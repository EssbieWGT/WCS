Using circular economy principles and energy-neutral processes, the technology converts animal manure and agricultural residues into valuable commodities with minimal environmental impact. The modular BCT system, now in its fifth generation after 15 years of development, can be rapidly deployed. Each module, shipped in ten containers, can be assembled in under a month and processes 36 tonnes of dry biomass per day with negligible emissions and no residual waste.

Verdus said the system works efficiently on a smaller, decentralised scale, making it suitable for farms, forests, and industrial sites. It can process feedstocks including cattle manure, poultry litter, crop residues, and municipal solid waste, transforming them into more than 200 marketable products such as renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biochar, green fertilisers, organic pesticides and herbicides, bio-oils, electricity, and carbon credits.

Biochar alone can sequester three tonnes of CO₂ per tonne applied to soil and reduce methane emissions from cattle by up to 22%. Overall, Verdus claims its solutions can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 187%.

The company has partnered with governments, primary producers, energy firms, and waste managers, and plans rapid international expansion given the over 20 million tonnes of annual feedstock surplus in New Zealand and growing global demand.

Kevin Smith, President and COO, said the technology has already proven commercially. “Version 4.0 has been operating for over two years, producing carbon fuel pellets for a major mining company. Rollout of V5.0 begins in Q4 2025, with production in North America scheduled for 2026.” He added, “Verdus Energy is not just addressing waste—it is creating a new model for resource recovery, climate resilience, and economic regeneration.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Biomass-6.png,N,,2025-09-26 12:56:59.596160

“This is a big day for northern Wisconsin – we’re looking at over $1 billion in annual economic impact and over 350 high-paying, local jobs, all while bolstering our forestry industry,” said Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk). “This facility will also help maintain clean forests, lowering the risk of forest fires and haze resulting from extreme smoke.”

To complement approximately $1.5 billion of private investment, the Forestry Revitalization Act will invest $210 million ($60 million in WEDC Enterprise Zone Tax Credits and $150 million in state bonding through the forestry account) to the new Hayward facility. The facility will turn CORSIA-qualified woody biomass (bark, branches, cutter shavings, tree tops, etc.) into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and naphtha, primarily for export. The European Union (E.U.) is phasing in regulations to require SAF to be mixed with conventional aviation fuel. By 2050, the E.U. will require 70% SAF.

USFWS Offers Voluntary Lead-free Ammo Incentive Program for 2025-26 Season

La Crosse, Wis. — The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is extending the Voluntary Lead-Free Hunting Ammunition Incentive Program for the 2025-26 hunting season in the National Wildlife Refuge System. The decision follows a successful pilot program and survey results indicating that hunters are more likely to use lead-free ammunition on national wildlife refuges when an incentive program is available. The program will include 25 hunting seasons at 13 refuges in 11 states.

Locally, the program is offered to those hunting deer on the Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge.

The program also is being offered at refuges in Maryland, Idaho, West Virginia, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Oregon.

“We are committed to providing access to quality hunting experiences on national wildlife refuges and supporting the contributions of the hunting community to wildlife conservation,” said USFWS Director Brian Nesvik. “Our analysis after the first year of the pilot indicates most hunters were satisfied with the program and we are pleased to expand it to accommodate more hunters.”

The lead-free program was launched in 2024 at seven national wildlife refuges and encourages voluntary adoption of lead-free ammunition as a non-regulatory means of addressing lead ingestion by wildlife on federal lands. The USFWS collaborated on program recommendations from the Hunting and Wildlife Conservation Council as well as from states, non-governmental groups, industry partners and the public. The HWCC is a federal advisory committee established by the Secretaries of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture.

This voluntary lead-free hunting ammunition incentive program offers hunters an opportunity to try ammunition types that reduce the risk of unintentional lead ingestion by scavenging wildlife. Participating hunters at each refuge will benefit from an incentivized rebate program that includes prepaid debit cards for reimbursement of the cost of lead-free ammunition with proof of purchase and other refuge-specific verifications. Participating hunters will receive up to $50 per box of rifle ammunition and $25 per box for shotgun or muzzleloader, for up to two boxes.

Under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, the USFWS allows hunting, within specified limits, on more than 430 refuge units. There are 573 national wildlife refuges and 38 wetland management districts.

Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge Offers Waterfowl Hunt for People with Disabilities

Trempealeau, Wis. — The Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge will open the River Bottoms tract for waterfowl hunting from Saturday, Oct. 18 through noon Friday Oct. 24. This portion of the refuge will be closed to other public use. Hunters will be provided with a code to access the property.

Abstract

The increasing carbon footprint of civil aviation has made the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a strategic necessity in line with the sector’s sustainability goals. This study evaluates the existing SAF types based on environmental, economic, technical and social criteria, determines the criteria weights with Fuzzy-Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (F-SWARA) and selects the most suitable alternative through Spherical Fuzzy-Multi Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis plus full MULTIplicative form (SF-MULTIMOORA) method. The alternative evaluation process was carried out on a Python-based online platform and sensitivity analysis was performed on five different scenarios. According to the findings, the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK) alternative stands out as the most suitable option in all scenarios, followed by the Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) alternative. In contrast, Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ-SPK) and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) options seem to be more variable and less stable. The study provides methodological contributions for the evaluation of SAF alternatives with fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and provides strategic implications for manufacturers and airlines in achieving the low-carbon targets of the aviation sector.

Carbon utilization strategies: fuels, building materials, chemicals Following CO2 capture, there are several main pathways for carbon utilization.
Individual emissions tracking displays a detailed breakdown of personal travel selections and the carbon emissions related to those selections.
As such, there is significant potential for reductions in carbon emissions in this sector to fit into the context of carbon capture, utilization.
Improved storage technology helps drive geological storage technology to deliver the massive amounts of CO₂ in the net-zero scenarios.","Thirty years of ambitious targets. One disappointing truth: carbon capture was supposed to save us by now, and we have only managed to reach 50 million tonnes of global CO2 storage per year with where we needed to be at 1 billion tonnes by 2030.

As CCUS projects continue to face delays and climate change continues to accelerate, the technology that was supposed to be our salvation is desperately racing against time. CCUS technology is one of the most promising runners in this race, but there’s still a lot to catch up on.

In this article, we will break down the phenomenon of CCUS, define the carbon capture processes, understand what happens after capture, and see the role carbon tracking plays. We will also try to answer a question: Is CCUS a promising technology? Let’s start by defining it.

What is CCUS (carbon capture, utilisation, and storage)?

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a form of technology that captures CO2 emissions from industrial sources and power plants or directly from the atmosphere.

According to the EU Science Hub, at the EU level, 30% of CO2 emissions come from fossil-fuel combustion in power generation and energy-intensive industries, such as cement and steel. The process consists of three parts: the capture of CO2 from the source, transporting it to a storage site via pipelines or ships, and permanently storing it below ground or utilizing it to create another product.

The history of carbon capture goes back to the 1920s, and now, around the globe, the International Energy Agency reports that CCUS capacity has grown to just over 50 Mt of operational capacity as of 2025, with the expectation of growing to 430 Mt by 2030. However, developers are now also focusing more on advancing existing projects, with 60% of the pipeline in advanced development stages blocked.

Difference between CCS and CCU

Within the wider framework of CCUS’s emissions reduction technology, there are two separate approaches - CCS and CCU. They differ in some notable aspects:

Goal. CCS permanently stores CO2 underground to stop emissions, with cleanenergywire.org noting it's ""essential for achieving climate goals, particularly for limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C."" CCU turns captured CO2 into useful products, with CO2 Value Europe stating it will reduce EU emissions by 250Mt by 2050.

Challenges. CCS needs suitable underground storage sites - IOGP Europe shows projects like Norway's Smeaheia (5 Mtpa planned 2028) require specific porous rock with impermeable caps above. CCU faces high conversion costs, with projects like 4AirCRAFT (completed 2024) demonstrating synthetic kerosene production but requiring significant energy input.

Project types. CCS targets heavy industry - examples include Belgium's ArcelorMittal (0.125 Mtpa, operational since 2022) and Germany's Cemex cement plant (0.146 Mtpa, planned for 2026). CCU covers diverse sectors: aviation fuels (4AirCRAFT), building materials (Spain's AGGREGACO2), and chemicals (France's ABACUS algae project, completed 2020).

Carbon uses. CCS utilizes old oil/gas fields (like Croatia's CO2 EOR project, running since 2014) as well as saline formations (Denmark's Greensand, with a claim of .4 Mtpa by 2025). CCU uses different conversions: catalytically (4AirCRAFT for jet fuel), biologically (ABACUS algae-to-chemicals), or mineralisation (AGGREGACO2 for carbon-negative concrete).

Impact on timelines. CCS allows for immediate permanent removal, i.e., Iceland's Orca facility (0.004 Mtpa, operational), which is permanently storing underground CO2. CCU allows for temporary storage, in that most products will re-release the CO2, with the exception of the mineralized building materials, which CO2 Value Europe claims is permanently stores 8% of the overall carbon that is captured.

Current scale. CCS has scaled up to sizeable operational projects (Norway's Sleipner (1 Mtpa since 1996) and Longship (1.5 Mtpa, 2024). CCU remains at a modest scale, with most of the relevant projects having demonstrated proof-of-concept or pilot phase, with CO2 Value Europe projecting some 173Mt of utilization by 2050.

Business model. CCS cannot make money from enhanced CO2 storage; thus, it needs government support from carbon capture public companies, such as the UK's Net Zero Teesside (with 2 Mtpa in 2027), which is advancing under a ""policy backing"" only. CCU can sell products for profit, i.e., CO2 Value Europe indicates about 50% of utilization will become transport fuels and 42% chemicals, thus building market value.

With these differences in place, CCUS projects influence varied industries altogether. One of the most important ones is done for the airline industry.

How does CCUS impact the airline industry?

Aviation is coming under increasing pressure to decarbonize. The International Energy Agency reported that aviation accounted for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023, almost 950 Mt CO2, as travel demand rebounded to almost 90% of pre-pandemic levels. If the ICAO forecasts hold true, the European Commission adds that emissions from aviation could triple by 2050 compared to 2015 levels. To respond to growing sustainable travel trends, potential CCUS technologies provide a number of pathways for the aviation industry to reach its net-zero commitment.

Noteworthy benefits of carbon capture and storage for aviation:

Sustainable aviation fuel. CCUS is enabling the production of synthetic fuels for aviation. Projects, such as 4AirCRAFT, have showcased the potential of producing synthetic aviation fuels, specifically kerosene. This would provide airlines with alternatives to fossil-based fuels.

Cost-competitive CCUS infrastructure. Initiatives, such as CO2 Hub in Zeebrugge, Belgium (planned for 20 Mtpa capture capacity by 2030), leverage shared infrastructure for carbon management strategies that airlines may be able to access.

Carbon offsetting. According to IATA, CCUS technology has the potential to capture 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes. Direct Air Capture, a CCUS technology, can offer a way to remove carbon dioxide permanently, which meets aviation's additionality and permanent requirement for emission reductions.

Assist with regulatory compliance. Airlines are currently bound to adhere to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), whose full auctioning of allowances will increase by 2026. Credits that are derived from CCUS offerings may be beneficial compliance instruments.

In its report, the IPCC recognizes that ""CCUS will be critical to limit global warming to 1.5°C"" and that the target ""cannot be met"" without the use of such technologies. The International Energy Agency (IEA) calculates that CCUS could reduce global CO2 emissions by as much as 19%.

In terms of aviation, IATA states that CCUS, coupled with renewable biomass, could operate in ""carbon-negative"" mode, actually removing CO2 from the atmosphere while producing sustainable aviation fuels and making it essential to achieve net-zero ambitions.

How do carbon capture technologies work?

Point source carbon capture involves capturing CO2 emissions at their source, usually at industrial sources of energy generation, such as power plants or cement plants, or that create large quantities of CO2 (such as carbon capture for cars that produce 81% of non-industrial emissions) before the CO2 is released into the air. To understand how capture works, let’s break it into several types and describe each one with its goals, benefits, and real projects.

Post-combustion capture

Post-combustion CO2 utilization technology captures carbon dioxide from flue gases after the combustion of fossil fuels, with chemical solvents (generally amine-based solutions or carbon capture fertilizers, like those offered by the Fertilizers Europe project). This approach allows components to be replaced without impacting the operations of the power plant. Furthermore, the phased introduction of this technology facilitates a reduction in operational disruption and investment risk, as the post-combustion CCUS value chain applies to pre-existing plants.

Europe's first fully operational post-combustion carbon capture plant is the Eni Casalborsetti natural gas treatment plant near Ravenna, Italy, shows the technology's capabilities while utilizing Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' KM CDR Process™ to capture around 25,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The facility has an impressive 90% CO2 reduction rate, with peaks of 96% efficiency, before transporting captured CO2 via reconverted gas pipelines to a depleted offshore gas field for permanent storage.

The technology is viable for decarbonizing existing industrial infrastructure worldwide using advanced solvent technologies such as, but not limited to, the KS-21™ system, with 18 commercial plants already deployed.

Pre-combustion capture

Pre-combustion capture technology (PCC) targets the CO2 in synthetic gas (syngas) prior to combustion. This CCUS technology uses acid gas removal technologies, which have been used across many industrial sectors for decades. The Global CCS Institute describes PCC as working under pressure (> 40 bar, for example), the increased pressure allows the use of physical solvents like Selexol to promote CO2 regeneration in a flash drum, while also reducing the power requirement for the absorption system.

The process itself involves converting syngas to hydrogen and CO2 through one or more water-gas shift reactions before separating the CO2 using chemical or physical absorbents, which dissolve acid gases, achieving CO2 removal rates of >90% in practice.

Applications for the technology are found in natural gas processing, hydrogen production, and coal gasification, with its commercially mature distilable gas separation technology. The DECARBit CCUS project of the European Commission aims to reduce the price of PCC to 15 euros per captured ton. Axens states that for processes with high-pressure syngas treatment (15-20% CO2 at 20-30 bar), physical solvents become the best option for investing in carbon capture technology in industrial applications, such as fertilizer producers and refineries.

Oxyfuel combustion

Oxy-fuel combustion involves burning air that has been stripped of nitrogen and argon to produce high concentrations of oxygen that combust with fuel (coal or natural gas) in the combustor, producing steam and CO2 for gas turbine efficiency and power generation.

According to the technology study by Southwest Research Institute, scrubbed CO2 is taken in a power plant, with a capture rate above 90% and with the CO2 being used again, as it can be used in refrigeration manufacturing, carbonation of drinks, or oil and gas applications. In particular, there are advantages of carbon capture for the use of traditional fuels, such as coal, which is typically considered a high-emission fuel. Oxy-fuel conditions allow coal to burn cleaner and at the same time maintaining the abundant feedstock.

The Callide Oxyfuel Project at Callide A Power Station achieved more than 10,000 hours of oxy-combustion and 5,000 hours of carbon uses. Southwest Research Institute continues to research direct-fired supercritical CO2 (sCO2) power cycles, by combining sCO2 technology with oxy-combustion, and is able to achieve nearly 100% CO2 capture efficiency. It also partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy in the development of megawatt-scale demonstration equipment for power plant carbon capture.

Digital solutions for CCUS

Digital technologies are removing cost barriers that have previously limited CO2 utilization technology adoption. In remarks made by Prateek Bumb, co-founder and CTO of Carbon Clean, capture rates can ""substantially exceed"" 90-95%, but cost has historically been a barrier to adoption as ""the operating costs for large conventional plants with high columns are difficult to justify for many emitters, especially small-to-mid-size companies.""

Advanced digital technologies have the potential to be used to reduce the carbon capture costs through optimization and prediction.

Integrated management platforms that visualize the entire CCUS value chain and enable CO2 supply-demand matching, e.g., Mitsubishi's CO2NNEX® we mentioned.

Digital twins for monitoring CO2 pipeline flows in real time and optimizing energy consumption in power systems.

AI and machine learning, with anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and process optimization that match theoretical operating conditions with operational realities.

Process control systems for carbon capture equipment, e.g., AspenTech's Aspen solution that we described above.

Advanced simulation tools, such as SLB's Intersect simulator, for improved subsurface modeling and characterization of CO2 storage sites.

Now that we have sorted out the carbon capture methods, let’s focus on the next steps that are equally important.

Utilization and storage: What happens after capture?

Capture, as complex as it is, is just the first step of CCUS. CO2 utilization technology is extremely diverse and important as well. Let’s now understand what happens after carbon has been captured.

Carbon utilization strategies: fuels, building materials, chemicals

Following CO2 capture, there are several main pathways for carbon utilization. The main idea remains the same, however, to transform captured carbon into useful products. These pathways generalize over 25 other ways, which could represent substantial carbon capture and sequestration market opportunities by 2040.

Utilization of fuels and chemicals.

For chemical processes, CO2 is utilized via reaction with hydrogen to produce fuels and chemicals. According to the Planete Energies group, the chemical sector currently uses:

100 million tons of CO2/year for producing fertilizers based on urea.

130-280 Mt CO2/year for e-methanol, one of the few commercially viable products, as demonstrated by plant developments such as Topsoe's facility in Spain, which produces 40,000 tons annually of e-methanol and captures 56,000 tons of CO2.

E-kerosene for aviation presents a great market for carbon uses, estimated to be between 50-150 Mt CO2/year, but without regulatory incentives, its adoption is slow..

Both e-methanol and e-kerosene share the opportunity to establish biogenic CO2 scarcity constraints, while they both provide closed carbon cycles that only emit the amount of CO2 they captured to produce the fuels.

Construction applications.

Construction materials have the greatest CO2 utilization potential, with construction aggregates capable of utilizing 0.5-2 Gt CO2/year, according to extensive research. However, low product value makes economic competitiveness questionable.

CO2-cured concrete is a smaller option of carbon reduction technologies, but has stronger revenue potential (40-70 Mt CO2/year), and the technology is nearly ready for commercialization (as shown by the Carbon Upcycling projects).

Materials systems such as CarboPac-C from Bright Renewables are also examining how to capture CO2 from flue gas to produce either liquid or gaseous CO2 for construction applications.

The construction utilization pathway represents a market opportunity value of $400 billion with the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 3 Gt/year by 2030.

Biological utilization with microalgae and cyanobacteria.

Biological utilization is based on photosynthetically functioning organisms using large amounts of CO2 to support growth. The cultivation of microalgae has achieved commercial maturity for producing high-value products, including pigments and omega-3 fatty acids.

Green algae contain 50-70% protein on a dry weight basis, providing opportunities for the peri-urban agriculture application of animal feed with reduced land allocation. Commercial viability has already been established with the production of astaxanthin. The pathway for microalgal-to-ethanol conversion demonstrated that cyanobacteria were more readily genetically manipulated than green algae.

Engineered cyanobacterial strains have been developed to produce ethanol, fatty acids (which can be consumed by animals), 2,3-butanediol, and other chemicals, although a majority of commercially relevant products are still not yet economically viable.

Carbon storage solutions: geological formations, saline aquifers

After CO2 capture, permanent geological storage is the next most effective long-term climate change mitigation option on an economical scale. Deep saline aquifers and geological formations represent substantial geological storage potential through proven methods, with commercial viability demonstrated in numerous deployment examples.

Deep saline aquifers.

According to research published on MDPI, deep saline aquifers have the greatest estimated storage capacity, ranging from 400 to upwards of 10,000 gigatonnes of CO2. Underground saline aquifers can provide all the conditions for permanent CO2 storage through pressure increase, structural, residual, solubility, and mineral trapping. Pioneering CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers provides commercial feasibility examples such as Australia's Gorgon project, at up to 4 million tonnes per year in the Dupuy saline formation.

Geological formations.

Depleted oil and natural gas reservoirs offer the advantage among other carbon capture materials as they provide a proven storage with existing natural infrastructure.

CO2-Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO2-EOR) captures value from two sources: injecting 300-600 kg of CO2 per recovered barrel of oil, and it achieves permanent storage for the majority of injected CO2 underground.

Carbon Storage with Enhanced Gas Recovery (CSEGR) in depleted natural gas fields allows for the permanent storage of CO2 while capturing remaining natural gas resources potential with negligible possibility of leakage, because the depleted natural gas fields and overlying geology have proven containment capabilities.

In regard to the technical basis, if site selection and management protocols follow the IPCC assessments of geological storage, the majority of the CO2 can be retained for longer than 1,000 years with a 99% or better certainty for permanent retention.

Risk management and monitoring of stored CO₂

Risk management is essential to the safe geological storage of CO2 and must be continuously monitored for the duration of the life of the project. The European Commission CCS Directive states that effective storage requires permanent containment, and associated health and environmental risks of any CCUS technology should be as low as reasonably practical.

It defines the following considerations for risk management and monitoring:

Risk assessment should be based on site-specific risk screening that uses likelihood categories and consequence rating criteria for human and environmental health.

The hazard identification approach should identify all potential hazards associated with CO2 leakage pathways, formation fluid displacement, and induced seismicity.

A risk management monitoring program should be organized, documented, and related to the project-specific risks as effectively as possible within budget.

A typical commercial project (≥1 Mt CO2/year) should have an annual monitoring budget of US$1-4 million, which is based on <5% total project costs (IEA Technology Collaboration Programme).

A monitoring approach should adopt a mix of monitoring technologies capable of detecting any leakage or assessing CO2 migration, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Current operational projects showcase a strong level of faith in the monitoring technologies currently available, with better efficiency achieved by incorporating risk-based methods. Carbon offset companies like Terrapas and CarbonClick facilitate the commercial viability and cost-efficiency pros of carbon capture, allowing the sale of carbon credits for tax reduction and showcasing sustainability initiatives. None of this would be possible without carbon tracking.

How does carbon tracking enhance CCUS performance?

To see how carbon tracking approaches enhance carbon utilization and capture, let’s review how each specific type of technology influences the development of this industry.

Emissions calculators.

Emissions calculators are necessary tools for measuring carbon footprints using internationally accepted methodologies. They enable businesses to accurately measure carbon footprint of their travel with a data-driven approach and provide a solid foundation for sustainable decision-making and identifying improvements. This, in turn, allows organisations to set realistic emissions reduction targets and build cultures of sustainability within their organisations. Apart from assisting businesses with green initiatives, personal carbon capture devices like CarbinX help use the converted carbon into energy for residential buildings.

Dashboards with real-time CO2 analytics.

Real-time CO2 analytics dashboards and carbon reporting software, such as those offered through StormGeo and Sievo CO2 provide better access to carbon emissions data and insight. These dashboards bring together the organization’s CO2 emission data and metrics, give a complete overview of the organization’s environmental impacts, and provide more visibility by mapping the spent data with emission data. The dashboards allow users to create customized reports that allow unlimited collaboration, while the totals are being updated in real-time.

Carbon emission budgeting.

Carbon emission budgeting involves creating measurable emission targets that are specific to an organization's sustainability goals. When used effectively, it can develop a framework for decreasing environmental impact while incorporating and utilizing sustainable travel practices. Ultimately, organizations are perceiving carbon emissions budgeting as an investment towards future business continuity, allowing them to maintain a place on the leading edge of responsible environmental activity.

Emissions visibility while flight shopping.

Transparency while booking flights creates awareness of the emissions associated with flights and other travel options. When carbon footprints are shown next to every flight option, it allows travelers to make informed decisions about their travel choices consistent with environmentally friendly or sustainable practices. In addition, selecting airlines with robust sustainability credentials (like Wizz Air and Air France-KLM) that use airline digital solutions reinforces responsible travel practices and supports business travel that has less impact on the planet.

Individual emissions visibility.

Individual emissions tracking displays a detailed breakdown of personal travel selections and the carbon emissions related to those selections. Armed with this level of detail, people can figure out exactly what they can change in that travel selection to lower their environmental impact. Acting on emission visibility accomplishes two things: One, it allows individuals to act on that visible impact, and, more importantly, it creates awareness and a corresponding shift in collective action within an organization.

Environmental initiatives and carbon offsetting.

Investing in high-quality carbon credits offsets unavoidable emissions and gets you certified greenhouse gas reductions through a project-based certification system. Contributing to global research and development projects that focus on environmental protection can establish a global positive ripple effect. This is more than just carbon offsets - this is about supporting organizations that model and promote corporate responsibility and community development.

Technology and modern approaches help support CCUS projects and the related benefits they bring.

What is their role in CCUS?

Transportation causes nearly 20% of global CO2 emissions (out of 36.7 billion tons globally; Ritchie, Science Direct). As such, there is significant potential for reductions in carbon emissions in this sector to fit into the context of carbon capture, utilization.

Carbon tracking applications help identify emissions sources, calculate the associated emissions impact, and provide a basis for behavioural change to intentionally reduce the total carbon to capture and store.

In fact, research suggests that by using carbon footprint tracking apps, emissions could be reduced by as much as 23% through continuous feedback (Hoffmann et al., Science Direct). However, the relative impact will vary - mobility reported a 12% reduction, and household activities had up to a 35% reduction.

The evidence of success is real, particularly concerning tourism in Ireland. The Fáilte Ireland Carbon Calculator has involved over 500 businesses to measure and collectively reduce emissions, which shows how tracking technologies can provide a means of bridging the information gap for sustainable decision-making.

The future of CCUS in climate strategy

The UK government's CCUS investor roadmap establishes its national commitment to CCUS development, which advises the establishment of four CCUS low-carbon industrial clusters that are expected to capture between 20-30MtCO2 per year by 2030. The UK is now in a unique position in that the estimated 78Gt of CO2 storage potential in the UK Continental Shelf will potentially provide one of the largest and most available CO2 storage capacities in Europe.

Also, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report confirms CCUS technology can support global climate aims such as the 1.5°C warming targets and must go hand-in-hand with rapid emission reductions to be able to achieve net-zero emissions. It’s particularly important for hard-to-abate sectors like cement, where CCUS will be “essential to avoid emissions from the limestone calcination process.”

Integration with hydrogen production and DAC (Direct Air Capture)

The combination of CCUS technology and hydrogen production brings one step closer to net-zero emissions through applications like ""blue hydrogen"" using natural gas reforming. Hongfang Lu outlined this pathway in a paper, ""Hydrogen production in integration with CCUS,"" published in Science Direct. This pathway provides immediate access to clean hydrogen while using current industrial infrastructure and expertise. Here is the possible workflow and results:

Capture integration. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is directly integrated into grey hydrogen production processes using absorption, adsorption, and DAC; it is estimated that current technology has a 10-20% increased energy demand relative to the grey hydrogen production chain.

Economic optimization. Large-scale implementation gives CCUS companies the ability to achieve cost reductions of approximately 30-40% over smaller installations. Blue hydrogen production could be achieved for 1.2-2.1 USD/kg, assuming natural gas prices are in the range of 1.4-6.3 USD/GJ.

Infrastructure development. The required shared transport and storage infrastructure is allowed by the regional clustering of hydrogen production, storage, and transport. With projects like Northern Lights, infrastructure development reduces the costs for each hydrogen project.

Catalyst performance. Investing in the development of high-performance catalysts, higher selectivity, and improved resistance to carbon deposition and materials sintering. Especially, alkali metals provide improved catalytic performance.

Policy support. Implementation will need government policies that include carbon taxes, market incentives, and industry engagement models that capture, transport, utilize, and store projects and development.

Apart from hydrogen production, direct air capture is another useful complementary technology to point-source CO2 capture because it removes atmospheric CO2 directly. Specialized DAC technology exists that is also capable of integrating with facilities with low-concentration CO2 waste emissions, lessening the boundary condition for mass and thermal transport.

Use of a contactor system designed for CO2 adsorption-desorption using solid-amine materials for atmospheric CO2 capture.

Use of waste heat and recoverable energy from co-located industrial facilities to lower operational costs

Integration of low-concentration CO2 streams from industrial vents to improve the efficiency of the overall system.

Creation of commercial systems based on actual field-testing data, for use internationally.

Production of concentrated (>99%) CO2 that is suitable for either utilization or storage.

The DAC RECO2UP project, finalized in July 2024, shows how technology enhances the advantages of carbon capture storage. As the first direct air capture system, the project conducted five testing campaigns and over 3,300 operational hours. The project demonstrated a reduction in the cost required to capture CO2, produced concentrated CO2 streams with a purity of >99%, and achieved more than what was originally requested. The project also verified that DAC technology has commercial promise around cost.

Innovation trends and emerging technologies

The CCUS industry is at a turning point as the world moves toward net-zero emissions targets. After demonstrating technological feasibility, the sector has large hurdles remaining in order to scale up to the immense deployment needs for global decarbonization.

Some innovative trends help move this industry forward:

AI is changing the game with respect to finding suitable CCUS storage sites. It can quickly analyze potential aquifers and adjacent geological features, identifying site potential rapidly. AI can 'see' the presence of faults and honeycombed fractures much more clearly than traditional methods. Using an AI model, location screening of storage sites can happen rapidly before any excavation, and to understand whether there is trap and seal integrity in the site.

The hub & network model

of creating larger CCUS hubs and networks has led from isolated projects to integrated systems of infrastructure that support multiple emitters from different industrial sectors.

Standardization helps as the sector is approaching a shift from customized processes and CCUS equipment being designed for a specific site, to standardized equipment and mass manufacture as a low-cost option that speeds up deployment.

Cross-sectoral integration, or the delivery of CO₂ from gas processing to the hard-to-evade sectors of cement, steel, chemicals, fertilizers, and waste.

Shared-infrastructure development causes regional economic and industrial clusters to facilitate multiple emitters utilizing shared CO₂ transport and storage infrastructure.

Advanced business structures make risk management more attractive for private investment, developing market acceptance for CCUS projects to set commercial viability.

Improved storage technology helps drive geological storage technology to deliver the massive amounts of CO₂ in the net-zero scenarios.

The main problems with carbon capture and storage are high costs, regulatory ambiguities, and bespoke manufacturing models that limit scale. However, some emerging trends are promising, such as more robust policy instruments, particularly the reformed EU's Emissions Trading System and the Clean Industrial Deal.",https://www.hospitalitynet.org/picture/153185082.jpg?t=1751881108,N,,2025-09-26 10:57:28.539506

When used to power on-site operations, the RECs can be retained and retired to lower the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno's SAF and renewable diesel, thereby boosting the value of the 45Z and LCFS credits.

Alternatively, the electricity and RECs can be sold into the Nevada power grid to serve the growing clean energy demands of the region's expanding data center hub. Located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where some of the world's largest technology companies operate major facilities, New Rise Reno could supply renewable power through wheeling arrangements that help operators meet both regulatory requirements and corporate sustainability goals.

The project is expected to be rolled out in two phases:

Pilot Deployment: Installation of a 100-kW Flex-Fuel Genset to validate performance using New Rise Reno's byproduct streams.

Modular Scale-Up: Expansion of the project through a modular approach targeting a total capacity of up to 10-MW, providing significant upside in both credit capture and revenue growth.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""XCF's mission to lead the transition to carbon-neutral aviation will be achieved not only by producing SAF, but by reducing carbon emissions throughout the supply chain to create a future-proof energy ecosystem. Teaming up with Posh Energy highlights how next-generation fuels and power can converge to deliver impact at scale. Converting byproducts into renewable electricity strengthens our sustainability profile while unlocking new revenue streams that enhance profitability, growth, and long-term shareholder value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy commented:

""Posh Energy's Flex-Fuel Gensets are designed to convert challenging, non-standard fuel streams into reliable renewable power. Working with XCF at New Rise Reno gives us a first-of-its-kind opportunity to demonstrate how our platform can help decarbonize industrial facilities while supplying clean energy to meet the rising demand from grids and data centers.""

The LOI is non-binding, and project execution remains subject to mutual due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

The purchase provides AAR with several strategic benefits. By incorporating ADI’s electronics-focused product lines, AAR will broaden its distribution portfolio and gain access to a fragmented but fast-growing market. In addition, the transaction enhances AAR’s position with new OEM partnerships and deepens relationships with existing partners. The company has indicated it will leverage its market presence to significantly grow ADI’s revenue base.

AAR also expects the acquisition to support margin improvements. These gains are projected to come from sales growth, greater operational efficiency, and ongoing business optimisation.

The move highlights AAR’s intention to consolidate its role in the aerospace supply chain, expand its international footprint, and increase its share of the high-growth distribution segment. The acquisition of ADI reflects a long-term strategy to strengthen both scale and profitability in a sector undergoing significant expansion.

Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the WRI, was commenting following several new countries outlining their climate commitments through to 2035, at the close of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Summit.

Well short

The latest announcements will feed into the UN’s forthcoming NDC Synthesis Report, which is scheduled for release ahead of COP30 in Brazil in November. However, Dasgupta warned that global efforts continue to fall well short of what’s required.

“We cannot sugarcoat it: these new climate plans do not put us anywhere near on track for a safe future,” he said. “The lack of ambition so far from most major emitters, barring a few, underscores the immense political challenge countries face in transforming their entire economy. Yet vulnerable countries continue to step up with bold climate leadership.

“Countries’ last round of NDCs put the world on track for up to 2.8°C of warming, already exposing billions of people to more frequent and intense heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods. By 2035, the world needs to cut 31.2 gigatons of emissions to stay on track for 1.5°C, or 20.2 Gt for 2°C. The NDCs and announcements so far would reduce that by just 2 gigatons — only 6% of what’s needed for 1.5°C and 10% for 2°C.”

Greater ambition

With COP30 now just around the corner, Dasgupta said that it was “critical” that all nations – including major emitters – deliver the most ambitious possible climate plans.

“Some countries are taking steps to transform key sectors of their economy,” he said. “Falling costs are accelerating this momentum: clean energy, heat pumps, and electric vehicles are now the lowest cost option in many parts of the world — creating jobs, boosting countries’ growth and competitiveness, securing reliable clean energy, and improving people’s quality of life.

“Countries need to do much more to seize this momentum and scale up renewable energy and clean transport solutions.”

As the WRI noted, in 2024, climate-related disasters were estimated to cost the global economy at least $300 billion, and without more ambitious action, “these losses will continue to escalate. By COP30, all countries must present a clear response and double down on solutions within our grasp to cut emissions and build adequate resilience.”

A study by IATA and Worley Consulting estimates that SAF production could reach 400 Mt by 2050 in its core forecast*. While contributions from all regions will be essential, a large share of global output will need to come from a few leading regions.

North America is projected to lead with more than 100 Mt of potential SAF by 2050, supported by abundant biomass feedstocks and proven incentive-based policy frameworks.

Central & South America, North Asia, and South Asia are also expected to contribute significantly, driven by strong biomass resources and leadership from Brazil, China, and India.

* The core forecast considers 236 Mt of bio-SAF out of a theoretical maximum of ~300 Mt. e-SAF covers the remaining volume.

Together with Europe and East Asia & Pacific, these regions will form the backbone of global SAF production, accounting for around 360 Mt, or nearly 90% of the total forecast.

The Middle East & North Africa also show substantial potential, while Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to contribute more modestly. These lower projected volumes reflect infrastructure gaps, limited supply chain readiness, and less mature policy frameworks. However, both regions hold untapped feedstock resources that could enable higher contributions if the right conditions are established.

Globally, the main bottleneck is not feedstock availability, but the pace of technology rollout. Scaling up both bio-SAF and e-SAF will require multiple technology routes. While achieving net zero and reaching 500 Mt of SAF production by 2050 is possible, it will require urgent acceleration in technology readiness, expanded access to sustainable feedstocks, and robust policy frameworks to ensure investment certainty.",https://iata.shorthandstories.com/chart-of-the-week-26-09-2025/assets/cMITYmLkLB/frame-at-0.000s-of-gettyimages-501550629-social-cover.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 10:58:45.757877

The Downstream Solutions Challenge spotlights scalable innovations across design, collaboration, logistics and finance.

This year’s winners – Schneider Electric, Vestas, DHL and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria – show how business can deliver systemic change.

Tackling climate change requires bold action on Scope 3 downstream emissions, which typically include those generated during the use of sold products, the end-of-life treatment of sold products, downstream transportation and distribution, the processing of sold products and investments.

Understanding and addressing Scope 3 downstream emissions is increasingly significant in sustainability and climate reporting, as these emissions often represent the largest share of a company’s total carbon footprint.

By measuring and managing these emissions, organizations can identify opportunities for product innovation, engage with value chain partners and contribute to global climate goals.

For the 133 members of the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, Scope 3 downstream accounts for 67% of their value chain emissions, equivalent to 3.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2e) equivalent, roughly the same as India’s annual CO2e emissions (from fossil fuels and industry only, as per Our World in Data figures with further BCG Analysis).

The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders’ Downstream Solutions Challenge aimed to highlight companies that are pioneering scalable, innovative and collaborative approaches to Scope 3 downstream decarbonization.

By focusing on four categories – sustainable design, collaboration, smart logistics and financing – the challenge highlights solutions that not only reduce emissions but also unlock business value, resilience and long-term competitiveness.

Sustainable design: Schneider Electric

Product design is where downstream impact often begins. The materials chosen, the way systems are powered and how they are maintained or recycled all shape emissions across the entire lifecycle. Sustainable design can deliver exponential benefits, including lowering costs, enhancing safety, ensuring regulatory compliance and reducing Scope 3 emissions.

Schneider Electric’s AirSeT technology is a breakthrough in medium-voltage switchgear, replacing sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a greenhouse gas with 24,300 times the global warming potential of CO2, with pure air and vacuum technology.

Unlike incremental improvements, AirSeT eliminates SF6, reducing regulatory risks, lowering long-term costs and improving worker safety.

To date, AirSeT has avoided more than 1.2 million tons of CO2e, contributing to Schneider’s goal of saving or avoiding 800 million tons of CO2 by 2025. Fully compatible with existing infrastructure, digitally integrated and externally audited, AirSeT is not just a product; it is a scalable solution for climate-resilient energy systems.

Collaboration: Vestas

No company can decarbonize its value chain alone. Collaboration between suppliers, customers and industry peers is essential for scaling new technologies and aligning market incentives. In hard-to-abate materials such as steel, joint action can break cost barriers, reduce investment risks and send powerful demand signals that reshape entire industries.

Vestas has embraced this challenge by pioneering the use of low-emission steel in wind turbine towers, produced in partnership with ArcelorMittal using scrap and renewable electricity.

With steel representing up to 50% of a turbine’s lifecycle emissions, this innovation, it says, cuts emissions by 66% per kilogram of steel, achieving up to 52% reductions in onshore towers and up to 26% reductions in offshore towers.

By engaging both suppliers and customers, such as Baltic Power and Vattenfall, Vestas created a self-reinforcing demand signal that accelerates the adoption of its products. This initiative shows how collaboration can extend beyond pilots to systemic change.

Smart logistics: DHL

Transportation and distribution are among the most visible sources of downstream emissions. Every product that reaches a customer carries a carbon footprint associated with its transportation.

As global supply chains expand, sustainable logistics has become a decisive lever, not just to reduce emissions but also to meet procurement requirements, strengthen brand reputation and improve air quality in cities.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus is reshaping logistics by embedding sustainability across air, ocean, road and warehousing. By using sustainable aviation fuel, bio-LNG (liquefied natural gas), hydro-treated vegetable oil and battery-electric vehicles, the programme enables insetting, cutting emissions directly within the supply chain.

In 2024 alone, GoGreen Plus reduced 1,598 kilotons of CO2e, verified by independent third parties. Its book-and-claim model makes the solution globally scalable, already used by more than 300,000 customers.

Partnerships such as Formula 1 have amplified its visibility worldwide, accelerating adoption and setting a new industry standard for sustainable logistics, already used by more than 300,000 customers of all sizes and across all industry sectors.

Financing: BBVA

Even the best technologies cannot scale without capital. Financing plays a catalytic role in downstream decarbonization, enabling suppliers and customers to invest in cleaner processes, equipment and systems. By embedding climate ambition into financial products, banks can unlock transformation across entire value chains.

BBVA’s Sustainable Ecosystems initiative integrates advisory services, supplier classification and targeted financing to accelerate Scope 3 reductions. It helps clients diagnose emissions and then mobilize funding to address them, bridging the gap between ambition and implementation.

For instance, in the automotive coatings sector, BBVA structured financing that enabled downstream garages to install solar panels and adopt energy-efficient equipment. This not only reduced emissions but also improved competitiveness and resilience across the value chain. Globally deployable and sector-agnostic, the model exemplifies how finance can turn climate commitments into measurable results.

IATA says SAF feedstock enough for net-zero by 2050

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, has published a study confirming that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. All feedstocks considered meet strict sustainability requirements, avoiding any impact on land use.

The report concludes that the availability of raw material will not be a limiting factor, but stresses that rapid acceleration of SAF production is critical. Current commercial facilities rely almost exclusively on HEFA technology, which converts waste oils into fuel. Scaling up new technologies, such as power-to-liquid (PtL), will be essential to achieve the 500 million tonnes of SAF annually required under IATA’s Net Zero Roadmap. Biomass has the potential to provide more than 300 million tonnes a year, while PtL would supply the balance, supported by advances in renewable energy, hydrogen and carbon capture.

Key challenges identified include the slow pace of technology deployment, competition for feedstocks with other hard-to-abate sectors, and insufficient infrastructure to support large-scale production. The report stresses that investment in supply chain logistics, conversion efficiency, and commercial-scale facilities across all regions is necessary if aviation is to meet its climate commitments.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said the findings offered “unequivocal evidence” that feedstock availability is not a barrier but warned that “we need shovels in the ground now”. Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Chief Economist, highlighted the potential for SAF production to stimulate economies and support energy security, but called for urgent cross-sector collaboration to de-risk investment and ensure policy stability.

The study identifies North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China and ASEAN as crucial to future SAF output, and urges governments and the energy sector to act decisively. According to IATA, the next 25 years will determine whether aviation can turn this proven potential into reality.

Available to members of the Finnair for Business program, the new SAF service allows companies to monitor the flight emissions that their business trips generate. They can then buy SAF environmental attributes (the quantified benefits of using sustainable aviation fuel rather than conventional jet fuel) to help lower the carbon footprint of flying.

Using a book-and-claim model, companies can make an associated claim to the environmental benefit their purchased attributes represent. This means the actual emission reduction does not necessarily take place on the flight their employees travel on, as the fuel they purchase is not physically loaded into the aircraft.

The achieved reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to sustainable aviation fuel use is verified by a third party, with the company receiving an audited SAF certificate that can be used for its sustainability reporting.

“We want to develop flying in a more sustainable direction and are now taking steps on several different fronts. We believe that the most effective solutions can be found at the system level and require cooperation not only between decision-makers and energy producers, but also between airlines and customers. With the Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials,” said Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair’s Head of Environment.

In 2024, approximately 0.5% of the aviation fuel procured by Finnair was SAF, with the airline planning to grow that number to 1.5% this year.

“The greenhouse gas emissions reduction in sustainable aviation fuel is significant,” said Karppinen. “However, the aviation fuel we use will not be fully renewable for a long time, since SAF is blended with fossil fuels. But the more we use renewable fuel, the greater the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we will achieve.”

Power-to-Liquid must expand more rapidly, supported by the growth of renewable energy and flexible rules governing CO₂ sources.
A cautious optimism The Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production paints a picture of both daunting challenges and enormous opportunities.","The scale-up required over the next 25 years is extraordinary, and a new study conducted by IATA and Worley Consulting suggests that even under ambitious assumptions, output is likely to fall short of expectations. Their Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production forecasts that the world could realistically produce approximately 400 million tons of SAF by 2050. While this would mark a remarkable leap forward, it still leaves a 100 Mt gap to net zero.

A race against time

What emerges most clearly from the report is that time, rather than resources, is the fundamental constraint. On paper, the world has sufficient feedstock to support the growth of SAF. By mid-century, global biomass potential is expected to exceed 12,000 million tons, yet much of this will be consumed by other industries or be unsuitable for fuel.

After subtracting competing uses, just 1,580 Mt could be directed toward SAF production. This would be enough for slightly more than 300 Mt of bio-based SAF. The remainder must come from synthetic fuels produced through Power-to-Liquid (PtL) processes, which combine renewable electricity, hydrogen, and captured carbon dioxide.

The challenge is not that the raw materials do not exist. The problem is that the technologies required to turn them into jet fuel are not scaling up fast enough. Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), the only pathway currently operating at commercial maturity, will continue to dominate production in the near term. However, HEFA is constrained by the limited supply of waste oils and fats.

Other routes, such as ethanol-to-jet (EtJ), Fischer-Tropsch (FT) gasification of residues, and PtL e-fuels, are progressing; however, most remain at the demonstration or early commercial stages. Unless these emerging pathways accelerate rapidly, the sector will remain unable to exploit the potential of available feedstocks fully.

The shifting balance of feedstocks

The report highlights that the composition of SAF feedstocks will undergo significant changes over time. Today, most production relies on waste oils, animal fats, and virgin vegetable oils. By 2050, however, agricultural residues are expected to provide nearly 60% of biomass-based SAF, while forestry residues and municipal solid waste are expected to play growing roles. Waste oils and crops will represent only a small fraction, reflecting both sustainability constraints and limited scalability.

This transition will not be straightforward. Agricultural residues, for instance, are abundant but difficult to collect. They are often scattered across vast rural landscapes, subject to seasonal availability, and tied up in competing uses such as soil enrichment or animal feed.

Municipal waste, meanwhile, offers low-cost potential but suffers from inconsistent quality and high processing demands. Even as technical pathways mature, these logistical barriers will require investment in infrastructure, aggregation hubs, and supply chain coordination.

Power-to-Liquid pathways offer an alternative that bypasses these supply chain complexities. By utilising renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and combining it with captured CO₂, e-SAF could theoretically provide more than 170 million tonnes by 2050. Yet this pathway comes with its own obstacles: high costs, dependence on a massive expansion of renewable energy, and the need for global carbon capture infrastructure. Without doubling renewable capacity and rapidly scaling electrolysis, e-SAF will struggle to deliver its potential.

Regional leaders and laggards

Although every region has some role to play in SAF production, a handful of countries are expected to lead the charge. North America is forecast to emerge as the largest producer, thanks to its robust agricultural base, strong incentives, and established biofuel sector. Brazil will be another heavyweight, leveraging its ethanol industry and energy crops to supply large volumes through the EtJ pathway. Europe, while limited by strict land-use rules, will continue to play a leading role in policy and regulation, particularly in advancing waste- and residue-based fuels.

Asia is set to become increasingly important. China and India both have vast agricultural residues and expanding renewable energy capacity, making them prime candidates for scaling SAF. The Middle East and Africa, meanwhile, will likely contribute smaller but still significant volumes, particularly from residues and waste streams. The study emphasises that these regions will require substantial infrastructure investment to unlock their full potential.

By 2050, the US, Brazil, China, India, and Europe are expected to account for the bulk of global output, with smaller but vital contributions from Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. This uneven geography reflects both the distribution of natural resources and the policy frameworks in place to support investment.

The role of policy

Perhaps the most important conclusion of the assessment is that policy will determine success or failure. Unlike solar or wind power, which now compete with fossil fuels on price, SAF remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. In the case of e-SAF, costs are currently four to five times higher. Without strong policy frameworks, private investors are unlikely to take the risks required to fund large-scale plants.

The report identifies several levers for success. Financial incentives, such as tax credits, subsidies, and contracts for difference, can reduce costs and attract investment. Blending mandates, when carefully designed, create demand certainty and give producers confidence to expand.

Infrastructure investment—through public-private partnerships—can address bottlenecks in logistics, collection, and processing. Research and development funding will also be critical for bringing newer pathways, such as cellulosic ethanol and advanced PtL, to maturity.

Crucially, policies must prioritise aviation over other sectors that have easier decarbonisation options. Road transport, for example, can shift toward electrification, whereas aviation is likely to require liquid fuels for the foreseeable future. If governments fail to allocate scarce biomass and synthetic fuel capacity strategically, airlines may be left competing with road or marine transport for the same feedstocks.

Closing the gap to 500 Mt

Even with favourable conditions, the report’s core forecast falls 100 Mt short of the 2050 target. Bridging this gap will require bold action. Technology deployment must accelerate dramatically, shortening the journey from pilot projects to commercial scale.

Energy crops grown on degraded land could add new volumes of oil and cellulose without displacing food. Power-to-Liquid must expand more rapidly, supported by the growth of renewable energy and flexible rules governing CO₂ sources. International collaboration will also be essential, both to harmonise standards and to prevent a fragmented market that favours only a few regions.

The authors stress that meeting the target is possible, but only if the industry, governments, and investors act in concert. Airlines will need to sign long-term offtake agreements to de-risk projects. Governments must provide financial certainty and policy clarity to ensure stability. Producers will need to deliver scalable and replicable plant designs to accelerate rollout. Without these measures, the industry risks failing to meet its climate commitments.

A cautious optimism

The Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production paints a picture of both daunting challenges and enormous opportunities. Achieving 400 Mt of SAF by 2050 would represent a transformation of aviation energy supply on a scale comparable to the rise of renewables in the electricity sector. Yet the shortfall reminds us that ambition alone is not enough.

What is required now is focus and urgency. The feedstocks exist, the technologies are within reach, and the policy tools are well understood. The question is whether the world can mobilise fast enough to deliver. For an industry that has little time to waste, the coming two decades will decide whether sustainable aviation fuel becomes the backbone of decarbonised flight or remains a promise unfulfilled.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/09/24/iStock-1333311294-scaled-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 07:56:39.674472

However, the report highlights significant barriers to large-scale SAF production.
There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050.
“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, has confirmed that the aviation industry has enough sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The study found that all considered feedstocks meet strict sustainability standards and do not require changes in land use.

However, the report highlights significant barriers to large-scale SAF production. Current technologies, such as HEFA which converts used cooking oil into SAF, are limited in scale, and competition for feedstocks with other sectors may restrict availability.

To meet the net zero target, airlines will need 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050. Biomass could provide over 300 million tonnes each year, while power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies will be essential to produce the remaining volume. Expanding production will require improvements in conversion efficiency, faster technology rollout, enhanced feedstock logistics, and upgraded infrastructure across regions.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh emphasised the urgency of action. “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” he said.

The report also identified key challenges, including scaling up new SAF production technologies, ensuring feedstocks are available to the aviation sector, securing low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure for PtL, and achieving coordinated government policies to foster innovation and investment. Regional leadership from North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN will be critical to global SAF output.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist, highlighted the broader benefits of SAF. “The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now, delays will only make the challenge harder,” she said.

Walsh added, “With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality.”",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/09/26/86777-saf-adobestock465019242.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 04:56:36.023773

Zero Pollution Action Plan

The Ambient Air Quality Directive forms part of the EU’s Zero Pollution Action Plan, which aims to reduce premature deaths from air pollution by 55% by 2030.

As the EPA noted, Ireland is currently projected to achieve 93% compliance with the fine particulate matter standard (PM2.5) and 78% compliance with nitrogen dioxide limits, and also continues to fall ‘well short’ of more stringent World Health Organization (WHO) health-based 2040 guidelines for several key pollutants.

Solid fuel burning and traffic emissions are the primary sources of air pollution in Ireland, the report found, with the European Environment Agency estimating that approximately 1,700 premature deaths occur each year in Ireland as a result of poor air quality.

‘Healthier air and healthier lives’

“Many of us have grown up with the comfort of an open fire and limited alternatives to travelling by car—but these familiar habits contribute to poor air quality,” commented Pat Byrne, director of the EPA’s Office of Radiation Protection and Environmental Monitoring. “Supporting people to shift towards cleaner heating and more sustainable travel isn’t about giving something up—it’s about gaining healthier air and healthier lives.”

According to the EPA, air pollution is not confined to cities, with towns and villages also affected. The EPA provides hourly updates on air quality and a three-day forecast through its website, airquality.ie.

“Ireland is facing considerable challenges in its efforts to meet the more stringent air quality standards set for 2030, as well as the World Health Organization targets for 2040,” added Roni Hawe, EPA programme manager for environmental monitoring and surveillance.

“Achieving these goals will require a decisive shift away from solid fuel burning, alongside the adoption of electric vehicles, efforts to reduce traffic and encouraging the use of public transport.” Read more here.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSarYrCRgtflDS1W/e66a1ba41b185717e4ec65ee20e37df309a7df61ff5dc9a0fe672c7b23f924a5/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=news-1&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%231e6000%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2024%252F12%252Flogo-white.png%253Ffit%253D1000%25252C141%2526ssl%253D1%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fi0.wp.com%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F09%252Fpexels-aadil-hayat-bhat-912963690-32179237.jpg%253Ffit%253D900%25252C600%2526ssl%253D1%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22More%2520effort%2520needed%2520to%2520protect%2520clean%2520air%2520in%2520towns%2520and%2520cities%2520across%2520Ireland%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fsustainabilityonline.net%2Fnews%2Fmore-effort-needed-to-protect-clean-air-in-towns-and-cities-across-ireland,N,,2025-09-26 04:56:40.780911

A Partnership With Breakthrough Energy Ventures

Announced on September 17, in Dallas, Texas, the oneworld alliance, and member airlines (plus SQ), have forged a partnership with Breakthrough Energy Ventures, an umbrella company founded by Bill Gates ten years ago (2015), with a vision to accelerate innovation through sustainable energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through new technologies.

The partnership will launch a new investment fund that is specifically designed to address the high costs and scarce availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This fund, which is led by Alaska Airlines and American Airlines as 'cornerstone investors', will bid to accelerate the development of longer-term aviation fuel solutions at scale. Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines and chairman of oneworld, explained:

“By investing in the SAF technologies of the future, American and our oneworld partners are making this business decision to unlock novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices than current technologies can achieve.

""We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.”

Understanding The BEV Fund:

The structure of the Breakthrough Energy Venures (BEV) fund, is set to provide global development of fuel solutions that are cost effective, long-term, lower emmission fuels when compared with traditional jet-fuel. This will be developed by investing in new neovel, next generation fuel technologies, while supporting the growth of alternative fuel markets.

It's no secret that the aviation industry must look to adapt to new ways of thinking and operating, with alternative, more sustainable fuel options. The BEV fund is expected to create economic value for all of its investors and the regions in the world to which its airline partners operate.

Alaska Airlines, a cornerstone investor, has already noted its excitement to partner with this innovative fund to contribute to the development of innovative SAF technology. Its partnership with BEV will bring the scientific, technical, and commercial expertise required to help develop next-generation fuels for the decades ahead.

Next-Generation Thinking For the Aviation Industry

As analysed by oneworld, the global aviation industry generates more than $4.1 trillion in economic activity around the world, and as a result supports more than 85 million jobs. However, the industry accounts for around 2-3% of all carbon dioxide emissions globally, in addition to other environmental impacts.

Airlines are now looking to address how they can limit their footprint on the environment by investing in more modern, fuel-efficient aircraft. Demand for air travel shows no signs of slowing and is expected to rise. As a result, sustainable aviation fuel is necessary to be the tool to limit continued environmental impacts.

Using SAF can decrease carbon dioxide emissions significantly; however, the fuel is yet to attract the necessary investment to scale production at competitive prices. oneworlds bold step, will be a new chapter in this story, with the alliance airlines partners, focussed on supporting the initative.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2671682753-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-26 04:56:45.399184

This move aligns with South Korea’s broader environmental goals, reinforcing the country’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector. By integrating SAF into its flights from Incheon to Kobe and Gimpo to Osaka, Korean Air is leading the way in sustainable travel, helping to shape a greener future for global air travel. This expansion is not only a crucial step for the airline but also supports the global push for decarbonization in aviation.

Korean Air has significantly advanced its commitment to sustainability by expanding the use of domestically produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on its flights connecting Incheon to Kobe and Gimpo to Osaka, Japan. This move comes as part of the airline’s broader initiative to reduce its carbon footprint and contribute to the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts. SAF has become a crucial element in the global push to make air travel more sustainable, and Korean Air is leading the way in integrating this innovative fuel into its operations.

In August 2024, Korean Air first began testing the performance and safety of domestically produced SAF on its Incheon-Haneda route. The trial was a resounding success, confirming that the fuel could be safely and effectively used on long-haul flights. Following the successful trial, the airline decided to extend its use of SAF to two additional routes: Incheon to Kobe (KE731) and Gimpo to Osaka (KE2117), which started on 19 September 2025. The implementation of SAF on these routes is part of the airline’s ongoing commitment to sustainable aviation and its support for the global goal of achieving carbon neutrality in the aviation sector.

The benefits of SAF in comparison to traditional jet fuel are significant. One of the most important advantages of SAF is its potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80%. This reduction is achieved because SAF is made from sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil (UCO), and has a much lower carbon intensity than conventional jet fuel. By using SAF, airlines can drastically decrease the environmental impact of their operations without sacrificing performance or safety.

Korean Air’s use of SAF on the Kobe and Osaka routes will involve a 1% SAF blend, a percentage that aligns with the industry’s initial phase of SAF adoption. The airline plans to incorporate this blend into approximately 90 flights on the Kobe route and 26 flights on the Osaka route through 31 December 2026. While the 1% blend is relatively modest, it is an important first step toward increasing the use of SAF in the airline’s fleet. As technology advances and SAF production becomes more widespread, Korean Air expects to increase the proportion of SAF in its fuel blend, contributing further to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from its operations.

The SAF being used by Korean Air is sourced from two domestic suppliers, HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex, both of which are key players in South Korea’s energy and fuel production industries. These suppliers are producing SAF from used cooking oil, a renewable feedstock that helps reduce waste while providing a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. The SAF produced by these suppliers has been certified under the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This certification ensures that the fuel meets the rigorous sustainability and carbon reduction standards required by the aviation industry.

In addition to reducing carbon emissions, the use of SAF is also expected to have other positive environmental impacts. By supporting the development and deployment of SAF, Korean Air is contributing to the growth of the biofuels industry in South Korea. This industry has the potential to generate significant economic and environmental benefits, as it reduces the country’s dependence on imported fossil fuels and helps stimulate green innovation in various sectors, including transportation and energy.

This initiative reflects Korean Air’s broader strategy to support sustainable aviation and help meet global environmental goals. The airline has been increasingly active in incorporating green technologies into its operations, with the use of SAF representing just one part of its larger sustainability efforts. Other initiatives include the introduction of more fuel-efficient aircraft, the use of sustainable ground handling equipment, and the development of energy-saving operational procedures. By adopting SAF on key international routes, Korean Air is positioning itself as a leader in the effort to decarbonize the aviation industry.

Korean Air’s commitment to sustainability also extends beyond its use of SAF. The airline has been working closely with global organizations and regulatory bodies to ensure that its sustainability practices align with international standards and best practices. This includes participation in the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) efforts to reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint and ongoing investments in research and development for alternative fuels and technologies. The adoption of SAF is an essential part of Korean Air’s long-term strategy to reduce its overall carbon emissions and contribute to the aviation industry’s overall sustainability goals.

The expanded use of SAF by Korean Air is a significant milestone in the airline’s ongoing sustainability journey. By using SAF on high-traffic routes to Japan, Korean Air is demonstrating that sustainable aviation is both achievable and practical in the short term. This move also sets a precedent for other airlines in the region and beyond, highlighting the potential for SAF to play a crucial role in reducing the environmental impact of air travel.

Looking ahead, the airline plans to increase its use of SAF as more sustainable fuel production facilities are built and as the global supply of SAF becomes more readily available. In addition to its environmental benefits, SAF offers the potential to enhance the long-term viability of the aviation industry by reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and promoting a more sustainable future for air travel.

South Korea is advancing its sustainable aviation efforts by expanding Korean Air’s use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on key routes to Japan. This move aligns with the country’s environmental goals and supports the global push for greener air travel.

Korean Air’s use of domestically produced SAF on its routes to Kobe and Osaka is a crucial step forward in the airline’s commitment to sustainability. The airline’s leadership in adopting SAF and its continued efforts to drive innovation in sustainable aviation will likely inspire other carriers to follow suit, contributing to a more sustainable aviation industry in the years to come.

The low-cost carrier’s strategic move will see two Boeing 737 aircraft permanently based at Trapani-Marsala, the airline’s third base in Sicily and 20th across Italy.

Ryanair’s Strategic Investment for Sicily

The announcement follows the Sicilian Region’s decision to abolish the Municipal Tax at smaller airports, a measure expected to boost regional growth and passenger traffic.

As part of the $200 million project, Ryanair plans to operate 23 routes, including 11 new connections to major European destinations such as London, Bratislava, Stockholm and Brussels. The plan will also focus on increased domestic flights to cities like Verona, Pescara and Bari.

The million-dollar expansion is forecast to create more than 800 local jobs and handle over one million passengers annually.

The airlines also plan to improve year-round connectivity for Sicilian residents and tourists through a 10% increase in capacity on routes to Milan and Rome.

Eddie Wilson, Ryanair CEO, stated that the new base in Trapani-Marsala represents a long-term commitment to Sicily.

“By connecting Trapani with nine countries and key Italian cities, we are ensuring the island benefits from sustained economic growth, greater tourism and consistent year-round access,” he stated.

Municipal Tax Reforms in Sicily Driving Growth

The project focusing on the new base at Trapani-Marsala Airport, leading to its revival, comes after years of challenges, including the absence of Ryanair services for a decade. Local authorities credit the abolishment of the Municipal Tax as a decisive factor in attracting investment back to the region.

Regional President Renato Schifani’s government has positioned the elimination of the tax as a cornerstone of its strategy to enhance air travel across Sicily.

Officials stated that the removal of the surcharge encourages airlines to expand and makes secondary airports more competitive.

“The elimination of the surtax could attract up to five million additional passengers to Sicilian airports. This will not only lower fares but also strengthen our regional economy and tourism,” said Alessandro Arico, Sicily’s Councillor for Infrastructure and Mobility.

Calling Ryanair’s return “the milestone” of Trapani-Marsala Airport’s revival, Airgest President Salvatore Ombra, whose team oversees Trapani’s Vincenzo Florio airport, stated, “After a 10-year absence, we are seeing the results of our determination and the government’s support.”

“This is just the beginning of further modernisation plans,” he added.

Ryanair’s Wider Growth Plan for Italy

After successful exports to Japanese carriers last year, Hyundai Oilbank now begins regular supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel for the Korean Air route between Incheon and Kobe. The program will fuel ninety aircraft movements through twenty twenty six, giving the airline an immediate reduction in lifecycle emissions without altering equipment or schedules.

Innovative Production Platform

The refinery produces one hundred thirty thousand tonnes of biodiesel each year and applies advanced supercritical processing that works under elevated temperature and pressure while avoiding chemical catalysts. This approach accepts high acid, non edible feedstocks that do not compete with food markets. By simplifying purification steps, the method cuts both operating cost and waste generation, positioning the plant to scale additional aviation volumes rapidly.

Expansion to Blue Water Fleets

Hyundai Oilbank has already supplied ultra low sulfur biofuel to domestic and international shipping lines, demonstrating that the same infrastructure can serve multiple hard to abate sectors. The dual

market strategy diversifies revenue, strengthens supply chain resilience, and creates consistent demand for domestic feedstock growers.

Non-obvious Insight

The adoption of supercritical technology delivers an often overlooked benefit: it allows producers to swap feedstocks seasonally based on price and availability without lengthy reconfiguration. This flexibility transforms feedstock procurement from a fixed cost into a dynamic optimisation lever, enabling margin protection during volatile commodity cycles.

So, What Is The Bottom Line When It Comes To The Boeing 777X?
At the end of the day, the Boeing 777X will fundamentally change the aviation industry when it enters service.","The Boeing 777X is the latest-generation widebody to be brought to the market by US-based manufacturer Boeing (NYSE: BA). The aircraft is designed to replace the Boeing 777-300ER and capture very long-haul missions with lower fuel burn and higher seating density. The aircraft comes in two variants: the high-capacity Boeing 777-9, geared towards trunk routes, and the ultra-long-range Boeing 777-8, geared towards the ultra-long-range segment. The aircraft features new carbon-fiber composite wings and folding wingtips, which extend the aircraft's range and cruise efficiency. These wingtips also allow the aircraft to comfortably fit into Code-E gates. The jet's GE9X engines will be the largest ever to enter commercial service with a passenger airline.

The aircraft's cabin borrows a number of features from the earlier Boeing 787, including larger windows, improved pressurization and humidity, and wide cabins that support competitive business class layouts. The Boeing 777-9 seats between 380 and 420 passengers in a three-class configuration with a range of around 7,200 to 7,300 nautical miles. The Boeing 777-8 targets around 350 seats over an 8,700 nautical mile range, making it more ideal for thinner, ultra-long-range sectors. Current major customers for the model include Emirates, Qatar Airways, Lufthansa, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, ANA, Etihad, and Singapore Airlines.

A Breakthrough In Gate-Fitting Technology

The Boeing 777X's folding wingtips allow Boeing to offer a high-aspect-ratio composite wing, which provides exceptional efficiency while in cruise control. However, the manufacturer still wants operators to be able to park the aircraft at Code-E gates when the tips fold on the ground. This single design choice drastically changes airport math. Carriers chase long-haul route economics without triggering costly aircraft stands or requiring widened taxiways. From an operational perspective, this leverages advanced technology to provide flexibility for operators unlike anything ever seen before.

This is exceptionally valuable for operators that fly in and out of slot-constrained hub facilities. Some airports, like London Heathrow Airport (LHR), are pretty much already operating at maximum capacity, with little room for additional flights. As a result, airlines are in a position where they are required to purchase landing slots in order to gain access to the airport, and some of these slots can go for millions of dollars. At these kinds of slot-constrained hubs, the Boeing 777-9 can deliver Boeing 777-300ER-level capacity and range using existing airport infrastructure.

For airports, this is a hedge. The aircraft ensures that it can expand capacity without having to invest in the expensive development of wider gates that can accommodate its exceptional wingspan. Over time, this gate-fit innovation will gradually become a template for others to follow, as continuing to modify airports to fit larger and wider aircraft is both expensive and inefficient. Expanding some gates means eliminating others, something very unpopular at airports that continue to become increasingly crowded each year.

A New Frontier In Long-Haul Unit Costs

The Boeing 777X pushes down long-haul costs per seat while preserving the Boeing 777's belly cargo space and maintaining the same amount of premium cabin real estate. This ensures that the aircraft can offer an efficient gauge on sectors that have flight times between 8 and 14 hours. On trunk routes, the aircraft can consolidate off-peak demand into a single departure with more seats, offering better per-seat economics and a stronger premium density, something valuable to today's hub carriers that operate out of slot-constrained hubs.

On thinner, long sectors, the Boeing 777-8's payload-range profile supports city pairs that push the Boeing 787-10 to its limits, but don't require the hefty gauge of an Airbus A380. This enabled new on-stop-to-nonstop upgrades and robust winter schedules. The aircraft's geometry also shifts for alliances, with more seats at competitive unit costs allowing the airline to sustain corporate contracts without adding frequencies that erode aircraft yields. In leisure-heavy markets, lower per-seat-mile costs improve off-season viability, allowing airlines to use the jet to stabilize off-season connectivity.

The aircraft's floor plan also caters to premium-friendly operations, with wide aisles and big galleys. Business class suites with closing doors, true premium economy depth, and a healthy economy cabin are all options, allowing airlines to balance yield mix and scale as desired. The net effect of this aircraft entering service will be a valuable fleet tool that widens the profitability envelope for airlines on all kinds of high-density routes.

A Quieter, Calmer Long-Haul: Cabin And Comfort Upgrades

Borrowing from the Boeing 787's cabin design, the Boeing 777X offers improved pressurization and humidity, ensuring that passengers can relax in a quieter environment with a wider fuselage cross-section. This supports roomier aisles and more generous shoulder space for passengers. The aircraft is a canvas on which airlines can install next-generation business class suites, most of which feature doors, in addition to large premium economy seats with layouts that allow credible seat width. This reduces anticipated passenger fatigue on 10 and 15-hour segments.

More aerodynamically clean wings and modern flight control systems reduce turbulence during flights, resulting in improved sleep quality for passengers. Cabins are also insulated to reduce overall noise, and LED lighting is reduced to improve circadian rhythms. Improved airflow control reduces perceived jet lag and enhances meal pacing without leading to clogs in galleys.

For passengers who are interested in remaining fully connected while on the go with abundant power and reliable Bluetooth audio, the experience can feel less like an endurance test and more like a productive work block or restful overnight travel. The Boeing 777X offers this comfort at scale, with hundreds of seats per flight. This combination of quiet operations and a comfortable environment will set a new standard for long-haul comfort, pushing operators to match this new exceedingly high bar in order to ensure the most comfortable experience possible for their passengers.

Fuel Burn And A Path To Lower Carbon Emissions

The Boeing 777X's efficiency story involves blending carbon-fiber wings and advanced aerodynamics with GE9X engines that use ceramic-matrix composites and lean-burn combustors. This ensures that a very high bypass ratio is utilized as it will reduce fuel consumption. For airlines, this offers lower trip costs and lower fuel burn per seat, something which is compounded by carbon pricing and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending mandates, which continue to rise. Overall, community noise footprints continue to shrink, easing night-bank operations and slot negotiations at major hubs.

Aircraft compatibility with high-blend sustainable aviation fuel helps airlines decarbonize quicker, with aircraft efficiency preserving range and payload when SAF energy density or supply drives contract margins. Fewer flights can carry the same number of passengers due to the aircraft's higher gauge, reducing overall movements and associated carbon emissions in the market. Here are some specifications from the Boeing 777-8 from manufacturer Boeing:

Beyond flight operation, commonality exists between the Boeing 777X and existing Boeing 777 maintenance networks, allowing the aircraft to easily integrate into the fleets of legacy Boeing 777 operators. With a fleet life measured in decades, these incremental fuel gains certainly compound, especially on the world's highest-demand flagship sectors where marginal drag and increased engine efficiency matter the most. The outcome, in the end, is not a single silver bullet but a credible step down the emissions curve that scales at a global level.

Ripple Effects Across The Industry

Because the Boeing 777X is an update of the popular Boeing 777 family, airlines can use the same pilots, procedures, and maintenance setup that they already have in place. This makes it faster to put into service and less risky than a brand-new model.

Aircraft training is relatively simpler too, as crews can easily move between Boeing 777 versions in order to cover busy seasons or disruptions. This allows them to keep schedules steady and maintain costs in check. While on the ground, a large, modern Boeing 777 fleet supports spare parts suppliers and repair shops, lowering maintenance time frames across an entire fleet.

The Boeing 777X also accommodates a large amount of belly cargo without compromising passenger cabin space, making it ideal for e-commerce and pharmaceuticals on longer routes. Regulators will also set clear rules for folding wingtips and similar aircraft features, paving the way for more efficiency gains in the long run. Passengers can also get used to seeing this at airports.

So, What Is The Bottom Line When It Comes To The Boeing 777X?

At the end of the day, the Boeing 777X will fundamentally change the aviation industry when it enters service. The era of large-capacity widebody jets like the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747 may be over.

However, the introduction of new, capable models with long-range capabilities that have the appealing operating economics of twin-engine aircraft will become more popular than ever. Jets like the Boeing 777X continue to be among the most innovative aircraft on the market and operators anxiously await their entry into service.

Ensuring that models like the Boeing 777X not only enter service cleanly but are able to have an extensive impact on the market will prove essential for operators. The jet will become a common sight at airports, and it will offer an exceptional passenger experience with unbeatable economics for airlines.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/476589458_1048570050648136_4205377480146556987_n.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-25 23:56:45.858573

1) A Decisive Decade Begins

Every industrial transition arrives in two movements: first, a proof of possibility; then, a proof of inevitability. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) cleared the first bar over the last fifteen years - multiple ASTM pathways, early flights, and the birth of book-and-claim markets. Now we enter the second movement, where the question is not whether we can decarbonize aviation, but how fast we can scale the molecules that will do it.

The IATA - Worley global feedstock assessment removes any remaining ambiguity about the starting point for this decade: waste and residue lipids are the most bankable, sustainable, and immediately scalable feedstocks, and HEFA is the pathway that can turn them into certified jet fuel at the speed policy now demands. That is the thesis of this article - and the strategic reason to situate our flagship HEFA SAF refinery in Port Klang, Malaysia.

2) What the IATA - Worley Assessment Actually Says

The assessment frames Asia - Pacific - and especially ASEAN - as one of the world’s richest biomass theaters for SAF, but it also cautions against magical thinking. It quantifies a vast regional feedstock base and clarifies the shares by category through 2030 and 2050, with agricultural residues as the single largest pool and oil-based wastes/residues (UCO, tallow, PFAD) forming a consistently material share of what is both available and practical to mobilize in the near term. In ASEAN & Pacific, unlocking oil-based and agroforestry residues could yield ~112 Mt of SAF biomass feedstock by 2030, increasing to ~129 Mt by 2050—a resource platform that is both diversified and adaptable to multiple pathways.

Crucially for Malaysia’s positioning, the report recognizes ASEAN’s dominant oil-based feedstock capability, led by Malaysia and Indonesia, and underscores that the region is currently focusing on maximizing HEFA production thanks to established lipid supply chains and installed industrial competence—cues investors should not ignore.

3) The Strategic Logic of HEFA - Now

HEFA is not merely an ASTM annex or a chemistry set; it is a commercial ecosystem with proven performance, certified sustainability routes, and real production plants. That matters when you must approve capex at scale. While e-SAF (PtL), ATJ, and FT are essential for the 2030s–2040s, the 2020s are HEFA’s decade - the bridge that lets aviation post real decarbonization tonnage while the rest of the portfolio matures. The assessment validates this hierarchy implicitly: crop-based scaling is constrained by land - use and food security, whereas wastes and residues - notably UCO and lipid side - streams - are the sustainable growth lane the world can accept politically and accelerate industrially.

This isn’t about “picking winners”; it’s about sequencing. We scale the bankable pathway first (HEFA from wastes/residues) to unlock policy credibility, offtake discipline, and supply - chain muscle memory. That sequencing lowers perceived risk and brings the cost delta down sooner, which in turn makes later-decade pathways financeable at scale.

4) Why Waste & Residue Lipids Are the Best Near - Term Bet

Waste and residue lipids—UCO, tallow, PFAD, selected processing residues—uniquely satisfy sustainability, carbon-intensity, and social acceptance requirements:

High sustainability integrity: They avoid the land-use change and food security debates that shadow crop oils. The assessment is explicit that crop-based pathways offer limited scalability under real-world land and food constraints; scaling should focus on wastes/residues.

Systems readiness: ASEAN already runs large, sophisticated lipid supply chains (oleochemicals, palm derivates), and Malaysia/Indonesia lead this domain, shortening the learning curve for SAF-grade logistics, pretreatment, and QA/QC.

Immediate carbon benefit: UCO-HEFA typically delivers significant lifecycle CO₂ reductions (depending on system boundaries), with transparent certification possible through ISCC/CORSIA frameworks and digital chain-of-custody—precisely the sort of proof airlines and corporate buyers require.

The practical obstacles are not about what to use; they’re about how to mobilize it. The assessment details the logistics and aggregation challenges that slow waste/residue flows—fragmented production, scattered generation sites, seasonal availability, lack of storage, and limited standardized collection practices. It calls for intermediary aggregation hubs, cooperative models, and digital coordination tools to ensure consistent, year-round supply—exactly the system design FatHopes Energy has built for a decade.

5) Malaysia’s Native Advantages - Made for HEFA

Geography, industry, and know-how combine to give Malaysia a rare trifecta:

Port Klang on the Straits of Malacca—one of the world’s busiest maritime corridors—lets us aggregate feedstock regionally and export liquid molecules effortlessly, a crucial advantage given how book-and-claim and physical blending will co-evolve this decade.

Industrial and talent depth: Our oleochemical and palm industry base trains engineers, chemists, operators, and quality managers in lipid systems, catalysis, and large-scale processing—capabilities that translate directly to HEFA.

Feedstock theater: The assessment identifies ASEAN (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines) as the regional nucleus for biomass, with oil-based streams a persistent share of the total potential through 2030–2050.

Policy leverage: With ASEAN chairmanship, Malaysia can harmonize fragmented national plans, moving from uncoordinated targets to a regional SAF platform that standardizes certification, accounting, and cross-border logistics.

6) The ASEAN Feedstock Map - Where the Tonnes Live

The assessment’s blueprint for East Asia & Pacific excludes Japan, Korea, Singapore from primary feedstock sourcing (they are expected importers) and centers the biomass story on ASEAN + Australia. It projects ~10% of the region’s unconstrained feedstock potential by 2030 dedicated to SAF (rising slightly by 2050), with agricultural residues ~60–64%, MSW ~13%, and oil-based ~9–13%—a composition that stays remarkably stable across the time horizon. This anchor is why we argue for a portfolio mindset with HEFA as the near-term backbone.

The document also emphasizes residue classes—rice straw, husks, mill by-products, forestry and wood waste—plus MSW, whose combustibles will grow with urbanization. These pools matter for ATJ/FT down the line, but require supply-chain formalization and waste-management upgrades before they can reliably feed commercial SAF at scale—another reason to lead with HEFA now while building the residue/MSW pipelines for the 2030s.

7) Designing Port Klang as Malaysia’s HEFA Lighthouse

A Port Klang HEFA refinery should be engineered around three reinforcing design pillars:

(i) Feedstock-first design Build pretreatment and hydrotreating trains that are lipid-agnostic within the waste/residue family: UCO, tallow, PFAD, selected side-streams. Engineer for contaminant robustness (metals, water, FFA variability), and data-rich receiving that ties every batch to a traceability ledger. The assessment highlights exactly this need for intermediary hubs, storage, preprocessing, and digital coordination to overcome scattered supply. Our design institutionalizes those hubs at the terminal-refinery interface.

(ii) Digital chain-of-custody as core infrastructure Treat traceability as a plant utility, not an optional bolt-on. A refinery that can generate auditable, real-time chain-of-custody compliant with ISCC/CORSIA will command a premium from airlines and corporate buyers. The assessment’s repeated warning about fragmented, decentralized supply points straight at the solution: digitize collection, aggregation, validation, and mass balance, then lock it with third-party certs.

(iii) Export-ready liquids & regional integration Engineer the site as a regional molecule hub, capable of book-and-claim enablement and physical shipments aligned with contracts. Port Klang’s maritime scale means SAF/renewable naphtha/diesel coproducts can move fluidly to ASEAN, India, Middle East, and even Europe—turning sustainability into export earnings while undergirding aviation’s decarbonization.

8) The Finance Case - Why HEFA Clears Investment Committees

Investors fund de-risked pathways. HEFA’s advantages are pragmatic:

Proven capex & opex envelope: Reference plants and licensors exist.

Certifications and buyers: ASTM pathway maturity + airline offtake culture = bankable revenue visibility.

Policy alignment: Near-term mandates/levies and incentive frameworks reward early tonnes.

Digital premium: Verifiable chain-of-custody can command price premiums and unlock Scope 3 credit demand from corporate travel buyers.

The IATA–Worley document’s central caution is not that feedstock is lacking, but that supply chains are messy and under-organized. That is a solvable, investable problem—especially in Malaysia, whose private sector has already built collection networks, depot infrastructure, and data systems for exacting international buyers.

9) The Policy Design - How Malaysia Leads at Home and in ASEAN

To turn assessment insights into national advantage, Malaysia should adopt six policy levers:

A Malaysia SAF Roadmap with clear HEFA-first sequencing, blending targets, and a long-dated incentive runway to derisk capital.

Creditable carbon accounting & book-and-claim standardization so that every tonne uplifted anywhere can be claimed everywhere—within a harmonized ASEAN framework. The assessment notes regional policy fragmentation; chairmanship is our window to set the standard.

Aggregation infrastructure finance—storage, preprocessing, rural collection roads—precisely the bottlenecks identified in the report.

Fast-track permitting for HEFA and mutual recognition of certifications across ASEAN to shorten time-to-tonnes.

Cooperative vendor models for smallholders and MSMEs that formalize supply without excluding the informal sector—answering the assessment’s call for intermediary hubs and coordination.

Export ambition—treat SAF as a strategic liquid export alongside petrochemicals and oleochemicals; Port Klang becomes the green molecules pier of ASEAN.

10) Addressing the Hard Questions - Upfront

Q: Will wastes and residues be “enough”? A: Alone, no—portfolio thinking is essential. But wastes/residues are enough to justify a decade of HEFA scale-up, which buys time for ATJ/FT to mature on residues/MSW and for PtL to ride the hydrogen-and-power cost curve. The assessment’s composition shares (residues largest, oil-based consistently material, MSW growing) match that portfolio logic.

Q: What about sustainability controversies around palm derivatives? A: The assessment is explicit: any expansion that triggers LUC/deforestation is constrained. Our strategy centers wastes and residues (UCO, PFAD side-streams where permissible, and mill residues), not primary crop expansion. We must hard-wire traceability and prefer UCO as the signature feedstock—socially acceptable, circular, and already flowing through compliant supply chains.

Q: Is MSW or forestry residue a faster route than HEFA? A: Not in this decade. The assessment notes collection complexity, competing uses, and logistics that require targeted investments and systems reform before MSW/forestry can behave like bankable SAF feedstock at scale. Hence HEFA-first, then residue/MSW-based ATJ/FT as the 2030s workhorses.

Q: How does PtL/e-SAF fit? A: It’s essential—but power-constrained. The assessment underlines that PtL depends on renewable power, electrolyzers, CO₂ capture logistics, and grid build-out. It is the late-decade scaler; betting the 2020s on it would delay real tonnes now.

11) Building the Malaysian Playbook - From UCO to SAF at Scale

Step 1: Lock the collection flywheel. Scale UCO aggregation across HORECA and food manufacturing, integrate household flows via ranger/consumer nodes, and formalize POME/PFAD side-streams where they meet best-practice sustainability. The assessment’s diagnosis—fragmented generation, seasonal flows, and weak storage—is exactly the problem set our digital stack solves.

Step 2: Engineer pretreatment resilience. Design for contaminant variability and rapid feedstock switching. Use data to triage batches before hydrotreating. This is where Port Klang’s terminal footprint can host quality-indexed storage and continuous QA—a physical expression of mass balance you can audit.

Step 3: Institutionalize trust. Make chain-of-custody a product. Airlines and corporate buyers are not just buying fuel; they are buying auditable emissions math. Bake ISCC/CORSIA workflows into operations; expose buyer dashboards with real-time batch lineage.

Step 4: Export competence. Use Port Klang’s shipping lanes to move SAF, renewable diesel, and co-products. Link physical flows with book-and-claim registries accepted across ASEAN and beyond.

12) ASEAN as a Coordinated SAF Basin

The report’s regional lens makes one policy message unmistakable: coordination beats fragmentation. With Malaysia in the chair, ASEAN can:

Standardize certification & accounting so a tonne from Malaysia can be recognized seamlessly in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines.

Pool aggregation infrastructure—cross-border depots and preprocessing—targeted exactly where the assessment finds today’s bottlenecks.

Prioritize wastes/residues first, while co-funding residue/MSW formalization to prepare ATJ/FT for the 2030s.

13) The Social Contract - Waste to Wealth

A HEFA strategy built on wastes and residues carries a pragmatic social dividend: it pays households, hawkers, small eateries, and MSMEs for what was once a nuisance stream; it cuts improper disposal and landfill pressure; and it transforms women- and family-run micro-businesses into feedstock entrepreneurs—precisely the intermediary hubs the assessment says are required for reliable year-round supply.

14) Risk, Managed - How We Keep the License to Operate

Three guardrails keep this strategy future-proof:

No new land-use; waste & residue-only growth. This aligns with the assessment’s sustainability boundary and avoids the policy backlash that derails investor confidence.

Digital transparency. The supply chain is only as strong as its weakest ledger. Make the ledger public (within commercial bounds), certify continuously, and punish non-compliance.

Portfolio evolution. Treat HEFA as necessary but not sufficient; begin residue/MSW pilots for ATJ/FT and lay the power foundations for PtL, consistent with the assessment’s view of feedstock classes and PtL prerequisites.

15) The Investor’s Summary - Why This Works in Malaysia

Resource certainty: ASEAN biomass base, with oil-based wastes/residues a steady slice through 2050.

Operational competence: Malaysia’s lipid industries + Port Klang logistics.

Demand pull: Global mandates and voluntary markets; buyers prefer traceable waste-based SAF.

Policy window: ASEAN chairmanship to harmonize rules and reduce cross-border friction.

Scalable narrative: A refinery designed as infrastructure + information system will earn a trust premium in book-and-claim markets.

16) The Call to Action - Time to Choose Speed

The IATA–Worley assessment is not a promise; it is a map. Maps don’t move you—leaders do. Malaysia’s choice is stark: either treat this decade as a pilot program and watch others seize the export geography, or build Port Klang into ASEAN’s green molecules pier and lead the most investable phase of aviation decarbonization.

To Government: Publish a Malaysia SAF Roadmap with HEFA-first sequencing, incentives through 2035, and ASEAN-wide certification harmonization. Fund aggregation infrastructure where the assessment identifies the bottlenecks—storage, preprocessing, rural roads, and digital coordination.

To Investors: Back the Port Klang HEFA refinery now. Bankability rests on pathway maturity, feedstock realism, and verifiable accounting. This is the combination Malaysia uniquely offers.

To Airlines: Anchor financing with multi-year offtakes and commit to book-and-claim at scale. Demand waste-residue provenance and real-time chain-of-custody—force a race to the top on transparency.

To ASEAN Partners: Use Malaysia’s chair to adopt a regional SAF standard and shared infrastructure toolkit. Coordinate targets to avoid policy whiplash and drive pooled procurement.

To the Public: Your household UCO is climate infrastructure. Return it through formal channels; insist on transparent collection; and recognize that every liter kept out of drains and landfills is one step closer to clean flight.

17) Closing : Malaysia’s HEFA Mandate

Aviation’s decarbonization will be written, in no small part, by the places that can organize waste & residue lipids into auditable molecules at scale. The IATA–Worley assessment is clear about the resource base, honest about the logistics constraints, and optimistic about what coordination and infrastructure can unlock. That is Malaysia’s brief. That is Port Klang’s opportunity.

We predicted this decade. Now we must build it—with the HEFA refinery, the digital ledger, and the regional standard that lets the world trust every tonne we ship. The window is open. Let’s move.

Bangchak’s rise highlights the opportunities and tensions facing Southeast Asia’s energy incumbents.
As Southeast Asia’s energy transition accelerates, Bangchak’s evolution from national refiner to regional clean energy contender shows how even mid-sized players can carve out leadership positions.","For much of its four-decade history, Bangchak Corporation was regarded as a mid-sized Thai refiner with a strong domestic brand. Today, the company is seeking to punch above its weight, presenting itself as a regional champion of sustainable energy through a growing portfolio of renewable power, biofuels and next-generation fuels.

Bangchak’s transition is anchored in its BCP 316 NET strategy, a plan that commits the group to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The strategy reflects a balancing act: using cash flows from its refining and retail network to bankroll a rapid expansion into green projects across Southeast Asia. Executives argue that this dual model allows Bangchak to maintain financial resilience while positioning itself at the forefront of the region’s decarbonisation agenda.

The company’s most visible international success is the Monsoon wind project in Laos, one of the largest in Southeast Asia, which has begun exporting power to Vietnam. The project not only diversifies Bangchak’s portfolio beyond its home market but also underscores its role in cross-border energy integration, a priority for ASEAN governments as they seek to build a regional power grid. In Taiwan, Bangchak is pressing ahead with two new solar farms of more than 100MW combined, expanding its presence in one of Asia’s most advanced renewable markets.

These projects are complemented by domestic innovation. In Thailand, Bangchak has piloted solar-plus-battery storage for agricultural cooperatives, a model that could become a template for distributed power generation in rural communities. Its investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a unit capable of producing up to one million litres a day, positions the company as one of the few Asian producers ready to supply airlines once mandates are introduced. While the regulatory framework remains uncertain, the project illustrates Bangchak’s willingness to take early risks in areas that could become central to the energy transition.

Beyond scale, the group is trying to differentiate itself through circular economy initiatives. Its “Fry to Fly” programme, which turns used cooking oil into jet fuel, has earned environmental awards and strengthened its ESG profile. These initiatives help Bangchak appeal to global investors increasingly focused on sustainability metrics, while reinforcing its domestic reputation as an innovator.

Regional competition is intensifying. Malaysia’s Petronas has launched Gentari, a clean energy subsidiary with multi-gigawatt ambitions. Indonesia’s Pertamina is leveraging its geothermal reserves, and Thailand’s state-backed PTT is deploying capital into hydrogen and electric vehicle infrastructure. Compared with these giants, Bangchak is modest in size. Yet analysts argue that its agility and focus on niche segments such as SAF and community-based renewables allow it to move faster and demonstrate results sooner.

The company’s trajectory has already attracted recognition. It has received awards for environmental compliance at its refinery, as well as accolades for climate leadership. More importantly, it has begun to draw interest from green finance markets, where access to capital increasingly depends on credible transition plans. By embedding ESG objectives into board-level strategy and project design, Bangchak is making the case that it is more than a refiner in transition — it is a regional energy player in its own right.

Bangchak’s rise highlights the opportunities and tensions facing Southeast Asia’s energy incumbents. Demand for fossil fuels remains strong, yet climate commitments and investor pressure are forcing companies to pivot. For Bangchak, the challenge is to scale its clean energy ventures quickly enough to offset future declines in refining revenues, while competing against larger state-backed rivals.

What distinguishes the company is its willingness to reinvent itself. From pioneering biofuels in Thailand to investing in wind in Laos and solar in Taiwan, and now moving into sustainable aviation fuel, Bangchak has repeatedly anticipated policy and market shifts. In doing so, it has crafted a narrative of transformation that resonates beyond its domestic base.

As Southeast Asia’s energy transition accelerates, Bangchak’s evolution from national refiner to regional clean energy contender shows how even mid-sized players can carve out leadership positions. The outcome of its gamble will depend on execution, policy support and market dynamics, but the company has already secured something more immediate: a reputation as one of the region’s most forward-looking energy groups.",https://www.atalayar.com/media/atalayar/images/2025/09/25/2025092516070742666.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 02:56:25.992341

Background on the use of SAF and the Lufthansa Group's climate project portfolio

There is no refueling of individual flights with pure SAF. As a so-called ""drop-in"" fuel, SAF is compatible with fossil kerosene and can be easily blended with it. Before being transported to the airport, SAF is mixed with fossil aviation fuel (blending) or produced through co-processing (joint processing of biogenic residues with crude oil) and then transported to airports in Europe where the Lufthansa Group refuels large quantities of kerosene. The Lufthansa Group ensures that the amount of SAF required to offset individual CO2 emissions is fed into the Lufthansa Group's flight operations within six months of purchase. Over its entire lifecycle, the SAF used by the Lufthansa Group from biogenic residues has a CO2 footprint at least 80 percent lower than conventional kerosene from fossil crude oil.",https://content.presspage.com/uploads/2888/be9aa416-f4a7-442b-85c1-e64d795b2a92/1920_20250925_lhg_foto_01_miles_more_setzt_neue_anreize_fuumlr_nachhaltigeres_fliegen.jpg?10000,N,,2025-09-25 21:56:08.054937

This dissertation evaluates the economic viability of a large-scale SAF production project in Brazil, using Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, leveraging the country’s abundant lipid-based feedstocks and evolving regulatory support. To capture the uncertainty surrounding the SAF market, a risk analysis framework combining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) modelling with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is applied, enabling a probabilistic assessment of financial performance, thereby offering a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding than traditional deterministic methods. Moreover, it can be used to support decision-making from a risk-adjusted perspective. Sensitivity, break-even, certainty equivalent and scenario analyses are conducted. The findings indicate that, although the project shows potential for economic feasibility, it is highly exposed to various sources of risk. Particularly, regarding SAF market premiums, primarily driven by regulatory frameworks, and feedstock prices, influenced by availability and demand from the global biofuels market. The future evolution of these factors remains highly uncertain, reflecting a complex interplay between the evolving regulatory landscape, supply-demand dynamics and market maturity. As a result, the project’s viability depends on broader market developments, sustained market prices and the progression of supportive policy frameworks. Furthermore, the results highlight that financial support mechanisms, particularly capital grants, play an important role in improving the economic attractiveness of such capital-intensive projects.

Collectively, these laws reflect a shift toward increasing corporate accountability for human rights, labor conditions, and environmental sustainability within supply chains.
Cohesive due diligence legislation across the union could be similarly helpful for large European firms.
Moreover, the CSDDD requires European firms to put forth climate transition plans that align with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
The battery passport, an idea developed by the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), would provide each battery with a digital tracking of its supply chain.","Over the past decade, as the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has become more salient, public opinion in Europe has shifted in favor of more sustainable consumption choices. Between 2011 and 2019, Europeans not only showed a continuous increase in support for more sustainable practices, but also reported taking more actions to “help tackle climate change” (European Commission, 2023a). This shift in public opinion has exerted significant pressure on policymakers and firms to push for and adopt more sustainable practices, culminating in the introduction of national-level supply chain due diligence laws as early as 2015. However, with the promulgation of multiple laws across national jurisdictions, a clear need arose to harmonize these regulations.

Thus, in 2024, the European Union adopted the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), as part of a broader regulatory effort undertaken by EU policymakers to improve the coherence of its sustainability policies and address human rights abuses in the supply chain of European firms. The directive, similar to many of the individual laws already adopted by certain member states, serves a dual purpose: (a) addressing human rights violations stemming from the activities of large multinational firms abroad and (b) limiting the environmental impacts of those activities (European Commission, 2025b; White & Case, 2025). The date initially set for member states to implement it into national law was 2026.

Although the directive applies broadly to large firms operating within the European Union in various industries, its implications are particularly significant for sectors reliant on critical minerals, especially under the concurrent push for the green transition. Critical minerals such as lithium and cobalt are key to battery energy storage technologies that enable renewable energy generation and the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). However, many critical minerals are extracted and processed in developing countries, often with adverse socioeconomic impacts on local communities and ecosystems (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2025; Stimson Center, 2023; World Economic Forum, 2024).

Though several regulations for battery and critical materials have already been introduced in the European Union, we suggest that, despite the recent Omnibus proposal limiting its scope, the CSDDD remains a useful framework for harmonizing existing national-level regulations. We explore existing and potential measures of adjustment by affected companies, and the requirements for a successful implementation of the regulation.

These import dependencies create significant vulnerabilities for the European Union’s industrial strategy, especially as demand for EVs and battery materials accelerates. While the CRMA aims to increase self-sufficiency—setting targets like 40 percent domestic processing and 10 percent extraction by 2030—there is no dedicated funding to achieve these goals (European Court of Auditors, 2023). As a result, the European Union is pursuing new trade partnerships and is attempting to diversify supply through agreements with countries including Chile, Argentina, and Indonesia, while simultaneously investing in recycling technologies.

Several regulations for batteries and critical materials have already been introduced in the European Union. The Battery Directive (Directive 2006/66/EC) from 2006 aimed to reduce the amount of hazardous materials in batteries and increase battery recycling rates. This was replaced in 2023 by the New Batteries Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1542), under the auspices of the broader European Green Deal political strategy (European Commission, 2025a). This regulation aimed to minimize the environmental impact of batteries throughout their entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal, including carbon footprint requirements and minimum recycled content requirements (by weight) for cobalt, lead, lithium, and nickel. This regulation also implemented a “battery passport” to ensure compliance and better transparency and tracking of those battery contents.

Furthermore, the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/821) was promulgated in 2021, aiming to stem trade in tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, sales of which have historically been used in part to finance armed conflicts. Lastly, the EU Deforestation-Free Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1115), adopted in 2023, asks firms to prove that commodities, including critical minerals, are not sourced from deforested land.

Thus, directives like the CSDDD work to ensure that materials sourced for products sold in the European Union achieve the standards desired by consumers in the region, thereby supporting the focus on sustainable sourcing of imported critical minerals.

The United Kingdom was the first country to promulgate such a law, with the Modern Slavery Act in effect since 2015. This was the first law to mandate that large businesses disclose their efforts in addressing modern slavery within their supply chains. The act requires companies to publish annual statements on their actions. While there are no criminal penalties for noncompliance, the government can seek injunctions to enforce reporting requirements. Though the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in 2016, fully exiting in 2020, this law helped spur momentum for supply chain due diligence in the greater region (UK Parliament, 2015).

Since 2017, France’s Duty of Vigilance Law has required large companies to develop due diligence plans that identify and assess social and environmental risks in their operations and supply chains. These plans must include risk mitigation strategies, and companies can be held legally accountable for damages resulting from insufficient implementation, facing potential civil penalties (Latham & Watkins LLP, 2024).

The Netherlands’ Child Labor Due Diligence Act, adopted in 2019, requires companies to investigate child labor risks in their supply chains and to declare that they have exercised due diligence in addressing them. Noncompliance can result in administrative fines, and repeat violations may lead to criminal sanctions for company directors, including imprisonment (Littenberg and Binder, 2019). However, the law is not yet in full effect.

Norway’s Transparency and Human Rights Act, enacted in 2021, requires large enterprises to carry out due diligence in line with the OECD Guidelines and report publicly on these efforts. The law also grants individuals the right to request information on how companies manage human rights risks. Companies that fail to comply may face enforcement orders and coercive fines imposed by the Norwegian Consumer Authority (DNV, 2025).

Switzerland’s supply chain due diligence regulation, enacted in 2022, requires companies to implement measures to ensure responsible sourcing. Firms must evaluate their supply chains for compliance with human rights standards related to conflict minerals and child labor risks (EY Switzerland, 2025).

Germany’s Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz, or LkSG), which took effect in January 2023, mandates that companies with at least 3,000 employees (starting in 2024, at least 1,000) establish supplier risk management systems. These systems must address concerns such as child labor, unsafe working conditions, and environmental harm. Companies that fail to comply may face fines of up to 2 percent of their annual revenue and be barred from public tenders for up to three years. Firms are required to conduct risk assessments, implement mitigation measures, set up complaint mechanisms, and publish annual reports on their due diligence efforts (Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, 2023).

Collectively, these laws reflect a shift toward increasing corporate accountability for human rights, labor conditions, and environmental sustainability within supply chains. However, it is important to note that none of these laws have specific targets or deliverables, other than publishing annual plans outlining the steps taken by firms to monitor their supply chains. Hence, the primary channels through which the laws operate are (a) increasing the salience of this topic in public discourse and (b) providing interested groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) legal grounds to go after noncompliant firms.

The European Commission surveyed business executives, industry organizations, and civil society, to document the perceived motivation for conducting supply-chain due diligence after the introduction of these laws. Interestingly, business executives ranked reputational concerns, investor relations, and consumer preferences the highest, while not placing a large weight on sanctions and fines or judicial oversight stemming from those regulations. On the other hand, civil society and NGO groups seem to be overly optimistic about the legislative power of these laws, despite the lack of specific thresholds and guidelines (European Commission, 2020).

Yet, while reputational concerns seem to be enough of an incentive for businesses to respond to such legislation, multinational companies in particular grapple with differing requirements and restrictions across different countries. This is a primary concern in the European Union more generally and has led to the introduction of laws that attempt to harmonize disparate national approaches in order to lower the barriers to trade within the larger internal market. Cohesive due diligence legislation across the union could be similarly helpful for large European firms.

Most of the national laws referenced in the previous section apply broadly to large companies across various sectors but do not specifically mention automotive supply chains. However, given the significance of the automotive industry in Germany, the LkSG has direct implications for automotive manufacturers and suppliers. Companies are required to assess and address risks related to child labor and forced labor in the extraction of raw materials, such as cobalt and lithium, essential for EV batteries. They are also required to address issues of environmental degradation, including pollution and deforestation, associated with mining and production processes. Lastly, they need to address occupational health and safety violations in manufacturing facilities (Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS), 2023).

Switzerland’s Ordinance on Conflict Minerals and Child Labor also directly affects supply chains in the automotive sector. It requires companies to establish a supply chain traceability system, with specific obligations for each category. Firms must document product details, trade names, and information about suppliers and production sites when there is reasonable suspicion that child labor was employed. As for conflict minerals, companies dealing with 3TG (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) sourced from high-risk areas must record details such as mineral descriptions, supplier information, country of origin, and, for metals, data on smelters and refiners. If risks are identified, additional information—including mine of origin, processing locations, and tax payments—must be documented. By-products are traceable only up to the point where they are initially separated from primary minerals or metals (Swiss Confederation, 2022).

The main purpose of the CSDDD is to standardize the requirements to comply with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)’s “Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct,” ideally helping multinational companies to homogenize their reporting and sustainability requirements across the European Union. Moreover, the CSDDD requires European firms to put forth climate transition plans that align with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Lastly, it aims to homogenize the individual laws that European countries adopted at different times (KPMG in Finland, 2024).

Specifically, while the directive entered into force on July 25, 2024, required compliance was delayed due to negotiations. Companies with a global turnover of more than €1.5 billion and more than 5,000 employees in the EU must comply within three years, by 2027. Those with a turnover exceeding €900 million and more than 3,000 employees have four years, until 2028, and companies with a turnover above €450 million and more than 1,000 employees are granted five years, with compliance required by 2029 (European Commission, 2025c). However, the proposal has been criticized as “onerous and in need of simplification,” given the extensive reporting required across the supply chain (Runyon, 2025).

The criticisms leveled against the CSDDD led to intensive lobbying efforts that resulted in the introduction in February 2025 of what came to be known as the Omnibus proposals. The proposals were a set of amendments aiming to simplify and streamline sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements. While these proposals were intended to reduce administrative burdens and enhance competitiveness, concerns have been raised that they could dilute both existing national regulations and the initial CSDDD proposal (KPMG International, 2025).

There are five main ways in which existing national regulations might be diluted. First, the Omnibus proposals suggest that CSDDD would now apply only to Tier 1 (i.e., direct) business partners and not the entire supply chain. Secondly, the required reporting would be carried out only every five years, as opposed to annually, as is the case in much current national legislation. Third, current legislation requires that firms terminate relationships with business partners for which risks have been identified; the proposal suggests removing this requirement. Additionally, the proposal would exclude financial institutions, such that they would no longer be required to decide investments based on similar guidelines. Lastly, the proposal includes a one-year postponement of the effective date of the law (July 2028) (Ropes & Gray LLP, 2024; PwC United States, 2024).

In recent years, European automotive multinationals have made several efforts to invest in sustainability and rights-focused projects in developing countries. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, BMW and BASF, in partnership with Samsung and GIZ, launched the “Cobalt for Development” initiative in 2019. The project aimed to improve labor conditions and implement responsible mining practices in artisanal cobalt extraction (BMW Group, 2019; BASF SE, 2019). These efforts directly address labor and human rights risks, including child labor and unsafe working conditions. In 2021, Volkswagen Group, the second largest automotive manufacturer worldwide, headquartered in Germany, recognized their “responsibility along the entire supply chain, including their human rights due diligence for raw material sourcing and production” (Volkswagen Group, 2021). As a result, the company, along with a consortium of other large car manufacturers, set up the Responsible Lithium Partnership, an organization to foster sustainable lithium extraction in the area of the Atacama Salt Flat in Chile (Volkswagen Group, 2021; Factory Warranty List, 2023; Mercedes-Benz Group, 2024).

Renault, meanwhile, entered a 2022 partnership with Morocco’s Managem Group to secure low-carbon, traceable cobalt for its EV batteries. The agreement includes a new refinery powered 80 percent by wind energy, thereby contributing to both climate and sourcing goals (Renault Group, 2022). In 2023 the Volkswagen Group announced a €1 billion investment in Brazil to expand its electric and flex-fuel vehicle lineup, as part of a broader zero-carbon mobility strategy (Volkswagen Group, 2023).

Similarly, BMW committed R4.2 billion in 2023 to electrify its Rosslyn plant in South Africa for the production of plug-in hybrid vehicles, explicitly supporting the country’s green transition (BMW Group, 2023). Sweden-based Volvo announced a €160 million investment to expand its Hosakote truck and bus manufacturing facility in India. The new plant will prioritize clean mobility and support India’s growing demand for sustainable transport solutions (Volvo Group India, 2025).

These investments illustrate that leading European automotive firms are beginning to invest in green technologies, environmental protection, and the improvement of labor conditions in developing countries. However, whether these actions were a direct result of the due diligence requirements imposed across the European Union is unclear.

The capital investments outlined above mainly concern new projects, and while they are focused on the use of renewable energy and sustainable sourcing, they do not directly deal with the activity of suppliers and subcontractors. To obtain a sense of the specific actions taken by automotive firms to monitor their supply chains, we reviewed their annually published reports (an obligation stemming from due diligence laws) and we summarize the key takeaways for Stellantis and Volkswagen Groups.

Between 2017 and 2023, Stellantis—through its legacy firms Groupe PSA and FCA—built a progressively more robust supplier due diligence system grounded in risk assessment, third-party audits, and digital monitoring tools. Initially, both PSA and FCA relied on corporate social responsibility-based evaluations covering over 90 percent of their procurement volumes, complemented by corrective action plans and basic supplier codes of conduct banning forced labor and environmental negligence. Over time, they expanded these systems. PSA introduced sustainability indices and whistleblowing mechanisms, while FCA integrated conflict mineral tracking and launched a supplier compliance platform. After the Stellantis merger, these efforts scaled significantly. By 2023, the group was assessing over 100,000 suppliers using EcoVadis (a global assessment platform that rates businesses’ sustainability based on environmental impact, labor, and human rights standards) and had rolled out a real-time digital compliance tracking system. Supplier contracts were updated to mandate carbon footprint reduction, circular economy integration, and adherence to International Labour Organization standards, with high-risk suppliers subject to independent third-party audits (Stellantis N.V., 2025).

The Volkswagen Group followed a similar path. In 2017, the group implemented a supplier code of conduct and carried out basic sustainability audits. Over the next several years, it introduced digital risk mapping tools, expanded audit programs to cover over 90 percent of procurement spending, and integrated AI-based systems to detect violations. By 2023, Volkswagen was auditing over 4,000 suppliers annually, had trained nearly 8,000 direct suppliers on sustainability requirements, and imposed financial penalties for noncompliance. Volkswagen significantly strengthened its labor rights enforcement, with annual human rights risk assessments and targeted monitoring in high-risk sectors like cobalt mining. It also intensified its environmental responsibility, requiring major suppliers to commit to carbon neutrality and renewable energy sourcing, and to integrate recycled materials under expanded circular economy policies (Volkswagen Group, 2025).

Though companies are taking action to improve the sustainability of their sourced materials through capital expenditures and monitoring activities, due diligence is often challenging to verify.

For mineral sourcing in particular, tracking mineral flows from the mine to the buyer is crucial. One approach that mining companies have taken to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability is their voluntary adoption of or inclusion in sustainability certification mechanisms, such as the Copper Mark, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM)’s principles, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) standard, and Toward Sustainable Mining (TSM). Other voluntary certification programs exist, yet many have been accused of greenwashing (see, for example, Zharfpeykan (2021); Kippenberg and Wilde-Ramsing (2025)). The challenge is that each of these programs approaches assessing and/or certifying the sustainability of mines differently, and the rigor with which they proclaim sustainability at the mine varies widely (Hiete et al., 2019; Tröster and Hiete, 2019). In the context of the European Union’s supply chain due diligence laws, Human Rights Watch (2023) expressed concern about companies relying upon voluntary audits and certifications as compliance mechanisms, as some of these certifications do not guarantee environmental or social sustainability. In sum, reliance upon voluntary sustainability certifications or audits as a simple way of demonstrating sustainability may not actually result in improved outcomes at the mine.

Even in cases where automotive firms respond to the laws and put procedures in place to hold their suppliers to higher standards for human rights and environmental practices, it is virtually impossible for lawmakers to obtain an accurate understanding of the impact of those activities and, in turn, the effectiveness of the laws in improving outcomes at the supplying mines.

Given the challenges of verifying due diligence activities across fragmented supply chains, moving beyond procedural reporting to instituting quantifiable, performance-based metrics against which compliance can be meaningfully assessed would be more likely to improve outcomes. While developing such metrics may require additional mediation so they could emerge through the negotiation process, existing goals and regulations (e.g., the Critical Raw Materials Act, the battery passport) that can be built upon may prove to be a helpful starting point. Relying solely on commitments or audit participation offers limited insight into actual supplier behavior. Instead, due diligence frameworks could require companies to consistently report specific indicators such as carbon emissions per unit of output, volume of water consumed per product, or percentage of electricity sourced from renewable generation, for example. A benefit of these metrics is that they can be tracked across time and compared across suppliers to assess not just compliance, but progress. For labor-related aspects, metrics could include the percentage of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements, number of occupational health and safety incidents per 100 full-time employees, or the ratio of the average wage to the local living wage benchmark.

Importantly, sector-specific metrics reflect the material risks and environmental or social footprints of each industry. For example, in the automotive sector, relevant environmental indicators may include life cycle emissions of battery components, percentage of recycled materials used in vehicle production, or share of cobalt and lithium sourced from certified conflict-free zones. Tailoring metrics to sectoral realities could ensure that due diligence is both effective and proportionate, supporting meaningful oversight and credible enforcement.

Given the challenges in enforcement and the ability of manufacturers to fully quantify the impact of their supply chains on environmental and social sustainability, whether the CSDDD, as written and influenced by the Omnibus regulation, will result in measurable environmental and social improvements at the mine level is an open question. Estimating the impact of the policy will be key to understanding its effectiveness, the costs it imposes on manufacturers and consumers, and the impacts it has on vehicle decarbonization pathways.

There are two ways in which the CSDDD could affect the costs of decarbonization pathways. The first is through increased compliance costs, including administrative costs of compliance and fixed costs of shifting suppliers (Joshi et al., 2001; Kinderman, 2020). These manufacturer costs could be estimated with economic vehicle market models that leverage information on vehicle prices and demand (such as the one utilized in Linn (2022)). Alternatively, exploring public filings from companies or conducting interviews could elicit information about the extent to which the CSDDD impacts manufacturing costs; however, companies have generally kept this type of information confidential, so acquiring the information could be challenging. The European Commission predicted a relatively low cost of compliance with the CSDDD—about 0.13 percent of shareholder payouts made in 2023 (European Commission, 2022; van Teeffelen and de Leth, 2025)—although conducting an ex post analysis as described above would be prudent to ensure that these compliance costs remain low.

The second way in which the CSDDD may affect the costs of decarbonization is that improvements in sustainability at the mine extraction and processing points may increase the cost of procuring the minerals. If environmentally and socially sustainable minerals are more expensive, the cost of EVs could increase measurably, potentially slowing down their adoption. Identifying the impact of the CSDDD on mineral prices is thus a first step to understanding how the policy will impact EV adoption.

Importantly, sustainability is a positive good that many consumers value, yet for that value to be realized, vehicle buyers must be made aware of the environmental impacts of their purchases. Consumers’ knowledge that their vehicles were made in a sustainable manner may boost their willingness to pay (Jupiter Chevrolet, 2025); without verifiable information, however, this benefit is lost (Costa et al., 2019). One solution that could support this effort is the battery passport. The battery passport, an idea developed by the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), would provide each battery with a digital tracking of its supply chain. The idea behind the passport is that consumers would have visibility into the sustainability (or lack thereof) of the batteries in their EVs. So far, the GBA has implemented two pilots of the battery passport, which resulted in the release of rulebooks that cover greenhouse gas emissions, labor concerns, biodiversity, and indigenous peoples’ rights. See https://www.globalbattery.org/battery-passport-mvp-pilots/. If implemented and adopted, these passports could increase willingness to pay for sustainable battery extraction, and reduce the consumer welfare impacts that increased prices would create. Ultimately, however, the battery passport cannot eliminate the challenges of tracking and tracing the minerals across the supply chain.

The European Union’s CSDDD represents a significant shift in the regulatory landscape governing global supply chains, particularly for industries such as automotive manufacturing that rely heavily on imported critical minerals. While the directive aims to harmonize national laws and elevate environmental and human rights standards across company operations and supply chains, its effectiveness hinges on the ability of firms and regulators to monitor, verify, and enforce compliance. As illustrated by the practices of companies like Stellantis and Volkswagen, industry leaders are already implementing digital compliance tools, supplier audits, and risk mapping strategies in response to reputational and regulatory pressures. However, many of these efforts remain difficult to quantify, and the lack of standardized metrics limits transparency and comparability across firms.

To address this, future success will depend not only on the adoption of comprehensive legislation but also on the integration of measurable, sector-specific performance indicators. Without such concrete metrics and independent verification systems, laws risk becoming procedural rather than transformative. Moreover, given the potential for increased compliance costs to affect consumer prices and slow the green transition, especially in the EV market, tools like the battery passport and better consumer awareness may help align sustainability goals with market incentives. Ultimately, the CSDDD offers a framework with the potential to drive real change—but only if implemented with rigor, data transparency, and meaningful accountability, for which further regulatory steps are needed.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_1368334982.width-600.png,N,,2025-09-25 21:56:11.631743

By leveraging patented circular economy principles and energyneutral processes, Verdus turns animal manure and agricultural residues into a powerful engine for ecological and economic transformation.

The company supplies a modular BCT system— developed over 15 years and now in its fifth generation— which is a plug-and-play solution that arrives in 10 shipping containers and can be assembled in under a month. Each module processes 36 tonnes of dry biomass per day, producing negligible emissions and leaving no residual waste. Unlike competitors who require 500 tonnes daily to operate, Verdus achieves superior efficiency with a fraction of the input, making it ideal for decentralized deployment across farms, forests, and industrial sites.

Verdus Energy’s technology transforms feedstocks such as cattle manure, poultry litter, crop residues, and even municipal solid waste into over 200 marketable products. These include renewable diesel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Biochar, green fertilisers, organic pesticides and herbicides, bio-oils, electricity, and carbon credits. The environmental impact is profound: Biochar alone sequesters three tonnes of CO₂ per tonne applied to soil, and when fed to cattle, it reduces methane emissions by up to 22%. Combined, Verdus’ solutions can achieve a staggering 187% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

The company’s ESG alignment is equally compelling. Environmentally, Verdus eliminates landfills, cleans up rural pollution, and replaces petrochemical inputs with natural alternatives. Socially, it protects ecosystems, enhances food safety, and revitalises degraded land. From a governance perspective, Verdus empowers responsible management through traceable carbon credits and sustainable procurement.

Verdus Energy says its business model is built on strategic partnerships with governments, primary producers, energy companies, and waste managers. With feedstock surpluses exceeding 20 million tonnes annually in New Zealand alone, and strong global demand for its offtake products, Verdus says it is well-positioned to scale rapidly.

Kevin Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer of Verdus says the company’s technology has already proven itself in commercial settings.

“Version 4.0 has been successfully operating for over two years, producing carbon fuel pellets for one of the world’s largest mining companies. The current rollout of V5.0, will start in Q4 2025 and production is planned to commence in North America in 2026.”

Last week, the canal forecast a $3.5 billion profit for the fiscal year ending in September. The canal has said it expects less transits next year due to global economic instability.

The now-approved budget includes provisions for some of the canal's planned investments, it added, including its plan to build a $1.6 billion reservoir to expand the canal, a project that has been challenged in court by local communities.

The Rio Indio reservoir project would displace some 2,500 people. A group representing farmers filed a lawsuit to Panama's Supreme Court, saying most residents do not want to leave and that the project violates the constitution.

Building the reservoir would boost key supplies of water needed to transport cargo ships through a series of elevated locks, after a drought in 2023 caused the canal to reduce transits. Millions of gallons of water are needed per transit.

Panama has faced pressure from Washington over the running of the canal, with the Trump administration pledging to ""take back"" the waterway from perceived influence from China.

The global ethanol market size was valued at USD 68.43 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach USD 71.56 billion in 2025 and USD 102.39 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 4.58% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033.

The ethanol is derived from biomass feedstocks such as corn, sugarcane, and cellulosic materials, serving dual roles as a renewable fuel additive and an industrial chemical. Ethanol is most widely used as a biofuel, blended with gasoline to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance octane levels. According to the International Energy Agency, transportation accounts for nearly 24% of global CO₂ emissions from fuel combustion, which is making low-carbon alternatives like ethanol critical in decarbonizing mobility.

MARKET DRIVERS

Government Mandates and Renewable Fuel Policies

Mandatory biofuel blending regulations are driving the growth of the ethanol market. Countries have implemented policies requiring a fixed percentage of ethanol in gasoline to reduce fossil fuel dependence and lower transportation emissions. Brazil, the second-largest producer, operates a long-standing blending program requiring 27% anhydrous ethanol in gasoline (E27), as regulated by the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). These policies provide stable demand signals for producers and incentivize investment in production capacity and supply infrastructure, making regulatory support the cornerstone of ethanol market expansion in both developed and emerging economies.

Expansion of Flexible-Fuel Vehicles and Ethanol-Ready Infrastructure

The proliferation of flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) is significantly boosting the ethanol market. The country’s fueling infrastructure includes over 37,000 service stations offering ethanol, according to ANP, ensuring consumer accessibility. In the United States, the Department of Energy notes that nearly 27 million FFVs were on the road in 2023, though utilization of E85 remains limited due to sparse refueling stations. The initiatives, like the Biden administration’s Clean Fuels and Vehicles Program, are encouraging investments in ethanol-compatible pumps. Additionally, India and China are piloting E100 two-wheelers and public transport fleets in select cities.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Feedstock Price Volatility and Agricultural Constraints

Ethanol production is highly dependent on agricultural commodities such as corn, sugarcane, and cassava, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in crop yields, weather patterns, and global food prices. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, corn prices rose by 32% in 2022 due to drought conditions and export disruptions, directly increasing ethanol production costs. In India, erratic monsoon patterns have affected sugarcane output, with the Indian Sugar Mills Association reporting a 14% drop in production in 2023 compared to the previous year. These constraints limit the scalability of first-generation ethanol and create financial instability for producers in regions without diversified feedstock sources or price stabilization mechanisms.

Limited Infrastructure for High-Level Ethanol Blends

The absence of widespread infrastructure for dispensing high-concentration ethanol blends like E85 or E100 is limiting the growth of the ethanol market. In the United States, despite 27 million flexible-fuel vehicles on the road, the Department of Energy reports that fewer than 3,000 retail stations offer E85, representing less than 3% of all fueling points. In Europe, ethanol blending is largely capped at E10 due to material compatibility concerns in older vehicles and fuel systems. India, though advancing its E20 program, faces challenges in ensuring ethanol availability at retail outlets, particularly in rural areas. The lack of consumer awareness and perceived risks related to engine compatibility further dampen demand.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Growth of Cellulosic and Advanced Biofuels

The development of cellulosic ethanol produced from non-food biomass such as agricultural residues, wood chips, and municipal waste is escalating the growth of the ethanol market. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, cellulosic ethanol can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 86% compared to gasoline, far exceeding the 20–30% reduction from corn ethanol. In 2023, POET-DSM’s Project Liberty in Iowa produced over 15 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol, utilizing corn stover as feedstock. Companies like LanzaJet are commercializing alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathways using ethanol.

Integration of Ethanol in Decarbonizing Heavy Transport and Aviation

Ethanol is emerging as a viable low-carbon fuel for hard-to-abate transport sectors, including aviation, marine, and freight logistics, which is additionally escalating the growth of the Europe cookies market. Through chemical conversion, ethanol can be transformed into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) via alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) processes. According to the International Air Transport Association, SAF could contribute up to 65% of the aviation industry’s carbon reduction by 2050, with ethanol-based pathways playing a crucial role. Additionally, Brazil has launched ethanol-powered buses in São Paulo, which is demonstrating feasibility in urban transit.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Carbon Intensity and Lifecycle Emissions of First-Generation Ethanol

While ethanol is marketed as a low-carbon fuel, the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of first-generation (food-based) ethanol are under increasing scrutiny. According to a 2023 study by the International Council on Clean Transportation, corn ethanol in the U.S. offers only a 20–30% GHG reduction compared to gasoline when indirect land-use change (ILUC) is factored in, significantly less than previously estimated. The expansion of cropland for ethanol feedstocks can lead to deforestation and soil carbon loss, particularly in tropical regions.

Trade Barriers and Policy Inconsistencies Across Regions

The global supply chain integration and investment stability across countries are expected to degrade the growth of the ethanol market. The European Union imposes a safeguard duty of up to €250 per cubic meter on U.S. ethanol imports, limiting transatlantic trade despite surplus production in North America. India, though promoting domestic blending, restricts ethanol imports to protect local sugar producers, as stated by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Meanwhile, Brazil’s ethanol exports face logistical bottlenecks at ports and fluctuating tax regimes across states.

Speaking by video in a speech to a UN Climate Summit, President Xi also announced 2035 targets to expand China’s installed capacity of wind and solar power to 3,600 gigawatts – more than six times 2020 levels – and to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to over 30%.

The new emissions reduction goal will form China’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement. NDCs are national climate action plans presented by each country under the agreement, and are required to be updated every five years with increasingly higher ambition. In 2021, China set targets to reach peak GHG emissions prior to 2030, and to achieve climate neutrality by 2060.

China produces more greenhouse gases than any other country, accounting for nearly 30% of GHG emissions in 2024, more than double that of 2nd place U.S.

Several climate-focused groups expressed disappointment at China’s new targets, calling for greater ambition from the world’s top emitter.

Climate Action Tracker’s (CAT) China lead Norah Zhang said:

“Given China is both the world’s largest emitter and a leader in clean energy, this new target could have been a major opportunity for China to help the world reach the global climate goals. However, our calculations show the new target is unlikely to further drive down emissions, as China is already set to achieve this target with the policies it has in place. This is disappointing as China has the opportunity to decarbonise faster.“

CAT also pointed out that President Xi’s renewable energy goal was also less ambitious than current policy scenarios already suggest.

In the late days of the prior administration, U.S. President Biden also announced a goal to reduce GHG emissions by 61% – 66% by 2035, although President Trump has worked extensively to undo the Biden administration’s climate initiatives, and this week at the U.N called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

Speaking the day after Trump’s remarks, Xi said:

“Green and low-carbon transition is the trend of the time. While some countries are acting against it, the international community should stay focused on the right direction, remain unwavering in confidence, unremitting in actions and unrelenting in intensity, and push for formulation and delivery on NDCs, with a view to providing more positive energy to the cooperation on global climate governance.”

In addition to the emissions reduction and clean energy targets, Xi also outlined a series of other climate-related 2035 goals, including scaling up total forest stock volume to over 24 billion cubic meters, making new energy vehicles the mainstream in the sales of new vehicles, and expanding the National Carbon Emissions Trading Market to cover major high-emission sectors.

Xi said:

“These targets represent China’s best efforts based on the requirements of the Paris Agreement. Meeting these targets requires both painstaking efforts by China itself and a supportive and open international environment. We have the resolve and confidence to deliver on our commitments.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/China-Xi3.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 16:56:38.020149

Full transcript - MicroCap Rodeo Fall Conference:

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I’m Sean Severson, CEO and founder of Water Tower Research. Great to have our next presenter and company today, Gevo. Doctor, are you Mr. or Doctor? Which one? Doctor, Doctor, Doctor. Dr. Pat Gruber. We’re going to talk a little bit about Gevo, and then we’re going to leave plenty of time for Q&A on this one as well. There’s a lot going on at the company, but we’ll go through an overview of the company, and then we’ll get to some Q&A. Pat? Great. Glad to see you. We’re a company that’s focused on a new generation of fuels, the renewable resource-based jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel fuel. They’re made from renewable carbon, and they can achieve even carbon-negative footprints. Here’s the thing about them, is that to produce them on a cash cost basis, they can be economical.

I’ll do this to take a little bit about our story, where we’re at today, and how we look as a business and how to think about us. Our team is extremely well experienced. We’ll get this slide later, but we’re people who’ve been there, done it, built plants before, operated stuff before. We represent a team that’s one of the very few in the world who’s ever done agricultural stuff crossed over into the petrochemical world. If you were familiar with NatureWorks PLA, the clear plastic stuff that’s biodegradable, usually a clear cup, green band, and a whole bunch of products. I invented that stuff when I was young. I led the teams to build the plants. The people who worked with me then, we were all at Cargill and built stuff. We all came over here, and we wanted to do something bigger. We wanted to do hydrocarbons.

The cheapest way to make hydrocarbons from renewables is to take carbohydrates through alcohols. Alcohols like ethanol and other alcohols like isobutanol, and then do the chemistry, copying it straight out of the petrochemical industry of what’s done, and turn it into these hydrocarbon fuels. Put it all together and do it with a low carbon footprint. Our team is well experienced. When you look at our filings, you’re going to see four groupings of businesses. One of them is Gevo Fuels. Gevo Fuels encompasses ethanol. We recently bought an ethanol plant up in North Dakota. We’re using 16% of 12% of the capacity. One of the obvious things we’re going to want to do is you should buy more CO2 and put down that hole and get value for it. There’s a couple of ways that we can capture the value for it.

The wetland look is, it’s in a call to Broom Creek Formation. This is a cartoon of it. To give you the idea, it’s, like I said, been operating for three years. Interestingly enough, the people who built this, the plant was owned by Red Trail Energy. Red Trail Energy is a co-op. It’s owned by a farmer group who are both oilmen and farmers, mixtures of people. They said, I think it’s going to be important someday, and they built themselves a beautiful well. As I said, today, this is the only one that’s available on a public company basis, only three in the United States. They’re moving more in the future, and we’ll see this. Carbon capture is important. It creates a product that is called a CDR, Carbon Dioxide Removal credit. That’s the voluntary carbon they sell. That’s an important concept, the CDR.

It has nothing to do with the 45Z tax credit, nothing. They’re completely separate and unrelated. CDR. A ton goes down. You want to buy a ton? We’ll sell it to you. It’s going to cost you some money. One of the things is that we use corn as a raw material. This is important. You see my friend Corny, the cob out of here. He says, I’m not that kind of corn. We have to remind people that the kind of corn that we use in process is not the kind you eat. It is not in a bag, on a cob, or in a can. That ain’t the kind of corn we’re talking about here. We’re doing the 99% of the corn that’s grown. People forget this, particularly the enviros who like to talk about this food. You’re going to take food off a plate.

Sorry, that’s not true. Not food off a plate. In fact, you’re capturing all of the protein value and selling it in the marketplace. It’s important. To understand, say, a ton of corn, one third goes to ethanol, one third of a ton makes protein, which goes to the food chain, and the other third is carbon dioxide. Guess what? We’re doing a couple of interesting things here. We got ethanol as a product, and then we have protein as a product. Awesome. That’s a good co-product value. Now we’re talking about monetizing, creating value for that other third of a ton of raw material. That’s pretty important economically. You’ll see it. Where analysts get us wrong is not understanding how this business system works, because it is a little bit complicated. Corn comes in, and we’re going to take the corn, grind it up, mill it.

We’re going to use the carbohydrate portion and use that to make ethanol. We will take the protein and separate it, sell it to the food chain, take the corn oil, and sell it to the food chain. We are going to generate carbon, which we can sell to a voluntary carbon market, or we can also generate tax credits and other things. These things show up as co-products, so they are sometimes caught into costs. Cost of goods sold are offsets to our cost of goods, cost of production. You will not necessarily see it on a revenue line. If someone asked me that earlier today, where do we see this stuff? The carbon values come up as costs. The tax credits come up as a cost improvement.

Lazy analysts, when you come across them, they will have taken the corn and done some kind of a calculation. We are talking about SAF or jet fuel. They will talk about it, and they will do some kind of a calculation based on energy. They are lazy. They need to look at it in detail, do the economics, and actually come up with it, and you get the right answers. Low carbon corn, you sell out the co-products, you get low carbon ethanol. Cool, that is the business we have today that we are operating. It is profitable. In the future, we see ATJ, Alcohol-to-Jet, and I will explain that. No, I will get to it. Stand by. There are two markets that we are addressing in carbon markets.

Think of them as these are markets where we are actually selling dollars per ton, is the right way to think of this. Completely separate than a 45Z tax credit. The low carbon fuels markets like LCFS in California, Oregon, Canada, Washington, and others, you can get $50 to $200 a ton. That is better than zero. You can do CDRs. Those are $100 to $300 a ton. It does not take a genius to figure out that we should be focused on selling CDRs. That is what you saw last week in an announcement. We saw we sold something in NASDAQ. We are developing this marketplace. The reason you have not seen lots of these things is no one has handed us this sell this water. We just bought this plant and it closed on Peck in February.

Now we are taking it to the marketplace and seeing voluntary carbon markets as CDRs. An important concept. You can always bundle the carbon with a gallon of ethanol and sell it into California. That is this other market, generally at a lower price. Your EBITDA question is now being answered. The adjusted EBITDA potential, we are currently at a run rate of about $20 million a year. This is, if you look at this, this is what we think is going to happen in the near future. Right now, the light blue is going to be the tax credit market where we’re able to monetize tax credits. Another 45Z, big beautiful bill that runs through the end of 2029. It’s important. When you look at that light blue and you see the growth there, that’s pretty darn certain.

There’s another blue shadow up above there that’s about the voluntary carbon markets. That’s where we are putting a lot of emphasis to make happen, because we think that ultimately is where the world needs to go. Ethanol generates money, and then R&D. Where it has the negative in the column that has a negative above it, that’s our expenses. GSA, R&D, you know, the SARD or whatever you want to call it. It’s our burn. That’s what that is. That’s the subtraction. We’re saying that, yeah, we can see our way in very short order to $40 million a year with that. Very shortly after that, $110 million. This was without building an ATJ plant. This is just optimizing how we sell more carbon, optimize more ethanol. Optimizing more ethanol makes more CO2. It makes more protein.

It’s easier to understand what we’re trying to achieve here on this site. You did good by buying this site and by bringing in the carbon expertise on how to monetize sites. We are not a company that needs to raise money anytime soon from an operations standpoint. We have $127 million of cash equivalent on the balance sheet. We’re in pretty good shape. We like that. That’s an important point. As one looks at it, people say, gosh, it’s going to take you a long time to get an ATJ plant. You know what? We can be profitable without an ATJ plant. Get out of it. Get over it. We’re going to go build this ATJ plant. We’re going to lots of them. It’s a question of how we do it, but we don’t have to live and die by that sword. That’s a good place to be.

Now remember, we’re a company with hundreds of patents, huge amount of technology, fully designed plant, and we’re out to get that thing financed and built. That is our main growth platform is ATJ. I’ll tell you that story now. Fundamentals, first of all, this is information from the Energy Information Agency. U.S. jet fuel demand is increasing. In fact, it’s increasing all around the world. The demand for gasoline products is decreasing generally. Refineries are shutting down in the U.S. In a barrel of oil, there’s only 9% of jet fuel. The question is, where is the rest of the jet fuel going to come from in the future? What’s going to be the shortfall? How do you fill it? In 2035, it’ll be 2.3, 2.4 billion gallons a year of a shortfall.

The only alternative is going to be to import that. There will be some adjustments that refineries can do, but you can’t turn diesel fuel into jet fuel. It doesn’t work. It’s going to be sharp. This is actually the reason people want to see SAF, renewable jet fuel, be commercialized. Without it, absolutely, the price is going up for them. Our jet, this chart is a scatter chart of oil price versus jet fuel price. On the lower left, you see us overlapping heavily with the blue dots. That’s the cash cost of production of our stuff. It’s competitive with jet fuel. You know what that means? We can actually deliver a product on the same basis, assuming my plant was paid for, as that petrochemical company. Same basis, even though ours is made for renewable and has a zero carbon footprint. That’s pretty cool.

Which do you think people would buy if those two things are available? The challenge, of course, is that we have to pay off new capital. That’s the reality. Theirs is paid off. We have to pay for it. That’s what all those co-product values come and do. Those tax credits can help us. That’s how that works. It’s pretty interesting. Half thought is up to the right, and power and liquids thing is even off the chart. There are all kinds of technical reasons for it. If anyone ever wants to know, get me. I’ll tell you about it. Why that one is economically challenged. It’s about the use of energy. If one of these builds that ATJ plant up in North Dakota, adjacent and connected to our plant, we’d expect to add about $150 million of uplift to that site. $150 million of EBITDA uplift to that site.

Based upon the contracts we currently have in place, where we’re selling jet fuel as jet fuel, nothing’s done. It’s just jet fuel going to the market, and we sell the carbon to that same channel that passed the airlines. You hear what I said? We’re separating the carbon value from the jet value. The airline buys jet. The person who actually cares about carbon downstream, the buyer of airline seats, buys carbon. That’s incredibly important. Rather than trying to jam it all into the airline, make it where they can’t afford anything. Very important point. Okay? That’s what it looks like. That’s pretty exciting. That 2.3 billion gallons, if you’re doing simple math, we did 30 million gallon plants. That requires 70 new plants by 2035. That sounds like a lot of plants. Could we do that? Yeah, 70 is a lot. You know what?

That’s a targetable environment to deploy. These little markers are representing the 180 ethanol plants in the U.S. Lots and lots of opportunity. Let’s go back here and point out, for each site, it generates about $100 million of EBITDA outside of our boundary, or $30 million of regional impact, 400 to 600 jobs. It’s important for rural economic development. Remember, ethanol demand is predicted to be flat or declining. Corn production without increasing land is increasing. We’re going to be a billion bushels more corn produced this year than people expected. What happens? What do you do? You’ve got to find new uses. Energy security is a huge issue. The Trump administration wants energy security, wants economical hydrocarbon products. Guess what? We check all the boxes. That’s what we do. It’s pretty interesting. We can evade carbon too and satisfy that need for the marketplace.

A little bit different game. The executive order does specifically mention ethanol in the aviation field. That’s still different. What we’re doing over here, our puzzle pieces are saying you have to actually know a lot. You have to know how to do agriculture and processing and sell protein and sell to animals, sell, do the chemistry. You have to sell carbon. You have to sequester carbon. It’s actually a lot. When people ask, why don’t those big oil companies do it? They don’t have agriculture. Why don’t the agriculture companies do it? They don’t know how to do hydrocarbons. We do. This is what we’ve done for the last, me, 30 years. Now we’re at a point where the market seems to care about it. We can finally pin down the value in the marketplace and get on it. For instance, we’ll build ATJ plants. It’s a targetable environment.

We use, we’re going to call it Project North Star up there in North Dakota. Get that thing optimized, get it, get you improved the cash flow, and then we’ll build an ATJ plant, ATJ 30, and then we’ll cut and paste them. Now we’re going to have to build these things differently than doing a stick-built project finance. I don’t believe in that model. I don’t like that model. I think it makes everybody rich but us. What we’re going to do is build it in a factory in modules. We’re going to make modules in a factory, okay? Truck-sized modules that these modules can then be tested, validated, proven that they work. It de-risks them from an execution standpoint. The wells are, you know they work. We know the electronics work. We can put them on a ship.

In this case, we’ll ship them to Duluth, Minnesota, put them on a truck, and drive them over to North Dakota. That’ll sell them like Legos with more regional builders rather than having some giant lump sum turnkey EPC project. They’re doing that. That puts all the money in the EPC project guy’s hands, right? If we’re doing them in a factory, guess what? It’s a freaking factory. We can build more than one plant at once if we want. Our key task then is to continue to generate the cash flow, improve the cash flow up there in North Dakota, Project North Star, and expand capacity, expand, learn how to sell more carbon, learn how to sequester more. Carbon is important for enhanced oil recovery as well. There’s a demand up in the bucket for that. Cool.

We’re going to go figure that out too, because I don’t care who buys my CO2 as long as I get paid for it. I don’t care where it goes, right? All I care is what we make more money.

Unidentified speaker: You’ll lower it to what?

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I have no idea how that’ll work, how they’ll account for it. We’ll do it as just a transfer. If you want to buy my tons, pay me.

Unidentified speaker: Okay, sounds good.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: You get more oil out of it.

Unidentified speaker: Yeah.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah.

Unidentified speaker: I don’t know that.

All right. Joseph, when you want to build these ATJ plant designs, do you consider whether to put them off in these areas?

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: No, we don’t need to, because it’s just a drop-in fuel. Put it in the rail car and ship it to wherever. There’s a limit to a number of trips. These are true drop-ins. That’s one of the things about when I’m talking about hydrocarbons, literally drop-in products. It’s not a surprise. Techniques we’re using. Jet fuel is made this way in the petrochemical industry from old. It’s no surprise that it’s going to be straightforward. People talk about it as magic. This is one of the things that gets on my nerves in our industry. Ooh, I got the greatest special sauce. I call it bullshit. Sorry. It’s not. You can’t do things that are big with all this foofy stuff. It’s got to be stuff that’s tried and true and proven. That’s where we land. We just happen to have a, I don’t know, pragmatic point of view.

I’ll add it to the work. No kidding, what we’re going to do: grow our EBITDA, deploy the first plant, and that really comes down to how we’re going to finance that plant. That’s what it really is going to come down to. How do we make it reproducible? I’m not interested in being a one-trip pony. One plant, and that’s all we do. That’d be serious underachieving. That’s not what we want. Got to have a reproducible model to be deployed over and over and over again. That requires both the execution of how you build plants, but then the financing of those plants. That’s the topics all around the world. We do have projects around the world. We just don’t talk about them. Now, I could take questions.

Unidentified speaker: Just one question, Pat. If you look at the businesses that exist today and are now generating cash, if you unpack this a little bit for investors, you got the cash-generating businesses. Talk a little bit about those in the bar chart. What is the opportunity to develop and grow those? How should investors think about those, the R&D, the ethanol, the carbon, and then we can touch a bit on the SaaS.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah, so what we’ll be doing is, remember we just took over this plant. The previous owners of the plant didn’t, that wasn’t in their wheelhouse to monetize carbon value. We come along, it’s an uplift of $60 million. Okay? That’s the time to do that. It was a non-trivial thing to do because you’ve got to get it all audited, validated, certified by people, and then insured. That’s what we did. That’s why other people haven’t done it yet. We’ve been the first to do this. We see that growing, and that’s pretty much certainty about how the system works by increasing the ethanol production incrementally and by how carbon exposure is calculated by the vehicle built. We see that. The next one, first just starting at the bottom of the chart of the things that are blue. The next one is about the CDRs.

That market is interesting because people have never been offered something where it’s like, look, there’s a meter. You can watch the tons go down the hole. It’s unequivocal. It’s not somebody planted a tree somewhere, and I hope it’s good. It went down the hole. It’s a carbon removal credit. So it’s a gold standard. That’s why Carolyn Romero certified it. That’s why NASDAQ bought it. That’s why. Yeah, it’s not pushing all around you, I’m not even going to deny it.

Unidentified speaker: I understand.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: You have to push everybody. I’m sure you covered every single person.

Unidentified speaker: Did you guys, you know, anyone that asked about me changing the name?

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah.

Unidentified speaker: Okay.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I’ll leave that up to you guys.

Unidentified speaker: We will make it clear that we’re still trading under Gevo and GEVO. We are undergoing a transition to the new name.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I still use the company description that I have too.

Unidentified speaker: Which one did you choose?

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah, let me make sure that’s.

Unidentified speaker: Yes, that’s fine.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: That’s okay?

Unidentified speaker: Yeah.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: If I look.

Unidentified speaker: It’s a very short one. Yeah, it’s for him to announce.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah, this one is.

Unidentified speaker: Okay.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: I have a few questions, but I’ll jump in. Let’s just run with anything that comes up, yeah?

Unidentified speaker: Yeah, those ones we submitted.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah.

Unidentified speaker: We like those ones.

Sean Severson, CEO and founder, Water Tower Research: Yeah, I love it.

Tallgrass Energy said this week that its repurposed Trailblazer natural gas line will now carry CO₂ from ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa to a sequestration site in Wyoming.
Alongside the launch, Tallgrass is contributing $500,000 to the Trailblazer Community Investment Fund, managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation.
“It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.
Jeff Yost, president and CEO of the Nebraska Community Foundation, said the fund will target pressing challenges in rural areas.","Tallgrass Energy is set to launch its $1.5 billion Trailblazer CO₂ pipeline across Nebraska, linking ethanol plants to Wyoming storage.

A $1.5 billion carbon dioxide pipeline is preparing to begin operations across Nebraska, with developers also rolling out a community benefits program tied directly to the project, according to the Nebraska Examiner.

Tallgrass Energy said this week that its repurposed Trailblazer natural gas line will now carry CO₂ from ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa to a sequestration site in Wyoming. The system stretches 392 miles through Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa and Wyoming, with initial shipments expected soon from the first of 11 ethanol plants connected to the network.

Alongside the launch, Tallgrass is contributing $500,000 to the Trailblazer Community Investment Fund, managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation. Over the next decade, the fund is expected to distribute more than $7 million to support rural organizations in 31 counties, including early childhood programs, elder care facilities, and food pantries.

The program was negotiated in partnership with Bold Nebraska, an advocacy group that had previously opposed the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Jane Kleeb, Bold Nebraska’s founder, said the deal shows that rural communities “deserve to benefit from the projects that impact them — whether that’s sharing in profits, investing in social services, or simply having a seat at the project’s decision-making table,” as reported by the Nebraska Examiner.

Tallgrass officials say the pipeline is designed to lower the carbon intensity of ethanol, potentially boosting its role in new markets such as sustainable aviation fuel. “It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.

Looking Ahead: Funding the $4.5 Trillion Net-Zero Gap The energy transition requires trillions of dollars in funding by 2050.","Macquarie Asset Management has closed a $3 billion fund to speed up the global energy transition. The fund, called Macquarie Green Energy Transition Solutions (MGETS), exceeded its original target after strong demand from investors. The money will support projects that cut greenhouse gas emissions and build a cleaner energy system.

More than 65% of the fund is already committed. Early investments target renewable energy storage, sustainable fuels, carbon capture, and electric transport systems. By backing both proven and emerging solutions, Macquarie shows that climate-focused investing is now central to its strategy.

Where the Billions Are Going

MGETS is designed to finance infrastructure and technology that reduces carbon. This includes battery energy storage, distributed renewable power, clean transportation, and sustainable fuels. It also covers carbon capture, recycling, and circular economy projects.

So far, the fund has backed 12 projects. These include Eku Energy, a UK-based battery storage platform; SkyNRG, a Dutch producer of sustainable aviation fuel; and Verkor, a French maker of EV batteries. These examples show the fund’s focus on areas where emissions are hardest to cut.

The fund also targets low-carbon technologies that are still developing, such as green hydrogen, carbon capture, and advanced batteries. These solutions are not yet scaled up, but early capital is needed to drive progress and lower costs.

Investing in these technologies carries risks. Costs are high, and technical barriers remain. But the long-term growth potential is strong. As countries and companies set net-zero targets, demand for these technologies will increase. Macquarie is positioning itself as a leader by supporting both current infrastructure and future innovations.

Key Features of the Fund

Here are some of the fund’s highlights:

Fund size: $3 billion

Focus: Energy transition projects

Sectors: Renewable power, grid upgrades, clean fuels, storage, and clean transport

Scope: Developed and emerging markets worldwide

Structure: Mix of equity and debt financing

Goal: Cut emissions and support net-zero pathways

Investors: Global institutions such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds

This flexible structure allows the fund to support both large-scale projects and smaller ventures that need growth funding.

The Investor Surge: Why Demand Exceeded Expectations

The strong demand for MGETS highlights how fast climate finance is growing. Pension funds, insurers, and sovereign wealth funds see the energy transition as both a duty and an opportunity. They can back low-carbon infrastructure while earning stable returns.

The fund also shows how investment is expanding beyond solar and wind. Macquarie is putting money into enablers of the transition, such as grid flexibility, carbon storage, and clean fuels.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts global energy investment will hit a record $3.3 trillion in 2025, led by clean energy technologies. Of this, $2.2 trillion will go to renewables, nuclear, and energy storage — about double the amount slated for fossil fuels. Solar power could attract $450 billion, while battery storage investment rises to around $66 billion.

According to the IEA, global clean energy investment could reach $4.5 trillion annually by 2030 if countries meet their climate goals. Funds like MGETS are meant to help close this gap.

Scaling Climate Impact: From Europe to the World

The launch of MGETS shows the scale of funding needed to meet climate targets. Private capital, alongside public funding, will be critical.

By committing $3 billion, Macquarie sets an example for other asset managers. The fund is also expected to attract co-investments and partnerships, expanding its impact far beyond its initial size.

Institutional Capital as a Climate Catalyst

Large investors are under pressure to align their portfolios with climate goals. They are looking for opportunities that combine stable returns with measurable impact. MGETS offers one way to do this.

Macquarie is not alone. BlackRock and Brookfield have also raised multi-billion-dollar energy transition funds. Together, these efforts show how finance is becoming a key driver of climate action.

Separately, a venture capital alliance overseeing $60 billion in assets has launched a $300 million fund to support climate-tech startups. Called the “All Aboard Coalition,” the fund aims to help firms scale from pilot to commercial stage.

It aims to close what’s known as the “valley of death” in clean technology. Backers include Breakthrough Energy, Khosla Ventures, and DCVC. This move comes amid a multi-year drop in climate-tech investments and seeks to restore funding momentum in the sector.

Opportunities vs. Risks: Navigating the Transition

The opportunities are clear. Demand for clean power, EVs, and smart grids will rise over the next decade. Technologies that reduce emissions will become more profitable as rules tighten and companies aim for net zero.

But there are risks. Some technologies are costly or unproven. Policy changes, such as shifts in subsidies or carbon pricing, can affect returns. Large projects also face hurdles with permits, supply chains, or local opposition. Climate risks such as extreme heat, flooding, or storms can also impact assets directly. Macquarie will need to manage these challenges carefully.

Early Momentum and Global Reach

Despite these risks, the fund has momentum. With over 65% already invested, Macquarie is moving fast. Current projects are based in the UK, France, and the Netherlands, but the fund plans to operate globally.

The name “Green Energy Transition Solutions” reflects its broad focus. It is not only about generating clean power but also about enabling systems that cut emissions across industries.

Looking Ahead: Funding the $4.5 Trillion Net-Zero Gap

The energy transition requires trillions of dollars in funding by 2050. This growth will continue, with more money flowing to energy storage, carbon capture, and clean transport.

Corporate net-zero pledges also create demand. Over 6,000 companies worldwide have set science-based climate targets. In 2023, companies with SBTi-approved climate targets made up 39% of global market value, rising to 41% in 2024. These businesses also grew faster than the wider economy, with market value increasing 16%, compared to 11% growth in global GDP.

This adds pressure on supply chains and energy providers to cut emissions. Financial players like Macquarie are stepping in to provide both funding and expertise.

Macquarie’s $3 billion fund is part of a much larger movement. To keep global warming to 1.5°C, clean energy investment must rise sharply over the next decade. Funds like MGETS can help connect technology developers, infrastructure operators, and investors.

The success of the fund will depend on two things: financial returns and real carbon reductions. If Macquarie delivers on both, it could attract more capital and inspire others to follow. That would speed up the world’s shift to a low-carbon economy.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2393182905.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 14:56:09.681144

The company confirmed that its Chief Executive Officer, Jimmy Samartzis, delivered a keynote address in front of key dignitaries, including Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, the President of Kazakhstan, and Askhat Khasenov, Chairman and CEO of KMG. The announcement was made during New York Climate Week, marking a symbolic moment as both companies signed a major agreement to progress Kazakhstan’s first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project. This will also be the first time LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology will be deployed in the Central Asian region.

The collaboration between LanzaJet and KMG has already completed an extensive feasibility study, which assessed the potential for SAF production in the country. Building upon this, both parties have now agreed to move forward into the next crucial stage: the Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) phase. During FEED, detailed technical, engineering, and financial solutions for the proposed facility will be developed. This stage will ensure the plant is optimally designed and economically viable, paving the way for its eventual construction and operation.

Kazakhstan, with its diverse and resource-rich economy, provides fertile ground for a project of this scale. Speaking about the potential impact, Jimmy Samartzis emphasized that Kazakhstan offers opportunities across agriculture, logistics, aviation, and the oil and gas industries, making it a strong hub for innovation in sustainable fuels. He added that the collaboration would not only help reduce aviation emissions but would also stimulate economic growth and enhance regional energy security.

Echoing these sentiments, KMG’s CEO Askhat Khasenov described the SAF initiative as a cornerstone project for the nation’s low-carbon strategy. He highlighted that this cooperation would strengthen bilateral ties, promote the use of advanced technologies, and stimulate the development of Kazakhstan’s biofuels market. Moreover, it is expected to bring lasting benefits such as improved environmental performance within aviation, a stronger transit position for the country, and alignment with international climate goals.

The agreement signifies more than just a technical milestone. It represents Kazakhstan’s strategic push towards becoming a leader in low-carbon energy solutions within Central Asia. As aviation continues to face mounting pressure to decarbonize, projects like this demonstrate tangible progress in addressing both regional and global demand for cleaner fuels.

With immediate work beginning on the FEED phase, the project is positioned to move quickly toward realization. Once operational, it is anticipated to meet the growing demand for SAF within Kazakhstan, which is projected to reach around 70,000 tonnes annually by 2030. This milestone not only underscores Kazakhstan’s commitment to sustainability but also cements LanzaJet’s role as a pivotal partner in shaping the future of aviation fuel.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-25 13:56:39.758343

Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is seeking to broaden its cargo network as the ongoing US-China trade dispute reshapes global supply chains, but volumes through the hub remain resilient, according to Fred Lam, chairman of the Airport Authority of Hong Kong.

Speaking at Routes World 2025 in Hong Kong, Lam said the city is adapting to changing trade flows while retaining its position as one of the world’s busiest freight gateways.

“We still see growth for the entire airport cargo sector [despite the US-China trade dispute]; we have seen very strong growth now to Europe, to the Middle East and also to South-East Asia and Australia,” he said.

Lam added that the changing trade environment and the importance of diversifying air cargo markets would be a “major shift” for airports such as his going forward.

“The impact from the tariffs is not going away soon,” he said.

The US-China trade conflict, now into its sixth year, has driven manufacturers and exporters to seek alternative routes and destinations for their goods.

While some cargo previously bound for the US has been redirected, Hong Kong has benefitted from strong demand in other regions, particularly Europe and Southeast Asia.

Hong Kong is also serving as a transit point for cargo that is bound for the US, but from markets that have replaced China, such as India, Lam said.

Hong Kong serves as a global cargo hub

The city’s extensive connectivity within the region and further afield, and its mature and highly integrated logistics ecosystem, mean it can weather the shocks of a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.

Lam also pointed to the potential for greater import growth into Hong Kong and mainland China, as the country and its special administrative region pivots toward a more consumption-driven economy.

“We feel that the government in China will continue to encourage consumption,” said Lam.

“At the moment, in our total trade portfolio, two thirds is exports, and only one third is imports. We believe there’s a lot of potential for us to encourage more imports into Hong Kong, This is an area where we can do a lot more,” he said.

HKIA took the top place in the 2024 ranking of the world’s busiest cargo airports compiled by Airports Council International (ACI) World.

The airport has been named the busiest cargo airport in the world for the fourteenth time since 2010. The airport handled 4.9 million tonnes of cargo during 2024.

In August, the latest month for which figures have been released, cargo volumes saw a year-on-year increase of 5.6% to 429,000 tonnes.

This was mainly driven by sustained traffic to and from Europe and the Middle East, which offset declines in traffic to and from North America under the lingering tariff impacts.

The growth was underpinned by a 13.5% increase in transshipments (those shipments that use Hong Kong as a stopping point between origin and destination).

Over the first eight months of 2025, cargo traffic grew 2.6% year on year to 3.3 million tonnes.

On a 12-month rolling basis, cargo throughput grew 5% year on year to 5 million tonnes.

The airport authority has been investing heavily in infrastructure to sustain its role as a leading air cargo hub.

SAF Funding | Cleared for Takeoff?

Bill Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures recently unveiled a $150 million sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) fund aimed at accelerating the adoption of low-carbon jet fuels. The initiative, which includes strategic investments from Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, seeks to address one of SAF’s biggest hurdles: cost competitiveness.

While U.S. producers benefit from production-side incentives like the 45Z, LCFS and the Renewable Fuel Standard, the absence of enforceable national blend mandates or buyer-side subsidies continues to limit market uptake. As a result, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of U.S. jet fuel consumption. Breakthrough’s SAF fund demonstrates some airlines’ willingness to support alternative fuels, creating demand signals that could broaden industry participation.

The fund is technology-agnostic but prioritizes technologies that can compete on cost with conventional jet fuel. It excludes fuels from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids, which account for over 95% of the current U.S. SAF supply, due to concerns over feedstock limitations and scalability.

While certain synthetic SAF pathways offer higher potential revenue per gallon when supplemented by credits, they remain hampered by capital intensity and commercial immaturity. Still, new synthetic and alcohol-to-jet SAF projects are slated to come online later this decade, potentially expanding the market for emerging technologies supported by this fund (Figure 1).

The A330neo-based evolution of the combat-proven, aerial refuelling and transport aircraft A330 MRTT, will be equipped with both the hose-and-drogue, and a boom, as refuelling systems. Also included is the Airbus Medical Evacuation kit solution and will come in a VVIP cabin configuration.

The aircraft is scheduled to enter into military conversion at the A330 MRTT Centre in Getafe, Spain, in 2026, with final delivery to customer in 2029.

“Thailand’s selection of the A330 MRTT+ underlines the trust placed in this platform, while embracing the next evolution in efficiency, capability and sustainability. This natural evolution of the A330 MRTT, which will be a key asset for the Royal Thai Air Force operations, builds on its proven performance over the past years in service with nine customers all over the world, accumulating more than 340,000 flight hours,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Air Power at Airbus Defence and Space.

This strategic addition to the RTAF fleet marks a significant step in bolstering Thailand’s national defence, and enhancing its ability to respond effectively during crises, ensuring the safety and security of the Kingdom. The A330 MRTT+’s advanced capabilities will be instrumental in securing Thailand’s sovereignty, providing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR), and supporting Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) missions.

Launched at the 2024 Farnborough Airshow, the A330 MRTT+ introduces innovations from the A330-800 commercial airliner, including Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, optimised aerodynamics and wing-tips. These deliver up to 8% lower fuel burn and reduced noise. An increased maximum take-off weight of 242 tonnes (up from 233 tonnes) further extends range, increases fuel offload capacity, and enhances operational flexibility.

Retaining 95% airframe commonality with the current A330 MRTT fleet, the A330 MRTT+ ensures a common training process and access to a robust global maintenance network.

The A330 MRTT is cleared to refuel more than 25 aircraft types. Holding more than 90% of market share outside the US, the A330 MRTT has been ordered by Australia, Canada, France, NATO’s Multinational MRTT Fleet (MMF), Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. To date a total of 85 aircraft have been ordered by 11 customers.

In parallel with this new order, Airbus will further strengthen its collaboration with Thai Aviation Industries (TAI). Both companies have signed an expanded Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to include in-country maintenance support for the RTAF’s A330 MRTT+. This expansion builds on the existing cooperation for the sustainment of C295 transport aircraft in Thailand.

The expanded MoU also marks an important step in Airbus’ long-term strategy to align with the Kingdom’s “Make in Thailand” policy. By expanding TAI’s scope of activities to include A330 MRTT+ maintenance and in-service support, Airbus will support the Royal Thai Armed Forces in increasing self-reliance for critical operational needs, while contributing to local capability building.

“Through our partnership with TAI, Airbus is committed to transferring skills, know-how, and technology to further develop aerospace capabilities in Thailand,” added Jean-Brice Dumont. “This expanded MoU with TAI ensures that the RTAF’s A330 MRTT+ will be maintained in-country, while also reinforcing our contribution to Thailand’s defence ecosystem and industrial growth.”",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102499/749880-uo01jnfhss-preview.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 11:57:56.239686

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, I think many people would maybe push back first the word waste there.
Peter Reinhardt: That’s right, and there’s some geographical diversity to that, so we can get further into the nuance here.
I worked in the carbon market world, the voluntary carbon market world, like geez, 15 years ago now, and the legacy carbon offset world is a disaster in my opinion.
Thanks for talking through ag residue and carbon removal with me, but appreciate the time.","Agricultural byproducts like corn stover, wood chips, and soybean husks typically get left to decompose and release carbon dioxide. Don’t call them “waste” though; some farmers use these byproducts as field cover to improve soil health. And industry uses a fraction of this biomass as feedstock for valuable products like ethanol, electricity, and heat. Theoretically, it’s a vastly underutilized resource.

The problem is that agricultural residue is really hard to collect. The economics of gathering, sorting, processing, and refining are tough. On top of that, it makes for a crappy fuel. It’s low energy density and high carbon, compared to oil, for example.

So in what applications does agricultural residue make the most sense? And how do you economically collect the material at scale?

In this episode, Shayle talks to Peter Reinhardt, co-founder and CEO of Charm Industrial, a carbon removal startup that collects agricultural residue and refines it in the field into what it calls “bio-oil.” It then injects the bio-oil underground for sequestration. Together, Peter and Shayle discuss the use cases and collection of agricultural residue, covering topics like:

How the difficult economics of collecting and transporting biomass have killed centralized biomass projects, except in a few niche examples

Why Peter says the processing and densification are key to improving the economics

The tradeoffs between big, centralized processing facilities and Charm’s on-field mobile pyrolysis units

The case for using agricultural residue for applications where the carbon content matters, like iron-making, sustainable aviation fuel, and carbon removal

Shayle Kann: I’m Shayle Kann and this is Catalyst.

Peter Reinhardt: If you looked at, for example, at our woodchips that we process in Colorado where we’re getting in these forest fire prevention thinnings, if we were to stand there and look at it, you’d be like, this is pretty consistent material visually. It’s not like, oh, this is all over the place. But nonetheless, you can still get edge cases. You can get a rock that was randomly stuck in a branch or you can get people talk about a bale that had a handgun in it.

Shayle Kann: Coming up we’re talking ag residue, wood chips and carbon removal of Peter Reinhardt.

I am Shayle Kann. I invest in early stage companies at Energy Impact Partners. Welcome. So here’s the cycle. We humans grow crops. A lot of them because there are a lot of us, those crops contain carbon that has been sucked up from the atmosphere. Mostly they’re either consumed or burned to produce energy, but along the way a lot, really, a lot of them, parts of most of every plant that we grow actually are wasted, so to speak. There was a DOE study a couple of years ago that estimated the amount of ag residue alone that’s a subset of this category at around 200 million dry tons per year. So those ones generally decompose, of course releasing greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere. But what if they didn’t? There’s a whole class of ideas around utilizing that so-called waste biomass, either to displace something else that might generate greenhouse gases like fuels or just locking it up so that the CO2 is never released into the atmosphere in the first place.

The latter category is what charm industrial has focused on. Charm turns waste biomass into what they call biooil and then injects it back underground to be stored for thousands of years. Peter Reinhardt, who is the founder and CEO of Charm, is a friend of mine and I’ve always thought came into this space with a refreshing perspective. Prior to Charm, he was a wildly successful software founder. He founded the company, Segment, which was acquired for over 3 billion by Twilio in 2020. So he has this startup experience and actually carbon removal buyers experience, but this was his first foray, a charm into hard tech, into carbon markets as a producer into the realities of waste biomass. So that’s what I wanted to talk to him about, what he’s learned out there in the fields, what works, what’s hard, and where we are in the carbon removal markets. Here’s Peter. Peter, welcome. Thanks for having me. Alright, give me a tour of ag waste to start. Where is it? What is it? How much of it is there? Just give me the quick high level.

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, I think many people would maybe push back first the word waste there. For the most part, when you have ag residues, it’s mostly things that are unutilized or very underutilized, and so in some sense there’s waste there, but really I would think of it as sort of extremely underutilized and has a lot of value maybe that is going to waste or getting lost. But there’s an enormous amount in the United States, which maybe is where we can focus for now. Just corn stover for example. Obviously concentrated in the Midwest and particularly the northern part of the Midwest, and there’s about 90, 95 million acres of corn grown in the US every year. Just order magnitude for dry tons of stover per year on each of those acres. And so you’re just on corn stove, you’re looking at 400 megatons of ag residues that don’t really get used. They just rot on the field and return to the atmosphere.

Shayle Kann: What is stover actually on this cornstalk? What is the stover and then I think you just answered this question, but in a default scenario, corn is harvested, the stover just continues to sit on the field and eventually decomposes. That’s what happens to it.

Peter Reinhardt: That’s right, and there’s some geographical diversity to that, so we can get further into the nuance here. But the stover itself is the stalks, the leaves, depending on the harvest method, you may actually have cobs in the mix too. So it’s everything basically kind of minus the kernels because the kernels are really where the value lies, whether it’s animal feed stock or human consumption or high fructose corn syrup or ethanol. The kernels is really what we grow corn for today, but the actual practices around what happens to that stover are very pretty widely. There are a few places where it’s used for cellulosic ethanol production, but it’s really tiny that’s never really taken off. And as you get sort of farther north, you can have very moist soils that hold a lot of water, and as you get farther north, those will sometimes stay frozen deep into the spring when they actually need to plant it. So depending on the place, there can be quite different practices, actually on around whether you need to remove it so that you can actually plant in the spring and not be dealing with frozen soil or in other places, where actually say the Great Plains in Western Kansas and Colorado where you actually want to keep it on because more of it on because it’s going to help retain the soil moisture, which is a huge problem there. So there’s geographic diversity to that.

Shayle Kann: Yeah, I mean I have a feeling a lot of this part of the conversation is going to be like there is no uniformity in general, and that’s one of the challenges with doing anything at scale with ag residue. I’ll stop saying waste because you’re even just talking about specifically corn stover and that’s going to be different from almond shells in California from whatever soybean husks or whatever else it is from a practical standpoint, I mean, okay, so let’s view ag as a resource. It should be a resource, it has value, it has various things you could do with it, and we’re going to talk about highest best use, but one of the things that you and I have talked about a little bit that I think you have insight into that people don’t often appreciate is just the practical challenge of aggregation and utilization of that resource. Talk me through what does it take? Say you want it to do something, forget what you’re doing with it, say you want to do something with it at scale, what does that actually entail?

Peter Reinhardt: There is, again, some diversity depending on the residue, but if we stick with corn stover for a second and say you want to use the corn stover somewhere, typically you’re not going to be able to use it on the field. Typically, if you’re going to take some portion of it, whether that’s 70% or 30% depending on the sort of agricultural zone that you’re in, you need to get it off the field. And so there’s actually a lot of steps to get the biomass off the field in a sort of usable format at a usable distance, where typically people are building centralized plants, and so that actually dominates the cost of the biomass, which is something that we’re trying to invert this a charm by eventually operating on field to cut this all out. But let’s say you have a field that’s all laid flat, a forage harvester came through and cut it all down, now you need to first windrow it into a pile, then you’re going to bale it.

Then once you have bales, you’re going to bring a machine that’s going to stack the bales and bring ’em over to the edge of the field where put ’em in piles, and then you’re going to need something like telehandler to load it onto a truck and they need to drive the truck and they need to unload the truck. And so every one of those pieces equipment is a big CapEx piece and opex to run. You need people to actually do every step of that labor. So it’s a huge portion of the cost structure. So if you’re looking at getting corn stover, say, delivered to Abengoa Hugoton was a huge cellulosic ethanol plant that failed in Western Kansas because they were transporting their biomass 50 to a hundred miles. They expected to pay maybe $60 a ton. They found in fact that they were paying north of $120 a ton, and the actual dollars that were getting delivered to the farmer for the stover that they had was maybe in the low tens of dollars and all the rest of it was bundled up in the consolidation and transport of the biomass. So it’s quite an operation to do it and requires specialized equipment for each different type of feedstock as well. So it’s quite complicated and there’s some companies that do an incredible job of this, like Pacific Ag has a large operation in the panhandle kind of region. But yeah, it’s tough,

Shayle Kann: Isn’t it? Also when you talk about dollars per ton, things in delivered biomass world get priced in dollars per bone, dry ton, but actually the part of the problem also is that what you’re getting off the field is not one ton is not one bone dry ton, and so there’s more material.

Peter Reinhardt: It gets both ways. It gets priced both ways.

Shayle Kann: There’s no standard there, but I guess, well, the bigger point is part of the cost that’s loaded in there is that either you’re transporting something that has partial value, some piece of the stuff that you’re transporting is actually valuable and another piece of it is not. And so you’re carrying dead weight along with you, or you have to go process it before you transport it, in which case there’s a different piece of capital equipment that you need at the site in order to avoid transporting this stuff that is waterlogged or has whatever other stuff in it.

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, that’s true. The water content of stover dries on the field pretty effectively into the 15 to 20% range. So you’re not carrying that much water. I mean there is water in there, but the thing that kills you on the transport or more than the dead weight there is actually the volume. So when you’re trying to transport stover, you cube out, meaning volumetrically, you run out of space a lot faster than you weigh out. And I mean that’s why you see these insane trailers where it’s coming out all over the place trying to haul the biomass, the volume just literally you can’t fit it all in there, so fluffy. So from a cost perspective, at least for corn stover that dominates, but for wood is quite different. Actually wood can easily be 50% water if it’s young growth and hasn’t aged for a year post cutting. So when you look at wildfire thinnings, for example, oftentimes we get wood that’s in the 50% range and there, yeah, it sucks because half what you’re transporting is useless.

Shayle Kann: Right. What about heterogeneity? I mean, I think also this probably depends what you want to do with it. There’s probably some things that you can do with it that are going to be super sensitive to heterogeneity in the actual feedstock and other things that won’t be. But how big an issue is that in general?

Peter Reinhardt: It’s an issue, but it’s an issue because you encounter edge cases at volume as opposed to it being like if you looked at, for example, at our woodchips that we process in Colorado where we’re getting in these, taking this stuff from forest fire prevention, thinnings, that the Colorado State Forest Service and US Forest Service are running and we work with the forestry contractors, they would power burn this stuff. Otherwise they send this sort of thinning material to us, which nominally should have a lot of heterogeneity to it because effectively a waste product that they would have to burn if we were to stand there and look at it, you’d be like, this is pretty consistent material visually. It’s not like, oh, this is all over the place, but nonetheless, you can still get edge cases. You can get a rock that was randomly stuck in a branch, or you can get people talk about bale that had a handgun in it.

It happens. And so if you’re processing it at scale, you do have to have things in place to ensure that that doesn’t happen. But it’s the exception. The heterogeneity is problematic in its exceptions as opposed to some sort of continuous variability. Variability in moisture content is interesting. That can really affect processes. And so having strong controls around drying or measurement of moisture content or depending on your process, the form factor of the actual material going into a biomass processing system can matter a lot, right? Like aspect ratio, a long twig often is way more problematic than the same amount of mass in a well-rounded chip just because you can create bridges and other things like that and equipment.

Shayle Kann: So okay. If we want to, let’s just assume that we as a society or as entrepreneurs, whoever want to utilize this residue, let’s focus on ag residue here though. We could talk about wood chips or whatever else too. Let’s assume that we want to use it, it has some use. What are the things that you think then need to be true to make it work? In other words, I assume that basically the trade-off here is you can either do what the ethanol plant you described failed was trying to do, which is aggregate centralized, build a big centralized processing facility to go make something with it, and that you get the economies of scale on the processing facility. So that’s good because you want that, but you have to source from a wider aperture geographically, and so you end up paying these transport costs and logistics costs that kill you, or you do something at the edge, which I think is closer to what you’re doing because you then don’t have to do what the transport costs, but you trade off the economies of scale on the processing side. So how do you think about that balance?

Peter Reinhardt: In some sense, this is the fundamental thesis of charm, which is you can’t bring biomass to market in its broadly heterogeneous, highly distributed, fluffy, current existing capacity. You just can’t do it. It doesn’t work. People have tried it so many times and it just doesn’t work. So the things that do work today are when people have large centralized sources of biomass. That could be rice hulls coming out of a plant or it could be sawdust coming out of a plant. Those are the places where it works, but that’s a tiny fraction. It’s a tiny, tiny fraction of the total biomass. And so to your point, if you want to get it to scale, you do have to be able to go out into the field and convert it into some kind of format that actually is more homogeneous and transportable. And so that is basically the thesis of charm, which is can we take that material?

And instead of, people have tried pelleting, people have tried all these things, but the problem is your starting density is maybe like a hundred to 200 kilograms per meter cubed, and even if you get that up via pelleting to four or 500, 600, it’s still really, really hard. And so our fundamental thesis is can we go out into the field with pyrolysis equipment and consolidate that biomass by removing a bunch of stuff that isn’t useful? So sort of reducing the total mass to what is the useful component in oil and biochar and can we increase the density dramatically? So the density of oil is 1200 kilograms per meter cubed, so almost more than a 10 x in terms of consolidation. And so now actually you’re weighing out your tanker and you have a pumpable fluid instead of having to deal with moving around bales that are super fluffy. And so the sort of fundamental thesis there is like can you make it transportable and can you densify it such that the economics fundamentally change around your ability to centralize it for further processing or for consumption? So that’s our fundamental thesis with pyrolysis and people have tried a lot of other ways to do it, but we think this one will work.

Shayle Kann: How much do economies of scale matter on pyrolysis? Would it be the trade you’re making is you’re saying I’ll do a small pyrolysis unit, but in exchange for that I’ll get this density, I’ll drive down logistics costs and transportation costs and all these things that blow up the economics of every other use of waste biomass or I’m sorry, ag residue or whatever it is. Presumably you believe that to be the right trade to make, but how much of a trade off is it really if you were doing pyrolysis at a 10 x scale relative to what you are doing it at, would it be notably cheaper?

Peter Reinhardt: It can get notably cheaper up to a point. So we today operate two ton per day systems. It is significantly cheaper to operate like a 20 ton per day system, and that’s what we’re working towards is you’ll have basically the same amount of labor operating something with 10 times the throughput, maybe 15 times the throughput, and you get a lot of leverage out of that. You start to see some economies on top of that. When you go beyond, we think that sort of equipment, farm equipment form factor, when you start moving away from a mobile piece of equipment into a fixed facility, you do get some economies of the construction, but you actually take on a lot more risk in every facility that you build. You have all the balance of plant, you have permitting, you have just more risk, you’re going to build many fewer of them and each one is going to be uniquely sized.

And so there’s actually, I think you actually break the unity economics in some sense break and jump beyond that mobile form factor. And that’s part of our thesis is how much throughput can we jam into a large combine kind of form factor is what we’re ultimately going to be shooting for. And we think that there’s great economics and continuing to push that throughput. But if we look at the CapEx for example, of our system today on a dollars CapEx per ton basis and compare it to say state-of-the-art pyrolysis facilities, we are already less than half of that cost on a dollar per CapEx basis, and that will decline drastically as we increase the throughput. So that’s where you would expect to see the most economy there in labor. And we already are realizing an economy relative to where you would expect to see an economy and through this concept of mass production, the other place where you’d expect to see economy is on the labor side. And I think we won’t beat that aside from through automation and reliability that just requires fewer people over time per machine. But the CapEx thing is surprising to me actually when I went and ran those numbers, I was surprised that we were already under the CapEx per ton.

Shayle Kann: Is that a function of the pyrolysis market is not enormous and it’s not the most mature in the world, is it just in part there has been room for innovation not totally optimized?

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, it’s also the case that there are some processes that benefit drastically from sort of a surface area to volume change. A lot of these world scale chemical plants have massive volumes inside their reactors, and so as they scale up the sort of metal cost, physical metal cost of the reactive vessel is declining because the surface area to volume ratio is declining. I think that there are some process, I think pyrolysis in some senses is less influenced by that because you’re sort of putting heat in and taking heat out and so you almost have a surface area to surface area scaling law. So maybe also the pyrolysis is somewhat unique relative to other chemical processes.

Shayle Kann: All right, so let’s assume you can get your ag residue, you can get your biomass off the field. You can do it in a manner that is sufficiently dense and that is economic to do something with. And the next question then is, okay, so what should we do with it? What’s the highest and best use? So I know you have opinions on this, but talk me through I guess to start the suite of options. What are the things you think of as being potential uses for that biomass once you get it off the field?

Peter Reinhardt: Historically, biomass has been primarily used for industrial heat sort of alongside an existing plant or for electricity production in some cases, or for car fuel production like ethanol. These are not actually very good uses for biomass. They don’t really take advantage of the best properties that biomass has. What really distinguishes biomass is not necessarily its energy content, which is actually quite low. So on a per kilogram basis, the energy content of biomass is about one third that of crude oil, so it’s pretty energy poor. What’s interesting about it is that relative to almost everything else, it’s very carbon rich and so the use cases that rely either on the chemical availability of carbon or on the sort of physical availability of carbon, those or in the case of carbon removal literally on the amount of carbon in there, those are the use cases actually that have the highest and best use over time.

So carbon removal is obviously the market that we have gone into first where we can do oil sequestration and pump the carbon underground in a liquid form. That’s actually a pretty high value use case for it directly monetizing the carbon embedded in the biomass. There are other use cases where the carbon is really critical from a chemical perspective, so these is things like iron making. When you reduce iron oxide to iron, you need carbon monoxide and you can use hydrogen, but it’s endothermic. So if you want to make it sort of work in a reliable basis, you probably need carbon monoxide. You need that carbon. Well, great. We have a carbon source, so iron making is a pretty compelling use case. Another one actually is SAF is jet fuel. We don’t have a lot of great dense energy carriers that can actually do long haul flights and there it is. So we’re probably for a long time going to need carbon there. So those are some of the cases made. Asphalt plastics, there’s a bunch of these places where the carbon isn’t integral part either of the being an energy carrier or being chemically involved in the process or structurally involved as an atomic element. Those are the places where and world Resources Institute would agree with this in their analysis I think, which is like that’s where we need the carbon and other use cases like car fuel are pretty poor economic fits.

Shayle Kann: Is your view on why historically we’ve used biomass as an energy source rather than a carbon source predominantly just a function of the market has been there for energy, the market has not really been there for the carbon stuff, certainly not for carbon removal. Historically, SAF is a relatively new thing. Is it just like a market maturity thing or is there some other reason why we’ve gone down the wrong road historically?

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, I think it’s a market maturity thing. I think also for the industrial heat and electricity use cases, often that’s when you have a concentrated flow of biomass and now

Shayle Kann: And you just want to cofi with something else and you might as well. It’s like buying down your total cost.

Peter Reinhardt: Yes, A facility owner is like, well, I have this thing, why don’t I use it? Whereas the sort of biomass that we’re talking about maybe is a different type of biomass, which is like, okay, but then there’s five gigatons of this stuff all over the world and it rots or burns today, which is a different, it’s a different, yeah,

Shayle Kann: Maybe they’re right. Probably the more accurate way to put it is that a lot of this stuff has not been used actually historically. It’s not that it’s been used for this other stuff to the extent that it has, if it’s being used to produce ethanol, we’ve sort of distorted a market into existence for ethanol that is tax credit driven predominantly, and so there’s an economic reason to do that that doesn’t speak to the underlying rationality of leveraging it for energy.

Peter Reinhardt: To be clear, there’s geopolitical reasons also to ensure that we have massive amounts of corn and food grown in the United States. It maybe gets more complicated than just what’s the highest and best use of biomass, but it, yes.

Shayle Kann: Okay, so I’ve seen the analysis too that basically suggests that look, okay, so let’s just assume we care about CO2 emissions. Let’s assume we care about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change in general. Then if you look at biomass, if you look at waste biomass, clearly if you could do it cheaply enough, the highest and best use of it is carbon removal. You just get the most bang for your buck even over the other things that leverage the carbon SAF or whatever else, which is where you guys have started. The question then is less, I think in my mind, what is the highest and best use of the material, and rather what is the market for that, right? Which is the sort of underlying question in CDR. So I want to transfer to talking about that a little bit. Been a kind of, I think you’ve delivered more tons of permanent CDR than anybody else in the world, or at least that was true at one point.

And the other thing that I think you’ve done that has been interesting to me is that you’ve found a more diverse set of buyers for CDR than most other folks. I think listeners to this podcast probably know that if you just look at overall tons purchased in the CDR market, it’s basically Microsoft followed by an order of magnitude lower frontier, which is the Stripe Coalition, followed by a bunch of little minnows in relative terms. And so a lot of the CDR market to the extent that they have actually generally pre-sold tons as opposed to selling tons, which is you’ve done, that’s the buyer universe for them essentially. But you have found some others on that list. So just give me your overall take on how the CDR demand side has evolved and what your approach has been to finding those buyers.

Peter Reinhardt: I think I have a little bit of a unique perspective here also as an ex-buyer, the reason that I’m in this market at all is because previously built a software company called Segment, which sold in 2020, and along the way, we were trying to figure out how to offset our carbon or remove our carbon, and I was really pissed off at the quality of what was there. And so I come from a perspective of sitting in the buyer’s seat beyond the folks that have gotten really excited and have driven forward the carbon removal industry, the Stripes and Shopifys and Microsofts and Googles and Facebook sort of core tech group. Beyond that, I feel a little bit of some of the pain that the broader market has encountered in trying to buy offsets historically. I went through it and specifically my experience was I went and bought some offsets in Indonesian rainforest and the Amazon Rainforest and it was like 20K or something, and then I came back a year later and I was like, wait a second, what happened?

What happened when I bought those offsets? Is there any clarity of can I look up which acres exactly did I protect and did it have an impact? Is it still there? Then you see in the news the Amazon is on fire and you’re like, oh, shoot, maybe I need to go rebuy something. Did my protection totally fail here? And so the deeper that I got into that, the more I was like, this is bad. This is really bad. There’s no clarity on it, there’s no trail of evidence, there’s no FedEx style delivery history of what happened there. And so I think there’s a few things that have differentiated charm and appealing to a broader set of buyers. The first is extreme transparency. So you can go to the website and this comes from that experience. You can go to the website, charmindustrial.com/ledger, and you can see a complete history of every delivery you can click in and you can see where the biomass came from and so on.

I still think it’s a really crappy V zero. I want to get to a point where you can, when the DoorDash deliverer takes a picture of the food on your doorstep, every step of the process, I won’t have photo evidence of what happened and make that public. So that’s one thing that still is extremely differentiated. We’ve made a big point of it over the years, and I’ve tried to push other suppliers to do that, and for whatever reason it’s still differentiated. And so from a risk perspective, if you’re a buyer and you’ve been feeling all this risk of these junky offsets that you maybe got burned by, that’s a pretty different feel in the sort of broader market. And the other is just all the co-benefits associated with charms process. There are many other processes that are sort of arbitrage-y of delivering tons in a cheap fashion, that are real, but probably can’t get to climate scale. What’s different is not only can charm get to a very large scale due to the feedstocks that we’re going and getting access to, but the potential wildfire impacts the potential orphaned, well cleanup. There’s a bunch of things along the chain that I think are big co-benefits to human health and communities that buyers want to help support.

Shayle Kann: So is your view that there’s a significant volume of latent, I don’t know whether this is the right way to put it, but latent demand for CDR that has not been unlocked? Largely because one, a sort of lack of trust in the market, which I 100% agree with you. I worked in the carbon market world, the voluntary carbon market world, like geez, 15 years ago now, and the legacy carbon offset world is a disaster in my opinion. So there’s definitely some repair that needs to be done there, but so your view is that a combination of trust and co-benefits deliver this big wave of demand that we haven’t seen fully show up yet outside of just that core group? You said the tech companies, et cetera?

Peter Reinhardt: I think so.

Shayle Kann: And why? What are they driving toward? Is it net zero commitments that they’re trying to meet? What’s the underlying motivation for corporates at least, do you think?

Peter Reinhardt: I think our underlying motivation for corporates is impact, and they want to trust that that impact is actually happening in a measurable way and climate impact is great, but they also, if they can double dip simultaneously into having climate impact as well as health impact because there isn’t particulate coming out of a wildfire and into community impact because homes aren’t getting burnt down and into community impact because a well is getting cleaned up and it’s not spewing radioactive brine at the surface anymore or methane if their goal is having a positive impact with these kinds of purchases a lot more, right? There’s just more there on the bone as opposed to some other approaches often have trade-offs in this sense, whether that’s consuming a lot of power or other kinds of things where it’s like that can be less appealing.

Shayle Kann: Are there other categories of buyers that you think are likely to scale? I mean, I guess the way I think about it’s right now, it’s been the tech industry first and foremost, followed maybe by the financial sector where there have been a few buyers who have stepped like some of the big banks who’ve made some larger volume purchases. Is that the next big beach head for CDR?

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah, I’d say certainly. We started in high tech or technology, big software companies, ai, hyperscalers. We see a lot of activity in banking, financial services. We see a lot of activity in consulting, have a lot of consulting companies as customers, we’re starting to see more activity in advanced manufacturing, so that’s like aircraft, chips, pharmaceuticals. If you look at a sort of chart of profitability per ton or EBITDA per ton, it’s the companies that have a lot of EBITDA per ton that are going to lead the way on helping things down

Shayle Kann: Per ton of emissions, in this case, not per ton of removal, right? It’s like, yeah, how much money do they make? But it’s basically saying how hard is it for them to afford to purchase credits to offset a significant chunk of their emissions.

Peter Reinhardt: Yeah. I will say though that there are some companies that have done the analysis of, they’ve reduced all their obvious emissions in terms of just buying clean electricity and so on, and they’re getting down to the point where they’re like, hold on, it’s going to cost $2,000 a ton for me to go tear down a building and rebuild it with a proper HVAC system that does heat pumps and have clean concrete. At some point, you get down to this base baseload of amortized embodied emissions and things that are in the built structures, and it’s really hard and really expensive, and as they get down there, it’s like, well, maybe this is just cheaper to remove.

Shayle Kann: Alright, Peter, this was fun. Thanks for talking through ag residue and carbon removal with me, but appreciate the time.

Peter Reinhardt: Thanks for having me.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-25T093825.756.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 10:56:36.508150

Today, in the high-tech corridors of aviation and the carbon-accounting realities of ESG, we’ve lost sight of the truth that it takes more than evidence to propel change.

For the science of sustainability needs to be felt – through experience, through emotion, through human connection.

As we build the future of sustainable aviation, we need the fusion of imagination and evidence.

Because no matter how cutting-edge our solutions, ESG fatigue is real and it isn’t a failure of action, it’s a failure of imagination.

Experience is the antidote to apathy

The aviation sector faces a paradox: it is one of the most vital industries to decarbonise but the moves it is making in that direction are not being felt.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), electric propulsion, new infrastructure and the technical efforts are monumental.

But the public doesn’t feel them. This is where experiential marketing becomes not a luxury, but a strategic necessity.

Experiences build trust in ways data can’t. When people witness innovation with their own eyes, when they stand inside a net-zero aircraft cabin or engage with immersive sustainability journeys, they start to believe.

Brands doing this effectively are those that let people feel sustainability rather than read about it.

Immersive activations, demo flights or VR experiences can all turn abstract numbers into lived memories. This shifts ESG from compliance to something desirable and human.

TotalEnergies at the 2025 Paris Air Show used experiential marketing to demystify SAF and highlight the infrastructure challenges slowing its adoption.

At its booth, the company recreated a fully immersive SAF-powered airport environment – a physical manifestation of a concept typically confined to technical whitepapers and policy discussions.

By simulating what a SAF-enabled airport could look and feel like, TotalEnergies made an abstract future tangible.

This hands-on experience helped stakeholders – from policymakers to aviation executives – better grasp the logistical hurdles and opportunities tied to adopting SAF.

The installation reinforced TotalEnergies’ commitment to decarbonising aviation, translating complex ESG issues into actionable, engaging narratives.

Building emotional connection with passengers

The public may not grasp the carbon lifecycle of SAF, but they remember boarding a plane fuelled by it.

They may not read emissions dashboards, but they remember being immersed in a space where sustainable flight feels real.

The United Airlines’ historic passenger flight using 100% SAF in 2021 was a technical milestone and a strategic move to engage the public emotionally and promote sustainability.

The flight was positioned as a tangible example of progress in decarbonizing aviation, aiming to transform abstract environmental goals into a relatable and hopeful narrative.

By involving passengers and industry leaders, United sought to create a sense of shared accomplishment and personal connection to the sustainability effort.

Why airlines need to rethink their ESG marketing strategies

Airlines rely on data-heavy reports or fragmented campaigns that don’t resonate with passengers.

They’re good at setting targets and piloting new technology, but weak at translating that into customer experiences so, their ESG marketing needs to be reframed.

To increase consumer willingness to pay for sustainable travel, airlines need to make sustainability exciting and aspirational; a rewarding experience rather than a moral imperative.

Brands can better share the successes of how they have implemented ESG, such as including SAF seat upgrades or green booking options.

They can reward sustainable choices through loyalty programmes and premium perks, sharing proof through storytelling rather than just statistics.

ESG storytelling must move from solo to systemic

Aviation’s decarbonisation isn’t a solo act. It’s a system-wide, multi-stakeholder evolution. Yet the public often sees only fragments – a single innovation, a new fuel type, an airline campaign.

Events like the Paris Air Show, Dubai and Farnborough offer rare opportunities where the entire industry convenes in physical space.

Air shows are primarily industry-focused but their impact extends far beyond B2B audiences. The innovations and demonstrations fuel media coverage, social content and trust signals that regular consumers see.

To appeal to businesses, you need to appeal to where their revenue is generated, the end consumer.

B2B ultimately depends on demand at the passenger level, so showing progress and innovation at the start of the value chain helps businesses sell to other businesses.

A breakthrough demo at Paris or Farnborough often becomes a story the public remembers, and air shows act as launchpads for innovations before they reach passengers.

These aren’t just exhibitions; they are arenas of alignment. When done right, events become system accelerators, aligning emotion, science and society.

Every experience is a trust touchpoint

Experiential marketing is the bridge between scepticism and momentum. Through experiences, sustainability can be translated into emotive narratives.

They are a powerful tool; designing immersive activations that make progress feel personal, elevating smaller players like SAF pioneers and electric start-ups from side stage to main stage means these are not just promotional moments but opportunities to change people’s perspectives.

Sustainability won’t succeed if it’s seen as a sacrifice. It needs to be seen and felt as an upgrade. Experiential marketing shows the value, not just the cost.

It builds public will, which unlocks capital. It makes complex policy human. It transforms ESG from abstraction into action.",https://www.aviationbusinessnews.com/resources/uploads/2025/09/Margaux-Bang_2.webp,N,,2025-09-25 10:56:40.712341

Objectives of the Fund

The oneworld BEV Fund will invest in novel, next-generation SAF technologies; support the growth of alternative fuel markets to meet the long-term needs of the global aviation industry, drive technology innovation and develop a diverse and resilient SAF supply chain to meet future demand.

oneworld and its partners are focused on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimising other environmental impacts.

The alliance’s members include Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Fiji Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Oman Air, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian and SriLankan Airlines.

Challenges in investment

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts.

Airlines and manufacturers continue to invest in modern aircraft, engines and operational efficiencies. Demand for air travel is expected to rise in the coming decades, and SAF, which today can reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is a crucial tool for mitigating the industry’s environmental impact.

While SAF can significantly decrease the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft engines, the first-generation SAF in production today has come with challenges. The SAF industry has not yet attracted the investment required to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, and lifecycle environmental impact is a concern.

“The oneworld BEV Fund is built to identify and scale breakthrough SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions for jet fuel, compete with fossil-based fuels on cost, and integrate seamlessly with today’s aviation infrastructure. These are complex systems-level challenges that will take time to solve, and the fund is built with the long-term vision and staying power to help bring solutions to market,” said Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy and managing partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

Breakthrough Energy Ventures has raised more than $3.5 billion in committed capital and partnered with more than 110 groundbreaking companies.

Other recent developments

In June, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matchmaker platform to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers.

IATA estimated in June that production of SAF is expected to reach two million tonnes, or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025. Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a six per cent SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. The EU is offering some subsidies for SAF purchases by airlines.

In March, Airbus launched a new initiative called the “Book and Claim” system to make SAF more accessible and scalable.

Delta and Maeve target cleaner regional flights

Delta Air Lines has announced a strategic partnership with Maeve Aerospace to support the development of the Maeve Jet, a hybrid-electric aircraft designed to transform regional aviation. The aircraft promises up to 40% fuel savings compared to conventional regional jets, with further reductions possible through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The collaboration marks a significant step in Delta’s journey towards ‘net zero’ emissions by 2050 and reflects its commitment to pioneering cleaner, more-efficient aircraft technologies.

As Maeve’s exclusive North American airline partner, Delta will contribute operational expertise to help tailor the Maeve Jet for the US market. The aircraft’s design is a ‘bold re-imagining of regional travel’, offering the comfort and economics of a narrow-body airliner in a five-abreast, single-aisle configuration. This approach is intended to set a new benchmark for short-haul sustainability and passenger experience.

The partnership also sees Maeve join Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab, becoming the fifth revolutionary fleet partner in the airline’s 2023 Sustainability Roadmap. Maeve’s hybrid-electric solution complements Delta’s existing collaborations with JetZero, Joby Aviation, Airbus and Boeing, each focused on different aspects of future aircraft design and operation. Together, these partnerships form a comprehensive strategy across short, medium and long-haul markets.

Delta’s broader sustainability strategy is built around three pillars: what it flies, how it flies, and the fuel it uses. From investing in next-generation aircraft and scaling SAF adoption to optimising flight operations and reducing onboard weight, the airline is taking a holistic approach to decarbonising air travel.

Bold, forward-thinking innovation

Kristen Bojko, vice president of fleet at Delta Air Lines, said: “Delta is proud to collaborate with Maeve to help shape the next chapter of regional aviation and accelerate progress toward a more sustainable future of flight. As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the bold, forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design, enhance operational efficiency, elevate employee and customer experiences, and cut emissions.”

The Maeve Jet’s hybrid-electric engine architecture provides power assistance during low-altitude operations, enabling optimisation of both the power plant and wing design for reduced fuel consumption. The model also supports the integration of more electric aircraft systems, further enhancing efficiency.

Martin Nuesseler, chief technology officer at Maeve Aerospace, added: “It is a privilege to have Delta as a partner in the development of groundbreaking technologies and processes. Their expertise in fleet innovation and commitment to aviation sustainability is unmatched, and we are proud to work together to tailor the Maeve Jet for the US market.”

In addition to its work with Maeve, Delta is partnering with Green Taxi Aerospace to develop electric taxiing technology for regional aircraft. This initiative, also part of the Sustainable Skies Lab, aims to reduce fuel use, operating costs, taxi time and carbon emissions. The Green Taxi collaboration exemplifies Delta’s dual approach — making immediate operational improvements while investing in transformative technologies for the future.

Nick Andrews: We created USA BioEnergy to be the world’s leader in advanced fuels. My job is to lead and deliver the performance of the company. My philosophy is that we lead together with our partners.

2. Outline the core mission and vision of USA BioEnergy, and explain how the company is contributing to the global transition toward low-carbon transportation fuels.

Nick Andrews: Our goal is to have the lowest carbon intensity score in the advanced fuels industry. We have determined that an airline like Southwest Airlines can fly 112,000 net neutral flights each year from the sustainable aviation fuel we produce from one facility.

3. The Bon Wier, Texas facility is projected to produce 65 million gallons of renewable fuels annually by 2030. What milestones are being prioritized to ensure the project remains on track from development to commissioning?

Nick Andrews: Having terrific companies like Honeywell and JM go along way of giving the funders the comfort they are seeking. Having some of the strongest commercial agreements help ensure our project remains on track.

4. Forest thinnings are identified as a primary feedstock. How does this strategy address long-term feedstock security, sustainability, and supply-chain resilience for SAF production?

Nick Andrews: We can show super redundancy of our primary feedstock at a location that was formally a plywood manufacturing facility. We have the largest and longest feedstock supply agreement in the history of advanced fuels with LP Corporation.

5. With Johnson Matthey and Honeywell technologies integrated into the facility, what features make this project stand out as an advanced and fully integrated renewable fuel model?

Nick Andrews: We use bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration as a strategy to reduce our carbon intensity score. Working together with Johnson Matthey and Honeywell as the primary technology providers we can fully integrate the processes.

6. Scaling SPK production at commercial levels involves operational and technological challenges. What hurdles are anticipated, and how is USA BioEnergy preparing to address them?

Nick Andrews: Our licensors provide performance guarantees and because of that our EPC provides a wrap that guarantees the project will be built on time, on budget and will meet the performance specifications including the ASTM certification of the fuels. Each of these companies have a big balance sheet to back their commitments.

7. A 20-year offtake agreement with Southwest Airlines has been secured. How do such long-term contracts influence market stability and shape the future of SAF adoption in the U.S.?

Nick Andrews: The most important factor for SAF adoption is access to development capital. Having long term commercial agreements are the key to giving the capital markets comfort.

8. With airlines and logistics companies targeting net-zero emissions, demand for SAF is expected to outpace supply. How is USA BioEnergy positioning itself to expand production capacity while maintaining cost competitiveness with fossil fuels?

Nick Andrews: We plan to build twelve facilities using the best fully integrated approach in the advanced fuels industry. We look for efficiencies to lower cost and increase production.

9. Beyond the U.S. market, what strategies are being considered for USA BioEnergy’s participation in the global SAF ecosystem, particularly in Europe and Asia where policy incentives and demand are strong?

Nick Andrews: We have several locations identified in southern US and are actively looking for locations in Europe, Asia and Australia.

The standards setting group will take up the topic of contrails and other so-called “short-lived climate pollutants” (SLCP) at its 42nd Assembly, happening now in Montreal, according to ICAO agenda documents.

Front and centre is a new report from US group International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) concluding that reducing CO2 will have less impact on mitigating rising global temperatures than will reducing SLCPs, especially contrails.

ICCT says the aviation sector must cut both CO2 and SLCPs to reach the Paris Agreement goals.

“SLCP controls can provide faster and cheaper reductions in Earth’s temperature response to international aviation activity than [greenhouse gas] controls,” says an ICAO White Paper from August reviewing topics to be considered at the Assembly.

“Contrail avoidance, in particular, is modelled to be the most-impactful and cost-effective lever, providing 40% of total avoided warming by 2050,” the paper adds.

An arm of the United Nations, ICAO did not respond to questions about its consideration of ICCT’s report, which that group released publicly on 23 September.

ICAO is scheduled to review the proposal on 25 September, ICCT says.

The transportation group tells FlightGlobal its analysis shows that eliminating greenhouse gases like CO2 “alone cannot align aviation with the Paris Agreement”. It says the industry must focus on reducing contrails, which will cost a “magnitude” less than widespread production and use of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SLCPs include contrails (the result of ice crystals formed from water vapour in jet engine exhaust), and turbofan emissions including nitrogen oxides and “black carbon”, commonly known as soot. Those materials can cause atmospheric heating over hours or days, unlike CO2, which causes warming over centuries.

“The best available scientific assessments highlight that the net warming impact of non-CO2 emissions is at least the same magnitude as that of aviation’s cumulative CO2 emissions,” ICAO’s paper says.

ICAO in 2022 set its goal for the aviation industry to have net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The goal was intended to help the sector comply with the United Nation’s 2015 Paris Agreement, which urges member states take steps to prevent global temperatures from exceeding 2°C warmer than a pre-industrial revolution baseline.

Toward that end, airline groups rolled out ambitious road maps, saying they will achieve net-zero CO2 by means including new technologies (such as hydrogen, hybrid and all-electric propulsion), improved operational efficiencies and use of SAF.

Promises aside, SAF remains in pitiful short supply – 0.03% of jet fuel last year, ICCT says. SAF is also exceedingly expensive, and growing crops for SAF poses land-use challenges and could impact food crops.

On the technology front, aircraft and engine manufacturers have recently walked back hydrogen and all-electric ambitions due to technological limitations.

But ICCT says the CO2 focus is way overrated.

“Overall, 85% of the avoided temperature increase is linked to SLCPs,” its report says, estimating contrails “contribute the largest share” – 40% – of the aviation sector’s contribution to warming temperatures.

“Contrail abatement technologies will would take less time to develop and scale”, and cost far less than other means, ICCT adds. “SLCP reduction emerges as a more-feasible option… in mitigating aviation’s climate impact.”

It says new analytical tools and “advances in contrails science” informed the new study.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/8/6/1/112861_ecodemonstrator_explorer_737_10_130596.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 10:57:00.586897

Governments plan to produce about more than double (120%) the volume of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, according to the 2025 Production Gap Report.

It further added that if global warming were to be limited to 2°C, even then the volume of fossil fuels in 2030 would be 77% more. If this does happen, then the world will even further away from the goals decided during the Paris Agreement.

The 2025 Production Gap Report was produced by Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), Climate Analytics, and International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).

Since the last time the report was compiled in 2023, countries are planning even higher levels of coal production to 2035 and gas production to 2050. For oil, planned production continues to increase to 2050.

Increasing fossil fuels across the world

The report analysed 20 major fossil-fuel-producing countries responsible for about 80% of global fossil fuel production. Its findings include that 17 of the 20 featured countries still plan to increase production of at least one fossil fuel to 2030.

Eleven now expect higher production of at least one fossil fuel in 2030 than they had planned in 2023. On the other hand, 6 of the 20 profiled countries are now developing domestic fossil fuel production aligned with national and global net zero targets, up from four in 2023, found the report.

Back in 2023, when the former report was compiled, the fossil fuel production gap was 110% above the 1.5°C warming pathway and 69% more than the 2°C pathway.

“In 2023, governments formally acknowledged the need to move away from fossil fuels to mitigate climate change – an obligation the International Court of Justice has now clearly emphasized. But as our report makes clear, while many countries have committed to a clean energy transition, many others appear to be stuck using a fossil-fuel-dependent playbook, planning even more production than they were two years ago,” said Derik Broekhoff, coordinating lead author of the Production Gap Report.

Meeting climate targets uphill task

The report underscored the need to undertake steeper and faster reductions in fossil fuel production if the world wants to limit global warming to well below 2°C. Another issue is that the fossil fuel infrastructure, which is primarily subsidised through public funds, will eventually end up as stranded assets.

The report advocated that achieving these reductions will require deliberate, coordinated policies to ensure a just transition away from fossil fuels. While a few major fossil-fuel-producing countries have begun to align production plans with national and international climate goals, most still have not.

“To keep the 1.5°C goal within reach, the world needs rapid reductions in coal, oil, and gas investments, redirecting these resources toward an energy transition that prioritizes equity and justice. By COP30, governments must commit to expand renewables, phase out fossil fuels, manage energy demands, and implement community-centered energy transitions to align with Paris Agreement obligations. Without these commitments, delaying action further will lock in additional emissions and worsen climate impacts on the world’s most vulnerable populations,” said Emily Ghosh, coordinating lead author.

Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use hydroprocessed esters and fatty acid (HEFA) technology such as converting used cooking oil into SAF.
Government policies need to be coordinated to support innovation and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market while the energy industry needs to invest in SAF production capacity and align its business strategies with global decarbonisation goals.
IATA director general Willie Walsh said: “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","A study by IATA and Worley Consulting has stated that technology, not the availability of raw materials is the main bottleneck to the roll-out of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and net zero aviation.

The report concluded that there is enough feedstock - that meets stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use - to enable the airline industry to achieve zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

However the roll-out of technology to enable SAF to be produced from varied sources is slow. Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use hydroprocessed esters and fatty acid (HEFA) technology such as converting used cooking oil into SAF.

These face competition with other potential users of the same feedstock so allocating biomass to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritised, the report said.

Biomass could produce more than 300m tonnes of the 500mt of SAF needed to achieve net zero by 2050. Some of this potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements.

Power-to-liquid (PtL) technology will be needed to produce the remaining 200mt and reach the 500mt target, the report continues. PtL, or e-SAF, uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, which is then combined with carbon dioxide to form synthetic kerosene and would allow the fuel to be made from multiple sources.

This will require reliable access to low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen and carbon capture systems.

However, in the meantime, maximising volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

For all technology, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiency, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure to scale up commercial SAF production in all regions, found the report.

Government policies need to be coordinated to support innovation and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market while the energy industry needs to invest in SAF production capacity and align its business strategies with global decarbonisation goals.

IATA director general Willie Walsh said: “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritized then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.

""There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”

IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, added: “Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout.

""Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder.”

Walsh concluded: “We can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality.”",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/7/6/11776_biofuel-aircraft-shutterstock_2055311654.jpg-resized.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 06:56:12.826893

Meanwhile, Tallgrass has launched the Trailblazer Community Investment Fund, pledging an initial $500,000 to be managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation.

Over the next decade, the company expects to distribute more than $7 million through the fund, supporting early childhood centers, elder care providers, food programs, and volunteer fire departments in 31 counties.

A New Model for Infrastructure Projects

The initiative emerged from negotiations with Bold Nebraska, a grassroots environmental group that once opposed Keystone XL but sought a more collaborative path with this project. Both organizations now describe the partnership as a template for balancing large-scale infrastructure development with meaningful community benefits.

Jane Kleeb, Bold Nebraska’s founder, emphasized that rural communities often bear the burdens of such projects without reaping tangible benefits.

Tallgrass executives framed the fund as a way to invest in the long-term well-being of local residents. “We hope that these investments serve to provide a safety net to our neighbors throughout their lifetimes,” said Kyle Quackenbush, the company’s segment president.

Enter Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is aiming to play a key role in helping to tackle climate change by significantly reducing flight carbon emissions.

While the ASA hasn’t seen too many examples of SAF claims in ads, plans have already been put in motion to increase its use in the sector and so there will, quite understandably, be increased opportunities for advertisers to highlight how it’s being implemented. There are positive messages to be communicated with this concept, however there’s always a balance to be struck in ensuring that those messages don’t give a misleading impression of the environmental impacts of flights through its use.

Here we’ll outline some key green claim requirements so you can get that balance right.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF is an alternative aviation fuel made from renewable feedstocks, which can range from general household waste and cooking oil, to waste wood and algae (and lots in between). SAF purports to offer a lower carbon alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel, with the aim of significantly reducing carbon emissions. The term itself is widely used and recognised in the aviation sector, as well as government, and was first defined by organisations like the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Unlike other alternatives to traditional aviation fuel, SAF’s chemical make-up means that it can be easily integrated – or ‘blended’ – into current fuel mixes, at a current maximum ratio of 50%. It can also be used in existing aircraft, resulting in minimal impact on infrastructure.

To encourage and secure demand, the UK government implemented a SAF Mandate in 2024, which sets a legal obligation on its supply. This starts in 2025 at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand and then increases annually to 10% in 2030 and finally 22% in 2040. It’s estimated that the Mandate could deliver up to 6.3 megatonnes of carbon savings per year by the final increase in 2040.

Make sure you make the basis of the claim clear

When it comes to the content of ads, they need to make the basis of any environmental claims clear. This means that any unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information. Additionally, the meaning of all terms used in ads should be clear to consumers.

Results from various ASA consumer research topics (be it related to food, EV and hybrid vehicles, green disposal methods or carbon neutral claims) have shown that there’s typically quite a low level of understanding, and often confusion, when it comes to grasping the meaning of environmental claims. This includes references to new technologies, a bracket that SAF is likely to fall into.

On the basis that consumers will lack in-depth knowledge and understanding of SAF, any negative environmental impacts of the fuel could be considered as material information that will have an impact on a transactional decision. Ads that don’t highlight this type of balancing information are therefore likely to mislead. What we’re considering here is something that explains that SAF produces reduced, but still significant, emissions over its full life cycle (more on that later), and the level of greenhouse gas emission savings that have been obtained.

The consumer’s perspective is therefore key – first, what is the ad’s overall message? What is that likely to mean to them? What’s their likely understanding and interpretation of it? What information are they going to need to help their understanding?

What about absolute claims?

A good place to start when making any objective claim is to make sure that you hold evidence to substantiate it. Absolute claims (like “green” or “eco-friendly”) have historically been taken to mean that something either has no effect on the environment or an actively positive one and will therefore require a very high level of evidence to back them up.

The term “Sustainable Aviation Fuel” is unlikely to be taken as an absolute claim in isolation, but you’ll want to avoid accompanying it with absolute-style descriptors. As we’ve already seen, while the transition to SAF aims to spark a positive shift on climate change compared to using jet fuel, there will still be some unavoidable impact on the environment through its use. This isn’t exclusive to SAF – it’s simply a nigh on impossible task to back up a suggestion that a product or service has absolutely no effect on the environment in some way, however small that might be.

So, if you want to claim “Environmental Advocacy” with “Total Peace Of Mind”, “a louder, bolder approach to sustainable aviation” or that consumers can “travel better and sustainably”, you’ll probably have a difficult time justifying it.

What could work instead is a claim comparing against a previous product or competitor product (“greener” or “friendlier”). In a SAF context, where different types of SAF exist and uptake may differ between airlines, this might be “one of the greenest” or “Fly more sustainably”, although remember that you’ll need to include the basis for which the claim has been used and be able to substantiate it.

Take into account the full life cycle

Generally the more specific and narrow the claim, the easier and more straightforward it will be to substantiate it. This is particularly relevant considering that, unless an ad states otherwise, environmental claims will need to take the full life cycle of the product or service into account – this means assessing its impact in its entirety, from cradle to grave (or from maiden flight to fini-flight if you’ll indulge me another aviation reference).

For SAF this might include the more obvious environmental impact of the flight itself, but also any impact that results from its production. This will differ depending on the type of SAF, but the ASA has previously seen examples including the diversion of biofuels from other sectors which might then revert back to fossil derived fuels, and the impact of land use changes, both direct and indirect. Where services are directly linked with aviation, it’s likely that claims will be taken in the context of the full life cycle of aviation operations generally, including where aircraft aren’t directly owned or operated.

Remember that nigh on impossible task mentioned earlier for absolute claims?

You might instead attach an environmental claim to a specific part of the process (the flight only for example), and that means that you would only need to hold evidence for the life cycle of that specific part, rather than the whole.

What can often be effective is taking a step back from the creative process at the initial stages and approaching it from a different angle. What claim would you like to make? What evidence do you currently hold? Is there enough there to make a more limited or specific claim? What evidence would you need to help substantiate a broader claim and is that achievable?

SAF being unique to your business and exaggerating fuel mix

You might argue that as a concept SAF is unique, but the practical use of it won’t be. The SAF Mandate is a legal obligation for fuel suppliers in the UK, so it’s important to remember that other companies will be adhering to it as well. If you refer to SAF in your ads, be careful that you don’t suggest that it’s an exclusive initiative or something that only you’re implementing. Be careful to also ensure that you don’t exaggerate your company’s role in the use and uptake of SAF.

Similarly, you’ll want to avoid any suggestion that your fuel mix contains more SAF than it actually does. There’ll be quite a few ways of achieving this, but initially you’ll want to have the likely interpretation in mind. For example, you might think about avoiding blanket statements, making clear in some way that the fuel mix contains SAF in part, or including the specific percentage of SAF contained within the fuel mix.

It’s easy to get caught up in the detail of sectoral targets and net-zero deadlines, but decarbonisation is also about opportunity. We’re not just reducing emissions; we’re building new systems with new priorities. The shift to a low-carbon economy is the greatest chance in generations to create a fairer, greener society where lasting, well-paid, and environmentally responsible jobs become the norm for everyone.

Nowhere is this more visible than in West Cumbria, where Carbon Neutral Fuels (CNF) is preparing to deliver a landmark project that combines climate action with economic renewal.

Backed by £7.4 million in grant funding from the UK Government’s Advanced Fuels Fund, CNF is advancing plans for a state-of-the-art green fuel facility near the Port of Workington. Online in 2031, this facility will produce Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and is expected to generate more than 2,000 jobs during its construction phase, sustaining over 50 full-time, skilled roles once operational. These are not short-term wins but long-term, future-proofed opportunities that make the West Cumbrian coastline an integral part of the new green economy.

A proud industrial legacy

The choice of West Cumbria is more than strategic; it’s symbolic. Having lived in the area, CNF’s Co-founder, Sophie, knows that this county has long powered Britain. Much of the coal that fueled our Industrial Revolution was mined from its hills. A century later, Cumbria became the heart of the nuclear age when Queen Elizabeth II opened the world’s first commercial nuclear power station at Calder Hall in 1956. Known as the ‘Energy Coast’, since the 2000s, the landscape is now home to multiple renewables projects delivering the new age of clean, green power.

Today, CNF’s sustainable aviation fuel project writes the next chapter in that industrial story. At full capacity, the Workington facility will produce 25,000 tonnes of green jet fuel annually, reducing lifecycle emissions by up to 89% compared to traditional fossil jet fuel.

From coal to nuclear to clean aviation, Britain’s Energy Coast continues to show how regional industry can shape national progress.

Aviation’s challenge and opportunity

The aviation sector is an unlikely hero in any sustainability story. Without intervention, it’s projected to be responsible for around 22% of global carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Batteries and hydrogen may help other forms of transport, but for long-haul flights, the weight and energy density challenges remain unsolved. Zero- emission aircraft aren’t likely to be adopted at scale before 2050. That’s where eSAF comes in.

eSAF (sustainable aviation fuel made using electricity) uses just low-carbon electricity, water, and captured carbon dioxide to make jet fuel that works in today’s aircraft without modification. For governments, it’s both a climate breakthrough and an industrial opportunity. For many airlines, alongside biofuels, it’s one of the few realistic options for meeting near-term climate commitments.

The Department for Transport estimates that low-carbon fuel production could add up to £5 billion to the UK economy by 2050. That’s why, in July 2025, it invested £63m across 17 UK projects to deliver clean fuel for the industry, with CNF’s ASAP-DAC consortium receiving £6m, the largest award for an e-fuels project in this funding round. The scale of this support builds upon their previous win in 2023 of £1.4m and reflects strong government confidence in both the technology and CNF’s vision.

As the MP for Workington and Whitehaven, Josh MacAlister, put it:

‘The £6m government funding boost announced today is a real vote of confidence in our area and it will help to fast-track the project to a final investment decision.’

Such backing is critical. Government investment not only signals trust but also unlocks private capital, ensuring the UK can compete internationally as more countries move to establish SAF production. For West Cumbria, it means momentum; for the UK, it marks another step towards Jet Zero by 2050.

According to CNF, Workington was chosen not just for its infrastructure, but for the ambition palpable within the community. The energy transition can’t only be about abstract policy and emissions curves; it has to mean something on the ground. ASAP-DAC is designed to deliver more than fuel. It’s about enabling long-term, well-paid jobs, up-skilling for the local community, and creating a pipeline of skilled work that lasts.

How it works

At the heart of the Workington facility is ASAP-DAC: Advancing Sustainable Aviation via Power-to-Liquid and Direct Air Capture. The process brings together a world-first combination of technologies at commercial scale.

Here’s how it works:

Electricity + water + CO2: The plant uses renewable electricity to power Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOEC). These convert water and carbon dioxide into syngas, which consists of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

CO2 capture: Around 90% of the carbon dioxide will come from biogenic sources such as farm waste, and 10% directly from the atmosphere using Direct Air Capture technology.

Fuel synthesis: The syngas generated by SOEC is then combined in a Fischer- Tropsch reactor to create long-chain hydrocarbons.

Refining: These hydrocarbons are then refined into synthetic kerosene, certified under ASTM D7566, suitable for blending with Jet A-1 aviation fuel.

The result: 25,000 tonnes of certified eSAF per year, delivering an 89% lifecycle emissions reduction compared with fossil fuels.

This isn’t a lab experiment. It’s a first-of-its-kind commercial facility designed to meet over 35% of the UK’s eSAF mandate in its first year of operation.

A national model

What’s taking shape in West Cumbria offers a model for the rest of the country. It shows that when government policy aligns with private innovation, the UK can build the industries of the future on the foundations of its industrial past.

As demand for SAF accelerates internationally, Britain faces a clear choice: import fuels and forfeit the economic value, or manufacture them domestically, creating jobs, skills, and resilience in regions that need them most.

The Workington project demonstrates that with the right support, the UK can lead.

The future of CNF

Workington is just the beginning for CNF. Aviation is their first focus, but their technology has the potential to serve other hard-to-decarbonise sectors like shipping in the years ahead. Wherever it takes them, the CNF ethos goes beyond clean fuel and into the communities they partner with, giving communities like West Cumbria a stake in a cleaner, fairer future.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Picture1_bigger.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 06:56:33.543409

Airlines will require about 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050 to hit that target.
IATA estimated potential feedstock at 12,000 million tonnes by mid-century, although less than 35 per cent will be available for bioenergy and biofuels due to competing demands.
Currently, commercial-scale SAF production relies almost exclusively on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA).
“Global SAF production could potentially reach 400 million tonnes by 2050,” the study noted.","A lack of technology rollout and infrastructure, rather than feedstock shortages, is the biggest obstacle to scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), according to a new study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), reports Australian Aviation.

The study found there is sufficient feedstock to allow the global airline industry to reach net zero emissions within the next 25 years. Airlines will require about 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050 to hit that target. IATA estimated potential feedstock at 12,000 million tonnes by mid-century, although less than 35 per cent will be available for bioenergy and biofuels due to competing demands.

Currently, commercial-scale SAF production relies almost exclusively on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). IATA said the slow development of alternative production facilities has created a gap between potential and actual output.

“Global SAF production could potentially reach 400 million tonnes by 2050,” the study noted. “This would still leave a shortfall of about 100 million tonnes. Closing the gap will require better conversion efficiencies, faster technology rollout, stronger feedstock logistics, and major investment in infrastructure.”

IATA director-general Willie Walsh stressed that the report shows feedstock supply is not the barrier. “There is enough sustainable feedstock to achieve net zero by 2050. The challenge is scaling production. We need shovels in the ground now,” he said.

Walsh urged policymakers and energy companies to accelerate investment, saying the findings amount to an urgent call to action. “We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” he said.

The study comes as the Australian Government ramps up its support for low-carbon fuels. Earlier this month, it announced a $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program to be spent over the next decade. The scheme aims to attract private sector investment into domestic production of cleaner fuels, including SAF. The first “drop-in” fuels that can directly substitute conventional jet fuel are expected by 2029.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SAF-01.jpeg,N,,2025-09-25 06:56:40.683902

The EU has imposed duties to protect domestic SAF production. The measures make imported SAF more expensive, giving EU producers an advantage. In addition, ReFuelEU mandates SAF blending from to 70% by 2050, while UK rules set higher targets in the short term and limit HEFA use.

EU Targets SAF Imports

The EU has added sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to its trade defence measures on imports of biofuels from the US, Indonesia and Argentina.

The EU has extended its anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures, effective September 15, to cover SAF under existing trade defence rules. The move responds to protests from the European biofuel industry and ensures consistent application of EU trade defence measures.

The new measures in the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation are intended to protect the EU market from unfairly priced or subsidised SAF, create a level playing field for EU-produced fuels, and support domestic SAF production.

Source: USDA

Imports of SAF from the US, Indonesia and Argentina now face combined duties. For example, US SAF is subject to duties of EUR 211–409/tonne, making it more expensive in the EU.

ReFuelEU mandates blending SAF into aviation fuel, starting with 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050, with specific targets for advanced biofuels and synthetic fuels. By establishing binding requirements for all flights originating in the EU, the regulation aims to create a stable and competitive environment for SAF, encouraging investment and production within the EU to meet climate goals.

EU and UK SAF Rules Drive Market Change

According to various sources, SAF mandates are reshaping the aviation fuel market. The EU and UK impose steep non-compliance penalties, turning regulatory requirements into a strategic lever for those who act early. Non-compliance is costly. Penalties range from two to 13 times the cost of compliance, particularly in the UK, making long-term planning essential to mitigate risk.

Beginning in 2025, ReFuelEU mandated that aviation fuel suppliers offer a minimum percentage of SAF and e-SAF (SAF produced from renewable energy sources) at EU airports. By 2030, suppliers must blend at least 6% SAF, including 1.2% e-SAF.

To discourage tankering practices (carrying excess fuel for return trips, which increases emissions), ReFuelEU Aviation requires airline operators to refuel at least 90% of their annual aviation fuel needs at the EU airport of departure.

In parallel, the UK Department for Transport (DfT) mandates a higher SAF blend of 9.5% by 2030 and places greater emphasis on reducing reliance on hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) SAF, which face eventual feedstock supply limits. HEFA’s allowable share will decline annually, from 100% in 2025 to 42% in 2040.

Cambridge University Press & Assessment, which transports over 1.5 million kilos of exam-related materials through DHL, had identified freight as a significant source of its greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 25% of the organization’s measured emissions. The use of GoGreen Plus is expected to reduce their carbon footprint by c. 1,500 metric tons CO2e WtW annually.

Guy Nicholson, deputy managing director of global operations, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, said, “We are already taking significant steps to reduce carbon emissions in our supply chain, and overall we have reduced our direct energy-related carbon emissions by 35% since 2019. This work with DHL builds on our commitment to environmental responsibility and will support us in achieving our broader carbon reduction targets by significantly reducing our freight emissions.”

Duncan Heron, VP, DHL Express, said, “Our customers are increasingly focused on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, and we’re delighted to be able to work with Cambridge University Press & Assessment in their sustainability journey.

“Through GoGreen Plus, we’re providing a powerful tool that enables our clients to cut emissions in their own supply chains. As SAF remains a leading solution for decarbonizing aviation, it’s an effective way for us to help our customers achieve their sustainability goals”.

Insetting through GoGreen Plus allows customers to bring down their Scope 3 emissions, the indirect greenhouse gas emissions that occur in a company's value chain, including downstream transportation and distribution. The service uses the book and claim approach, which enables DHL to directly replace fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within their network and allocate environmental benefits to paying customers, even when their shipments are not physically transported using these fuels. GoGreen Plus is part of DHL Group's sustainability commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Seattle’s working waterfront is the beating heart of our city. This month’s grand opening of the new Waterfront Park is the result of decades of work by many people. I’m proud of how the Port of Seattle was part of this effort.

The transformation of the waterfront marks a new chapter in Seattle’s history. To learn more about our contributions to the past and future of Seattle’s working waterfront, read the Seattle Times op-ed I recently co-authored with the Port’s executive director, Steve Metruck.

In it, we assert Seattle isn’t just a city with a port, we’re a port city. But today, more Seattleites than ever feel disconnected from the working waterfront — resulting in a growing affliction of ""maritime blindness."" To maintain our nautical heritage and the economic benefits of a strong maritime industry here, we’ll need to work closely with our partners in city, state, and federal governments.

This new waterfront is just the beginning. While we remain focused on creating good-paying maritime jobs, we continue to look for ways for community and commerce to coexist by helping create scenic bike and pedestrian paths as well as expanding waterfront parks that don’t conflict with maritime operations.

If you’re interested in learning more about the waterfront’s history, head over to Elliott Bay Book Company to purchase History Link’s latest book, “Where the City Meets the Sound.”

New bike paths at Pier 66 and Terminal 91

The Port’s bike path projects at Bell Harbor Cruise Terminal and Terminal 91, near Magnolia. highlight exactly the kinds of projects I’m talking about when it comes to striking that balance. Earlier this month, reporters came to Terminal 91 to view the demolition of what I’ve been referring to as the “bridge to nowhere” — a too-narrow, outdated pedestrian bridge. It took three years — far longer than it should have — to overcome BNSF’s resistance to this project. Thanks to the hard work of Port staff and our construction team, a new cycling path is slated to be complete by the end of this month. You can find more coverage of the project in the Seattle Times and on KIRO.

In August, I joined Mayor Bruce Harrell and other city officials to celebrate the completion of a new bike path in front of Pier 66 that will enable cyclists to bike along the waterfront safely — even while we have cruise ships loading and unloading goods and passengers.

I’m particularly proud of these mutually beneficial achievements, in light of conflicts that have occurred between bicyclists and industry in other parts of the city.

Learning how to make sustainable aviation fuel in the Tri-Cities

When it comes to the future of low-impact flight, eastern Washington is leading the way. Air travel contributes 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The fastest way to reduce this impact is to fly without fossil fuels. Local companies and Washington State University (WSU) have teamed up to advance the science of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

I had the chance to join a group of officials from the Port and economic development organizations here for a trip to the Tri-Cities, where we toured WSU’s lab and saw presentations from the companies involved in this effort. WSU’s researchers, together with talented entrepreneurs and established industry players, are doing what it takes to deliver SAF on a commercial scale.

At the heart of this effort is WSU’s Tri-Cities-based Sustainable Options for Aviation Research (SOAR) Lab, which provides cutting-edge testing to ensure SAF blends are safe, efficient, and compatible with today’s aircraft. A coalition of private and public partners — including the Port of Seattle — is fostering not just research capacity but also the supply chains, infrastructure, and policy support necessary to make the SAF we need to cut pollution in the aviation sector. They’re proving that sustainable fuel isn’t just a vision for the future — it’s an industry Washington is building today, with the potential to transform aviation around the world.

To continue our commitment to advancing the use of SAF, the Port has become a member of the recently formed Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Institute. The Institute is led by Snohomish County and supported by WSU, Boeing, Alaska Airline, Earth Finance, the Port, and others. This first-of-its-kind global initiative is focused on reducing the economy’s dependence on carbon-based fuels by accelerating SAF adoption through enhanced commercialization of innovative clean fuels solutions.

Pacific Ports Association Conference in Nanaimo, British Columbia

In August, I took a trip to Nanaimo, British Columbia for the Pacific Ports Association (PPA) 11th annual meeting where I learned about the innovative approaches ports are taking across the Pacific Rim to address the uncertainties associated with tariffs and other challenges facing the maritime industry.

I heard some fantastic speakers on a variety of topics. We talked about the ways ultra-modern terminals (including Seattle’s T5) are handling cargo. We discussed how autonomous vehicles are providing benefits for security and sustainability. And I learned more about the way shore power is changing the ferry industry for the better — something that Seattle is about to see a lot more of in the coming years. It was a fantastic forum for sharing some of the latest best practices and innovations that are driving our industry forward through uncertain times.

As you can see, I’ve stayed busy this summer but still found time to savor the sunshine.

The first agreement made with Microsoft covers the supply of low-carbon steel from Stegra’s Boden facility, while the second introduces a system of environmental attribute certificates (EACs) tied to the production of that steel.
The EAC agreement separates the environmental value of green steel from the physical product.
As such, buyers of the physical steel must agree not to make sustainability claims, preventing double counting.
But when physical delivery isn’t yet feasible, signing agreements for environmental attribute certificates demonstrates that emissions reductions are possible in the value chain through credible market mechanisms.","Swedish green iron and steel maker Stegra announced two agreements with Microsoft aimed at advancing the use of near-zero emission steel in the technology company’s datacenter operations.

Founded in 2020, Stegra utilizes hydrogen produced using green power to remove the oxygen from iron oxide, avoiding most of the CO2 emissions normally produced, and uses electricity from 100% renewable sources for the energy requirements generated in the manufacturing process.

The first agreement made with Microsoft covers the supply of low-carbon steel from Stegra’s Boden facility, while the second introduces a system of environmental attribute certificates (EACs) tied to the production of that steel.

Henrik Henriksson, CEO of Stegra, said:

“Sustainable change calls for unconventional partnerships. We are now teaming up with a market leader in Microsoft, to demonstrate how we can work together to accelerate change in the steel industry.”

The physical supply deal will see Stegra deliver steel produced with up to 95% fewer emissions than conventional methods.

While Microsoft does not directly purchase raw materials, it will work with suppliers who will receive coils from Stegra and process them into components for Microsoft’s datacenter equipment.

The EAC agreement separates the environmental value of green steel from the physical product. The steel itself can be sold as conventional, while the associated emissions reductions are sold through certificates.

As such, buyers of the physical steel must agree not to make sustainability claims, preventing double counting. Microsoft can then apply the EACs toward its carbon reduction goals.

Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer at Microsoft, said:

“The end game is to source physical materials with the lowest possible CO₂ footprint. Achieving this requires greater volumes of low-carbon steel available in more regions. But when physical delivery isn’t yet feasible, signing agreements for environmental attribute certificates demonstrates that emissions reductions are possible in the value chain through credible market mechanisms. Moreover, through tools like this, we aim to signal demand, enable project financing, and accelerate global production.”

The agreements build on Microsoft’s 2023 investment in Stegra through its Climate Innovation Fund.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Microsoft-israel.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 18:56:08.200035

“Having conducted assessments on global feedstock availability, technology readiness, and regional suitability, the core forecast of this study estimates that global SAF production could potentially reach 400 Mt by 2050,” IATA said.
“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050.
“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","According to the study, airlines will need 500 million tonnes of SAF to reach net zero by 2050, achievable through both biomass conversion and power-to-liquid, with an estimated potential of 12,000 million tonnes of feedstock by that point – though less than 35 per cent of this will be available for bioenergy and biofuels, the organisation says, due to competing uses.

Additionally, the pace of development on SAF production facilities has been slow, with the only current commercial-scale facilities reliant on a single technology, hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA).

“Reaching this level is a daunting task and would represent a major scale-up in SAF capacity. However, it also reveals a significant shortfall of around 100 Mt.

“In all cases, to maximise SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.”

IATA director-general Willie Walsh said the report provides “unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised, then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation”.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” he said.

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.

“The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality.”

The Australian Government earlier this month announced a $1.1 billion investment over 10 years into the development of low-carbon liquid fuels, including SAF.

The company is an Australian clean-tech startup working to enable Australasia’s first hydrogen-electric flights.

This hydrogen fuel cell testing has been made possible with the support of Air New Zealand, Hiringa Energy and the NZ Product Accelerator hosted by University of Auckland.

Stralis Aircraft is developing fuel cells to power hydrogen-electric propulsion systems for aircraft and other heavy transport applications that offer high performance and low operating costs.

Their proprietary high temperature PEM fuel-cell technology is lighter than alternatives, enabling aircraft to fly ten times further than battery-electric solutions at a lower cost than fossil-fuel-powered planes. The company is already testing its fuel cells in the U.S. and Japan but has now started testing closer to home in New Zealand.

The testing will provide data to help Stralis understand degradation mechanisms and degradation rates to support a credible lifetime assessment for the fuel cell system product.

Achieving long life HTPEM fuel cells is important to deliver engine maintenance cost savings to airline customers. This measured data will help quantify maintenance savings and encourage adoption of the technology.

Stralis’s propulsion technology delivers benefits like:

Zero emissions (producing only water vapor)

Up to 50% lower operating costs

Reduced noise

Their system integrates their fuel cells, liquid hydrogen tanks, and electric motors into existing and new aircraft designs. It plans to achieve the first flight of its six-seat Bonanza A36 technology demonstrator aircraft later in 2025 in Queensland, Australia.

Stuart Johnstone, co-founder and CTO of Stralis Aircraft says, “We are proud to be working with Air New Zealand to test our unique fuel cell technology in their engine test facility at Auckland Airport. New Zealand is an ideal location to develop, test and adopt emission free aircraft technology, so it is a great place to build capability and understanding.”

Johnstone continued, “The test cell is attractive because it has lots of capacity to grow and enable testing of our higher power systems. It is great to be working with businesses in Australasia to make hydrogen-electric and zero-emission aviation a reality. With the help of our Kiwi partners, we have managed to get the test cell operational in “record” time”.

Air New Zealand’s Sustainability Lead Energy Transition Matthew Connolly says, “Across Air New Zealand we have a significant programme dedicated to preparing for the future of flight, and the energy transition is a critical part of this work.”

Connolly added, “That’s where opening the engine test cell facility to innovative companies such as Stralis comes in, as another step in our collective learning about new technologies, future engine propulsion, and new ways that aircraft will fly people and goods in a lower-carbon future.”

“We believe Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), hydrogen and electricity will all be critical parts of a future aviation eco-system, and we’re proud to be supporting the innovation that Stralis is testing here in New Zealand,” he concluded.

Hydrogen-electric propulsion systems have fewer moving parts and operate at lower temperatures compared to existing aircraft engines, which is predicted to reduce engine maintenance costs by between 40-60%. This is similar to the maintenance cost reductions seen between combustion engine and electric cars.

The hydrogen, stored onboard in a tank, powers a fuel cell that generates electricity to power an electric motor, which drives a propellor.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","Beyond the Tarmac

Airlines are estimated to need 500mn tonnes (Mt) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to achieve the industry’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

This can be achieved from two main sources- biomass and power-to-liquid, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Biomass has the potential to produce more than 300Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades.

Power-to-liquid (PtL) will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximising the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

In all cases, to maximise SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

Recently, IATA in partnership with Worley Consulting, has published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use.

The study also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely the slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources and competition with other potential users of the same feedstock.

Currently, the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritised.

According to the report, there are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonise aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

With the right policies and investments, more than 300Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200Mt from e-SAF.

Enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry remain a major challenge.

Other major challenges, according to IATA, are: Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL, including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure, which are all required as part of the PtL production method.

Achieving coordinated government policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities.

Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Asean identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialisation, and align their business strategies with global decarbonisation goals.

IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh said: “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.

“The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.

Industry analysts say hitting net-zero aviation by 2050 is huge, technically possible, but it won’t happen by accident.

The industry must scale SAF fast, modernise fleets, squeeze out operational savings, build hydrogen and PtL capacity, and deploy robust policy and finance — all co-ordinated internationally and backed by strict sustainability and verification — to credibly reach net-zero by 2050.",https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2025/09/24/360904.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 17:56:37.881744

[2] Allocation of planned storage capacity to these entities assumes that storage projects developed by joint ventures are divided by ownership share.","In 2024, the EU broke new ground by requiring oil and gas producers to start building the CO₂ storage infrastructure needed to reach its climate goals. Under the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), these companies must deliver 50 million tonnes of annual CO2 injection capacity by 2030 — a target critical to keeping industrial decarbonisation on track. Analysis by the Clean Air Task Force shows some international oil companies are well prepared, while several regional operators face steep shortfalls. With national governments now tasked with setting penalties by July 2026, the next two years will determine whether this landmark law drives real investment or risks uneven progress across the EU.

The past few months have seen some major milestones in the implementation of the carbon capture and storage requirements of the NZIA, including the European Commission’s Decision identifying the contributions of the obligated producers. As stipulated under Article 23 of the regulation, these contributions are allocated to holders of production licences in proportion to the share of oil and gas they produced between 2020 and 2023. The Decision identifies 44 obligated entities which produced oil or gas in the EU over the relevant period, and excludes smaller producers which collectively contributed 5% of the total volume (see Figure).[1]

Figure 1. The CO2 storage capacity obligations of all 44 licence-holding entities identified by the European Commission.

Are oil and gas producers on track to meet their obligations?

Following the publication of the Commission’s Decision, CATF’s CO2 storage tracker has featured our analysis of how the company obligations compare with the storage capacity they currently have under development. As many of the obligated entities are joint ventures or local subsidiaries, it is useful to rationalise the list into parent companies (Figure 2). These entities, which include international oil majors such as Shell, Exxon, and TotalEnergies, as well as regional producers with significant state ownership, will be functionally responsible for delivering on the storage obligation. While our analysis has partitioned the obligations of joint ventures according to ownership stakes, in reality the partners may reach different agreements on how they collectively meet the target capacity.

Figure 2. Estimated scale of company obligations under Article 23 of the NZIA and corresponding shares of planned storage capacity in the EU

Over 80% of the 50 Mt/year target is to be delivered by just 12 companies, and around half of the target by only five companies. Should their current storage projects progress according to announced schedules, Shell, Eni, and TotalEnergies are on track to meet their obligations, with the potential to expand further beyond 2030.[2] In contrast, national oil and gas companies in Romania (OMV Petrom and Romgaz) and Poland (Orlen) are in a challenging position, with significant obligations but little or no announced capacity under development in the EU. The regulation has noticeably accelerated activity within these companies and fortunately both countries offer promising geology for CO2 storage. Orlen are investigating potential CO2 storage sites in central Poland and offshore, while OMV Petrom have recently begun exploring a storage site near Botesti.

The companies are not required to satisfy their obligation alone; the regulation allows them to reach agreements between themselves or with other storage developers, providing some flexibility to those entities currently facing a shortfall. The CATF storage tracker identifies potential for another 5 Mt/year of capacity that could feasibly be operational by 2030, which is under development by non-obligated entities. As can be seen in Figure 2, there are also obligated entities which may have surplus capacity in 2030, such as Nordsøfonden in Denmark and Energean in Greece (through its CO2 storage-focused subsidiary Enearth).

In June, the producers were required to submit plans to the Commission detailing how they intend to meet their respective targets – these have not been publicly released. However, starting from June 2026, they will need to submit annual progress reports which will be made public by the Commission..

Next steps to deliver on the target: Effective penalties and Member State support

What remains to be done to ensure the storage target is met on schedule? By 30 June 2026, Member States are required to establish penalties for any infringements of the obligation – a provision which was one of several amendments proposed by CATF and Article 23 Project partners during the NZIA’s consultation process. Penalties can be on an administrative or legal basis and must be ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ (a standard wording in EU law). Effective penalties will be essential to ensuring the obligated producers progress their storage plans in good faith, at the pace required, and dedicating appropriate financial resources.

Compared to some other environmental legislation in the EU, the legislative text offers relatively little guidance on how penalties should be designed. There is therefore potential for significant divergence between Member States and a risk of slower progress by some companies and a disparity in the options available to decarbonising industries. Although obligated entities are not required to develop CO2 storage in the same region as their production activities, they will be subject to penalties according to the Member State in which they are registered. As shown in Figure 3, companies based in the Netherlands, Romania, Italy and Germany represent the majority of the obligation, so penalty design in these jurisdictions will have the most impact on the success of the regulation.

Figure 3. Article 23 obligations according to country of origin of the obligated company

Environmental penalties regimes in the EU have been designed in various ways, and can include administrative fines, periodic penalty payments, and criminal penalties enforced through national courts. Administrative fines are likely to form a key part of penalty design under Article 23, and must be set at a level which effectively deters companies preferring to pay the fine than invest in storage. Fines are typically linked either to the environmental cost, such as the carbon price under the ETS, or the cost of compliance. For example, ReFuel Aviation, which requires aviation fuel suppliers to provide a growing proportion of sustainable aviation fuel, includes penalties for shortfalls of at least twice the cost difference between conventional and synthetic aviation fuel.

For Article 23, penalties could be linked to the volume of ‘unstored’ CO2 emissions and an appropriate carbon price level. Assuming the current penalty level for ETS non-compliance (around €130/t) or at a projected ETS price for 2030[3], these fines could clearly become very substantial, reaching over a hundred million euros for every Mt/year of shortfall. Fines on this scale are unusual – if not unprecedented – in the EU and, while they would represent less than 1% of the annual revenue of the international oil majors, they would be much more significant for regional players like Romgaz. The upfront cost of delivering a storage project at the million tonne scale could easily be on this order of magnitude for offshore storage developments, while onshore sites may be significantly cheaper.[4] Storage project developers are expected to make a reasonable return on their investment by charging the industries which use the infrastructure, so any estimate of compliance ‘cost’ may need to reflect this return relative to the value of alternative investment in oil and gas production.

Strong penalties must also be accompanied by support from Member State governments for storage developers. First-mover countries like Denmark and the Netherlands have well-established procedures for awarding CO2 storage exploration licences and permits, supported by adequately resourced government departments and permitting agencies. In comparison, Poland, Romania and Germany must still put in place some of the procedures, regulations and institutional expertise that will allow their obligated entities to develop capacity within their own areas of operation, rather than buying into projects in other countries. Easy access to geological data also appears to remain a challenge in some Member States, despite provisions within the NZIA to ensure better data sharing. Enabling this greater regional diversity is vital to ensuring the obligation supports the decarbonisation needs of industrial emitters across the EU.

CATF project tracking determines the 50 Mt target is challenging to meet by 2030 under the announced schedule for planned projects, but the obligation should lead to accelerated deployment and new projects. To maintain ambitious deployment timelines, penalties will need to provide a real disincentive to delaying investment, without negatively impacting the ability of smaller entities to deliver on their obligation when they are actively progressing projects. Project deployment will necessarily be subject to timelines dictated by permitting authorities and local engagement strategies. Penalty designs should therefore consider allowing for such mitigating circumstances where developers are demonstrably acting at pace and with appropriate investment, particularly if shortfalls can be recouped once a project is operational. Obtaining exploration licences and initiating applications for full storage permits could be considered a prerequisite for obligated entities to demonstrate reasonable effort, but would need to be backed by real resources and other steps to advance the project.

However, companies should also be expected to build contingency into their plans by exploring a range of possible storage sites. Penalties can be increased under aggravating circumstances, for example, where companies are deemed particularly negligent, untransparent, or uncooperative, and repeated where companies fail to address shortfalls.

As part of a joint initiative with Carbon Balance and Bellona Europa, CATF will continue to track progress and compliance with Article 23, through the live storage tracker, annual reports, and regular policy briefs.

[1] Notably, several of the exempt entities listed in the Commission Decision are subsidiaries of other obligated entities, including Wintershall Dea International, Vermilion Hungary, and Energean Oil and Gas.

[2] Allocation of planned storage capacity to these entities assumes that storage projects developed by joint ventures are divided by ownership share. Shares of capacity belonging to non-obligated entities (e.g. Snam (Ravenna) and EBN (Aramis storage sites)) are partitioned among the obligated partners.

EPA considers wastewater injection permit for Montana Renewables in Pondera County

Evans serves as vice president of government relations for Montana Renewables.

However, Pondera County officials oppose the proposal, citing environmental concerns.

""The commissioners had been assured this would be such a good thing for Pondera County, but the more we looked into it, we thought this if this wastewater migrated into any of the usable aquifers, it could be disastrous,"" Corrine Rose said.

Rose is the Pondera County sanitarian.

Evans said Montana Renewables will comply with all EPA requirements for water quality standards.

""What I can confirm is that what EPA requires from a water quality perspective, for any injection water, we will meet or exceed that,"" Evans said.

Rose also criticized how the EPA has characterized the community in its assessment.

""They characterize us as being, we're losing population and low population. Well, we're important too, and I agree that that's a little offensive. So that is not a reason to then use this area as a waste disposal site,"" Rose said.

We will update you as we get more information.

(JUNE 3, 2024) Many Pondera County and Rocky Mountain Front residents are concerned over a proposed plan to classify wells in the area to Class V, which would allow wastewater from Montana Renewables to be injected thousands of feet below into the Madison Aquifer.

Montalban Oil & Gas is seeking permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, so Montana Renewables can inject their wastewater into the earth.

Pondera County citizens concerned over proposed injection well plan

Montana Renewables create sustainable aviation fuel. To do so they clean feedstocks, creating a by-product referred to as ‘agricultural wash water’. They’re working with Montalban Oil & Gas who are looking to receive permits from the EPA to give the wells Class V distinction. This would permit the injection of treated non-hazardous waste which may have been hazardous prior. Water is taken from the Missouri river.

Some critics have called the extraction of water from the Missouri River to be resource shedding, and damaging to the ecosystem. The water that is pulled goes into an aquifer and not back into the river.

“They need to put up a treatment plant. So at least the City of Great Falls can use that water with that amount of water being taken out of the river,” says David Waldner, a Hutterite living in a colony just a mile or so from one of the proposed injection sites.

Some individuals are calling on Montana Renewables to invest in a treatment plant, so the water can be put back into the river rather than wasted. The company are due to receive a $600 million loan. With he money, they plan to upscale production instead. Montana Renewables have said they plan to submit a discharge permit application to treat their wastewater at the city of Great Falls Water Treatment Plant.

Water planned to be injected has been characterized by Montana Renewables as non-hazardous. Some people are unsure. The Pondera County Sanitarian, Corrine Rose, says despite multiple requests for a sample of injection fluid, she has been repeatedly denied.

When I spoke with Chad Anderson of the Montana DEQ, he told me that Montana Renewables has the responsibility to send in fluid for sampling and testing. With their current Class II permits, they send their sample to Montana Board of Oil & Gas. If the Class V permits are granted, they will send a sample to the EPA. Because the permits haven’t been granted, they have no legal obligation to share their samples with anybody else. If the injection permit is granted, a sample can be shared with the public by way of petition.

Critics who believe Montana Renewables are ‘hiding something’ by withholding their sample say this is counter-intuitive because at this point the fluid would already be in the process of being injected.

I received a letter from the CEO of Montana Renewables Bruce Fleming, which was also sent to Pondera County Commissioners. In it, he outlined a response to some concerns, especially those regarding the contamination of drinking wells. The letter states that the Madison Aquifer (where wastewater will be injected) is not drinkable and that the aquifer does not contact surface water supplies based off geology and experience. It also states the permit they hope to receive would put a ‘cap’ on the maximum quantity of water allowed for injection. The proposed amount being a “tiny fraction of a percent in an enormous, non-potable, deep aquifer.”

The EPA are no longer holding public comment sessions, and many living along the Rocky Mountain Front believe the permits will be granted imminently.

“They're willing to do this because there's not many people there. Well, there's still people there that live in these areas of these two injection wells and those people, according to the Constitution of the state of Montana, have a right to dignity,” says another concerned Montanan, Nathan White.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d8a56e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Fa7%2F3da7cf2f4ebb87a030c696ad04bb%2Fkrtv00002.png,N,,2025-09-24 16:56:32.652814

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is typically made from agricultural waste such as sugarcane, tallow, canola and cooking oils and can reduce emissions from aircraft by 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.

But the UNSW project deploys an electrolyser that uses low-cost metals, carbon catalysts and renewable energy to turn carbon dioxide and water into fuel precursors.

The approach could cut out the need for farm waste and make environmentally friendly fuel easier to produce at scale, project leader Rahman Daiyan said.

“Most of the work so far has been on bio-based sustainable aviation fuel projects,” he said.

“But those sort of biomass resources are limited to some extent.”

The Trailblazer for Recycling and Clean Energy program, established by the Federal Education Department, has awarded the UNSW research team an additional $1.2 million to scale up its technology.

While the electrolyser has been proven to work in a lab, Dr Daiyan said a validated prototype would be ready within six to nine months and the project would be commercialised with industry partners Tjindu Power and Chinese energy firm Chuangqi Times.

If successful, the project could help realise Australian ambitions to become a green fuel exporter, he said.

“One of the best aspects of this technology is that it allows us to leverage Australia’s potential — we want to be a hydrogen exporter or a low-carbon fuel exporter,” Dr Daiyan said.

“There is domestic demand but there is also overseas demand because apart from Singapore and Malaysia, there are not a lot of places to make SAF for the Asia Pacific region.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is considered to be one of the leading ways to reduce carbon emission from air travel and is in high demand worldwide after major airlines committed to using the fuel to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

A report by the CSIRO and aircraft maker Boeing, released last year, found Australia could lead the world in production of the sustainable fuel but warned it had made only moderate progress so far.

S Dinakar New Delhi

As crop burning season approaches in Punjab and Haryana, with winds carrying noxious fumes to Delhi, US-based LanzaTech is stepping in with technologies to convert waste and gaseous effluents into advanced biofuels such as ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It has tie-ups with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s largest refiner, and GAIL India, the state-run natural gas distributor.

Advanced biofuel technologies can power India’s vision of becoming a leading producer and exporter of renewable fuels such as renewable diesel and SAF — premium-priced transport fuels derived from waste or industrial gases. These could enhance energy security if the government incentivises industry and sets mandates for their use, according to Satinder Pal Singh, managing director, LanzaTech India, and research from Deloitte.

“Long-awaited, reasonable policy around carbon tax and premium pricing for fuels generated from waste and other non-food, non-fossil sources are interventions that will create such market signals,” Singh said in an interaction with Business Standard. “Simultaneously raising costs for entities who do not take demonstrable action and incentivising those that do is important.” Aviation turbine fuel accounted for 2.5 per cent of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023, but airline emissions are harder to abate than ground transport.

Singh, an oil and gas veteran with 28 years at Shell and Adani TotalEnergies, is working with IOC to operationalise by year-end a 33 ktpa capacity “world’s first refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) to 3G ethanol project” at Panipat refinery. Sister company LanzaJet is also working with IOC to build a SAF plant at Panipat based on its alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology with a 90 ktpa capacity. This will be India’s largest alcohol-to-jet SAF facility, Singh said. LanzaJet, co-founded by LanzaTech in 2020, is starting up the world’s first commercial-scale demonstration plant in Georgia, US.

With limited SAF blending mandates in India, exports to western nations are expected. The market for SAF and renewable biofuels has widened after Shell and BP scrapped large biofuel projects in Rotterdam. Deloitte estimates India could build 8–10 million tonnes of SAF capacity by 2040, far exceeding its projected domestic need of 0.8 million tonnes by 2030 at 5 per cent blending. This would attract Rs 6–7 trillion in capital investments. India could also add 3–4 million tonnes of renewable diesel capacity, Deloitte said, with global SAF demand projected at 18 million tonnes by 2050 to achieve net zero.

However, Singh cautioned that government intervention is needed. “Without forward pricing for 2G ethanol and easier access to credit for high-capex projects, the sector’s growth will remain constrained,” said Deepak Ballani, director general, Indian Sugar & Bio-energy Manufacturers Association. He added that the absence of long-term offtake agreements and export restrictions on ethanol also hinder growth.

The UK has committed over £215 million to low-carbon aviation fuel since 2021, with LanzaTech receiving £35 million, making it the largest recipient. In India, ethanol is classified as 1G when derived from food crops, 2G when from agri-residue, and 3G when from waste gases.

Singh said: “We see India as a manufacturing hub for our global projects. This has led us to partner with local engineering firms to adapt solutions for domestic and international markets. Some private equity firms have also shown interest in co-investing with us in India.”

Europe and the UK are valuable markets for India’s SAF because of blending mandates and limited domestic supply. Renewable SAF currently costs up to three times conventional jet fuel, which India exports to Europe. EU rules mandate only non-food feedstocks for SAF production, unlike ICAO guidelines, which permit agricultural crops.

LanzaTech’s strength lies in converting waste and industrial gases into fuels, aligned with EU rules. It is also working with GAIL India to valorise CO2. “While our technology is competitive, we need support in areas such as agri-residue and municipal solid waste through firm blending mandates,” Singh said. “As the ecosystem matures, this handholding should not be required beyond the first few projects.”

Regulatory Push: Government Mandates, Incentives and Net-Zero Targets

The aviation industry is under constant pressure, with regulators, investors, and passengers demanding stronger mandates to drive adoption beyond early adopters for a greener way to fly. Government and regulatory bodies are establishing region-specific frameworks to support SAF deployment, each tailored to local feedstock availability, energy policies, and decarbonization priorities.

Aviation Carbon Footprint Reduction: Four Emission Control Scenarios by 2040

Over the next 15 years, SAF will be the primary enabler of carbon footprint reduction in aviation, helping airlines meet near and mid-term net-zero milestones. Airlines are expected to steadily increase SAF utilization from today’s less than 1% of global jet fuel demand to double-digit blending levels by the late 2030s, driven by regulatory mandates in regions such as the EU, U.S., and parts of Asia.

Infrastructure and Supply Chain Hurdles: Saf Production is One Thing, While Distribution at Thousands of Airports Is Another.

Solving the infrastructure and distribution challenges as SAF needs to be produced at refineries, transported, and blended within existing supply chains requires new logistical capabilities and standardized quality control on a global scale. The SAF supply chain will prioritize the development of multimodal transportation networks, including pipelines, shipping routes, and road transportation, out of which pipelines & trucks will facilitate ~70% of SAF transportations globally, till 2040.

Saf Technology Breakthroughs: Multiple Pathways (Hefa, Achtj, Ft, Ptl) are Maturing.

A combination of technologies, operational measures, and market-based mechanisms is expected to shape the pathway to net-zero aviation by 2050. These will deliver the most significant contribution, accounting for 60-65% of total emissions reductions. Looking ahead, SAF through pathways like HEFA, Fischer-Tropsch, Alcohol-to-Jet, and Power-to-Liquid will significantly support aviation’s decarbonization, making it the key factor of sustainable air transport.

Global and Regional Addressable Market: North America Leads With ~40% Share In 2025, With Europe and Asia Catching Up.

According to MarketsandMarkets, the Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market size is estimated at USD 2.06 billion in 2025. It is projected to reach USD 25.62 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 65.5%. In terms of volume, the market is projected to grow from 0.30 billion gallons in 2025 to 3.68 billion gallons by 2030.

What’s Holding Saf Back and Expected Moves by 2030?

Availability of aviation biofuel feedstock: Waste oils, fats, residues, and algae are promising, but finite.

Industry partnership and deals: Long-term green aviation fuel production plans and airline deals are the key.

Reducing the SAF vs. Jet Fuel price gap: SAF is still 3–5x more expensive than fossil jet fuel.

In the end, SAF won’t solve the emissions problem of aviation alone. It represents one of the most critical pillars of aviation’s transition toward a net-zero future. It provides the sector with a viable, scalable, and immediate solution to decarbonization while maintaining the performance, reliability, and energy density required for global air transport. SAF, such as biojet fuel, alcohol-to-jet fuel, power-to-liquid jet fuel, will remain the most practical alternative aviation fuel lever for the next decades.

Nature and industry transitions are unlocking investable opportunities, from regenerative agriculture to fossil-free steel; investable pipelines are growing across sectors.

With trillions in unmet financing needs for the Sustainable Development Goals, infrastructure and nature-positive transitions, leading investors will embed sustainability into their core strategy.

In 2025, sustainability has been overshadowed by geopolitics and election cycles dominating headlines. However, momentum around sustainable finance has not stalled.

Sustainable debt issuance topped $1 trillion in 2024 for the fifth consecutive year and private finance for nature has grown over elevenfold since 2020. This continued flow of capital reflects more than good intentions; rather, risks are becoming sharper.

Extreme weather, food insecurity and nature loss are actively reshaping economies and portfolios, making resilience a financial imperative, not a choice.

“

Nature finance is no longer emerging; those who act early will capture returns while helping set market-defining rules.

”

This year is about recalibrating for impact. Capital is entering food systems, nature, industry and infrastructure – embedding sustainability deeper into investment and corporate finance.

With available solutions, strengthening demand signals and increasingly measurable opportunities, the challenge now is execution. Leaders in banking, investment and policy have a narrow window to expediently scale solutions. Those who stay the course will protect portfolios and capture the first-mover advantage in the markets of tomorrow.

Connecting the real economy

Financing food systems transformation

Investors are moving beyond broad pledges and channelling capital into real-economy sectors – food systems are rising to the top.

Food underpins the global economy, accounting for 10% of gross domestic product and 40% of jobs. Yet, it is also highly vulnerable: droughts, floods and supply chain disruptions are driving inflation and destabilizing markets.

Transformation is necessary but it is also a major opportunity, as regenerative agriculture, resilient livestock practices and deforestation-free supply chains open new markets, diversify revenue streams and strengthen portfolios.

Momentum is already visible. Climate finance for agrifood systems rose over 300% since 2019, reaching $95 billion annually, according to the Climate Policy Initiative, while blended-finance vehicles are mobilizing billions annually across emerging markets.

A growing body of case studies demonstrates how capital is already being unlocked.

From Intesa Sanpaolo’s €23 billion programme extending reduced-rate loans to 172 agri-food supply chains in Italy, to GrowBeyond’s $100 million blended vehicle supporting smallholder farmers across the Association of Southeast Asian Nation states, and Aceli Africa’s $300 million mobilized across 3,500 loans to reach 1.5 million farmers and workers.

Despite the progress, agri-food systems require $1.1 trillion annually over the next five years, yet less than 5% of that is being met today. Closing this gap is critical but the trajectory is clear.

Financing the nature-positive transition

The world’s largest asset managers now recognize “nature capital” – biodiversity, water and soil – as fundamental to long-term performance.

The World Economic Forum estimates this opportunity to be $10 trillion in annual business value and nearly 400 million jobs by 2030 through nature-positive transitions.

Realizing this requires up to $2.7 trillion annually but capital flows are accelerating with private finance for nature growing from $9.4 billion in 2020 to more than $100 billion by 2024.

With nature underpinning the global economy, investors are starting to integrate it into portfolio assessments, closing the long-standing “data gap,” while pipelines of investable opportunities are expanding across sectors – from agri-food and chemicals to mining and water – supported by emerging financing models, policy frameworks and risk-sharing mechanisms.

Regulation is also advancing: the European Union’s (EU) Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, the European Banking Authority’s Environmental, Social and Governance guidance and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures are tightening expectations for nature-related risk reporting.

Nature finance is no longer emerging; those who act early will capture returns while helping set market-defining rules.

Financing industrial decarbonization

Net zero is impossible without tackling heavy industry and transport. Steel, cement, aluminium, aviation, shipping and chemicals produce over one-third of global carbon dioxide emissions. These sectors are among the hardest to decarbonize, still tied to fossil feedstocks and energy-intensive processes.

Yet progress is lagging: only $250 billion has been mobilized against a $1.6 trillion need for low-carbon materials. Clean technologies such as green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and green ammonia exist but scaling is constrained by high upfront costs, fragmented demand and thin pipelines, especially in emerging economies.

The stakes are clear: delay risks stranded assets, disrupted supply chains, and lost growth.

“

For financial leaders, this is about shaping markets as much as preserving them.

”

Momentum is building. Sweden’s HYBRIT has delivered fossil-free steel to Volvo, Maersk is sailing methanol-fueled ships and Cemex is rolling out low-carbon cement across Latin America.

Governments are also shaping markets: the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is rewriting trade rules, Japan’s GX Promotion Act is directing subsidies and India, Brazil and Australia are betting on hydrogen hubs and green iron.

Finance is catching up too, with blended-capital vehicles, aviation fuel price floors and de-risking models for shipping and industrial clusters underway. Together, these moves show how demand signals, enabling policy and innovative finance are converging to shift from pilots to full-scale industrial transformation.

Financing infrastructure

The next bottleneck in the transition is not renewable capacity but the infrastructure that connects and stabilizes it. Modern grids, long-duration storage, resilient ports and digital platforms are the underfunded backbone of the energy transition, requiring $600 billion annually by 2030.

Already, grid congestion in Europe is delaying renewables, while power shortages in the Global South constrain growth and deployment. For investors, these assets combine stable, inflation-protected returns with systemic impact, making infrastructure a portfolio stabilizer and a growth opportunity.

Upgraded grids reduce losses and unlock stranded clean power. Meanwhile, storage smooths volatility and digital platforms optimize utilization, shielding portfolios from disruption. In short, infrastructure is where resilience meets return.

Financing for development

Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will require an additional $4 trillion annually, well beyond public budgets. At the once-a-decade International Conference on Financing for Development in Sevilla, leaders reaffirmed their commitment, backing a tripling of multilateral development banks’ lending capacity and greater use of blended finance to mobilize private capital.

For investors, this means expanding opportunities in emerging and developing economies, with development banks and finance institutions absorbing early risks. Development finance is shifting from aid to a platform for scalable, investable growth aligned with climate and sustainability goals.

A message to financial institutions

The next era of finance will be defined less by headlines than by discipline. Across food, nature, industry and infrastructure, investable opportunities are emerging and capital is already flowing. The test is which institutions have the conviction to stay the course.

,,2025-09-24 10:34:17+00:00,Nebraska Examiner,New carbon dioxide pipeline to begin Nebraska operations and contributions to communities soon,"Paul Hammel, Christopher Ingraham, Cami Koons, Joshua Haiar",,,,,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/09/24/new-carbon-dioxide-pipeline-to-begin-nebraska-operations-and-contributions-to-communities-soon/,"LINCOLN — A Kansas pipeline company is about to activate its $1.5 billion pipeline to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa to a sequestration site in Wyoming and, along with it, launch a first-of-its-kind program to share some proceeds with rural communities along the pipeline route.
The investment fund was negotiated with the environmental group, Bold Nebraska, which was a leading opponent of construction of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline across the state.
The agreement has been hailed as a new blueprint for acceptance of large infrastructure projects that impact rural areas.
A year ago, Tallgrass announced its agreement with Bold Nebraska to share some of the proceeds in exchange for its cooperation.
“It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.","LINCOLN — A Kansas pipeline company is about to activate its $1.5 billion pipeline to transport carbon dioxide from ethanol plants in Nebraska and Iowa to a sequestration site in Wyoming and, along with it, launch a first-of-its-kind program to share some proceeds with rural communities along the pipeline route.

On Tuesday, officials with Tallgrass Energy said they would soon be shipping CO2 from the first of 11 ethanol plants connected to its pipeline — a converted, former natural gas pipeline — for a 392-mile trip across Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa and Wyoming.

In conjunction with the launch, Tallgrass announced it is making an initial donation of $500,000 to a fund managed by the Nebraska Community Foundation that could financially help more than 230 communities and community organizations on the route.

The company projects that more than $7 million will be distributed over 10 years through the “Trailblazer Community Investment Fund,” with the money targeted for local early childhood centers, elder care facilities and food pantries. That is on top of lease payments to landowners and spending more than $450,000 on disaster response training sessions and equipment purchases for the mostly rural, volunteer fire and rescue departments along the pipeline route.

The investment fund was negotiated with the environmental group, Bold Nebraska, which was a leading opponent of construction of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline across the state. The agreement has been hailed as a new blueprint for acceptance of large infrastructure projects that impact rural areas.

“It’s important to us to strategically invest back into the communities who have supported the project’s development,” said Kyle Quackenbush, segment president at Tallgrass.

“We hope that these investments serve to provide a safety net to our neighbors throughout their lifetimes – from early childhood to eldercare – so that these communities can continue to grow and thrive,” he said.

A year ago, Tallgrass announced its agreement with Bold Nebraska to share some of the proceeds in exchange for its cooperation.

Such pipelines in other states have generated opposition, as well as lawsuits and protests. In this case, though, extensive new rights of way weren’t necessary, and many landowners along the pipeline route grow corn, a crop expected to benefit from expanding the markets for corn-based ethanol by making the fuel more environmentally friendly.

Jane Kleeb, the founder of Bold Nebraska, said rural communities “deserve to benefit from the projects that impact them – whether that’s sharing in profits, investing in social services or simply having a seat at the project’s decision-making table.”

Kleeb said the agreement serves as a model for rural as well as urban communities impacted by such projects. She added that Tallgrass and Bold recently gave a presentation to officials with the NAACP.

The new pipeline, formerly the Trailblazer pipeline, is the first of its kind to begin operation as part of a push by the Biden Administration to reduce carbon emissions and make ethanol production more “green.” Making the biofuel less carbon-intensive could make it more attractive for states seeking environmental benefits, officials have said, and the pipeline will give Nebraska-produced ethanol an advantage in its use as sustainable aviation fuel, a new market for the biofuel.

“It’s going to put Nebraska ethanol into a league of its own,” said Steven Davidson, a Tallgrass spokesman.

Jeff Yost, president and CEO of Nebraska Community Foundation, said the new fund will target some of the biggest challenges facing rural communities — quality early childhood education, senior care and food insecurity — providing small grants to sustain jobs and services.

He said the foundation has already identified more than 230 organizations in the 31 impacted counties as eligible for a portion of the funds. To share in a portion of the funds, Yost said that qualified organizations will be invited to submit applications and verify that they are doing the work they profess to do.

Yost added that sometimes companies do this kind of fund sharing “for public relations purposes.”

Available to members of the Finnair for Business program, the new SAF service allows companies to monitor the flight emissions that their business trips generate.
“With the Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.” In 2024, approximately 0.5% of the aviation fuel procured by Finnair was SAF, with the airline aiming to triple that number this year.
Karppinen said: “The greenhouse gas emissions reduction in sustainable aviation fuel is significant.
But the more we use renewable fuel, the greater the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we will achieve.”","Finnair has launched the Finnair for Business SAF service for corporate customers keen to help reduce aviation emissions and boost the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Available to members of the Finnair for Business program, the new SAF service allows companies to monitor the flight emissions that their business trips generate.

They can then buy SAF environmental attributes – the quantified benefits of using sustainable aviation fuel rather than conventional jet fuel – to help lower the carbon footprint of flying.

Using a book-and-claim model, companies can make an associated claim to the environmental benefit their purchased attributes represent.

This means the actual emission reduction does not necessarily take place on the flight their employees travel on, as the fuel they purchase is not physically loaded into the aircraft.

The achieved reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to sustainable aviation fuel use is verified by a third party, with the company receiving an audited SAF certificate that can be used for its sustainability reporting.

Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair’s Head of Environment said: “We want to develop flying in a more sustainable direction and are now taking steps on several different fronts.

“We believe that the most effective solutions can be found at the system level and require cooperation not only between decision-makers and energy producers, but also between airlines and customers.

“With the Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials.”

In 2024, approximately 0.5% of the aviation fuel procured by Finnair was SAF, with the airline aiming to triple that number this year.

For example, Finnair collaborates with Neste to accelerate the adoption of SAF.

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is made from 100% renewable raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%* over the entire life cycle of the fuel compared to fossil kerosene.

Karppinen said: “The greenhouse gas emissions reduction in sustainable aviation fuel is significant.

“However, the aviation fuel we use will not be fully renewable for a long time, since SAF is blended with fossil fuels. But the more we use renewable fuel, the greater the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we will achieve.”",https://airlinergs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/09/Finnair-A350-Marimekko-Livery-Kivet-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 07:56:47.627967

High-purity CO2 for the food industry as an additional source of income

Prototype for the Flexpower Plus solution from Landmark, Rolls-Royce and ASCO

Rolls-Royce, energy services provider Landmark and carbon dioxide specialist ASCO have teamed up to commission a 10-megawatt gas engine power plant with a carbon capture system in the United Kingdom. Located in Worksop in the East Midlands region, the first tankers carrying purified and liquefied CO2 have already been picked up from the site for use in the food industry to carbonate beverages such as beer and lemonade.

The CO2 is extracted from the exhaust gases of the mtu gas engines - captured by a recovery system - processed, and liquefied. The plant will capture up to 30,000 tons of CO2 per year. The power plant feeds electricity into the grid for around 10,000 households and helps to ensure its stability. The heat produced by the combined heat and power mtu plants will be used both for carbon capture processes and to supply heat to households in the surrounding area.

“Flexible carbon capture gas engine power plants are an important technology for ensuring a stable decentralized energy supply while reducing CO2 emissions” explained Michael Stipa, Senior Vice President Business Development and Product Management Stationary Power Solutions at Rolls-Royce Power Systems. “This plant in Worksop is a great example of the future of sustainable energy and of a successful partnership between technology companies that want to make a difference.”

Rolls-Royce has supplied six highly efficient combined heat and power plants based on mtu Series 4000 L64FNER gas engines for the power plant in Worksop and will ensure the reliable operation of the plant for ten years under a maintenance contract.

ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. is responsible for the carbon capturing and processing plant and ensures the production of high-purity carbon dioxide. The UK-based power generation company Landmark Power Holdings Ltd. has developed and will operate the power plant.

The project is a joint venture with Victory Hill, a specialized investment company for sustainable energy infrastructure.

The Worksop facility is the first project under the FLEXPOWER PLUS™ concept developed by Landmark Power Holdings, which is designed for flexible power generation using mtu gas engines with improved energy efficiency and ASCO CO2 recovery technology. The partnership focuses on the development and distribution of scalable containerized solutions for clean power and heat generation that integrate carbon recovery technologies. With these solutions in line with the Rolls-Royce strategy the company helps its customers to reduce emissions, conserve resources and remain competitive.

“The captured CO2 is an additional source of revenue and a valuable resource for various industries, including food products, synthetic fuels, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and more,” said Ralph Spring, Managing Director of ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. “Carbon capture is one of the key technologies for the energy transition and will play an even more central role in the coming years as CO2 emission taxes rise, regulatory requirements increase, and mandatory net-zero climate targets come into force.”

The demand came as the aviation trade body published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use, the report produced in partnership with Worley Consulting claimed.

However, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions to maximise SAF output, Iata noted.

Director general Willie Walsh said: “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”

North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN nations were identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Walsh added: “With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation.

“The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.

""The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality.”

Iata chief economist and sustainability senior vice president Marie Owens Thomsen said: “The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.

However, current production is only around two million tonnes a year, compared with an estimated requirement of almost 500 million tonnes by 2050 if the industry is to achieve net zero.

India’s feedstock resources include sugar- and starch-based ethanol, waste oils such as used cooking oil and tallow, agricultural residues, forestry by-products and municipal solid waste.

Together, these could provide around 100 million tonnes of raw material by 2030 and 150 million tonnes by 2050. The study noted that non-food energy crops could further expand this supply.

Agricultural residues are expected to make up the largest share in 2030, accounting for more than 70 per cent of the feedstock potential, followed by forestry residues and waste wood at 16 per cent and municipal waste at about 7 per cent.

IATA said India’s experience with ethanol blending and supportive government policy could position it as a leading producer in the region.

The country is already the world’s third-largest ethanol producer and plans to expand by increasing output from sugarcane juice and starch-rich crops such as maize and cassava.

However, as attendees heard today, there are indicators that 2026 will be tough for the CO2 market.","Up to one-fifth (20%) of the US merchant carbon dioxide supply may be needed to meet growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demand.

The observation was shared by Jeff Holyoak, Vice-President of Sales and Market Development, at gasworld’s North America CO2 Summit, who described new technologies as “creative destruction.”

Holyoak warned that SAF and emerging carbon utilisation technologies could force industrial gas companies to rethink how they source and allocate CO2, presenting both a major challenge and a strategic opportunity.

“Creative destruction is the market’s way of self-renewing,” he said. “And pain is the price of progress.”

According to Holyoak, traditional sources of CO2 – ethanol plants, ammonia facilities, and geological domes – still account for more than 75% of the US supply.

These sources, he noted, are increasingly vulnerable to disruption, regulatory pressure, and competition from higher-value applications like SAF.

“SAF alone could impact the US CO2 market by up to 20%,” Holyoak said. “And they’ll likely pay a lot more for it than traditional commercial users.”

SAF production is emerging as a major consumer of captured CO2, particularly through power-to-liquid (PtL) pathways and other synthetic fuel processes. These technologies use CO2 as a feedstock to produce low-carbon jet fuel.

While SAF demand is ramping up quickly, Holyoak cautioned that the CO₂ supply chain is lagging dangerously behind, a mismatch that could leave traditional users at risk.

He said that end-users should be early adopters of alternative capture technologies, not just to support innovation, but to protect their own supply chains.

He suggested the companies “don’t care” about these dynamics right now because the CO2 market is in a relatively steady state. However, as attendees heard today, there are indicators that 2026 will be tough for the CO2 market.

“When everything is great, we undervalue the risk,” Holyoak said. “When it gets bad, we’re going to wish we did something earlier to mitigate [CO2] risks, but it will already be too late.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2304836079-3.jpg",N,,2025-09-24 05:56:23.231748

The Australian Government has announced a landmark $1.1 billion investment to accelerate the domestic production of low carbon liquid fuels, marking a major step towards cleaner energy and stronger fuel security.

The funding will support the new ten-year Cleaner Fuels Program, designed to stimulate private investment in onshore production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. These “drop-in” fuels are compatible with existing engines and infrastructure, with the first production expected by 2029.

Australia is well-positioned to lead in this space, thanks to it’s abundant feedstocks such as canola, sorghum, sugar, and waste, and access to reliable renewable energy. Currently, liquid fuels account for around half of the nation’s energy use. Replacing fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives presents a significant opportunity to reduce emissions and grow the economy.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation estimates that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050, with the potential to reduce cumulative emissions by 230 million tonnes CO₂-e, equivalent to the annual emissions of 86 million cars.

Funding will be awarded through a competitive process, with eligibility criteria to be shaped by public consultation. The initiative builds on existing government programs including the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.

To further support the industry, the Government is expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has introduced a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

The airline first trialed locally produced SAF on its Incheon-Haneda route from August 2024 to August 2025, successfully verifying the fuel’s safety and performance.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, has published a study demonstrating that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. All feedstocks considered meet stringent sustainability criteria and do not lead to changes in land use. The study also identified significant barriers in using that feedstock for SAF production, namely:

The slow pace of technology rollout that would enable SAF to be produced from varied sources. Currently the only commercially scaled SAF production facilities use HEFA technology, for example converting used cooking oil into SAF.

Competition with other potential users of the same feedstock. Policies allocating biomass feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation must be prioritised.

Airlines will need 500 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as outlined in the IATA Net Zero Roadmaps. This can be achieved from two main sources:

Biomass: This has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050. Some of this potential could be limited by use for competing sources. This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades.

Power-to-liquid (PtL): This will be required to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050. Maximizing the volumes of cost-effective bio-SAF will reduce the pressure on e-SAF to bridge the gap.

In all cases, to maximise SAF output, it will be essential to improve conversion efficiencies, accelerate technology rollout, enhance feedstock logistics, and invest in better infrastructure required to scale up commercial facilities across all regions.

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Key findings from the report include:

There are sufficient sustainable feedstocks and SAF production technologies to decarbonize aviation and meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050.

With the right policies and investments, more than 300 Mt of SAF from biomass feedstocks could be produced annually by mid-century and around 200 Mt from e-SAF.

​

The main challenges are:

Enhancing the feedstock supply chain infrastructure, scaling up novel sources that meet sustainability criteria, and ensuring that the feedstocks identified for SAF production are made available to the air transport industry.

Accelerating technology rollout to unlock new SAF production technologies, especially PtL, including reliable access to the low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure which are all required as part of the PtL production method.

Achieving coordinated government policies to support innovation, and investment to create a fully functioning SAF market, unlocking new economic opportunities.

Rallying regional leadership, with North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN identified as key drivers of global SAF output.

Activating the energy industry to invest in SAF production capacity, support technology commercialisation, and align their business strategies with global decarbonisation goals.

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now—delays will only make the challenge harder,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality,” said Walsh.

Korean Air expands use of domestically produced SAF on Japan routes

Korean Air has expanded its use of domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), introducing a SAF blend on flights to Kobe and Osaka. The airline first trialed locally produced SAF on its Incheon-Haneda route from August 2024 to August 2025, successfully verifying the fuel’s safety and performance. SAF, which can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is considered a key component of the aviation industry’s decarbonization strategy. Korean Air will use a 1% SAF blend on flights from Incheon to Kobe (KE731) and Gimpo to Osaka (KE2117) from September 19, 2025 through December 31, 2026. The program will cover approximately 90 flights on the Kobe route and 26 flights on the Osaka route.

The airline’s SAF is sourced from domestic suppliers HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex. Produced from used cooking oil (UCO), the fuel is certified under the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This initiative reflects Korean Air’s commitment to driving sustainable aviation in Korea and supporting global efforts to achieve carbon neutrality.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/Neste-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 22:56:13.324954

The COP30 SAF platform empowers conference attendees to calculate and address their aviation-related emissions by supporting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets SABA’s world leading sustainability criteria. In this first of a kind opportunity, the platform is available to all COP30 attendees, including those who are not currently SABA members, as part of a concentrated effort to raise the visibility of SAF and scale funding and adoption of this key climate technology.

“Having been to 18 COPs myself, I know COP attendees face a dilemma: flight emissions,” said Kim Carnahan, CEO of the Center for Green Market Activation and head of SABA Secretariat. “With the COP30 SAF platform, those travelers now have a way to calculate and decarbonize their flight emissions no matter their point of departure or the aircraft they fly on, while supporting real-world deployment of sustainable aviation fuel. This is the latest SABA innovation helping connect SAF producers with willing buyers who want to decarbonize their air travel.”

The SAF supported through the new platform is sourced from SkyNRG as the result of a streamlined, competitive procurement process initiated by SABA earlier this year.

“SkyNRG are proud to be the SAF supplier for SABA’s COP30 campaign,” said Theye Veen, chief commercial officer and co-founder of SkyNRG. “We are uniquely positioned as SAF knowledge experts with more than a decade of experience in building supply chains, partnerships, and sustainability standards for high-integrity SAF. We’re pleased to be deepening our collaboration with SABA and we’re excited to help expand SAFc access beyond its membership. The innovative COP30 SAF platform from SABA demonstrates our aligned vision of making SAF more accessible, and in turn, helping the industry to scale.”

SABA’s COP30 initiative is unique because it gives conference goers all the resources they need to decarbonize their COP air travel on a single platform. Attendees first estimate their flight emissions using one of two methods. For commercial flights, travelers will use Google’s Travel Impact Model, an industry-leading calculation tool, while travelers on private jets will use the Eurocontrol Small Emitters tool. Next, attendees purchase a corresponding quantity of high-integrity SAF certificates pre-vetted by SABA; and later receive a retirement statement from the SAFc Registry, which ensures the transaction meets best-in-class chain of custody requirements. The platform supports those traveling via commercial and private aircraft – crucial flexibility given that as many as 65 private jets travel to COP in a given year.

“Not all sustainable aviation fuels are created equal – which is why the SABA SAF platform is such a useful tool for conference attendees wanting to reduce their emissions from travelling to COP30,” said Elizabeth Sturcken, vice president, Net Zero Ambition & Action for Environmental Defense Fund. “For SAF to be high-integrity, it must meet rigorous environmental standards grounded in science. SABA has done the hard work of vetting the best-in-class SAF so buyers can feel confident their purchase will deliver a meaningful climate impact, while sending a clear message to policy makers and the market that high integrity SAF is in demand.”

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from renewable or waste-derived feedstocks and offering high scalability and CO2 emissions reduction potential. SAF is what is known as a “drop-in fuel”— meaning it is compatible with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure —and represents the best near-term option to decarbonize air travel. While SAF currently makes up only a small percentage of the total aviation fuels market, SABA’s procurements allow voluntary buyers to support SAF production through investment in sustainable aviation fuel certificates connected with an established, high-integrity book and claim system. Book and claim allows parties to invest in SAF and capture its environmental benefits, even if the fuel does not flow directly into the planes they fly on.

Lawmakers are proposing state support for a plant that would turn wood debris into aviation fuel. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)

Lawmakers from northern and north-central Wisconsin are circulating a bill supporting Johnson Timber Corp. in Hayward to build a processing plant for aviation fuel made from logging debris to establish a processing plant in Wisconsin.

The legislation would reward the company with a $60 million tax credit and access to $150 million in borrowing through Wisconsin’s bonding authority.

Republican lawmakers wrote in a memo circulated Monday seeking cosponsors that the proposal would create 150 jobs and generate $1.2 billion a year in income after three years of operation.

The processing plant in Hayward would be built by Johnson Timber Corp., in partnership with a German company, Sen. Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said at a press conference in the state Capitol Monday morning. The German partner is Synthec Fuels, according to Felzkowski’s office.

Wisconsin along with Michigan and Minnesota are all vying for the project, Felzkowski said, “and the state that helps will be the first state” to get the facility and probably the headquarters for the overall processing operation.

She said the process of converting logging waste into aviation fuel was comparable to how corn is grown for and converted into ethanol.

“We will be taking that wood product and turning it into a carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation,” Felzkowski said.

As drafted, the bill would authorize the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. (WEDC) to create a manufacturing zone for aviation biofuel derived from wood matter and to issue up to $60 million in tax credits for a business operating in the zone.

The bill requires the business to source 80% or more of the wood used from Wisconsin and invest at least $1.5 billion in the project.

The bill also provides for the business to borrow up to $150 million for the project using Wisconsin’s tax-free bonding authority.

At the press conference, lawmakers, Sawyer County officials and a timber industry representative billed legislation as a “forestry revitalization” measure.

Paper and pulp plants in Wisconsin Rapids, Park Falls and Duluth, Minnesota, have all gone out of business in the last five years, accounting for about 30% of the pulp produced by Wisconsin’s timber industry, said Henry Sheinebeck, executive director of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association.

Current SAF production relies almost entirely on Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, which processes used cooking oil and similar feedstocks.
The research contradicts previous concerns about feedstock availability limiting SAF production, instead identifying the technology commercialization process as the critical constraint.
Most SAF production pathways beyond HEFA remain at technology readiness levels below full commercial deployment.
While sufficient raw materials exist to fuel a decarbonized aviation sector, realizing this potential depends critically on accelerating the pace of technology development and commercial deployment across multiple SAF production pathways.","The aviation industry possesses adequate sustainable feedstock resources to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but faces critical delays in deploying the production technologies needed to convert these materials into usable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), according to a comprehensive study released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) on Monday.

The research, conducted in partnership with Worley Consulting, reveals that while sufficient biomass and alternative feedstocks exist globally, the slow pace of technology commercialization represents the primary bottleneck preventing airlines from meeting their decarbonization commitments.

Airlines will require approximately 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions, a massive scale-up from current global production of just 2 million tonnes in 2025. The study demonstrates this target could theoretically be met through available feedstock sources, but only if production technologies advance rapidly from their current developmental stages.

Willie Walsh, IATA Director General, emphasized the urgency of accelerating industrial deployment. The aviation industry has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with SAF expected to contribute roughly 65% of the required emissions reductions.

Current SAF production relies almost entirely on Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, which processes used cooking oil and similar feedstocks. However, meeting 2050 targets will require diversifying into multiple production pathways including power-to-liquid processes that convert captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen into synthetic fuels.

The study identifies biomass potential exceeding 12,000 million tonnes by 2050, though competing uses in other sectors reduce availability for SAF production to approximately 1,580 million tonnes. This quantity could support production of over 300 million tonnes of bio-based SAF annually, requiring power-to-liquid technologies to bridge the remaining gap.

Regional analysis highlights North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries as critical drivers of global SAF output. These regions possess the feedstock resources, refining infrastructure, and policy frameworks necessary to enable large-scale production.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, stressed that policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration remain essential to unlocking the required scale of investment. The report emphasizes that delays in technology deployment will only make the decarbonization challenge more difficult.

Power-to-liquid pathways face particular hurdles, requiring massive expansion of renewable electricity capacity and carbon capture infrastructure. The study estimates that global renewable power generation would need to nearly double to produce up to 200 million tonnes of synthetic SAF by 2050.

Competition for sustainable feedstocks presents another challenge, with other hard-to-abate sectors including shipping and heavy industry also requiring biomass resources for their own decarbonization efforts. Strategic allocation policies prioritizing aviation’s unique fuel requirements will be essential.

The research contradicts previous concerns about feedstock availability limiting SAF production, instead identifying the technology commercialization process as the critical constraint. Most SAF production pathways beyond HEFA remain at technology readiness levels below full commercial deployment.

Investment requirements for the necessary production infrastructure are substantial. Previous IATA analysis indicates that between 3,000 and 6,500 new renewable fuel plants will be needed globally to meet aviation’s 2050 targets, requiring significant annual capital expenditures over the next three decades.

The study’s findings arrive as various governments implement SAF mandates and incentive programs. Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and similar policies in other regions aim to create demand certainty for producers, though the research suggests supply-side constraints may prove more limiting than previously anticipated.

For airlines committed to net-zero emissions, the study underscores both opportunity and urgency.

And at least 80% of the wood that would be processed at the plant would need to come from Wisconsin forests over that same five-year period.

Five years ago, the Verso paper mill in Wisconsin Rapids shut down. That plant was a major consumer of pulpwood, and its closure left a “big hole” in Wisconsin’s pulpwood market, said state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, R-Tomahawk, who’s among the sponsors of legislation announced Monday.

The legislation began circulating for cosponsors Monday. State Rep. Chanz Green, R-Grand View, was listed as lead sponsor, along with more than half a dozen other Republicans.

Starting this year, airports within the European Union must use at least 2% of what’s known as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, within their fuel mix. The EU is set to increase its mandated SAF percentages in coming years. The United States does not currently impose such requirements.

SAF is an alternative to fossil fuel, and the goal of those requirements is to cut back on carbon emissions. SAF can include biofuels, such as energy made from pulped wood.

“There is going to be an increasing demand for this type of fuel, and we are right at the forefront here in Wisconsin,” Felzkowski said during a Monday morning news conference at the state Capitol.

A German company called Synthec Fuels is looking to run the plant in partnership with Wisconsin-based Johnson Timber, sponsors of the legislation said.

Synthec Fuels is also considering other locations in Minnesota or Michigan, Felzkowski said.

She suggested that the proposed tax incentives could help seal the deal for Wisconsin.

“There’s three states vying for this” Felzkowski said. “The state that helps will be the first state there, and they will also have the headquarters.”

The newly announced legislation would set aside $60 million in tax credits from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation for the project. Wisconsin would also give out a $150 million grant to help create the plant. That grant would be backed by public borrowing through the Wisconsin Department of National Resources’ forestry account.

In exchange, the company creating the plant would agree to invest at least $1.5 billion into the project over the first five years. And at least 80% of the wood that would be processed at the plant would need to come from Wisconsin forests over that same five-year period.

The facility is expected to create 150 jobs, legislative sponsors said. Those roles would help revitalize a local economy that’s been hit hard by a declining market for paper producers, said Mike Markgren, the county administrator in Sawyer County.

“Logging fell on hard times after the paper mills began to close,” Markgren said. “Demand decreased, prices flattened and we suffered.”

Markgren said Sawyer County’s economy has been increasingly centered on tourism.

“Those hospitality jobs pay on average $37,000 annually, and that is likely with no benefits, so that is not a sustainable wage,” Markgren said.

In contrast, he hopes a new wood pulp factory will bring more “well-paying jobs with full benefits,” to the region.

“Anything that can be done to strengthen the diversification of industry in Sawyer County is very welcome,” Markgren said.

Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of Wisconsin lawmakers introduced separate bills that would create a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for Sustainable Aviation Fuel producers.

Why it matters: Resource conservation can convert waste into value, helping industries cut emissions and reach sustainability goals.

Axios' Amy Harder, Ben Geman and Chuck McCutcheon hosted conversations with Delta Air Lines chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca, World Resources Institute president and CEO Ani Dasgupta, and McLaren Racing sustainability director Kim Wilson. The event was sponsored by Suntory Global Spirits.

Today, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is derived from soy and other crops, but DeLuca said future sources could include materials such as corn or wood waste. She stressed SAF's ""value chain approach,"" which affects corporations, farmers and rural communities.

""You've got a whole rural community that's like, 'I actually don't know where my future is,'"" DeLuca said. ""Sustainable aviation fuel, it's not just a blip. It's not a five-year thing. This is a multiple-decades' worth of a product that we're going to need as an industry that also helps those communities, and that's again where you have that win, win, win.""

Meanwhile, Wilson noted that McLaren Racing pioneered the use of recycled carbon fiber in the racing industry, which can reduce emissions by up to 90%.

After discovering that materials accounted for a significant portion of its footprint, McLaren Racing worked with a supplier to recycle aerospace waste.

""The thing about new materials is you have to think about how do we not compromise between on-track performance … for sustainability, but we also need to find ways to balance that and innovate,"" Wilson said.

McLaren Racing has already used recycled carbon fiber for non-safety-critical parts in Austin and Silverstone and is exploring what's next.

Separately, Dasgupta said technology is transforming the clean energy transition ""at a scale and speed and price that we didn't even think possible.""

However, Dasgupta noted that ""technology itself doesn't produce good outcomes. We need to orchestrate that outcome."" He said collaboration across industries and tech innovators is needed to help ensure a smooth transition.

On Sept. 23, Eni confirmed Italy’s Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security has approved Enilive’s proposal to convert selected units at the Sannazzaro refinery into a biorefining plant equipped to convert 550,000 tonnes/year (tpy) of renewable feedstocks into hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Alongside repurposing the Sannazzaro refinery’s second hydrocracking unit (HDC2) for production of HVO and SAF using the Eni-Honeywell UOP LLC codeveloped proprietary Ecofining technology, the proposed project also will involve construction of a grassroots pretreatment unit for biogenic feedstocks of waste and residues.

While the refinery’s current logistics systems will be adapted to support the site’s future renewable production, Eni said Enilive will source hydrogen required for the biorefining plant’s conversion process via infrastructure already in place, Eni said.

The planned conversion and integration of biorefining works at the Sannazzaro site—which is already connected to northern Italy’s aviation fuel supply chain via a pipeline to Milan Malpensa Airport and depots servicing other regional airports—will not impact the refinery’s existing production capacity for conventional fossil-based fuels, the company said.

Eni decarbonization strategy

Addition of renewable fuels production at Sannazzaro comes as Eni’s latest effort under the operator’s long-term plan to continue conversion of its conventional refineries into renewables-based production centers while retaining strategic optionality around remaining traditional capacity.

Forming part of Eni's broader decarbonization strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in line with the global energy transition, the projects collectively seek to increase Enilive’s current 1.65-million tpy systemwide biorefining capacity to more than 5 million tpy—2 million tpy of which could be SAF—by 2030.

The first global operator to convert two of its conventional refineries into biorefinerie, Eni first began producing biofuels in 2014 by processing vegetable oils and biomass waste into renewable diesel following conversion of the Venice refinery, followed by transformation of the 105,000-b/d Gela refinery on the southern coast of Sicily in 2019.

In addition to the Sannazzaro conversion project, Eni is also progressing on Italy’s northwestern coast with the planned conversion of the idled 84,000-b/d conventional refinery in Livorno, Tuscany, into what will become Italy’s third biorefinery.

Targeted for startup in 2026 with a nameplate production capacity of 500,000 tpy, the Livorno plant will be followed by Eni subsidiary Versalis SPA’s conversion of the Priolo Gargallo steam-cracking plant in eastern Sicily by yearend 2028 into a biorefinery with a nameplate production capacity of 500,000 tpy.","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/09/68d2e7df696209131e908ae0-250923eni_spa_sannazzaro_refinery.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-23 15:56:53.137825
