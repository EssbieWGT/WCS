(NYSE: ), a leading industrial gases company, has been navigating a complex landscape of strategic shifts, project challenges, and leadership changes. As the company works to refocus its strategy and address recent setbacks, investors and analysts are closely watching its performance and future prospects.

Company Overview and Recent Performance

Air Products & Chemicals specializes in the production and distribution of industrial gases, serving various industries including technology, energy, and healthcare. The company has maintained a strong market position within the industrial gas sector, benefiting from its defensive business nature in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

Recent financial results have been mixed, with the company facing headwinds from project cancellations and market weakness in certain segments. In its fiscal second quarter of 2025, APD missed earnings expectations and subsequently reduced forecasts for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2025. InvestingPro analysis indicates the stock is currently trading above its Fair Value, with a P/E ratio of 41.9x. The company generated revenue of $12 billion in the last twelve months, though experiencing a slight decline of 1.09%.

Strategic Initiatives and Leadership Changes

In a significant development, Air Products & Chemicals announced Eduardo Menezes as its new CEO in early 2025, succeeding Seifi Ghasemi. This leadership transition came in the wake of a proxy contest and aligns with the company’s ""change"" thesis, which investors have been anticipating.

The new management team has outlined a plan to address recent challenges, including:

1. Cost-cutting measures and efficiency improvements

2. Refocusing on core business activities

3. Implementing risk management strategies, such as pursuing joint ventures for large projects

Analysts expect these initiatives to potentially drive high single-digit EPS growth from 2026 to 2029, supported by pricing improvements, operational efficiencies, and new project contributions.

Industry Outlook and Competitive Landscape

The industrial gas sector continues to present opportunities, particularly in the emerging hydrogen market. Air Products & Chemicals is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for blue and green hydrogen projects. Successful execution in this area could significantly boost the company’s credibility and long-term performance.

However, APD faces stiff competition, particularly from companies like Linde (NYSE:NYSE: ), which some analysts prefer within the industrial gas industry. The company’s ability to secure long-term contracts for its hydrogen projects and bring them online efficiently will be crucial for maintaining its competitive edge.

Project Challenges and Cancellations

Air Products & Chemicals has encountered significant hurdles with some of its large-scale projects. In early 2025, the company announced its exit from three major initiatives:

1. World Energy SAF project

2. NY Green H2 project

3. Texas CO project (an unexpected cancellation)

These cancellations are expected to result in cash costs not exceeding $800 million. Additionally, APD has faced delays and cost overruns on other projects, most notably its Alberta facility.

These setbacks have raised concerns among investors and analysts about the company’s project management capabilities and risk profile. The company is now focused on de-risking its capital structure and securing offtakes for its remaining large projects.

Analyst Perspectives and Projections

Analysts’ views on Air Products & Chemicals remain mixed, with ratings ranging from Neutral to Overweight. The consensus acknowledges the company’s strong underlying business model but expresses caution regarding near-term challenges.

Some analysts believe that APD’s refocused strategy under new leadership could drive future growth and improve profitability. The company’s positioning for an early cycle recovery, should market conditions improve, is seen as a potential catalyst for stock performance.

However, concerns persist regarding the company’s ability to execute its large-scale projects efficiently and the impact of recent cancellations on long-term growth prospects. The challenging macroeconomic environment, including the impact of tariffs, also weighs on the company’s outlook.

Bear Case

How might project cancellations impact APD’s long-term growth prospects?

The recent cancellation of three major projects, including the unexpected exit from the Texas CO project, raises concerns about Air Products & Chemicals’ ability to deliver on its long-term growth strategy. These cancellations not only result in immediate financial costs but also potentially limit future revenue streams and market expansion opportunities.

The company’s growth trajectory has been partly predicated on the successful execution of large-scale projects, particularly in emerging areas such as sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen. With these cancellations, APD may face challenges in maintaining its projected growth rates and could lose ground to competitors who are advancing similar initiatives.

Moreover, the cancellations may damage APD’s reputation among potential partners and customers, making it more difficult to secure new contracts and projects in the future. This could lead to a cycle of reduced growth opportunities and diminished market share in key industrial gas segments.

What risks does APD face in de-risking its capital structure?

As Air Products & Chemicals works to de-risk its capital structure in response to recent project challenges, it faces several potential risks:

1. Reduced financial flexibility: By potentially reducing leverage or altering its capital allocation strategy, APD may limit its ability to pursue opportunistic investments or respond quickly to market changes.

2. Lower returns on capital: A more conservative capital structure could lead to lower returns on invested capital, potentially impacting shareholder value in the long term.

3. Opportunity costs: Resources allocated to de-risking efforts might be diverted from growth initiatives or research and development, potentially slowing innovation and market expansion.

4. Market perception: If investors perceive the de-risking efforts as overly cautious or indicative of deeper problems, it could negatively impact the stock price and make future capital raising more challenging.

5. Execution risk: The process of restructuring the capital structure itself carries risks, including potential missteps in timing or strategy that could lead to suboptimal outcomes.

These risks highlight the delicate balance APD must strike between managing its risk profile and maintaining its competitive position in the industrial gas market.

Bull Case

How could APD’s refocused strategy drive future earnings growth?

Air Products & Chemicals’ refocused strategy under new leadership presents several potential avenues for future earnings growth:

Türkiye’s civil aviation sector is entering a new phase in 2025, marked by the official launch of a “green era” through a sweeping Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) directive. This policy is the most ambitious environmental step ever taken by Turkish civil aviation, aiming to cut aviation emissions, boost domestic fuel production, and align with global climate standards. The following analysis explores the purpose and scope of the SAF directive, the methods used to implement and enforce it, key findings from the first months of its rollout, and the broader implications for airlines, fuel suppliers, and the Turkish economy.

Purpose and Scope of the SAF Directive

The main goal of Türkiye’s SAF directive is to reduce carbon emissions from international flights by at least 5% by 2030. This is part of a larger national plan to reach net zero emissions by 2053 and to make Turkish civil aviation a leader in environmental responsibility. The directive applies to all airlines, airport operators, and licensed fuel suppliers involved in international flights from Türkiye, except for humanitarian, medical, firefighting, and state-owned aircraft.

The policy’s scope is broad, covering:

All international flights involving Türkiye with aircraft over 5,700 kg maximum takeoff weight

Airlines registered in Türkiye and foreign carriers operating from Turkish airports

Jet fuel suppliers and domestic refiners, who must blend and supply SAF to meet national targets

By setting clear rules and deadlines, the directive aims to drive rapid change across the entire aviation supply chain, from fuel production to airline operations.

Methodology: How the SAF Directive Works

The SAF directive uses a combination of annual targets, strict compliance checks, and penalties to ensure progress. The Civil Aviation Directorate is responsible for publishing minimum SAF use and emission reduction targets before the end of the third quarter each year. Airlines and fuel suppliers must then:

Procure and blend SAF to meet the published targets, following international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Load at least 90% of the required SAF for international flights within Türkiye, ensuring domestic production is prioritized.

Submit compliance documentation to the Directorate, showing that SAF use and emissions reductions meet the annual requirements.

Face penalties if they fail to meet targets, with enforcement handled by the Directorate.

This step-by-step process is designed to create accountability and transparency, while also encouraging investment in new SAF production capacity.

Key Findings and Early Results

As of July 2025, the SAF directive is fully in force, with several important developments:

Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu officially launched the “green era” on July 5, 2025, highlighting the policy’s focus on environmental responsibility, domestic investment, and alignment with global standards.

Major Turkish refiners, including Tüpraş and SOCAR Türkiye, are preparing for large-scale SAF production. Tüpraş plans to produce 20,000 metric tons of SAF in 2026, with a goal of reaching 400,000 tons at its Izmir refinery if further investments are approved.

DB Tarımsal Enerji, a local biofuel company, is building a new plant with a target of 100,000 tons of annual SAF production.

Türkiye’s jet fuel demand in 2024 was 6.26 million tons, a 4% decrease from the previous year, reflecting both the impact of the pandemic and early shifts toward greener fuels.

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, making the adoption of SAF a critical step for climate action.

Data Presentation: Trends and Industry Impact

To better understand the impact of the SAF directive, it’s helpful to look at the numbers and compare Türkiye’s approach with global trends.

SAF Production Targets and Jet Fuel Demand

Tüpraş: 20,000 tons SAF in 2026, up to 400,000 tons pending investment

DB Tarımsal Enerji: 100,000 tons planned annual production

Türkiye’s total jet fuel demand (2024): 6.26 million tons

If both Tüpraş and DB Tarımsal Enerji reach their targets, Türkiye could produce up to 500,000 tons of SAF per year, covering about 8% of its current jet fuel demand. This would put Türkiye ahead of many countries in the region and help meet the 5% emissions reduction goal by 2030.

Comparisons and Patterns

International Alignment: Türkiye’s SAF directive is closely aligned with ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which will require international aviation emissions reductions starting in 2027. By acting early, Türkiye positions itself as a leader in the region and ensures its airlines are ready for future global rules.

Domestic Investment: The directive is already driving major investments in refinery upgrades, new biofuel plants, and SAF blending facilities. This creates new jobs and reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Operational Costs: Airlines face higher costs due to SAF procurement and blending requirements, but early compliance may help them avoid future penalties or restrictions under EU and ICAO rules.

Evidence-Based Conclusions

The SAF directive is already reshaping Turkish civil aviation in several ways:

Environmental Impact: The policy is projected to cut aviation-related emissions by 5% by 2030, a significant step toward Türkiye’s 2053 net zero goal.

Higher-density housing in the town center aims to reverse depopulation trends, while upgrades to the A590/A595 road network and Furness rail line will boost connectivity for both residents and freight logistics.

BAE Systems, Barrow's anchor employer with over 14,500 jobs, exemplifies the region's strategic importance to UK defense. Its stock's resilience reflects the sector's stability, but the real opportunity lies in the plan's diversification beyond traditional industries.

Green Energy: A Strategic Edge for Investors

Barrow's pivot to clean energy is its most compelling investment angle. The GRAMM consortium's proposed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project—targeting up to 850 new jobs by 2035—aligns with UK net-zero goals. Meanwhile, offshore wind and carbon capture projects will anchor a green economy.

The region's existing maritime expertise positions it to dominate emerging sectors like offshore wind installation and hydrogen production. Investors should monitor companies like Ørsted (ORSTED.C), pioneers in offshore wind, and local firms bidding for Barrow's green contracts.

Job Creation: A Diversified Pipeline

The plan's success hinges on its 360-degree job strategy:

- Defense: 14,500+ existing roles, with submarine programs securing long-term employment.

- Clean Energy: 850+ jobs from SAF alone, plus roles in wind and carbon capture.

- Education: A new University of Cumbria campus (2025) offering engineering and nursing degrees will train a locally rooted workforce.

- Logistics: Improved transport networks will attract warehousing and distribution hubs.

By 2035, Barrow aims to reduce economic inactivity below the national average, with workforce qualifications (RQF 4+) rising significantly.

Public-Private Synergy: A Blueprint for Success

The Team Barrow partnership—uniting government, BAE Systems, and local authorities—ensures coordinated investment. Key collaborations include:

- The £970k Barrow Transformation Fund, developing outline plans for mixed-use town center projects.

- The Brilliant Futures Fund (£5M) and Social Impact Fund (£650k+ distributed), boosting education and community resilience.

These partnerships reduce risk for private investors, as public funding de-risks early-stage projects like the SAF plant or rail upgrades.

Demographic Upside: A Growing Population, Rising Demand

With 12,000 new homes, Barrow's population is set to expand by ~20% over a decade. This growth will fuel demand for retail, healthcare, and leisure—sectors ripe for investment. The town center's planned cultural amenities (e.g., theaters, event spaces) will further attract visitors and talent.

Investment Playbook: How to Capitalize

Real Estate: Back developers building Marina Village or town-center mixed-use projects. Look for firms with strong local ties.

Green Energy: Invest in companies bidding for Barrow's renewable projects or partnering with GRAMM.

Logistics: Target firms benefiting from A590/A595 upgrades or Furness rail efficiency gains.

Education & Skills: Support the University of Cumbria's Innovation Hub or apprenticeship programs aligned with local industry needs.

Final Take: A Decade of Opportunity

Barrow's 10-year plan is not just about infrastructure—it's a strategic rebalancing of the UK economy. By 2035, the region could rival Scotland's renewables hubs or the Thames Estuary's logistics corridors. Early investors in Barrow's housing, green energy, and logistics sectors stand to benefit from a virtuous cycle of job growth, rising property values, and diversified tax revenues.

A380 Operators Airbus delivered the first A380 to Singapore Airlines in October 2007.
For example, in 2022, Airbus announced that the first A380 powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel had taken to the skies.
The A380 was the third Airbus aircraft to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuel in a 12-month period.
These tests constituted a substantial advancement for Airbus, as all Airbus aircraft had previously been certified for a 50-50 blend of sustainable aviation fuel and kerosene.","This April, Airbus celebrated the 20th anniversary of the A380's maiden flight. This jet has been built 254 times and has broken countless records, including being the only aircraft with over 500 seats and the only full-length double-decker aircraft. This can reach over 800 passengers in an all-economy configuration. Airbus also announced that the plane had flown over 800,000 flights, serving an astounding 300 million passengers.

Read this article to get behind the curtain of the A380. Learn about its expensive development, its largest operators, and how Airbus continues to use the A380 to innovate despite the jetliner no longer being in production.

An Astronomically Expensive Development

The A380 project was launched in 2000. The concept of a super-jumbo was proposed due to the popularity of hub-to-hub flights and the enforcement of slot limitations. The only way to serve more passengers without increasing the number of required flights was to increase the size of the aircraft. However, Airbus engineers had secretly begun to work on an ultra-high-capacity airliner (UHCA) in 1988, and a general outline of the aircraft was announced at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow.

Designers wanted to achieve 15% lower operating costs than the 747-400, while maintaining a substantially higher capacity. After years of consideration of various designs, including one with side-by-side A340 fuselages, Airbus's engineers settled on a double-decker design around 2000. By the end of 2000, Airbus's supervisory board agreed to launch a project worth 9.5 billion euros to build the A3XX, which they designated as the A380. When the first aircraft was completed in January 2002, it is estimated that the cost had swelled to 11-14 billion euros. This cost continued to swell. After the aircraft had been in service for 10 years, estimated development costs had reached 25-30 billion euros.

Part of the reason the development was so expensive was the complexity of the aircraft, which has over 330 miles of electric cabling. Moreover, its components are built all over Europe, including France, Wales, Spain, and Germany.

The A380's Enormous Size

The A380 is loved by aviation enthusiasts around the world for its mind-blowing size, beaten only by cargo jets flown by the Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov.

The table below features specifications for the A380 that reveal why its size is so impressive:

This size is far larger than any of the A380's competitors, such as the 747. The Boeing jumbo jet has a wingspan of 195 ft 8 in (59.6 m), almost 70 ft less than the A380. It also has the ability to get a lot less stuff into the sky. The largest variant (747-8) has a maximum takeoff weight of 975,000–987,000 lb (442.3–447.7 t).

The majority of Boeing 747 variants also can't match the A380's range, making them less appropriate for hub-to-hub operations. The 747-400 and 747-8 both have ranges of over 7,000 nautical miles, but the 747-100, -200B, and -300 have ranges of over 1,000 miles less than the A380.

A380 Operators

Airbus delivered the first A380 to Singapore Airlines in October 2007. Since then, Emirates has become the largest operator, and the jet continues to have an important role in its fleet. Emirates has announced the refurbishment of its A380s, alongside 777s, and the introduction of these services to eight more destinations. Adnan Kazim, Emirates’ Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer, said:

""The latest rollout of refurbished Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s and new A350s offer more opportunities for customers in over 70 dynamic cities and growing economies to enjoy our latest generation premium onboard experience combined with our award-winning service. The redoubling of our refurbishment programme efforts means that by the end of this year, Emirates will have established itself as one of the preeminent industry leaders offering Premium Economy seats. In the next two years, we will definitively cement our position as the industry leader in Premium Economy deployment.""

The table below reveals the top ten A380 operators by current fleet size according to Airbus data:

As of February 2025, 189 A380s remain in service, while 36 are stored and 21 have been scrapped. The most prolific A380 scrappers are Singapore, which has retired 12, and Emirates, which has retired seven. Five airlines were former A380 operators that have decided to permanently retire the aircraft from their fleets. They are China Southern Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Air France, Hi Fly Malta, and Thai Airways International. The most recent retirees are China Southern Airlines and Malaysia Airlines. Most of these carriers opted to stop flying the jet due to a combination of high fuel costs and the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the industry.

Seating on the A380

The A380's unique features are the astonishing number of seats that are available within its full-length double-deck cabin, and the ability for so many passengers to fly at the height of comfort.

Most airlines use the main deck for their economy seats. These will be arranged in a 3-4-3 configuration for a cabin designed to achieve the highest possible capacity while ensuring comfort standards are met. The upper deck is where airlines can be more creative, as this area of the aircraft is typically reserved for premium passengers, often combining first-class and business-class accommodations. The configuration is usually 1-2-1 for business class, or 2-4-2 for the airlines that have a more expansive economy class cabin.

Proposed Variants

The A380-800 was the only A380 variant produced, which will remain the case as Airbus stopped manufacturing the super jumbo in 2021. However, it may have remained in production for longer had Airbus decided to build its proposed variants. One was the A380F, a cargo aircraft capable of transporting a 150 t (330,000 lb) maximum payload over a 5,600 nmi (10,400 km) range. This is a 7% improvement in payload and a better range than the Boeing 747-8F, but it would have come with higher costs. This payload would have been larger than all aircraft except the Antonov An-225 Mriya.

Airbus also proposed passenger variants. One was the A380 Stretch. Designated either the A380-200 or the A380-900, this aircraft would have a capacity of 656 seats in a standard configuration, or 900 in economy-only. Several airlines, including Emirates, Virgin Atlantic and Air France, expressed an interest in the jet. However, production issues with the A380-800 led to these plans being shelved.

A 2015 Reuters report also revealed that Airbus was in talks with at least six airlines to produce the A380neo. This aircraft would have better engines, wings, and accommodate 50 more passengers. Delivery was planned for 2020 to 2021.

However, by 2016, Tim Clark, Emirates' president, indicated that talks over the A380neo had lapsed. This was confirmed a year later, with Airbus explaining that there was not a sufficient business case for the aircraft. The end of A380 production has not ended Emirates' interest in an A380neo. In June 2023, Flight Global reported that Clark had renewed his plea. He explained how the A380neo would benefit the airline: “It would give us a 25% reduction in fuel burn and emissions on the A380. That’s startlingly good.”

The A380 Continues To Innovate

The age of the Super Jumbo may be coming to an end. Twin-jet aircraft appear to be the future, even for long-haul widebody planes. However, Airbus continues to use the A380 to drive its innovation. For example, in 2022, Airbus announced that the first A380 powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel had taken to the skies.

The aircraft flew from Blagnac Airport in France for a three-hour flight, operating one of its Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines with exclusively sustainable aviation fuel. 27 tonnes were provided by TotalEnergies for the flight, made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), free of aromatics and sulfur, and primarily consisting of used cooking oil, as well as other waste fats.

The A380 was the third Airbus aircraft to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuel in a 12-month period. An A350 was the first in March 2021, followed by an A319neo in October 2021. These tests constituted a substantial advancement for Airbus, as all Airbus aircraft had previously been certified for a 50-50 blend of sustainable aviation fuel and kerosene. Airbus appears to be continuing the use of the A380 for sustainability testing, as the A380 used in this test is the ZEROe Demonstrator - a flying testbed for future technologies instrumental to bringing the world’s first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035.

This platform aims to bridge the gap between airlines and SAF producers by efficiently matching supply and demand, thus enhancing efficiency, connectivity, and transparency within the aviation sector. The introduction of this platform is crucial at a time when the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon emissions. By simplifying procurement and fostering collaboration, the SAF Matchmaker platform supports the aviation industry’s shift toward greener, more sustainable energy solutions, ultimately contributing to its long-term environmental goals.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, a pioneering solution aimed at streamlining the procurement process for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This platform is designed to serve as a bridge, connecting airlines and SAF producers to facilitate the purchasing process. By matching the supply and demand of SAF, the platform aims to enhance efficiency, connectivity, and visibility in the sector.

Addressing Key Challenges in SAF Procurement

The SAF Matchmaker platform is designed to tackle three major challenges in the SAF industry:

Efficiency: One of the primary goals of the platform is to simplify and expedite the SAF procurement process. By offering a centralized digital space for both airlines and SAF suppliers to connect, the platform eliminates the need for additional fees and intermediaries. This enables faster negotiations and smoother transactions, which can drive the growth of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing. By making the procurement process more efficient, IATA hopes to foster the broader adoption of SAF within the aviation industry.

Connectivity: The platform provides a transparent and accessible environment for SAF producers and suppliers to post their available or planned SAF volumes. Airlines, on the other hand, can indicate their interest in specific SAF volumes, either those already offered or volumes they seek to procure. When an agreement is made, the platform facilitates the initial connection, after which the parties can negotiate the specifics of the deal, such as price and payment terms, offline. This improved connectivity enhances collaboration between SAF producers and airlines, making it easier for both sides to meet their needs and goals.

Visibility: Transparency is a key feature of the SAF Matchmaker platform. It provides detailed information on the available SAF, including data on feedstock, production technology, emissions reduction benefits, and compliance with international standards like the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED). This comprehensive visibility ensures that airlines can make informed decisions when selecting their SAF suppliers, while producers can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and compliance with regulatory frameworks.

A Flexible and Inclusive Platform

The SAF Matchmaker platform is designed to be flexible, supporting both spot purchases and long-term offtake agreements. Initially, the platform is exclusively available to airlines and SAF suppliers. However, IATA has plans to expand access to other buyers of SAF, such as non-aviation corporations, in the future. This expansion will help broaden the market for SAF, encouraging wider adoption across various sectors.

The platform is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space created to support the aviation industry in managing energy-related challenges. The Aviation Energy Hub provides access to a variety of tools and resources that help stakeholders in the aviation sector improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and transition to more sustainable energy sources.

Supporting the Sustainable Future of Aviation

The SAF Matchmaker platform plays a crucial role in advancing the sustainability of the aviation industry. By addressing the supply chain inefficiencies and enhancing the visibility of SAF options, the platform can help accelerate the adoption of this vital fuel source. SAF is considered one of the most promising solutions for reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint and achieving its long-term sustainability goals.

IATA’s initiative comes at a critical time when the aviation sector is facing increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact. SAF offers a significant opportunity to cut emissions, as it can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The platform aims to create a more transparent and efficient market for SAF, allowing airlines to secure the fuel they need to reduce their carbon footprint while simultaneously supporting the growth of sustainable fuel production.

Long-Term Impact on the Aviation Industry

In the coming years, the SAF Matchmaker platform has the potential to become a cornerstone of the aviation industry’s transition to sustainability. By facilitating the exchange of SAF between producers and airlines, the platform will contribute to the development of a global SAF market, fostering competition and encouraging innovation in fuel production technologies.

In addition to improving procurement processes, the platform could also help mitigate some of the challenges faced by airlines in securing a steady supply of SAF. With the market for SAF still in its nascent stages, the platform’s ability to provide both visibility and connectivity between stakeholders will be essential in ensuring that airlines can meet their sustainability targets and comply with environmental regulations.

A Step Toward a Greener Aviation Industry

IATA’s launch of the SAF Matchmaker platform represents a significant step toward a more sustainable and efficient aviation industry. As airlines and SAF producers continue to face the challenges of sourcing and distributing sustainable fuels, platforms like SAF Matchmaker will play an essential role in facilitating the transition to greener alternatives. By helping to streamline procurement processes, improve connectivity between stakeholders, and enhance the visibility of SAF offerings, the platform can drive the growth of the SAF market and support the aviation industry’s broader sustainability goals.

IATA has launched the SAF Matchmaker Platform to streamline the procurement of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, addressing the growing demand for cleaner aviation fuels. This initiative aims to connect airlines and SAF producers efficiently, enhancing sustainability in the industry by simplifying transactions and promoting greener fuel options.

In a move that has stunned both aviation insiders and nostalgic travelers alike, a U.S.-based company is preparing to relaunch the world’s first supersonic passenger aircraft by 2026 — almost exactly 50 years after its inaugural commercial flight.

This revival, led by Fly-Concorde Limited and backed by sweeping legislative change, positions the United States at the forefront of a renewed global race toward high-speed, sustainable aviation.

And yes — this time, the Concorde plans to fly over land.

A Political Green Light That Changes Everything

The turning point came on June 6, 2025, when President Donald J. Trump signed the so-called “Concorde Bill” at Washington Dulles International Airport. The legislation reverses a 52-year-old ban on supersonic flight over U.S. soil — a restriction that has long hobbled the commercial potential of faster-than-sound travel.

Citing both technological advances and national innovation priorities, the bill marks a radical shift in U.S. aviation policy. The ban, originally enacted due to sonic boom concerns, had made overland supersonic flights commercially unviable, relegating aircraft like the original Concorde to a limited set of transoceanic routes.

With that regulatory ceiling lifted, a new era in civil aviation becomes possible — and Fly-Concorde Limited is already poised to seize it.

A Reimagined Concorde for the Modern Age

Fly-Concorde’s upcoming aircraft won’t simply revive the past; it aims to reimagine it. The next-generation Concorde will retain the iconic delta-wing silhouette, but beneath the familiar design lies a radically upgraded airframe.

Using advanced composite materials, the aircraft will be approximately 50% lighter than the original Concorde. It will be fueled by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), offering a projected 80% reduction in emissions compared to its 20th-century predecessor. And it will cruise at an altitude of 60,000 feet, high above conventional commercial aircraft, reducing air congestion and optimizing speed.

But perhaps the most critical breakthrough is also the most elusive: the sonic boom.

Solving the Sonic Boom Problem

Behind the aircraft’s reauthorization lies a major scientific achievement — one credited to Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, the physicist and polymath leading the Concorde project. With three PhDs from Oxford and decades of research behind him, Dr. Churchill developed and patented Sonic Boom Suppression technology in May 2025. His solution, which reportedly diffuses shockwaves before they reach the ground, makes overland supersonic flight feasible for the first time in history.

Churchill is more than an engineer — he’s also a descendant of Sir Winston Churchill, adding a symbolic continuity to a project first conceived in the post-WWII spirit of peace and technological ambition. According to the company, this is not just an aircraft; it is a statement of legacy, vision, and renewed Western aerospace leadership.

Fly-Concorde’s Vice President, Patricia Bader-Johnston, emphasized that the aircraft will serve as “a global benchmark for sonic boom suppression and sustainability.” It is, in short, the Concorde for a climate-conscious, tech-savvy world.

The Financial Engine: Concorde Coin

To fund this ambitious return to the skies, Fly-Concorde isn’t relying solely on institutional investment. The company has launched Concorde Coin (CSSC) — a stablecoin backed by the Concorde’s aviation assets and operational rights.

This digital currency, built on blockchain infrastructure, aims to align investors with the company’s long-term mission. By blending aerospace innovation with decentralized finance, Fly-Concorde hopes to unlock new sources of capital while inviting a broader community to participate in the rebirth of supersonic travel.

The market has taken notice. The Concorde brand is already valued at an estimated $50 billion, and the financial ecosystem developing around it suggests that aviation’s next leap forward could be just as much about crypto as it is about combustion.

Looking Back to Leap Forward

Originally developed through a joint venture between British Airways and Air France, the Concorde redefined international air travel when it entered commercial service in 1976. With cruise speeds of Mach 2.04 (2,179 km/h), it could fly from London to New York in under three and a half hours — cutting transatlantic travel time in half.

But despite its speed and prestige, the aircraft struggled commercially. High fuel costs, limited range, noise regulations, and a fatal crash in 2000 combined to seal its fate. In 2003, both BA and Air France retired their fleets, ending an era that once felt like the beginning of the future.

Now, thanks to regulatory change, sustainability advances, and sonic innovation, that future is being rewritten.

The Cold War’s Forgotten Challenger: The Tupolev Tu-144

No story about the Concorde is complete without mention of its Soviet-era rival, the Tupolev Tu-144. Often dubbed the “Concordski,” the Tu-144 became the world’s first supersonic transport aircraft to break Mach 1 — beating Concorde to that milestone in 1969.

Yet despite its engineering achievements, the Tu-144’s history was plagued by safety issues. A disastrous crash at the 1973 Paris Air Show, followed by another fatal incident in 1978, led to the end of its brief commercial career. Only 55 passenger flights were completed before it was retired by Aeroflot.

In later decades, modified versions of the Tu-144 saw use in experimental programs, including joint research ventures with NASA. But by then, the Concorde had already claimed the mantle of the West’s supersonic icon.

A Historic Relaunch at a Critical Moment

Fly-Concorde’s relaunch plan is timed with precision. The aircraft’s first flight is targeted for 2026, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Concorde’s original commercial debut. But this is more than a symbolic gesture — it’s a signal that supersonic flight is no longer a relic of the past.

It’s becoming part of aviation’s future.

And in an age where speed, sustainability, and smart policy must coexist, the new Concorde may well become a blueprint for 21st-century air travel — one that bridges legacies of innovation with the demands of a changing world.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/686a428342de80001d3573e7.jpg",N,,2025-07-06 07:02:04.492794

Sustainability is no longer a choice but a necessity in every sphere of humanity. Global warming, melting of polar ice shelves, and extreme climate changes are causing civilizational challenges. Uranus Oil is spearheading a quiet revolution as part of its commitment to environmental sustainability-one that transforms kitchen waste into aviation-grade fuel. At the heart of this revolution is transforming kitchen waste (Used Cooking Oil or UCO) into aviation-grade fuel. UCO is a waste product typically discarded by food outlets. However, it is now a pivotal ingredient in the world's transition toward clean aviation fuel.

The Untapped Gold: Used Cooking Oil (UCO) as a Sustainable Feedstock

Used Cooking Oil is generated in vast quantities every day by restaurants, hotels, caterers, street food vendors, and industrial kitchens. Once the frying life of kitchen oil is over, users discard it, often improperly. This clogs drains, contaminating water bodies, or ends up in landfills. However, such a seemingly worthless byproduct holds immense value.

When processed correctly, UCO can be converted into Biodiesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). It is a clean-burning, renewable alternative to conventional fossil-based aviation fuels. SAF derived from UCO can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil fuels, emitting large quantities of carbon and other pollutants. More importantly, SAF is a ""drop-in fuel,"". This means it is compatible with existing aircraft engines and fuel infrastructure.

This compatibility eliminates the need for costly overhauls and allows aviation companies to embrace sustainability without disruption.

Uranus Oil's Vision: Fueling the Circular Economy

Uranus Oil is on a mission to ""fuel the world with waste"" across India. The Company is building a future where waste oil is not an environmental hazard but a critical industrial asset powering planes, vehicles, and economies.

At the centre of Uranus Oil's model is a robust, decentralized UCO procurement ecosystem. The Company collects UCO from food and beverage outlets across Southern India, from five-star hotels in Chennai to small eateries in rural Karnataka. Uranus Oil's supply chain leaves no fryer behind.

To ensure seamless and efficient collection, Uranus Oil has deployed territory-based Direct Procurement Officers (DPOs). On-ground professionals forge relationships with local vendors, ensure quality standards, and supervise logistics. This decentralized model allows hyperlocal engagement, quick turnaround times, and a minimal carbon footprint during collection.

Electric Vehicles and Green Logistics

As part of its carbon-conscious philosophy, Uranus Oil has begun transitioning its collection fleet to Electric Vehicles (EVs). This move not only reduces tailpipe emissions but also reinforces the Company's commitment to full-cycle sustainability.

Each kilogram of UCO collected and transported via EV helps avert additional emissions, amplifying the positive impact of SAF and biodiesel down the line. Every step is optimized for low environmental impact and high resource efficiency, from the moment waste is collected.

Scaling the Model: From Southern India to National Dominance

The Company already has a dominant presence in the Southern Indian markets, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala. Uranus Oil is rapidly scaling its footprint to other geographies. Its strategy involves:

Expanding storage and pre-processing hubs in key metro and tier-2 cities.

Onboarding and training a national DPO network with strong local partnerships.

Implementing digital traceability tools for real-time monitoring of oil collection, quality, and transportation.

Forging long-term supply agreements with major biofuel producers, refineries, and aviation companies.

The Company also engages in awareness campaigns and compliance training to help vendors align with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) regulations on UCO disposal.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Future of Clean Skies

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) presents the most viable near-term solution for the aviation industry grappling with pressure to decarbonize. It doesn't require new engines or infrastructure. It just requires better feedstock (like UCO) and a robust supply chain.

Uranus Oil is becoming a preferred aggregator for FSSAI enrolled biodiesel and biofuel manufacturers, in India by guaranteeing:

Consistent UCO volumes

High-quality, low-contaminant oil

Real-time logistics tracking

This positions Uranus Oil not just as a collector, but as a strategic enabler of India's Biodiesel and SAF ambitions and as a catalyst for international emissions reduction targets.

Pioneering a Circular Economy: From Waste to Wealth

Circular economy is not just a buzzword at Uranus Oil. Rather, it's a lived reality. The Company's core belief is ""waste is not the end-it's the beginning."" Every litre of UCO collected is a step toward:

Cleaner skies via SAF

Greener roads via biodiesel

Lower carbon cities via electric logistics

More responsible food systems via compliant disposal

Uranus Oil doesn't just collect used oil. It regenerates value, creating an economy where waste is recirculated, emissions are reduced, and profitability meets planetary responsibility.

The Road Ahead: Building India's Green Energy Backbone

With climate policies tightening globally and India pledging aggressive net-zero goals, Uranus Oil stands at the crossroads of necessity and opportunity. The Company is actively exploring:

International collaborations with SAF producers and green aviation hubs.

AI-driven demand forecasting for biodiesel blending in transport sectors.

Blockchain-based UCO traceability systems to ensure transparency and compliance.

In recent years, the aviation industry has experienced positive changes as more women move into leadership roles. In North America, however, only a small number of women – just four – lead major airports, bringing unique perspectives and innovative ideas. One such leader is Christina Cassotis, whose journey from being the daughter of a Pan Am pilot to becoming the CEO of Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) is truly inspiring.

Cassotis grew up in a household connected to aviation, influenced by her father who moved from Pan Am to United Airlines. Living with her family in New England, she experienced the realities of airline life. Despite limited vacations due to her father’s preference for staying grounded when off duty, a family trip to London when she was ten years old sparked her love for travel.

Cassotis’ journey into aviation leadership was anything but conventional. “I was bartending on Beacon Hill in Boston,” she recalls. “It was a spot where state reps and senators would come in for lunch or drinks.” It was there that she was offered a job at the Department of Energy Resources, before being recruited to work as the communications director for a cabinet secretary.

“After six months, I moved to Massport,” the owner and operator of Logan Airport in Boston. “I didn’t even realise that airports had jobs like the one I was offered.”

At the age of 29, without a college degree, Cassotis went back to school while working at Massport and eventually graduated. “As the deputy director of communications, I absolutely loved it. I thought, I can’t believe I get to work at an airport.”

After four and a half years, she was recruited by a consulting company, where she worked and consulted for various airports for 17 years. The unpredictable nature of the industry captivated her.

Looking back on her ascent from bartending for politicians to leading an airport, Cassotis says, “Bartending teaches you people skills – how to read personalities, manage situations and think quickly. Those lessons have served me every day as a CEO.”

When Cassotis joined PIT in 2015, the airport was a shadow of its former self, having lost its bustling status as a travel hub in 2004 after US Airways abandoned it, leaving empty gates and an economic void.

“I expressed my concerns during the interview process in late 2014,” Cassotis says. “I told the headhunter that if the organisation aimed to become a hub again, I wouldn’t consider the position.

“I was very upfront about it,” she continues. The world and the airline industry had changed significantly, leading her to believe that smaller markets such as Pittsburgh simply do not generate enough demand for an airline hub.

“I believed that we could succeed using a different business model,” she explains. “This shift in mindset didn’t imply that anything was wrong. Rather, the landscape had evolved.”

Cassotis asserted that PIT could achieve success as a business. She posed the question: how could PIT redefine itself without relying on a major airline hub?

“Airlines serve markets, not airports,” she states. “Our path to success is to operate as an origin and destination airport.” Under her leadership, PIT has increased its destinations from 36 to 61. “We have every major US airline except Hawaiian,” she says.

British Airways, for instance, has operated a route from London Heathrow to PIT since 2019, and earlier this year increased its six-times-weekly service to daily, with flights running until October 2025.

Icelandair also connects PIT to Europe, and Cassotis envisions expanding to accommodate more West Coast flights. “There’s potential for more destinations in Europe and Canada,” she adds, highlighting opportunities in cargo and logistics, including the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on-site.

To prepare for its ambitious plan, a crucial element of the transformation at PIT is the new terminal, which is set to open this year. Often called the most beautiful airport design in North America, the terminal is intended to capture the essence of the city with locally sourced materials, systems and innovative architecture.

“We took a user-centric approach, focusing on the needs of passengers and staff,” she explains. “A key focus is on addressing issues when things go wrong. We strive to take care of people, regardless of whether it’s our fault or not.

“The space itself is a beautifully designed building filled with light and high ceilings,” she continues. “The interior features tree-like columns and outdoor terraces, which are accessible to everyone, regardless of club membership.”

Meanwhile, inspired by the city’s Fort Pitt Bridge, a new connector bridge will reduce walking distances and offer stunning views of the city.

When asked about her ideal airport, Cassotis imagines terminals featuring more sensory rooms, nursing stations and enhanced services for travellers during disruptions. “I’d like to see airports prioritise people over just efficiency,” she says.

This human-centred approach to leadership sets Cassotis apart, especially given her diagnosis of ADHD at the age of 47. “It felt like someone was unlocking something inside me, like a key turning,” she shares. “Suddenly I realised there wasn’t anything wrong with me.”

Cassotis discovered her ability to make real-time connections and understand complex systems from multiple perspectives. “I didn’t realise I could do things others couldn’t,” she says. “I can recognise people’s strengths and identify what holds them back.”

Medication has also helped. “If a task isn’t fun or urgent, I struggle to start it. The medication enables me to initiate projects that I would otherwise find difficult.”

Her story has resonated with many, and she often receives letters from people inspired by her journey. “A young man once wrote to me after his parents read my story. They told him, ‘You will find your way, just like she did.’ That touched me deeply.”

Cassotis hopes her story encourages people, particularly individuals with ADHD, to embrace their differences and recognise their strengths. “There’s nothing wrong with thinking differently,” she says. “It’s just different.”

Chamou a atenção o fato de que os participantes do evento mencionaram diversas vezes a COP30, a Conferência das Nações Unidas sobre as Mudanças Climáticas de 2025, que será sediada também no Brasil, em Belém do Pará, durante o mês de novembro.

O presidente do Conselho Nacional da Indústria (CNI), Ricardo Alban, que abriu o painel, comentou sobre “surpresas” que a conferência climática trará em novembro.

Nos bastidores, questionado por Opera Mundi sobre quais são essas “surpresas” mencionadas, o presidente da COP30, André Corrêa do Lago, explicou que se tratam de soluções desenvolvidas especificamente “dentro do Brasil” frente aos problemas do meio ambiente compartilhados, em especial, pelas nações do Sul Global.

“O mundo não sabe quantas já foram desenvolvidas aqui e que vamos divulgar em breve”, afirmou o diplomata, sem fornecer mais detalhes. “A COP30 será a ocasião da gente mostrar que o mundo já está pronto para a transição”.

O Fórum Empresarial do BRICS, que antecede a cúpula de chefes de Estado prevista para os próximos dois dias, reuniu lideranças empresariais, autoridades governamentais e especialistas dos países que integram o bloco, focando em temas essenciais para o desenvolvimento econômico sustentável.

Em sua exposição, Alban destacou que o BRICS precisa de “soluções compartilhadas para problemas contemporâneos”, ao apontar que a entrada de novos integrantes, com suas respectivas complementaridades econômicas, capacita o aumento no volume de negócios, parcerias e investimentos no bloco sob a perspectiva “Sul-Sul”, termo usado pelo vice-presidente Geraldo Alckmin momentos depois.

“Nesse tempo interfiador marcado por conflitos geopolíticos, emergências climáticas e novidades tecnológicas, o Brasil ocupa uma posição singular na diplomacia econômica e na governança global. Em 2024, liderando o G20. Neste ano, prevemos o BRICS e, em novembro, seremos a sede da 30ª Conferência Nacional das Nações Unidas sobre Mudança do Clima”, pontuou.

Fome, energia e clima

Por sua vez, o vice-presidente brasileiro Geraldo Alckmin mencionou os “três grandes debates planetários”, ao afirmar que o governo Lula tem demonstrado empenho nessas questões. São elas: segurança alimentar, segurança energética e combate às mudanças climáticas.

A autoridade enfatizou que o Brasil é líder global na exportação de alimentos, acrescentando que “o presidente Lula acabou de lançar um Plano Safra recorde”. Segundo o vice-presidente, o país sul-americano “ainda pode ter mais de 10% de aumento da Safra da agropecuária neste ano”.

Em relação à segurança energética, detalhou que o governo brasileiro detém 85% da energia elétrica limpa e renovável, além de sustentar um compromisso com a energia limpa.

“O presidente Lula acabou de assinar o aumento do etanol de 27% para 30%. E do biodiesel, de 14% para 15%. O Brasil tem tudo para ser um dos grandes na produção de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), ajudando na questão da descarbonização”, explicou.

Sobre as mudanças climáticas, Alckmin apontou que a gestão brasileira conseguiu inverter a curva do desmatamento, e que a meta é zerar o desmatamento ilegal, recuperando “a maior floresta tropical do mundo, que sediará a COP30”.

Lula confirma ida à Malásia

Ao lado do primeiro-ministro da Malásia, Anwar bin Ibrahim, o presidente brasileiro Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva confirmou que realizará uma viagem ao país asiático para participar da 47ª Cúpula da Asean (Associação de Nações do Sudeste Asiático), em outubro próximo.

“Já quero dizer que os empresários brasileiros precisam se preparar para viajar para a Malásia”, disse o mandatário “Quem quer vender, vai. Quem quer comprar, vai. Se ficar esperando a coisa, não acontece. Por isso eu queria, de coração, agradecer a presença aqui do primeiro-ministro da Malásia”.

Em seu discurso, Lula também mencionou a COP30 e reforçou o comprometimento brasileiro com a promoção de uma “transição ecológica justa e inclusiva”.

Microsoft has shut down its office in Pakistan after 25 years, marking the end of a significant chapter in the country’s tech landscape.

It is to be noted that Microsoft has not released a formal public statement or press release specifically announcing the closure of its Pakistan office. However, the decision has been widely confirmed through statements by Jawwad Rehman, Microsoft Pakistan’s founding country manager, who shared the news on LinkedIn and called it a “sobering signal” about the business climate.

Why Did Microsoft Exit Pakistan?

Microsoft cited a combination of global restructuring and a strategic shift to a cloud-based, partner-led model as the primary reasons for the closure. But the story runs deeper:

Global Factors

Microsoft is undergoing massive layoffs—over 9,100 jobs cut globally—as part of its cost optimization strategy.

The company is consolidating operations and shifting to regional hubs like Ireland for licensing and commercial contracts.

Local Challenges

Economic instability: Currency depreciation, high inflation, and a shrinking tech investment climate.

Regulatory hurdles: Inconsistent policies, import restrictions, and taxation on IT and telecom sectors.

Political uncertainty: Frequent regime changes and lack of long-term digital policy planning.

What Microsoft Leaves Behind

Despite the closure, Microsoft’s products and services will continue in Pakistan via:

Certified local partners

Cloud platforms and regional offices (e.g., Ireland)

However, the loss of direct presence means:

Fewer local training programs and digital skilling initiatives

Reduced corporate engagement and innovation partnerships

A symbolic blow to Pakistan’s aspirations of becoming a regional tech hub

Reactions

Former President Arif Alvi called it a “troubling sign” and revealed that Microsoft had once considered Pakistan for expansion but chose Vietnam instead due to instability.

Jawwad Rehman, Microsoft Pakistan’s founding country manager, said: “Even global giants like Microsoft find it unsustainable to stay.”

What’s Next for Pakistan?

Stabilize macroeconomic policies

Reform regulatory frameworks

Improve ease of doing business

Foster a consistent digital strategy",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEwpyabl5wKWArIBGvPYQZQ63ps_g739-K2yl4Cgy0YncE85lzSm8N50kiaNdxS6bg8AA4yQ4xUrU99bKKVDe2lSIfBPY3h47eRzwBtZE25Fxojyx2FtXqO9ymhIcD_CEkoXI0okoR8S-W__-PTB4CjUzfi6aOu7bCg9snijb4ZXXf7QzMDLTEDRNy2kk/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/1000082527.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:00:13.814056

This move marks a turning point for China’s aviation industry, particularly for its domestically developed narrow-body jet, the COMAC C919—China’s ambitious answer to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.
This allowed the resumption of engine shipments for both the C919 and the smaller C929 regional jet, which uses the CF34 engine.
As the global aviation landscape shifts, both economic pragmatism and geopolitical strategy appear to be guiding U.S.-China cooperation in this vital sector.
How critical is this move for the future of COMAC’s C919 program and China’s push for aviation independence?","In a significant development, the United States has resumed the supply of aircraft engines to China’s state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). This move marks a turning point for China’s aviation industry, particularly for its domestically developed narrow-body jet, the COMAC C919—China’s ambitious answer to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.

Although the C919 is a Chinese-made aircraft, it incorporates several critical Western components, including engines. The jet relies on LEAP-1C engines jointly developed by GE Aerospace and Safran. These components are essential for meeting international safety standards and gaining access to global airspace, which in turn supports the aircraft’s commercial viability and appeal to both domestic and international airlines.

China has been steadily working towards self-reliance in aircraft manufacturing, with the aim of reducing dependency on Western technology. Narrow-body and wide-body aircraft development has become a cornerstone of this strategy, especially as domestic airlines continue placing large-scale orders.

After years of research and investment, China officially launched the C919, signaling its readiness to compete on the global stage. The aircraft has already secured over 1,200 orders—primarily from Chinese carriers—and is now attracting international interest due to its affordability, quicker availability, and operational convenience compared to its Western rivals.

However, the journey has not been without obstacles. During the Trump administration, the U.S. imposed export restrictions that halted the supply of LEAP-1C engines, significantly slowing COMAC’s production. This disruption was part of broader U.S.-China trade tensions and had a direct impact on the pace of China’s civil aviation ambitions.

A key turning point came when China agreed to ease restrictions on its export of rare-earth materials—critical elements used in high-tech manufacturing, including aerospace, semiconductors, and electric vehicles.

In response, the U.S. Department of Commerce lifted the suspension of export licenses for GE Aerospace, announced on July 4, 2025. This allowed the resumption of engine shipments for both the C919 and the smaller C929 regional jet, which uses the CF34 engine.

This exchange highlights the complex interdependence between the U.S. and China. On one hand, China needs high-performance components to meet aviation standards; on the other, the U.S. relies on China’s rare-earth supply chains, which are vital to multiple strategic industries.

China, meanwhile, is aggressively developing its own jet engines to break free from foreign reliance. But until these become viable alternatives, Western technology remains critical for the success of aircraft like the C919.

Operationally, the C919 is proving itself. Since its entry into service, it has logged over 15 million flight hours and flown more than 15 billion miles—without major reported quality or safety issues. Several Chinese airlines are now actively using the aircraft, and its growing track record is boosting global confidence in COMAC’s capabilities.

A recent milestone further strengthened this momentum: COMAC’s C929 regional jet began its first international operations from Mongolia. This expansion into foreign airspace not only showcases the aircraft’s performance but also marks a symbolic victory for China’s aviation industry as it gains trust from international markets.

Restoring engine exports benefits both sides. It supports COMAC’s production goals for the C919 and C929 while allowing the U.S. to maintain influence in the global aerospace market through strategic technological exports. As the global aviation landscape shifts, both economic pragmatism and geopolitical strategy appear to be guiding U.S.-China cooperation in this vital sector.

“Even with record levels of U.S. crude oil production, recent global events continue to demonstrate that international oil markets can still influence domestic fuel costs.
The report compares ethanol with refinery-derived components used to boost gasoline octane levels and finds ethanol to be a far more cost-effective option.
Without ethanol, replacing its octane contribution with refinery alternatives would raise costs by $54 billion per year.
While the report focuses on octane-related cost impacts, it does not factor in the broader economic benefits of ethanol—particularly its contribution to U.S. fuel supply.","A new report highlights the significant role American-made ethanol plays in keeping gasoline prices down, saving U.S. drivers more than $50 billion annually, an average of 39 cents per gallon, according to the release by Renewable Fuels Association (RFA).

“As the nation prepares to celebrate Independence Day, this report underscores the powerful impact of domestic ethanol production on our energy security,” said Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA). “Even with record levels of U.S. crude oil production, recent global events continue to demonstrate that international oil markets can still influence domestic fuel costs. Ethanol, as a low-cost and reliable gasoline blendstock, provides a critical buffer against those price shocks.”

The study, authored by George Hoekstra of Hoekstra Trading LLC, a veteran in petroleum refining and technology, examines the financial and technical advantages of using ethanol in the U.S. fuel mix. The report compares ethanol with refinery-derived components used to boost gasoline octane levels and finds ethanol to be a far more cost-effective option.

According to Hoekstra’s findings, ethanol provides high-octane value at a fraction of the cost—approximately 4.5 times less than that of refinery-sourced octane. His analysis concludes that the presence of ethanol in the U.S. E10 fuel blend—10% ethanol by volume—lowers the wholesale cost of gasoline by about 39 cents per gallon. Without ethanol, replacing its octane contribution with refinery alternatives would raise costs by $54 billion per year.

The study also indicates that higher ethanol blends like E15, now increasingly available at retail stations, offer even greater savings per gallon of gasoline. E10 remains the standard fuel blend in the U.S., but the report suggests that expanding the use of higher-ethanol blends could lead to deeper cost reductions for consumers.

While the report focuses on octane-related cost impacts, it does not factor in the broader economic benefits of ethanol—particularly its contribution to U.S. fuel supply. Ethanol adds roughly 1 million barrels per day to the fuel market, which also helps stabilize prices by increasing overall supply.

The findings reaffirm ethanol’s role not only in lowering costs at the pump but also in reinforcing American energy independence and reducing vulnerability to global oil disruptions.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ethanol.png,N,,2025-07-06 07:02:11.403494

At Reduc, Petrobras is also evaluating a used lubricating oil re-refining project with a capacity of 30,000 m³/month (6,300 bpd).
These combined investments underscore Petrobras’ commitment to modernizing its operations, increasing domestic fuel supply, expanding the production of renewable fuels, and supporting Brazil’s energy transition goals.","Petrobras has announced plans to invest approximately R$33 billion in refining and petrochemical projects across the state of Rio de Janeiro, with R$29 billion allocated directly from the company’s capital expenditure (Capex) and an additional R$4 billion tied to a separate initiative aligned with Petrobras’ operational assets.

The bulk of the investment—around R$26 billion—is directed toward integration projects between the Boaventura Energy Complex in Itaboraí and the Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc). These initiatives are part of Petrobras’ 2025-2029 Business Plan (PN 2025-2029) and are currently in the bidding phase for service contracts.

Boosting Fuel Production and Refining Capacity

The integration will significantly expand fuel production, including an increase of 76,000 barrels per day (bpd) of S-10 diesel—56,000 bpd from improved fuel quality and 20,000 bpd from additional capacity. The project also includes an increase of 20,000 bpd in jet fuel capacity and 12,000 bpd in Group II lubricating oil output.

A dedicated Bio Jet Fuel plant will be built at the Boaventura Complex, with a capacity of 19,000 bpd to produce renewable fuels, including Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Two gas-fired power plants will also be constructed at the complex to participate in Brazil’s capacity reserve auctions. Engineering for the power units is already approved, and they will benefit from synergies with existing infrastructure at the Itaboraí Natural Gas Processing Unit (UPGN).

At Reduc, Petrobras is also evaluating a used lubricating oil re-refining project with a capacity of 30,000 m³/month (6,300 bpd). With the Boaventura Complex set to handle Group II oil production, Reduc may transition some units to apply circular economy principles—turning waste oils into high-value refined products. A co-processing test has already received ANP authorization, with trials expected to begin later this year.

Decarbonization and Efficiency at Reduc

In a major step toward decarbonization, Reduc has completed its first successful test producing jet fuel with renewable content through co-processing, using up to 1.2% corn oil. The ANP has authorized the process, and commercial production is set to begin in the coming months, with a projected capacity of 50,000 m³/month (10,000 bpd).

Reduc already produces Diesel R5, containing 5% renewable content, and has received approval to begin testing for Diesel R7, which will include 7% renewable content. These developments are part of Petrobras’ broader push toward cleaner energy and a just energy transition.

Additionally, Petrobras plans to build a new thermal power plant at Reduc to replace outdated steam and energy generation systems. With an investment of R$860 million, the project aims to improve operational reliability and align the refinery with global efficiency standards.

To maintain plant integrity and safety, Petrobras has also earmarked up to R$2.4 billion for scheduled maintenance shutdowns at Reduc between 2025 and 2029. Major maintenance activities are planned for 2026, particularly in the delayed coking and hydrotreatment units.

Petrochemical Development

In the petrochemical segment, Petrobras is studying the feasibility of producing acetic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG) at the Boaventura Complex. Acetic acid is a key input for industries producing paints, PET, and various chemicals. Currently, Brazil imports 100% of its acetic acid needs and partially relies on imports for MEG.

In addition to Petrobras’ plans, its affiliate Braskem is exploring an expansion of its polyethylene plant, potentially increasing production by 230,000 tons annually. The R$4 billion project would utilize natural gas processed through the Route 3 infrastructure at the Boaventura Complex and is pending internal approvals.

These combined investments underscore Petrobras’ commitment to modernizing its operations, increasing domestic fuel supply, expanding the production of renewable fuels, and supporting Brazil’s energy transition goals.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-07-05 15:02:30.130563

“This is not only a step forward for the environment but also a significant move for our industry and energy security,” he said.

The policy aligns with Turkey’s 2053 goal of achieving net zero emissions. Under the directive, the use, supply, and monitoring of aviation fuel must follow global standards, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) CORSIA program.

Uraloglu said the directive encourages investment in domestic fuel refining, aiming to reduce reliance on imports and promote high-tech production.

The SAF directive applies to all national and international air carriers operating flights from Turkey, airport operators, workplaces not handling hazardous materials, and individuals licensed by the country’s Energy Market Regulatory Authority. It covers flights using aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of more than 5,700 kilograms (12,566 pounds). Humanitarian, medical, firefighting, and state-owned aircraft are exempt.

“The Civil Aviation Directorate will publish the required SAF usage and minimum emission reduction per liter each year before the third quarter ends,” Uraloglu explained. “Fuel suppliers must meet this standard, and airlines will be required to use the specified amount.”

He added that carriers must load at least 90% of their required fuel from Turkey under this directive.

Uraloglu emphasized that SAF must meet current ICAO standards and noted that key Turkish energy firms are playing an active role. Refinery operator Tupras is preparing to start commercial SAF production by 2026. Other companies, including SOCAR Turkey, a subsidiary of Azerbaijan’s state oil firm, are also investing in SAF production.

“We will keep working to establish a strong and environmentally friendly aviation system through regulations like the SAF directive,” he said.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-3.png,N,,2025-07-05 15:02:37.297483

He’s the director of a maritime advisory services consultancy, UMAS, and professor at University College London. This is a lightly edited transcript of the second half of our conversation. This first half is here.

Michael Barnard [MB]: Welcome back to Redefining Energy–Tech. This episode is powered by TFIE Strategy, guiding investors toward climate-smart bets that will win in the real world and in the market. I’m your host, Michael Barnard, and returning for the second half of our conversation is Tristan Smith, director of UMAS, a maritime advisory services consultancy. He’s also a professor with the University College London Energy Institute and a maritime decarbonization expert. That’s what this nerdcast is all about, triggered by some excellent movement by the International Maritime Organization.

Part of the dynamic I’m seeing in this industry is that everyone is still confused about what the answer is. I’ve got my opinion, and some people share that opinion. You have a different perspective, based upon your published work. LNG was a dominant narrative, and now the bloom is off that rose. Methanol was a dominant narrative, and the bloom’s off that rose as well. Hydrogen was another narrative, and now the bloom is off that rose because hydrogen isn’t going to be cheap—and synthetic fuels made from hydrogen won’t be cheap either. Meanwhile, the nuclear industry is rearing its head again, claiming they’ve got a solution.

I recently read a survey—maybe it was from the IMO—where a large group of shipping industry participants were polled, and the responses were all over the map. It was, “Maybe this, maybe that—I don’t know.” Consensus just isn’t present yet because there have been so many abortive attempts. It’s fascinating to watch.

Tristan Smith [TS]: There have been abortive attempts, so trust has been lost that anyone can be authoritative on the subject. But also, I think a lot of people understand that what becomes dominant will depend partly on what the sector chooses now. There’s an element where the sector can shape its own pathway from here. If we challenge one of those statements you made and only build methanol dual-fuel ships, then nobody is going to build out ammonia or other fuel production bases. Everyone will assume there’s guaranteed offtake because those ships will need methanol once regulations exceed the greenhouse gas intensity limits already set. The market will respond directly to the specification of the ships.

So what happens next in the fleet will influence what we build as production capacity, creating interacting cycles—production capacity responding or moving in another direction because someone starts betting on a different fuel pathway, which gradually gains traction. Many people seem resigned to waiting and seeing how the fleet evolves and how the energy production side evolves. There’s a common narrative: “We’d love to decarbonize, but we just can’t see the fuels being available, and without knowing which fuels will be available, we can’t decide what molecule we should build our ships around.”

Therefore, some adopt a “bury our heads in the sand” approach, hoping biodiesel will be abundant enough to solve the problem. That’s an easy stance to take given the absence of evidence in fuel infrastructure development. Our research group is trying to monitor those trends closely, both on the supply side—the fuel provision—and by tracking investments and production maturity across fuel options. We’re also looking at the vessels being ordered. Certainly, until the recent IMO outcome, the dominant choice was LNG, representing over 50% of dual-fuel vessels.

So while we can have a theoretical discussion concluding LNG clearly isn’t the answer, that’s not what’s actually happening in the sector. We must factor that reality into our analysis. We make sure our models aren’t naïve and instead recognize the realpolitik influencing behavior and decisions constrained by what’s available or by observing what competitors are doing.

[MB]: There is no dominant answer yet. Maersk is trying to create one by purchasing all its dual-fuel ships with methanol, but it’s going to be interesting to see how that evolves.

We have about half an hour left, and I’d like to return to the recent IMO decision, because it’s intriguing. Let’s start with: What year is it baselined on?

[TS]: It’s baselined on 2008, which I can explain based on the fact that 2008 is the first year for which there was a consistent inventory from the third IMO greenhouse gas study. The organization has conducted four greenhouse gas studies so far, and the third study, published in 2014, examined the period from 2008 to 2012. Thus, the earliest date with reliable inventory data from the third IMO study is 2008. Previous studies went further back but employed substantially different methods, making it difficult to reliably connect earlier emissions estimates to later studies—for example, going back to 1990 or another baseline year.

So, 2008 is considered by the IMO to be the first year with a trustworthy estimate of actual international shipping emissions.

[MB]: The date is interesting in part because I compare and contrast it with Europe, which uses 1990 as its baseline for all greenhouse gas targets. The European baseline is convenient because it’s around the time the IPCC was formed and the first COP was held. The timing is meaningful, and it’s actually a baseline from before a massive amount of the growth in trade, GDP, and shipping we’ve seen over recent decades. But if you don’t have good data for the shipping industry from back then, I can understand why you’d pick a different year.

I also compare and contrast with the United States, which prefers 2007 as its baseline for electricity generation emissions. The U.S. story looks good from 2007 till now, but terrible from 1990 to 2007.

One thing I note, despite the practical reasons for choosing 2008 as the IMO baseline, is that it was prior to the economic crash, prior to widespread slow steaming, back when fuel oil was cheap and container ships were essentially sprinting across the Pacific. From your perspective, do you see the 2008 baseline as unfortunately high compared to the slower steaming practices and greater route efficiencies we observe today? I’m trying to determine if the average ship on an average journey today is already compliant relative to the 2008 baseline.

[TS]: So, compliant with what exactly? Compliant with the IMO’s revised strategy and trajectory, or compliant with something else?

[MB]: Let me paraphrase my question to make it clearer. If we take a typical 20,000 TEU container ship sailing from Shanghai to Los Angeles in 2008 and compare it to the same journey today, would the ship today already have significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions simply due to operational changes like slow steaming?

[TS]: It’s an interesting point that those ships didn’t actually exist in 2008. The largest container ships back then were probably around 9,000 TEU, and it’s extraordinary how they’ve grown in scale since. That’s a fascinating part of the puzzle. But broadly speaking, yes, the absolute emissions from individual vessels have come down significantly since 2008.

As you say, 2008 was indeed a high point—ships were moving fast, fuel was cheap, and energy efficiency in vessel design was relatively low. Those inefficiencies started to be corrected by market forces following the financial crisis, which led to a significant reduction in absolute emissions from around 2008 to about 2012 or 2013. During this period, fuel consumption dropped by as much as 40% or 50% on some vessels, largely due to substantial reductions in speed and correcting poor design choices from the early 2000s.

So yes, 2008 is a flattering baseline year. However, the basic logic the IMO used to set its 2030 and 2040 objectives helps correct for that because it takes a cumulative emissions approach. This aligns shipping’s climate response with the IPCC’s general recommendation: approximately halving emissions by 2030, and reaching net-zero by 2050. That’s from the IPCC AR5—I believe it’s AR5. I’m not always great at recalling these fine details, but around 2019 or 2020, the IPCC clearly stated that to avoid dangerous climate change, these targets were essential.

Translating cumulative emissions into IMO targets gave us the absolute reductions in the revised strategy. While we argued for slightly higher ambitions—around a 36% absolute reduction by 2030 and about a 90% reduction by 2040—the agreed-upon strategy targets of 30% by 2030 and 80% by 2040 are actually fairly close to those IPCC recommendations. That’s politics in action, but the point remains that the final numbers don’t appear to continue any trend of apologizing for past emissions.

2008 was essentially a line in the sand, and the process since then has been scientifically informed in reaching the current targets.

[MB]: Good, because I didn’t have the detail on that. Sometimes these baseline choices can seem arbitrary, picking an easy target to hit—but clearly, that’s not what’s happening here, unlike the United States and its 2007 baseline. The U.S. might have its own rationale similar to what you’ve described, but let’s get back to specifics.

I previously mentioned a large, modern container ship traveling from China to the United States. Do you have a concrete example of a route where you could illustrate the financial implications and likely costs associated with exceeding the IMO limits?

[TS]: I should have done my preparation. I don’t—I can’t do the numbers off the top of my head. The way we’ve been approaching it is in terms of relative competitiveness between fuel options, including simply continuing to use oil and paying the non-compliance fee. Initially, those costs are relatively low. But over the course of the 2030s, they rise substantially. By the 2040s, you’re looking at significant premiums just to stay operational while remaining out of compliance. Broadly speaking, fuel costs could quadruple if you just keep paying the fines.

[MB]: And that is significant. There’s an interesting thing here—I just want to nerd out a bit about the growth of container ships. I read The Box twice because it’s just so fascinating. Have you ever read The Box? Pretty much everybody in the industry has, but people outside the industry often say, “What’s that—a book about boxes?”

The move from ships of around 9,000 TEU to today’s 24,000 TEU vessels is interesting simply because greenhouse gas emissions per ton of freight delivered have decreased substantially. Scaling up these ships, lengthening their hulls, and improving efficiency as the hull moves through the water have collectively reduced emissions per container significantly. It would really be a good-news story if we hadn’t built so many ships to keep up with skyrocketing global shipping demand.

[TS]: I’d also argue that you need to be very careful about assumptions regarding how full these ships actually are. While economies of scale certainly work from a physics perspective, logistics often mean you can carry fewer containers and still make a profit. With smaller vessels, you need to be full all the time. But when companies started building these extremely large container ships, they found they could afford not to have them completely full, so their overall utilization dropped.

When you factor in the actual lower number of containers carried, the theoretical CO₂ savings these ships should have delivered—if they’d been full—didn’t necessarily materialize. We analyzed this using IMO data in the late 2010s, and it seemed clear at that time that the claims of significant CO₂ savings from giant container ships were overstated due to their lower operational utilization.

This underutilization partly arises from the competitive strategies of major shipping lines, which use large tonnage to establish monopoly-like dominance on key routes. They’re incentivized to push competitors off routes, sometimes colluding through shipping conferences to provide high-quality services on mainline routes like China-to-Europe. These huge ships allow companies to market significantly lower prices for freight, driving competitors out of business.

That’s why the shipping sector has experienced such dramatic consolidation. If you compare today with the early days described in The Box, you’ll see we’ve moved from a large number of shipping companies in the ’80s and ’90s to the small handful dominating global liner trade today.

The industry dynamics are complex, and economies of scale aren’t always beneficial from a CO₂ perspective. Another good example is bulk ore carriers. Historically, some ships specialized in carrying oil one way and iron ore on the return leg, creating a logistical efficiency. Instead of running empty half the time, these ships could operate triangular routes, significantly reducing empty miles. However, such vessels were gradually driven out by competitors offering lower freight costs through simpler back-and-forth operations. Those simpler operations enjoyed logistical advantages but actually generated higher overall CO₂ emissions than ships maximizing cargo utilization.

So, bigger isn’t always better from an emissions standpoint.

[MB]: Interesting—that’s a great nuance for me to mull over. The example numbers I put together, based on what I could understand of the regulation as someone who didn’t help develop it, indicated that additional costs might be a couple million dollars per journey. That seemed significant to me, but I’m not sure I got those numbers exactly right. I was hoping you’d have more precise figures.

However, your guideline—about four times the fuel cost—is an excellent rule of thumb. It’s substantial enough that we’re not talking about a 20% increase, but something like 300% or 400% higher.

So 43% in 2035. Is there a 2030 figure?

[TS]: There is—and I think it’s on the order of 8 or 9%. Sorry, I don’t have the exact number in front of me. It depends whether we’re talking about the base GHG intensity reduction trajectory, which is lower, or the direct compliance trajectory, which is higher. So it’s around 8% in 2030 for the base trajectory reduction, but then it goes up by another 13% to reach direct compliance. So, that’s nearly 21% in total.

[MB]: Those are interesting numbers because ship hulls typically last 25 to 30 years. There are exceptions, like the “ghost tankers” currently transporting Russian oil, and some older vessels that eventually get scrapped and recycled, but generally speaking, most ships remain operational for about three decades. That means most ships sailing five years from now are already on the water today.

This raises a key question: How will these existing ships achieve efficiency gains of 8 to 21% compared to the 2008 baseline, given they’re already built and operational?

We’re back to the balancing act around 2008 as a baseline. Back then, ships were steaming faster and designs were less efficient, so there are already savings embedded just by operational changes like slow steaming. But if ships today aren’t already meeting the upcoming regulations, how exactly will they achieve compliance in the relatively short span of five years?

[TS]: On energy efficiency, you don’t actually get credit from operational changes like speed reduction. Changing your speed doesn’t count towards the GFI, because the regulation specifically targets the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuel you have onboard. In other words, what’s regulated isn’t overall greenhouse gas emissions per unit of transport supply—which would include operational efficiencies—but purely the carbon intensity of the energy itself.

That means your compliance options are limited to measures related directly to onboard energy sources. Although guidelines aren’t fully finalized yet, wind assistance would likely count. So if you installed sails on your existing five-year-old ship, you’d receive some credit toward compliance. Similarly, energy you use when docked in port—connecting your vessel to shore-based electricity—would also count.

However, this varies considerably by vessel type. Many ships won’t significantly lower emissions through shore power because they’re only alongside for short periods, limiting electricity substitution to small single-digit percentages. Cruise ships might be exceptions since they spend more time docked and could displace more of their onboard energy demand with electrification.

But for most ships, if wind assistance and shore power aren’t sufficient to meet the required 8% reduction—which is just the baseline compliance, with a $100 charge applied to emissions in the next band—they’ll have to consider biofuels. There are already significant examples of companies trialing biofuels and securing biofuel supplies specifically to achieve the required emission-intensity reductions.

[MB]: If you’re bunkering in Singapore or Rotterdam, you can buy B30 right now. I’m not sure how many other ports currently offer biofuel blends—those two immediately spring to mind, but that might just reflect my availability bias.

[TS]: Those are also the ports that publish data on this. Most references indeed point to Singapore and Rotterdam because they sell some of the largest volumes, making information readily accessible. But biofuel availability is broader—there are multiple ports providing these fuels today.

However, it’s worth remembering we’re still pre-regulation. Ships won’t need these fuels to comply until 2025, though some operators are already adopting them to align with existing EU regulations. The EU already has its own standards, so we’re seeing early adoption there.

Globally, I would expect the IMO decision to accelerate the evolution of supply chains for B30 and similar biofuel blends, much like we saw previously with low-sulfur fuels. Biofuels represent the obvious “drop-in” compliance solution for existing vessels. As long as prices stay competitive—without demand outstripping supply and pushing prices higher or other sectors driving up costs—biofuels will be the simplest solution for existing ships that need to meet the upcoming IMO regulations.

[MB]: That’s interesting, because the market demand dynamics will certainly shift significantly. Right now, we produce around 70 million tons of biodiesel annually, mostly wasted in ground transportation. And ground transportation is electrifying rapidly—India reached about 97% heavy rail electrification by the end of last year; China is around 75–80%. Europe’s passenger rail network is already 65–70% electrified and continues to electrify, supplemented by battery-electric solutions for bridging gaps.

So, as ground transport electrifies, that existing biodiesel demand will diminish. This raises the question of whether that 70 million tons will transition towards sustainable aviation fuels or be consumed largely by shipping. It sets up an interesting market shakeout as organizations place their bets.

But there’s another intriguing question here. Suppose that many ship operators simply can’t achieve full compliance. From what you’re telling me, operators will likely opt to pay the initial $100-per-ton fine rather than the higher $380 fine. They’ll choose to blend fuels and pay penalties on emissions above the base compliance level. Given this, what do your models project as the total annual revenue from these fines, and how will that revenue ultimately be used?

[TS]: So in the parameters that we have for the first three years, we think assuming the behaviors of some biofuel use and some methane use and some methanol use, given the existing fleet, that will generate on the order of 11 to 12 billion US dollars per annum. So a total pot of the order of 33 to 36 billion by the end of that first three-year phase. And that first three-year phase is the first period for which we actually have the parameters very clearly set. What the parameters will be in 2031 is still uncertain because there are various review clauses that will kick in and those values might change. So therefore the revenues might increase—or potentially not. And the use of the revenues is still to be finalized.

But there is some language that we can see and we can sense from the political dynamic from the negotiations in April, that there’s a strong desire for a large share of that to be used for subsidizing what the IMO calls ZNZS, or zero or near-zero emission fuels. And then there’s also revenue use for wider purposes, for which there’s quite vague language, but which many countries suggest should support energy infrastructure investments in countries, particularly low-income countries, and also assist countries with their various other energy transition needs, which will include skills retraining of seafarers, maybe some uses to improve logistics so that the effect of the cost increase due to using more expensive fuels is reduced as much as possible.

You know, these various other things that one could use the money for, which will now have to go through a political discussion to finalize. So it’s not clear exactly what the ratios are. There was some proposal during the meeting that it should be split where the majority of the money should go to those national projects, which would still leave on the order of 40%, so a good chunk of maybe 5 billion per annum, to energy subsidy for the ZNZ substitute fuel use. But others have proposed that the subsidy should be greater—maybe use 70%, so closer to 8 billion per annum going to fuel rewards for these ZNZ fuels. And I guess the final thing to say here is that we haven’t yet agreed the definition of ZNZ.

At the moment we have a threshold on the greenhouse gas intensity that sets the minimum requirement for a ZNZ, and that’s 19 grams of CO₂ per megajoule. That puts most of the first-generation biofuels out of the definition, but includes advanced biofuels, and also includes e-fuels, as long as they’re made in a way which minimizes upstream emissions—so using renewable electricity. It probably discounts a lot of the blue fuels that come from CCS and natural gas, steam methane reformation and CCS on land, but it’s not definitive. Maybe, maybe some of that. But that’s just the minimum. And we’ll now have another political discussion to say: do we want everything that is within the minimum to be rewarded, or only a subset? A subset that is genuinely scalable and therefore will be the one we will need in large volumes by the time we get to 2040.

[MB]: It’s going to be interesting to see how this plays out. One of the observations I’ve been making and wondering about since the late 2010s is why everyone assumes synthetic fuels will be remotely affordable for anyone.

I did the techno-economic analyses on direct air capture and synthetic fuels, looked into chemical processes, and compared them against alternative solutions. The numbers simply didn’t make sense. Every time I’ve assessed the cost of green hydrogen production—across four continents, covering 15 or 20 different projects myself—the economics never added up to a truly cheap option.

For instance, I conducted a study on European energy colonialism in North Africa, specifically Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt, where European policies were pushing to manufacture green hydrogen locally for export, rather than prioritizing domestic decarbonization. My conclusion, which I’ve published, was that hydrogen can indeed be green—but it can’t be cheap. By extension, synthetic fuels can’t be cheap either. The IEA’s recent fuel assessments echoed this, finding synthetic fuels costing about four to six times as much as conventional fossil fuels.

This makes synthetic fuels extremely difficult economically, which is why I lean toward biofuels—they’ll likely cost around two to three times more than traditional fuels, rather than four to six times.

Meanwhile, the global biofuels market itself is set for transformation as electrification takes away biofuel’s current primary markets. This could leave the right kinds of molecules available—but airlines will be competing for exactly the same molecules.

All of the conversations I’ve had around this issue ultimately boil down to economics.

[TS]: Absolutely. There’s nothing in shipping that adds any premium, which is exactly why we’ve been using heavy fuel oil—a waste product—because shipping always gravitates toward the lowest-cost fuel source available. We need to identify what the equivalent low-cost waste product might be in the global economy of the future. We’ve tried to do exactly that ourselves.

Our problem is that we struggle to see bioenergy being supplied at the volumes needed—not just by shipping, but also by the numerous other sectors competing for it. We’ve analyzed the cost of substitution across these sectors. Take aviation as an example: if airlines can’t sufficiently decarbonize with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), they’ll need synthetic kerosene. Comparing the costs of synthetic kerosene versus synthetic ammonia indicates you’re more likely to see bio-derived SAF flowing into aviation, with E-fuels moving into shipping. This is because it’s much more efficient—per green electron—to produce synthetic ammonia for ships than synthetic kerosene for airplanes.

But that analysis still only focuses on shipping and aviation. In reality, sustainable biomass feedstocks—those which avoid unintended consequences like land-use changes—will be in demand from many sectors, even after accounting for the extensive electrification underway. This isn’t just our finding; others have reached similar conclusions.

This debate is precisely where the conversation sits right now. We need to revisit all assumptions about potential biomass consumers—whether that’s a growing global population, the plastics industry, or sectors not easily electrified—and then reassess how much residual biomass demand remains, and if that residual demand matches the sustainable bioenergy supply. We’ve done this before, but it should be revisited continuously. That reassessment will tell us clearly whether there’s enough sustainable bioenergy to avoid reliance on more expensive synthetic E-fuels, or whether E-fuels will inevitably have a significant role.

Based on current conditions, we think the incentives set by the IMO—using some of that projected $5 billion to $8 billion revenue—would be enough to make a viable business case for using E-ammonia in shipping this decade, even at today’s high hydrogen costs. That means, regardless of whether E-ammonia proves to be the optimal long-term solution, we’ll likely see at least some early adoption. Maybe not massive volumes initially, but certainly meaningful experimentation.

We already see ship owners ordering dual-fuel ammonia vessels because they’re convinced by these economics and skeptical about sufficient bioenergy availability in maritime markets. They’re willing to take the risk, experiment, and see how reality plays out—not just theoretical spreadsheet analyses from teams like ours. We need real-world data on costs, unexpected factors we’ve overlooked, or potential cost-reduction opportunities we’ve underestimated.

Over the next three to five years, we’ll gain valuable experience to help revisit and clarify these critical questions: What exactly will replace those 250 million tons of oil currently required each year to fuel the global shipping sector and serve global trade?

[MB]: Well, we disagree about that number because 55% of tonnage is in structural decline. So my projection for tonnage is lower than the adjusted tonnage that the IMO uses, which is fine. But it’s not like you’re using the maximal tonnage either. The Maersk Institute—when I talk to them, the Maersk McKinney Møller Institute for Maritime Shipping Decarbonization or whatever that collection of syllables is, it’s just too long a name—they reference 450 to 550 million tons. So there are all sorts of projected numbers, and there’s a big range. I’m at the bottom end of the range, just as I am with hydrogen.

But I’ll make two statements before we close. The first is that we throw away 2.5 billion tons of calories manufactured for human consumption every year. A full third of food is wasted. A lot of that waste happens at choke points or points of heavy processing, where it can be captured. Every ton of dried biomass turns into 0.4 tons of biofuels. So there’s a massive amount of biomass waste, currently turning into methane—a major greenhouse gas problem—that we are underutilizing. That waste stream is a large feedstock opportunity for biofuels, particularly for shipping and aviation, which still need them for long-haul transportation.

I’ve done the work on all the sources of biomass feedstock and the conversion technologies—professionally, for an energy firm that asked me what the energies of the future would be, and personally, because I’m a nerd who can’t help it. So I think the answers are there.

The second thing I’ll say is I did the math on ammonia. If you take a ton of e-ammonia and use it to fertilize biomass, the result—because of modern agricultural upskilling—is 64 tons of biofuels. If you just burn that ton of ammonia, you get exactly that: one ton of ammonia energy. But if you use it to grow biomass and make biofuels, you get 64 tons of output. So I think the math is going to become pretty obvious over time.

I think there’s a lot of emotion in the EU’s discussion around biofuels, but eventually economic rationality will prevail. That said, these are just differences of opinion. You guys make spreadsheets, I make spreadsheets. What’s going to matter is what people actually buy.

And here’s the good news: the IMO is now representative of an industry that’s getting serious about fixing climate change. And that’s a really good news story.

[TS]: Exactly. A good place to wrap up is acknowledging that, until now, it’s been very difficult to establish a clear business case for substantial investments—whether in high-quality bioenergy production that truly valorizes waste products rather than simply growing crops for bioethanol, which obviously isn’t scalable, or in synthetic hydrogen-derived fuel pathways.

The critical point is that the IMO regulations will create the business case that drives investment and innovation. We’ll gain valuable insights into both biofuels and hydrogen-derived alternatives, understanding their relative merits and trade-offs based on real-world experiences, not just theoretical debates.

This learning period over the next few years will be immensely beneficial, not just to shipping as it plans its future, but also to all sectors seeking solutions for hard-to-electrify applications.

[MB]: I always like to leave an open-ended opportunity at the end of our discussions. We’ve covered a lot of ground, but if there’s anything important we’ve missed or anything you’d like to add, this is your chance.

You have an audience of founders, CEOs, investors—all with a nerdish predisposition. Whether you want to share a key takeaway, offer advice, or even just pitch UMAS, how would you like to close this? What would you like to say with an open-ended opportunity to address this audience?

[TS]: I guess our takeaway is this: we had hoped for more clarity from the IMO outcome. We’d hoped for a steeper reduction curve, more aligned with climate science. It was difficult to celebrate fully, because the targets still aren’t entirely consistent with what we know is needed to avoid some of the most extreme climate outcomes.

Nevertheless, the shipping industry now faces dramatic and inevitable change. By 2040, we know the majority of energy used in shipping will no longer be fossil-based. The regulation now mandates a 65% greenhouse gas intensity reduction—this is binding, backed by significant penalties, enforced by an organization with a strong track record of ensuring compliance.

So, in the next 15 years, shipping will undergo profound shifts. While there remains uncertainty about exactly which fuel molecules will ultimately prove cost-optimal, the industry can now seriously strategize. Shipping requires long-term decisions—ships typically operate for around 30 years, and infrastructure such as terminals can last 40 years or more. Assets built today will soon exist in a world where fossil fuels are no longer dominant.

This presents enormous opportunities but also significant risks. The risk lies primarily in taking a “wait-and-see” approach, the traditional behavior in shipping. The opportunity comes from proactively doing the math—carefully analyzing which fuel pathways offer competitive advantages and how to build viable business cases around them. Those who move early can effectively de-risk their strategies, positioning themselves well for the coming transition.

Historically, it’s been easy to dismiss the credibility of IMO actions—but that’s changing now. I can’t think of another sector that has successfully advanced a regulatory strategy at such a global scale. There are examples where national policy has driven localized transitions, but shipping is unique in creating a global transition opportunity.

I hope this also triggers significant opportunities in lower-income countries, ensuring the energy transition isn’t solely led by North America, Europe, and China—regions with substantial public investment—but genuinely becomes a globally inclusive process. Energy transitions must encompass a wide variety of countries to succeed in practice.

[MB]: I’ll just say the IMO’s movement is a lot better than what the ICAO is doing.

[TS]: In relative terms, it certainly is.

The bill, expected to be signed into law on Friday afternoon, includes changes to taxes, better support programs for farmers, and new incentives for biofuels, reports Iowa’s News Now.

ISA President Brent Swart, a soybean farmer from Spencer, called the bill a major win for Iowa’s 37,000 soybean farmers and thanked the Trump administration and Iowa’s members of Congress for their work on key farming issues.

One important part of the bill extends support for clean fuel made from crops like soybeans until 2029. It also removes rules that made it harder to use farmland for these fuels and limits the fuel sources to those grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada.

Another change increases support for small biodiesel producers by raising the benefit to 20 cents per gallon. This will help local plants that make fuel from soybeans and create more opportunities for Iowa farmers.

The bill also provides long-term tax relief for farmers. It raises the amount of money a person can pass on without paying estate taxes to $15 million and keeps an important farm tax break in place. It also raises the base price for soybeans used in government programs to $10 per bushel starting in 2025, with increases tied to inflation beginning in 2031.

“For farmers passing family farms to sons and daughters, the estate tax reform helps secure our generational legacy,” Swart said. He also praised ISA members who spoke to lawmakers in support of the bill.

Ja, das würde ich auch gerne wissen. Denn um es vorwegzunehmen: Champagner gab es bei dem Flug, den ich für das „Luxemburger Wort“ gemeinsam mit anderen Journalisten und Journalistinnen aus dem Großherzogtum absolvierte, nicht. Das Erlebnis war sogar weniger glamourös als erhofft. Doch zunächst einmal zum „Warum“.

Warum eigentlich Privatjet? Grund für den kleinen Ausflug war eine Einladung des in Luxemburg ansässigen Unternehmens Jetfly. Man feiert in diesem Jahr seinen 25. Geburtstag und will der Presse vorführen, wie denn so ein Privatjet von innen aussieht, wie er sich anfühlt und wie sich das Fliegen gestaltet. Und man möchte natürlich ganz nebenbei erwähnen, wie stark das international tätige Unternehmen gewachsen ist. Von nicht einmal zehn Mitarbeitern in Anfangszeiten auf mittlerweile 500 Männer und Frauen, darunter 250 Pilotinnen und Piloten.

Erlebnis versus Flugscham

Diese einmalige Gelegenheit, Taylor Swift und Co. nachzueifern, sorgte für heftige Diskussionen in der Redaktion. Natürlich, das Ganze klingt recht glamourös und warum nicht den Leserinnen und Lesern einen Einblick in die Welt der Schönen und Reichen gewähren. Auf der anderen Seite stehen aber die Auswirkungen des Privatjet-Verkehrs: die hohen CO₂-Emissionen, die ständig Thema sind. Flugscham scheinen viele der Jetsetter nämlich nicht zu kennen.

Und schließlich sagten wir doch zu, trotz aller Zweifel. Die Neugier siegte mit hauchdünnem Vorsprung. Die Möglichkeit, dem Mysterium auf den Grund zu gehen, spielte ebenfalls eine tragende Rolle bei der Entscheidungsfindung.

Der Abflug für die Privatjetpassagiere, zu denen ich nun auch gehöre, erfolgt standardgemäß im Business Aviation Center des Flughafen Findel an einem sonnigen Dienstag. Noch ist kein Champagner in Sicht, dagegen aber die Sicherheitskontrolle, die schnell durchschritten ist (schließlich sind später nur wenige Passagiere und noch weniger Gepäck an Bord). Und dann heißt es warten, auf den Pilot oder die Pilotin, der oder die uns zum Flugzeug führt.

Kaum ist der Gedanke vollendet, stößt Pilotin Amélie zu der siebenköpfigen Reisegruppe. 21 Prozent der Piloten bei Jetfly sind Frauen, in der gesamten Flugbranche sind es dagegen weit unter zehn Prozent. Sie führt uns nach draußen. Und dann steht sie auch schon vor mir: die Pilatus PC-12. Laut Herstellerangaben sind mit dem einmotorigen Propellerflugzeug Reichweiten je nach Passagierzahl von bis zu 2.800 Kilometern möglich, die Maximalgeschwindigkeit beträgt 537 Kilometer pro Stunde.

Jetfly, vor 25 Jahren in einem kleinen Appartment im Bahnhofsviertel aus der Taufe gehoben und mittlerweile im neuen Skypark Business Center am Findel ansässig, verfügt über 52 dieser Flugzeuge, die etwa auch in Australien vom Flying Doctor Service genutzt werden und sich laut Herstellerangaben besonders gut für kürzere Strecken eignen.

Ergänzt wird die Flotte durch 15 Pilatus PC-24, die aufgrund höherer Reichweite (bis zu 3.600 Kilometer) etwa auch Flüge bis in den Süden Spaniens oder in den Norden Afrikas ermöglichen, und drei kleinere Cirrus SF50 (bis zu 2.000 Kilometer), bei denen nur ein Pilot mit an Bord sein muss und ein Fallschirmsystem verbaut ist. Je nach Maschinengröße können so vier bis neun Personen von A nach B gebracht werden.

Eine Haltung wie eine Ährenleserin

Die Pilatus PC-12, die vor mir in der Sonne glänzt, ist in dezentem Grau gehalten, das Band, das sich um die Einstiegstür legt, ist bordeauxrot. „Das Design stammt von Philippe Starck“, erklärt Leslie Jacob, eine Vertreterin von Jetfly, und verweist schon vor dem Einstieg auf das Interieur, das ebenfalls vom französischen Stardesigner gestaltet wurde.

Mit einem „Da bin ich aber gespannt“ bewältige ich die wenigen Stufen der kleinen Treppe … und beuge den Oberkörper nach unten. Gebückt, fast so wie die Ährenleserinnen aus dem gleichnamigen Gemälde von Jean-François Millet, bewege ich mich durch das Innere des Flugzeugs und setze mich auf einen der beiden vorderen Plätze mit Blickrichtung Heck. Die zwei Männer aus der Gruppe werden gebeten, aufgrund der gewünschten optimalen Gewichtsverteilung dort zu sitzen.

Die fünf Damen verteilen sich auf die sechs nach vorne gerichteten Plätze. Pilotin Amélie gibt uns eine kurze Sicherheitseinweisung, zeigt uns die drei Notausgänge, die winzige Toilette, die wir aber bestenfalls nicht nutzen sollen, sowie die Schwimmwesten und weist uns auf die Getränke (Softdrinks) und Snacks hin, bei denen wir uns selbst bedienen müssen. Der Flug ist kurz, der Service fällt daher aus.

Und dann geht es auch schon los, Amélie und ihr Kollege Antoine starten die Maschine und rollen auf die Startbahn. Ziel ist die Stadt Epernay in der Champagne, es geht also zumindest mal in Richtung Edelbrause. Der angesteuerte Flughafen Aérodrome d‘Epernay/Plivot ist laut Jetfly eines von insgesamt 3.000 Zielen in Europa, das angeflogen werden kann. Dazu kommen noch weitere Ziele in Nordamerika: Dort arbeitet das Unternehmen mit einem lokalen Anbieter namens PlaneSense Inc. zusammen.

Stationiert sind die Flugzeuge überall und nirgends: Sie befinden sich dort, wo die Menschen hinfliegen und werden erst bei Bedarf vom nächstgelegenen Flughafen angefordert, so werden überflüssige Leerbewegungen, sogenannte Empty-leg-Flüge, vermieden. Gleiches versucht man auch dadurch zu vermeiden, dass solche Anforderungsflüge den Kunden speziell angeboten werden.

Wer Mitglied im Club der Privatjet-Nutzer werden will, kann entweder einen Jet chartern oder im Falle von Jetfly Anteilsinhaber eines Flugzeugs werden und damit viel einfacher auf ein solches zugreifen. Wie groß dieser Anteil ist, wird anhand des geschätzten Einsatzbedarfs gemessen und ist auch abhängig vom gewählten Flugzeugtyp. Der Einstieg erfolgt bei 200.000 US-Dollar (Cirrus SF50), was einem Zwanzigstel der Gesamtsumme entspricht. Die entsprechende Maschine wird erst ausgeliefert, wenn alle Anteile erworben wurden.

Dazu kommen weitere Kosten: monatliche Servicegebühren, der Preis für die tatsächlich geflogenen Stunden (rund 4.000 Euro pro Stunde) und zudem Flughafengebühren. Der Vertrag über die Nutzung läuft über fünf Jahre und kann auf bis zu zehn Jahre verlängert werden. Auch besteht die Möglichkeit, einen Anteil zu verkaufen. Leerflüge werden nicht berechnet, ebenso nicht die Positionierung. Eine Maschine – also die, an der man einen Anteil erworben hat – steht den Teilnehmern des Jetfly-Programms, derzeit sind es etwa 550, innerhalb von 24 Stunden zur Verfügung.

Nur ein wenig Luxus

Für unsere Reisegruppe heißt es aber zunächst einmal fliegen, rund 30 Minuten, um genau zu sein. Wir befinden uns in einer niedrigen Höhe, der Druckausgleich in den Ohren klappt problemlos, der Flug verläuft nahezu ohne Turbulenzen. So bleibt ein wenig Zeit, um die Felder und Wälder durch das Fenster unter die Lupe zu nehmen.

Oder aber auch: um das Dekor ein wenig genauer zu betrachten. Die Ledersitze sind bequem, aber nicht übermäßig groß. Da der Nebenmann von mir durch den schmalen Gang getrennt ist, kommt kein Engegefühl auf. Auch für die Beine ist ausreichend Platz, zumindest für eine kurze Reise, die kaum länger dauert als eine Tramfahrt vom Bahnhof der Hauptstadt bis zum Flughafen Findel. Der Geräuschpegel ist hoch, aber auszuhalten. Gespräche mit dem Nebenmann sind möglich, eine Gruppendiskussion eher nicht.

Philippe Starck konnte sich, anders als erhofft, im Inneren, ähnlich wie bei der Außenlackierung, nur bedingt austoben. Die gut betuchte Kundschaft erwartet ein Interieur, das das Auge nicht ablenkt: Das Ergebnis des Designprozesses kommt in einer Farbfamilie irgendwo zwischen Greige und Beige daher. Für den nötigen Business-Komfort sorgen ausklappbare Tische und Ladeanschlüsse fürs Smartphone.

Mit der Gulfstream G700, die sich Jeff Bezos jüngst für etwa 72 Millionen Euro angeschafft hat, haben die Flugzeugtypen von Jetfly wenig gemein. Sie sind keine Privatjets mit überbordendem Luxus, sie wirken eher wie Lufttaxis, die vor allem Geschäftsleuten das Leben erleichtern und sie schnell, problemlos und vor allem zeitlich flexibel ans Ziel bringen. Ein Drittel der Flugbewegungen bei Jetfly entfalle auf Geschäftsreisen, ein Drittel auf Privatreisen und ein Drittel auf solche Reisen, die beides verbinden, erklärt Leslie Jacob.

Sanfte Rasenlandung

Die Pilatus PC-12 bringt unsere Reisegruppe leider nicht bis an die Küste oder zu einer der spektakulären Landebahnen im Alpenraum. Und doch ist das Aufsetzen auf der Piste des Aérodrome d‘Epernay/Plivat ein besonderes Erlebnis. Denn: Die Landebahn ist nicht asphaltiert.

Unglaublich sanft setzen wir auf der Grasfläche zwischen Feldern auf. Alle bleiben brav auf ihren Plätzen sitzen und genießen das Ausrollen. „Man kann sogar auf Sandpisten landen“, ergänzt Jetfly-Mitarbeiterin Leslie. Und nach wenigen Sekunden auf der Parkposition steigt Pilotin Amélie aus dem Cockpit, öffnet die Passagiertür und entlässt uns nach draußen.

Kunden aus Luxemburg steuern laut Jetfly besonders häufig Paris (Le Bourget), Genf, Brüssel, Angers und Rom (Viterbe) an. Auf den Plätzen folgen Fanborough bei London, Amsterdam, Saanen in der Schweiz und Perugia. Insgesamt wachse die Nachfrage stark, so das Unternehmen: Die Zahl der Flugbewegungen von Jetfly stieg allein im Großherzogtum von 300 im Jahr 2019 auf 400 im Jahr 2024.

Später, bei einer längeren Pause am Boden, wird sich natürlich ausgiebig über die Erfahrungen an Bord unterhalten. Und dann kommt auch ein Thema zur Sprache, das schon seit längerem durch die Medien geistert: die Belastung der Umwelt durch Privatflüge.

Verschiedene Organisationen, wie etwa Greenpeace, weisen auf den Boom von Privatjetflügen hin und damit auch auf den wachsenden CO₂-Ausstoß. Laut einer Studie stiegen die Abgasemissionen in diesem Bereich zwischen 2019 und 2023 um 46 Prozent. Und der Markt wächst weiter, damit auch die Belastung der Umwelt: geschätzt etwa um 14,3 Prozent pro Jahr, vor allem im Kernmarkt der privaten Fliegerei, den USA.

Auf dem Papier betrachtet haben die CO₂-Emissionen der privaten Luftfahrt nur einen geringen Anteil an den Gesamtemissionen der Branche, etwa 1,8 Prozent. Auf der anderen Seite steht aber der geringe Prozentsatz der Bevölkerung, der Privatjets nutzt. Klimaexperten schlagen daher Alarm.

Bedingt nachhaltig

Jetfly, versichern Leslie Jacob und ihr belgischer Kollege Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore, sei sich dieser Problematik bewusst. Beide verweisen auf den geringen Anteil an den Gesamtemissionen und zeitgleich auf die Bemühungen des Unternehmens, im Sinne der Nachhaltigkeit zu handeln, wie etwa durch die Vermeidung von Empty-leg-Flügen oder die Möglichkeit, einer Mitfahrzentrale gleich, sich einen Privatjetflug mit anderen zu teilen.

Seit Februar 2025 besteht für Jetfly-Anteilseigner zudem die Möglichkeit, statt auf Kerosin auf SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), also einen nachhaltigen Flugkraftstoff, zu setzen. Dieser besteht aus nachwachsenden Rohstoffen, ist jedoch teurer in der Herstellung. Der Passagier beziehungsweise die Passagierin übernimmt den Aufpreis. Der CO₂-Fußabdruck werde laut Unternehmen dadurch um bis zu 40 Prozent reduziert.

Ob das auch häufig angefragt werde? „Ja, es läuft“, sagt Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore mit einem Lachen. Die Kinder der Anteilseigner hätten ein anderes Verständnis von Umwelt- beziehungsweise Klimaschutz und würden daher ihre Eltern dazu drängen, den Aufpreis zu zahlen.

Die CO₂-Emissionen seien laut Jetfly bei den Pilatus-Maschinen niedriger als bei vergleichbaren Flugzeugen anderer Hersteller. Das zeigen auch verschiedene Studien. Doch man sollte auch nicht vergessen: Eine PC-12 verbraucht rund 200 Liter Kerosin pro Stunde, eine PC-24 sogar 600 Liter.

Mit diesen Informationen im Kopf geht es dann auch schon wieder zurück zum kleinen Flugplatz mit Rasenpiste. Und knapp 30 Minuten später, nach einem vom Wind ein wenig verwehten Flug, der einer Passagierin gar den Magen auf den Kopf stellt, setzt die Propellermaschine schließlich zur Landung in Luxemburg an.

Den von mir herbeigesehnten Champagner gab es übrigens am Boden, vor dem Mittagessen. In der Pilatus PC-12 greife ich erneut brav zur Wasserflasche, die in einer Ausbuchtung neben meinem Platz zu finden ist. Vielleicht ist das auch die vernünftigere Getränkewahl, denn schließlich schmeckt mir der Crémant, der in den Luxair-Maschinen serviert wird, in luftiger Höhe nie so gut wie am Boden.

The airline group confirmed a firm order for 20 additional A330-900 aircraft during an official event in France, marking a clear signal of its long-term commitment to fleet renewal, sustainability, and customer comfort. This latest agreement effectively doubles the airline’s future A330neo fleet to 40 aircraft, ensuring it can deliver on growth ambitions while meeting evolving passenger expectations.

Expanding Malaysia Airlines’ Widebody Capacity

Malaysia Airlines, the flagship carrier of Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), has already begun operating its first A330neo jets on popular routes linking Kuala Lumpur to destinations such as Melbourne, Auckland, and Bali. These early deliveries have been praised for their modern, premium cabins and enhanced operational performance.

With this new order, the airline is investing in a consistent and standardized widebody fleet that will allow it to offer seamless experiences across its network. MAG’s leadership describes this move as essential for future growth, enabling the carrier to serve high-demand regional and long-haul routes with greater efficiency and reliability.

By doubling its A330neo commitment, Malaysia Airlines is also responding to strong passenger demand for comfort, connectivity, and sustainability. The aircraft’s modern features, fuel efficiency, and advanced passenger amenities make it an ideal fit for the airline’s evolving strategy.

Delivering Premium Passenger Experiences

The A330neo is designed with Airbus’s award-winning Airspace cabin, which offers passengers a distinctive experience characterized by more space, advanced lighting, and modern design. Travelers benefit from enlarged overhead bins, customizable mood lighting, and the latest in-flight entertainment systems.

This premium configuration aligns perfectly with Malaysia Airlines’ focus on delivering a world-class travel experience. The airline has committed to an all-new premium cabin layout for the A330neo, ensuring that passengers across all classes enjoy enhanced comfort and amenities. Business travelers and leisure passengers alike will see tangible improvements on routes served by the new fleet.

Such investments demonstrate Malaysia Airlines’ determination to compete effectively with other premium carriers in the region. By offering a modern, comfortable, and technologically advanced cabin, the airline aims to attract discerning travelers and reinforce its brand as a leading choice for travel to and from Southeast Asia.

Fuel Efficiency and Sustainability Goals

Malaysia Aviation Group doubles Airbus A330neo orders with sustainability as a key driver. The A330neo is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, delivering substantial improvements in fuel efficiency and emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft.

According to Airbus, the A330neo is capable of flying up to 13,300 kilometers non-stop while burning significantly less fuel per seat. This operational efficiency allows airlines to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing performance or passenger comfort.

In line with global aviation targets, the A330neo can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today, with a target of 100% SAF capability by 2030. For Malaysia Airlines, this aligns with broader sustainability goals to reduce environmental impact and support industry-wide decarbonization efforts.

MAG’s Managing Director, Datuk Captain Izham Ismail, emphasized that this fleet renewal is part of a long-term vision of building a future-ready fleet that supports sustainable growth, delivers consistent value to passengers, and strengthens competitiveness in key markets.

Strengthening Strategic Ties with Airbus

The latest order was signed during an official visit to France by Malaysia’s Prime Minister, highlighting the importance of strong diplomatic and commercial ties between Malaysia and France. It also underscores the trust and confidence that Malaysia Aviation Group places in Airbus as a long-term strategic partner.

Airbus executives described the repeat order as a testament to the A330neo’s performance, versatility, and popularity among premium airlines worldwide. This endorsement strengthens Airbus’s position in the competitive widebody market, while supporting Malaysia Airlines’ efforts to modernize its fleet and deliver improved passenger experiences.

By securing this deal, Airbus cements its role as a key supplier to Malaysia Airlines, providing not only the aircraft themselves but also ongoing support, training, and maintenance services that are critical for safe and reliable operations.

Supporting Growth in Asia-Pacific Aviation

Asia-Pacific remains one of the most dynamic and competitive regions in global aviation. With strong demand for both regional and long-haul travel, airlines are investing heavily in new aircraft to serve growing passenger numbers and shifting market needs.

For Malaysia Airlines, this expanded A330neo fleet will enable more non-stop routes, better frequency on high-demand services, and more efficient deployment of aircraft across its network. Travelers can expect improved connectivity between Kuala Lumpur and major destinations in Australia, New Zealand, North Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

Such expansion is essential for Malaysia Airlines to maintain its relevance and competitiveness in a market where other regional carriers are also modernizing their fleets and expanding their networks. By offering passengers a superior travel experience while managing operational costs, Malaysia Airlines aims to grow market share and enhance its reputation as a leading Asian carrier.

Aircraft Features That Impress

Powered by the latest Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, the A330neo offers a range of up to 7,200 nautical miles (13,300 km) non-stop. The aircraft’s advanced aerodynamics, fuel-efficient engines, and state-of-the-art cabin design combine to deliver both operational advantages and passenger satisfaction.

Key features include:

Enlarged overhead bins for more carry-on storage

Advanced lighting systems with customizable settings

Improved cabin layout for greater comfort and privacy

Latest in-flight entertainment and connectivity options

These enhancements make the A330neo especially attractive to airlines looking to offer a premium product while managing costs and environmental impact. For Malaysia Airlines, these features will help differentiate its service and meet the high expectations of today’s travelers.

Airbus’s Global Success with the A330neo

At the end of May 2025, Airbus’s A330 Family had secured over 1,800 firm orders from more than 130 customers worldwide. The A330neo itself has proven popular among premium carriers seeking a versatile, cost-efficient solution for both regional and long-haul markets.

Airbus continues to innovate with the A330neo, improving fuel efficiency, reducing emissions, and enhancing passenger comfort. As airlines transition to more sustainable operations, models like the A330neo play a vital role in bridging the gap toward full SAF adoption and eventually zero-emission technologies.

Malaysia Aviation Group’s repeat order validates Airbus’s strategy of continuous improvement and close collaboration with airline partners to meet evolving market demands. This partnership supports not only the airlines’ growth but also broader industry goals around safety, sustainability, and passenger experience.

This latest commitment signals Malaysia Aviation Group’s readiness to invest in its future and deliver consistent, high-quality service to passengers around the world. By doubling its A330neo order, the group is making a clear statement about its ambition to be a leading player in the region.

For travelers, this means more comfortable flights, more direct routes, and the confidence that their chosen airline is investing in modern, efficient, and environmentally responsible aircraft. As Malaysia Airlines continues its transformation, the A330neo will play a central role in shaping the next chapter of its story—one built on safety, sustainability, and superior service.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/malaysia-airlines-airbus-a330-900-takeoff.webp,N,,2025-07-05 12:10:45.353991

Logo no início de sua fala, antes mesmo das tradicionais nominatas, Lula fez críticas a vários órgãos de fiscalização, pedindo mais rigor no acompanhamento dos reajustes nos preços dos combustíveis.

“É preciso fiscalizar para saber se os preços estão sendo justos ou se tem alguém tentando mais uma vez enganar o consumidor brasileiro. Se não, seremos tratados como bando de imbecis, porque decidimos uma coisa e ela não acontece na ponta“, afirmou. Lula citou órgãos como a Agência Nacional do Petróleo (ANP), o Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica, a Secretaria Nacional de Defesa do Consumidor (Senacom), a Polícia Federal e o Procon, pedindo um acompanhamento mais de perto dos valores que estão sendo cobrados na bomba dos postos de gasolina.

“É preciso que esses órgãos, que têm a função de fiscalizar, não permitam que nenhum posto de gasolina neste país venda o combustível mais caro do que ele tem que vender. Não é possível que a Petrobrás anuncie tanto desconto no óleo diesel e esse desconto não chega para o consumidor”, declarou o presidente.

MAGDA TEM CARA DE “BOBINHA”, MAS É “COMPETENTE”

Em outra parte do discurso, Lula fez um “elogio” inusitado à presidente da Petrobrás, Magda Chambriard. O petista começou dizendo que a executiva é “uma das coisas boas que acontece na vida da gente“. A partir daí, a velha e boa habilidade com a improvisação do presidente começou a desafinar. “Quem olha para a Marta [o presidente errou o nome da presidente] assim, à primeira vista, essa mulher frágil, que anda devagar, que fala manso, pode pensar que ela não tem condições de dirigir uma uma empresa da magnitude da Petrobrás“, disse Lula. “E a surpresa é que a companheira Magda é extraordinariamente competente, não para dirigir uma Petrobrás, pra dirigir duas Petrobrás, ela teria competência para apresentar os investimentos que estão sendo feitos aqui“, emendou.

Em outro trecho de sua fala, Lula disse que “Quem vê a Magda assim pensa ‘ah, aquela presidente é bobinha, vamos acossar ela’. Tá ferrado. Tá ferrado porque não sabe a quantidade de inteligência tratada de veneno que tem na cabeça dessa mulher“.

NOVOS PROJETOS EM REFINO E PETROQUÍMICA

Os aportes anunciados hoje pela Petrobrás já haviam sido antecipados pela companhia ao longo da semana. Somando mais de R$ 33 bilhões, os investimentos têm potencial para criar mais de 38 mil empregos, diretos e indiretos, por meio de iniciativas voltadas à ampliação da eficiência operacional, à produção de combustíveis renováveis e ao estímulo ao desenvolvimento socioeconômico. Desse total, R$ 29 bilhões serão investidos diretamente pela Petrobrás e outros R$ 4 bilhões pela Braskem, em um projeto que atua de forma integrada com os ativos da estatal.

Durante a cerimônia desta quinta-feira, a Petrobrás apresentou também avanços nos testes de produção de combustíveis com conteúdo renovável, como o Diesel R e o SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), por meio do processo de coprocessamento. Foram anunciadas ainda a intensificação da integração entre a Refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc) e o Complexo de Energias Boaventura, novos estudos e projetos na área de petroquímica em conjunto com a Braskem, além de aportes em qualificação profissional por meio do Programa Autonomia e Renda.

Na área de infraestrutura, o destaque principal é justamente o Complexo de Energias Boaventura, localizado em Itaboraí (RJ), e sua interligação com a Reduc. O conjunto de obras, estimado em R$ 26 bilhões, deverá gerar cerca de 30 mil empregos. A estrutura vai ampliar a capacidade de produção de diesel S-10 em 76 mil barris por dia (bpd), de querosene de aviação em 20 mil bpd e de lubrificantes grupo II em 12 mil bpd. Também está prevista uma planta dedicada à produção de combustíveis renováveis, como HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) e SAF, com capacidade de 19 mil bpd.

Entre as novidades em análise na integração entre o Complexo Boaventura e a Reduc está a implantação de um processo sustentável de rerrefino de lubrificantes, com capacidade para produzir 6,3 mil bpd. Com a operação do complexo voltada à produção de lubrificantes grupo II, a Reduc poderá adaptar instalações já existentes para tratar óleos usados, aplicando o conceito de economia circular e transformando resíduos em produtos de maior valor agregado. O teste de coprocessamento já recebeu aprovação da ANP e deve ser realizado em setembro.

“Só aqui no Estado do Rio de Janeiro, além dos nossos investimentos em exploração e produção, estamos investindo R$ 33 bilhões nesse megaprojeto envolvendo Reduc, Complexo Boaventura e Braskem. Serão gerados 38 mil postos de trabalho em um local que já se encontra carente de soldadores, caldeireiros, eletricistas etc. Isso é pleno emprego nessa localidade. Estamos treinando profissionais no programa Autonomia e Renda. Serão cerca de 3.200 profissionais para atuarem nesse segmento da indústria. Estamos gerando um círculo virtuoso no estado do Rio de Janeiro com todo esse investimento”, destacou Magda Chambriard.

No setor petroquímico, um dos principais projetos envolve a ampliação da unidade de polietileno da Braskem, que aumentará sua capacidade produtiva em até 230 mil toneladas anuais. A iniciativa utiliza gás natural proveniente da Rota 3 do Complexo Boaventura, está atualmente na Fase 3 de planejamento e tem orçamento estimado em R$ 4,1 bilhões, ainda sujeito às aprovações internas da Braskem. A expectativa é de geração de cerca de 7.500 empregos. A Petrobrás possui 47% do capital votante da empresa.

Também em fase de avaliação, outra frente promissora no Complexo de Energias Boaventura é a produção de ácido acético e monoetileno glicol, insumos amplamente utilizados na indústria química. Se concretizado, o projeto poderá reduzir a dependência externa do Brasil em relação a essas matérias-primas, hoje importadas.

No campo da geração térmica, está previsto o desenvolvimento de uma nova central termelétrica composta por duas usinas de 400 MW cada. A intenção é participar dos próximos leilões de reserva de capacidade, aproveitando as sinergias com a estrutura da Unidade de Processamento de Gás Natural (UPGN) de Itaboraí.

Para assegurar a integridade e o bom funcionamento das unidades da Reduc, a Petrobrás também prevê investimentos de até R$ 2,4 bilhões em paradas programadas de manutenção até 2029. Só em 2026, estão previstas grandes intervenções nas unidades de coqueamento retardado e hidrotratamento, com estimativa de geração de 18 mil empregos diretos e indiretos.",https://petronoticias.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cropped-petroicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-05 13:16:12.822275

“Para que quem ganha até R$ 5 mil não tenha que pagar imposto, a gente decidiu que 141 mil pessoas, que ganham mais de R$ 1 milhão, paguem um pouco mais. Não estamos tirando de alguém que ganha nada, mas de quem ganha mais de um milhão por ano, estamos tirando uma merreca deles para dar às pessoas mais pobres”, defendeu Lula, que também disse almejar fazer do Brasil um país de classe média.

O presidente afirmou que o Brasil “muitas vezes, foi governado para 35% da população. Governar para 100% exige mais sacrifícios, fraternidade, compreensão e carinho. O que é duro é que as pessoas não querem ceder, quem tem privilégio não quer abrir mão do privilégio”.

Quanto às recentes dificuldades enfrentadas na relação com a Câmara e o Senado — sobretudo após a derrubada do decreto com o aumento do IOF —, Lula declarou: “Sou muito agradecido à relação que tenho com o Congresso. Até agora, nesses dois anos e meio, o Congresso aprovou 99% das coisas que mandamos”.

E acrescentou: “Quando tem uma divergência é bom porque a gente senta à mesa, vai conversar e resolver. O governo pensa uma coisa, o Congresso está pensando outra, vamos resolver isso numa mesa de negociação. Não quero nervosismo porque eu só tenho um ano e meio de mandato”.

Lula também falou sobre a disputa em 2026: “Tem gente que pensa que o governo já acabou e já está pensando na eleição. Eles não sabem o que estou pensando. Se preparem, porque se tudo for como estou pensando, esse país vai ter, pela primeira vez, um presidente eleito quatro vezes”.

Economia em alta

Outro ponto destacado pelo presidente foi o atual cenário econômico. “O Brasil está vivendo um momento, se não extraordinário, de muita certeza e muita garantia. Não tem um número negativo neste país, a não ser a taxa de juros que não depende de nós, porque o BC tem autonomia e nós herdamos uma pessoa com uma febre muito alta, e para curar essa febre, leva tempo. Mas, podem estar certos de que os juros também vão entrar”.

Como indicadores do atual momento, lembrou: “O dólar, que estava em mais de R$ 6, já está em R$ 5,40; a inflação está em 5%; o crescimento já surpreendeu em dois anos e vai surpreender outra vez. Nunca tivemos tanto crédito para pequenos, médios e grandes como temos hoje, nunca os microempreendedores tiveram tanto financiamento como têm”.

Além disso, acrescentou: “Voltamos a construir o Minha Casa, Minha Vida, que ficou parado por quatro anos — prometeram uma tal de Casa Verde Amarela que nunca saiu. E estamos também vivendo o melhor momento da renda salarial, de aumento do salário mínimo, de menor desemprego da história do país e de muita respeitabilidade no mundo”.

Em recado ao agronegócio, majoritariamente alinhado à extrema direita, salientou: “Em três anos, em três Planos Safra, colocamos à disposição do agronegócio R$ 1,7 trilhão, somado com a agricultura familiar, valor que é o dobro do que foi feito em todos os quatro anos do governo passado. E não fazemos isso na perspectiva de que o agronegócio vai gostar do Lula, eu não estou propondo casamento. Faço isso porque o agronegócio é importante para a economia brasileira”.

Petrobras

Em seu discurso, Lula disse estar “muito orgulhoso da Petrobras, dos investimentos que estamos fazendo, de voltarmos a investir na indústria naval, na formação profissional e na contratação de mais gente, porque é isso que faz um país ser grande”.

Ele também defendeu o uso do combustível fóssil para financiar a transição energética: “Não vou abrir mão do petróleo brasileiro para os outros explorarem. Quero que a gente faça da forma mais saudável e responsável possível. Tenho muito orgulho de a Petrobras ser uma empresa que leva muito a sério a questão climática. Não queremos prejudicar nada, mas não queremos abrir mão da riqueza do nosso país e de favorecer o nosso povo”.

Dentro dos valores anunciados, um dos principais destaques no campo da infraestrutura é o projeto do Complexo de Energias Boaventura, em Itaboraí, e sua integração com a Reduc.

O complexo receberá um total de investimentos estimado em R$ 26 bilhões, com projeção de geração de 30 mil postos de trabalho diretos e indiretos. Conforme o Ministério de Minas e Energia, a nova estrutura ampliará significativamente a produção de combustíveis essenciais, como diesel S-10, querosene de aviação e lubrificantes grupo II. Além disso, o complexo também se dedicará à produção de itens renováveis, como HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) e SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Segundo anunciado, a Reduc já obteve autorização da Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para produzir SAF com até 1,2% de óleo de milho no querosene de aviação (QAV). De acordo com o governo, a iniciativa posiciona o refino da Petrobras na vanguarda da produção de combustíveis mais limpos, permitindo o atendimento antecipado da regulamentação para redução de emissões de voos internacionais e antecipa exigências da Lei do Combustível do Futuro.

Outro avanço é o desenvolvimento do Diesel R7, com 7% de conteúdo renovável. A Reduc, que já produz Diesel R5, recebeu autorização da ANP para iniciar os testes com o novo teor ainda este mês. Em linha com a economia circular, a Reduc poderá converter unidades para rerrefinar óleos usados, gerando produtos de alto valor a partir de resíduos, com testes de coprocessamento previstos para setembro.

Já os investimentos na área petroquímica incluirão a expansão da planta de polietileno da Braskem — da qual a Petrobras detém 47% do capital votante — que aumentará sua capacidade produtiva em até 220 mil toneladas por ano. Orçado em R$ 4,1 bilhões, o projeto poderá gerar cerca de 7.500 empregos diretos e indiretos.",https://vermelho.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54632913934_6834a6b8b5_c-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 15:03:32.887903

Integração do refino fluminense

No campo da infraestrutura, o grande destaque é o projeto do Complexo de Energias Boaventura, em Itaboraí, e sua integração com a Reduc. O total de investimentos, estimado em R$ 26 bilhões, gerará 30 mil postos de trabalho diretos e indiretos. A nova estrutura ampliará a produção de diesel S-10 em 76 mil barris por dia (bpd), querosene de aviação em 20 mil bpd e lubrificantes grupo II em 12 mil bpd, bem como a produção de produtos renováveis, tais como HVO (da sigla em inglês Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) e SAF, em 19 mil bpd, por meio de uma planta dedicada.

O Refino Boaventura e BioQAV Boaventura fazem parte do NovoPAC, em que a Petrobras reafirma seu compromisso com as iniciativas do Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento no estado do Rio de Janeiro, visando impulsionar o desenvolvimento econômico e social da região.

Outra novidade em estudo na integração do Complexo de Energias Boaventura com a Reduc é o processo sustentável de rerrefino de lubrificantes da refinaria de Caxias, com capacidade de produção de 6,3 mil bpd. Com a entrada em operação do Complexo Boaventura para produção de lubrificantes grupo II, a Reduc poderá converter unidades existentes para rerrefinar óleos usados, aplicando o conceito de economia circular para gerar produtos de alto valor a partir de resíduos. O teste de coprocessamento já foi autorizado pela ANP e está previsto para ocorrer em setembro deste ano.

Petroquímica fortalecida: novos projetos em Itaboraí e expansão da Braskem

Na área da petroquímica, os investimentos incluem a expansão da planta de polietileno da Braskem, que elevará sua capacidade produtiva em até 230 mil toneladas por ano. O projeto, que utiliza gás natural processado na Rota 3 do Complexo Boaventura, está atualmente em Fase 3 e está orçado em R$ 4,1 bilhões (ainda sujeito às necessárias aprovações pela governança da Braskem), podendo gerar cerca de 7.500 empregos diretos e indiretos. A Petrobras tem 47% de capital votante na Braskem.

Já no Complexo de Energias Boaventura, entre as novas oportunidades de negócios está a produção de ácido acético e monoetileno glicol – usados na indústria química em geral. Atualmente em fase de estudo, o projeto pode colocar o Brasil como produtor de insumos hoje importados.

Outro projeto é a nova central termelétrica, com duas usinas de 400 MW cada, com previsão de participação no próximo leilão de energia, aproveitando sinergias com a infraestrutura da Unidade de Processamento de Gás Natural (UPGN) de Itaboraí.

Paradas programadas de manutenção na Reduc

Para garantir a integridade, a confiabilidade e a segurança das instalações, a Reduc fará investimentos em paradas de manutenção de até R$ 2,4 bilhões até 2029. Como destaque, em 2026 serão realizadas importantes paradas nas unidades de coqueamento retardado e de hidrotratamento, chegando a gerar cerca de 18 mil postos de trabalho diretos e indiretos.

Descarbonização na Reduc: combustíveis mais limpos e nova termelétrica

A recente autorização da ANP para produção do SAF da Reduc, com até 1,2% de óleo de milho na composição do querosene de aviação (QAV), é o primeiro passo em direção à produção de até 10 mil bpd desse produto. Tal marco coloca o Refino da Petrobras na vanguarda da produção de combustíveis mais limpos, permitindo o atendimento antecipado da regulamentação para redução de emissões dos voos internacionais (padrão CORSIA) e antecipa exigências da Lei do Combustível do Futuro.

Outro avanço importante é o desenvolvimento do Diesel R7, com 7% de conteúdo renovável. A Reduc, que já produz Diesel R5, recebeu a autorização da ANP para iniciar os testes com o novo teor ainda este mês. Essa evolução reforça o compromisso da Petrobras com a descarbonização de seus produtos e a transição energética justa.

Com foco em modernização e eficiência energética, a Petrobras também prevê a construção de uma nova central termelétrica na Reduc, substituindo equipamentos obsoletos de geração de vapor e energia elétrica. O investimento, de R$ 860 milhões, deve gerar aproximadamente 640 postos de trabalho, elevar a confiabilidade e alçar a refinaria aos melhores padrões internacionais de eficiência.

Autonomia e Renda

Por meio do Programa Autonomia e Renda, a Petrobras está oferecendo mais de 3 mil vagas em 22 cursos de capacitação profissional no estado do Rio de Janeiro – sendo 980 apenas em Duque de Caxias. O programa, que acaba de completar um ano, celebra os investimentos de R$ 2 milhões no Rio de Janeiro em 2024, com foco em formação técnica e inclusão social nas comunidades, além de contribuir para o desenvolvimento socioeconômico da região.

“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain.","Behind SAF’s climate-friendly facade, a months-long investigation by Climate Home News and its partner The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to significant fraud risks, raising doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead. Matteo Civillini, Azril Annuar, David Fogarty, Megan Rowling and Sebastian Rodriguez wrote an article on the Climate Home News website to discuss their findings.

Is the world’s big idea for greener air travel a flight of fancy?

This is the starting point for Europe’s lofty dreams of greener air travel – a collection point in Malaysia for greasy plastic bottles filled with discarded frying oil, thousands of miles from its final destination.

One Saturday morning last month in the city of Melaka, volunteers in green T-shirts rushed over as Adibah Rahim and her husband drove into the central square, eager to unpack, weigh and register her consignment of used cooking oil (UCO) – the “liquid gold” in European plans to ramp up production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Rahim left the collection point 90 ringgit ($21) richer, three ringgit per litre of oil – a welcome boost to her family’s household budget.

“We usually collect UCO from around 200 members of the public,” said Michael Andrew, sales manager for Evergreen Oil & Feed, the company running the Melaka collection with the local council and a supplier to leading European SAF producers including Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell and Finland’s Neste.

When made from waste such as UCO, rather than agricultural commodities like soy or palm oil, backers say SAF can slash planet-heating emissions by up to 80% over kerosene jet fuel, without taking up land that would otherwise be used for food crops, or fuelling forest destruction.

But behind SAF’s climate-friendly facade, a months-long investigation by Climate Home News and its partner The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to significant fraud risks, raising doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead.

As SAF producers scramble for limited raw materials to meet new blending quotas in Europe and growing demand elsewhere, barely used and virgin palm oil is being passed off as UCO to traders that supply fuel companies, experts and industry operators told us. Palm oil that is not considered waste is not permitted under European Union rules for SAF because of its links to deforestation.

Our reporting focused on the UCO trade between Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, and Spain, the EU’s largest aviation market and home to one of its SAF pioneers – oil-and-gas giant Repsol.

Fried in Spain?

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Repsol CEO Josu Jon Imaz held up his company’s new 250-million-euro ($285 million) plant for renewable fuels, including SAF, near the historic Spanish port town of Cartagena as an example of how Europe can pursue a fair, green transition. Nearly half of the plant’s cost was financed by the EU’s lending arm, the European Investment Bank.

Repsol, which aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, started large-scale production of biodiesel and jet fuel – with its SAF mainly made from UCO – at the plant early last year.

Contrasting this with electric vehicles, many of them imported from China, Imaz said the raw material for Repsol’s renewable fuels “comes from Spanish farms and from the Spanish rural economy”.

In a promotional video for those fuels, Spanish celebrity chef Susi Díaz is seen dispensing advice to young cooks in the kitchen of her La Finca restaurant. Olive oil is then poured out of a pan into steel jugs as a voiceover explains how the waste cooking residue will be sent to the Repsol biofuels refinery.

Spain’s restaurants, however, are not the main source of Repsol’s UCO.

In 2024, more than 126,000 tonnes of UCO from Asia – enough to fill 50 Olympic-sized swimming pools – arrived in the Spanish region of Murcia, where Repsol’s flagship biofuels plant is located, according to trade datapublished by Spain’s tax agency.

Nearly two-thirds came from Malaysia, whose UCO exports to the region saw a 10-fold rise in the same year the energy heavyweight fired up its Cartagena SAF refinery.

The figures do not specify who provided or bought the raw material. But Climate Home obtained a list of shipments of UCO certified for the European market that were sourced from Malaysia by Repsol’s trading unit in Singapore, based on analysis of customs records provided by Data Desk, an investigative consultancy.

Repsol told Climate Home it “complements with imports when necessary” and receives raw material shipments from more than 20 countries. It declined to provide more details about its imports for “competitive reasons”.

The company is promoting the recycling of UCO from Spanish households – of which it says only 5% is currently collected – at its fuel stations across the country. But according to the trade data, Repsol purchased at least 53,000 tonnes of UCO from five Malaysian companies, including Evergreen Oil & Feed, in 2024.

No incidents involving fraudulent UCO were detected in Repsol’s supply chain, with its imports meeting EU rules on green certification. But our investigation found the company’s heavy reliance on Malaysian supplies exposes it to fraud risks that raise wider questions about global assertions over the sustainability of SAF.

Asked what steps it takes to fight fraud, Repsol said it operates a rigorous supplier monitoring system to ensure the sustainability and integrity of its SAF production. A “very strong” compliance process means dubious raw materials and suppliers suspected of misconduct are quickly weeded out, it added.

“Repsol firmly rejects any fraud that distorts competitiveness in the sector and supports all initiatives by relevant authorities to combat it,” the company said in emailed comments.

Shrinking air travel’s carbon footprint

Europe’s green aviation fuel refineries are boosting output because of new requirements by the EU and the UK for planes to use more SAF in the coming decades. From the start of this year, fuel supplied to airports across Europe needs to contain at least 2% of SAF, with targets rising gradually over the next 15 years, putting huge strain on tight global supplies.

SAF is crucial for shrinking aviation’s carbon footprint, according to industry body the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and is expected to account for 65% of emissions reductions by 2050, when the sector has committed to reaching net zero.

In 2023, emissions from international plane travel accounted for 2.5% of the world’s energy-related carbon emissions. As air travel increases, and other sectors are more easily able to decarbonise, that share is set to grow.

Repsol’s Imaz told financial analysts early last year that emissions-cutting alternatives to SAF – such as restricting short-haul flights – would represent “a drop in the ocean”.

But surging demand for SAF’s feedstock of choice, UCO, and a global certification system based on self-declaration at the start of the supply chain are encouraging fraud that undermines the new fuel’s green credentials.

‘Ridiculous’ collection numbers

This investigation found that by the time Asia-based traders ship UCO supplies overseas to refineries for processing into SAF, guaranteeing their environmental integrity is virtually impossible – despite the certification system on which fuel companies and airlines rely.

A source at a leading Malaysian UCO supplier to companies including Repsol told The Straits Times that some UCO collectors and restaurants are committing fraud by providing oil that does not qualify as used, although it is difficult to prove.

In Malaysia, which is among the world’s leading suppliers of both UCO and virgin palm oil, government-subsidised cooking oil is cheaper than UCO – providing a clear incentive for fraud.

In a 2024 report, Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E) cited figures showing that Malaysia already exports about three times as much UCO as it is estimated to collect domestically and import, raising concern about where that oil is coming from – and what it consists of.

The analysis by consultancy Stratas Advisors, used as a basis for the report, says the “substantial deficit” indicates the “risks of fraud and palm oil potentially compensating for the shortfall”.

In 2023, 458,000 tonnes of UCO originating in Malaysia were registered with International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), the leading certification scheme recognised by the European Commission to demonstrate compliance with its biofuels sustainability criteria.

In absolute terms, that puts Malaysia second only to China. But if all that UCO were collected from its population, it would have had by far the highest volumes per person worldwide: 15.2 litres for each Malaysian inhabitant, compared with 0.9 litres per capita in neighbouring Indonesia and 3.8 litres in Spain.

Cian Delaney, campaigns coordinator at T&E, said that figure is “ridiculous”, adding that for it to be feasible, Malaysia would need to be “a world leading collection and refining system – which it isn’t”.

Exactly what it says on the bottle?

The waste ingredients from which SAF is made change hands multiple times in a largely opaque system. To verify their sustainability, European regulators rely on checks by private auditors and agencies that issue green certificates based on their findings.

But there is a blind spot: the restaurants, street stalls, households and factories from which the UCO is pooled self-declare the origin and authenticity of their contributions. Aside from ad-hoc spot checks and sampling, there is no way of knowing that all of these providers are telling the truth.

“The opportunity, or incidents, of fraud is very high,” said Vasu R Vasuthewan, the former Malaysia head for the ISCC.

Malaysian authorities recently uncovered criminal syndicates that had pocketed thousands of dollars a day by getting hold of large amounts of subsidised cooking oil, mixing it in with UCO, and then selling it on to industrial UCO traders.

Industry sources told Climate Home and The Straits Times that many households and restaurants are motivated to replace cooking oil after a single use – contrary to standard practice – and then sell it on as UCO. Cooking oil is considered waste when it is no longer fit for frying – generally after being used between three and five times.

“Restaurant compliance [with sustainability standards] may be very low,” said Vasuthewan, who now runs his own UCO import and export business. “Many will fake their declaration, hoping they won’t get caught.”

Malaysia’s Deputy Minister of Plantation and Commodities Chan Foong Hin, who has acknowledged that fraud is an issue in the UCO sector, said authorities are “actively monitoring the industry to prevent fraudulent activities” and strengthening enforcement mechanisms.

“To maintain supply chain integrity, various measures are in place, including traceability systems, certification requirements, and stringent export documentation,” he told The Straits Times.

Delaney of T&E said it is difficult for auditors to physically check the origin of the oil, since hundreds of restaurants can supply the same collection point, making it a “notable blind spot”.

Spot checks, patchy audits

In theory, there is a system in place to keep fraudulent stocks out of the supply chain. Buyers and regulators in Europe rely on audit companies to trace the raw materials used in SAF and prove their green credentials.

Those audits are verified by authorised certification systems like ISCC – which is led by the biofuels industry and, according to one source, enjoys “a kind of monopoly” in the sector. It then issues sustainability certificates to commodities traders and fuel suppliers.

ISCC says its certification process supports “sustainable, fully traceable, deforestation-free and climate-friendly supply chains”.

Yet while auditors conduct random field checks in some cases, that happens less often in countries outside the EU, industry experts say.

According to James Cogan, compliance and markets lead at Irish biofuel firm Clonbio, it is far easier for fraud to occur outside the EU where “it’s much less visible to us”.

An analysis by T&E in China, for example, showed that sampling of points of origin happened in less than 10% of the ISCC-approved audits, whereas in the EU it was about 30%.

Adam Kirby, ISCC’s senior sustainability manager, told Climate Home that auditors monitor volumes coming in and out of collection points for any suspicious behaviour, in addition to carrying out spot checks.

He added that the ISCC follows the requirements established by regulators like the European Commission.

In 2024, ISCC also conducted 79 special “integrity assessments” – around two-thirds targeting Asia-based suppliers – which independently monitored the work of auditors. In a third of cases, it found violations of its certification requirements, including an inability to demonstrate the traceability of products, leading to the withdrawal of 11 certificates.

From frying pan to frequent flier

Under the current system, the entire SAF supply chain relies on a long paper trail rooted in those self-declarations and sporadic inspections at the points where UCO is collected.

In Malaysia, Evergreen’s owner CK Lau told The Straits Times the company follows the “proper processes” in its collection based on the requirements established by the ISCC. He added that the documentation is “critical” as, otherwise, the company would not be able to export its UCO.

Repsol, for its part, said it requires “suppliers to be certified under European Commission-recognised voluntary regimes”.

In turn, airline companies that buy from Repsol such as International Airlines Group (IAG) – the parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus and LEVEL – rely on documentation they get from it and other jet fuel providers, to show the SAF they are paying for has green certification.

In exceptional cases, IAG told Climate Home it has sent its own staff to carry out checks on the ground, as with a Shanghai-based Chinese supplier last year. It described the outcome of that audit – which included supply, record-keeping, environmental and health and safety standards – as “positive”.

Robert Boyd, Boeing’s Asia-Pacific sustainability lead who previously worked for IATA, thinks airlines’ exacting standards will bring positive change in the SAF industry. “You’ll see a race to the top… on sustainability, and it will, in a way, be self-regulated,” he added.

SAF certification faces EU scrutiny

In the meantime, following a string of fraud allegations about the authenticity of UCO-derived biofuels imported from China, the EU has been trying to ascertain whether the certification system governments and businesses rely on is fit for purpose.

EU authorities have been in talks to strengthen that system, leading to speculation that the ISCC could be suspended for failing to catch cases of biodiesel fraud. The ISCC denied in a statement that regulators had considered halting automatic EU-wide acceptance of its certificates, adding that its relationship with the European Commission remained constructive.

“There’s always bad actors, there’s always bad people, and there’s only a certain amount of policing that can be done in any industry,” said Kirby. “We at ISCC have done, I think, an incredible job.”

A European Commission spokeswoman said the bloc’s executive arm was “closely monitoring” the SAF market “to detect and prevent fraud, which risks undermining the EU’s ambition to effectively decarbonise air transport”.

Authorities in the US and Singapore, which wants to position itself as a regional SAF hub, have also voiced concern about fraud in the SAF supply chain.

“We are aware of concerns raised by various stakeholders, including the EU and the US, regarding fraudulent practices in the SAF supply chain. We share the same concerns as these pose risks to market confidence, fair trading and development of a nascent SAF market,” said Daniel Ng, chief sustainability officer at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS).

He said the authority was working with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection to develop “harmonised standards for feedstock verification to prevent further fraudulent practices”.

Demand for UCO sizzles

Whatever action regulators take to keep SAF fraud-free, leading European refiners such as Repsol are pushing for a level global playing field as well as more public funding to bring down costs and help develop the nascent sector on the continent.

IATA warned earlier this month that the European mandates had caused the SAF price paid by airlines to double because of hefty compliance fees being charged by producers.

Repsol’s aviation head Carlos Suárez Cubillo warned that fuel producers in parts of the world with laxer rules could produce SAF “with less regulation and less control of the feedstock… and here in Europe that could de-incentivise the production, the construction of new facilities”.

In Brazil, for example, an emerging SAF industry is gearing up to use crop-based feedstocks that are commonly linked to deforestation – and are therefore banned in Europe – such as soy and palm oil, as well as sugarcane-based ethanol, which has been linked to labour abuses and modern slavery.

An investigation by Climate Home’s partner in Brazil, InfoAmazonia,found that the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in the Amazon region – billed as Brazil’s first SAF project – is growing the crop on land areas subject to sanctions by the national environment agency over illegal deforestation, and is struggling financially after rights abuse allegations.

IATA hopes its efforts to put in place a global registry for SAF, launched in April as a voluntary initiative, will boost transparency around feedstocks and their greenhouse gas savings – and enable airlines to have some level of visibility and comparability between countries, fuel providers and airports.

SAF producers and airlines are also looking to other waste-based materials to meet rising mandates – especially as more advanced fuels made from green hydrogen and carbon dioxide, known as e-SAF, are still being developed and tested.

Repsol, for example, recently closed a deal with US vegetable oils giant Bunge to source camelina and safflower – non-food crops that can grow on poor land – to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) for biodiesel and SAF.

In January, it also announced it would invest more than 800 million euros ($906 million) in Europe’s first plant in the Catalan city of Tarragona to produce “renewable” methanol from organic urban waste that now ends up in landfill, for use in maritime, road and aviation transport from 2029.

But in the meantime, Europe’s overwhelming reliance on UCO means it will continue to import supplies from Asia – despite the concerns over fraud, said Sophie Byron, global head of biofuels pricing at S&P Global Commodity Insights.

“That trade flow is not going away anytime soon,” she said.

‘Token effort’ on aviation emissions?

At Repsol’s vast refinery complex near Cartagena, the colourful pipes and metal cylinders of the flagship SAF unit are dwarfed by the site’s traditional, fossil fuel-refining infrastructure.

Repsol’s plants processed 43.3 million tonnes of crude oil last year, according to its annual report. In contrast, its renewable fuels production capacity stands at 1.25 million tonnes per year – of which the Cartagena plant accounts for 250,000 tonnes, including SAF.

It is a token effort towards tackling rising aviation emissions, said Pedro Luengo of Spanish environmental network Ecologistas en Acción, standing on a hillside overlooking the complex.

As Spain’s airports prepare for another record-breaking summer holiday influx this year, Luengo warned that the hype around SAF could prove counter-productive in the fight against climate change by justifying yet more air travel.

“Instead of gradually substituting fossil fuels with other [green] sources and consuming less, what we are doing is expanding the opportunities because we have more fuels available to use,” he said. “That is a contradiction.”",https://energyindemand.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/saf1.png,N,,2025-07-05 06:00:28.263187

O evento na Refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc) celebra a retomada de grandes projetos com potencial para gerar mais de 38 mil empregos diretos e indiretos no estado.

Acompanhado pela presidente da Petrobras, Magda Chambriard, e pelo ministro de Minas e Energia, Alexandre Silveira, o presidente Lula vai presenciar o detalhamento dos investimentos que visam aumentar a eficiência operacional da empresa, gerar produtos renováveis e promover o desenvolvimento socioeconômico da região. O ato ressalta o compromisso do Governo Federal com a reindustrialização do país, a geração de empregos e a transição para uma economia mais sustentável, consolidando a Petrobras como motor de desenvolvimento para o Brasil.

COMPLEXO — Um dos principais destaques no campo da infraestrutura é o projeto do Complexo de Energias Boaventura, em Itaboraí, e sua integração com a Reduc. Esse complexo receberá um total de investimentos estimado em R$ 26 bilhões, com projeção de geração de 30 mil postos de trabalho diretos e indiretos. A nova estrutura ampliará significativamente a produção de combustíveis essenciais, como diesel S-10 (em 76 mil barris por dia – bpd), querosene de aviação (em 20 mil bpd) e lubrificantes grupo II (em 12 mil bpd).

O Complexo de Energias Boaventura também se dedicará à produção de produtos renováveis, como HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) e SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), em 19 mil bpd, por meio de uma planta dedicada. A Petrobras, por meio do Refino Boaventura e BioQAV Boaventura, reafirma seu compromisso com o Novo PAC, visando impulsionar o desenvolvimento econômico e social do Rio de Janeiro.

COMBUSTÍVEIS MAIS LIMPOS — A Petrobras apresentará avanços na descarbonização com a produção de combustíveis mais limpos. A Reduc já obteve autorização da Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para produzir SAF com até 1,2% de óleo de milho no querosene de aviação (QAV), um primeiro passo em direção a uma futura produção de até 10 mil bpd deste produto. Essa iniciativa posiciona o Refino da Petrobras na vanguarda da produção de combustíveis mais limpos, permitindo o atendimento antecipado da regulamentação para redução de emissões de voos internacionais (padrão CORSIA) e antecipa exigências da Lei do Combustível do Futuro.

Outro avanço é o desenvolvimento do Diesel R7, com 7% de conteúdo renovável. A Reduc, que já produz Diesel R5, recebeu autorização da ANP para iniciar os testes com o novo teor ainda este mês. Em linha com a economia circular, a Reduc poderá converter unidades para rerrefinar óleos usados, gerando produtos de alto valor a partir de resíduos, com testes de coprocessamento previstos para setembro.

PETROQUÍMICA — Os investimentos na área petroquímica incluirão a expansão da planta de polietileno da Braskem, que aumentará sua capacidade produtiva em até 220 mil toneladas por ano. Orçado em R$ 4,1 bilhões (sujeito a aprovações da governança da Braskem), este projeto poderá gerar cerca de 7.500 empregos diretos e indiretos. A Petrobras detém 47% do capital votante na Braskem. No Complexo de Energias Boaventura, estão em estudo projetos para produção de ácido acético e monoetileno glicol, insumos atualmente importados, que podem posicionar o Brasil como produtor.

CAPACITAÇÃO — A Petrobras reafirma seu compromisso social por meio do Programa Autonomia e Renda, que está oferecendo mais de 3 mil vagas em 22 cursos de capacitação profissional no estado do Rio de Janeiro, sendo 980 na cidade de Duque de Caxias. O programa recebeu investimento de R$ 2 milhões em 2024, com foco em formação técnica e inclusão social nas comunidades.

TERMELÉTRICAS — Outro projeto do Complexo de Energias Boaventura é a nova central termelétrica, com duas usinas de 400 MW cada, com previsão de participação no próximo leilão de energia. A Petrobras também prevê a construção de uma nova central termelétrica na Reduc, substituindo equipamentos obsoletos de geração de vapor e energia elétrica. O investimento, de R$ 860 milhões, deve gerar aproximadamente 640 postos de trabalho, elevar a confiabilidade e alçar a refinaria aos melhores padrões internacionais de eficiência.

PARADAS PROGRAMADAS — Para garantir a confiabilidade e eficiência das instalações, a Reduc também receberá investimentos de até R$ 2,4 bilhões até 2029 em paradas programadas de manutenção, com destaque para 2026, que deverá gerar cerca de 18 mil postos de trabalho.",https://agenciagov.ebc.com.br/noticias/202507/presidente-lula-participa-de-anuncio-de-r-33-bilhoes-em-investimentos-da-petrobras-no-rio-de-janeiro/@@download/image/Lula Petrobras 3.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 06:59:46.587717

The final version extends the 45Z credit through the end of 2029—two years beyond its current expiration date of Dec. 31, 2027.
The loss of tax credits for this feedstock will push UCO trade flows towards the EU, according to a Commodity Insights report on advanced biofuels in June.","Agriculture and biofuel associations uniformly voiced support for the new US budget for extending incentives on crop-based biofuels and excluding foreign feedstocks from tax breaks after it was passed by the Senate on July 3.

The budget, which is popularly known as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" is expected to be signed into effect by US President Donald Trump on July 4.

The bill extends 45Z credits by two years, restricts the eligibility of these credits to fuels made from feedstocks grown in the US, Canada or Mexico, retains full transferability throughout the term without large tax liabilities and excludes indirect land use change in calculating lifecycle GHG emissions, which would result in no land use change penalty for corn ethanol.

""From the very beginning of the budget reconciliation process, our goal was to advocate for the inclusion of tax policies that provide certainty, growth opportunities, and market stability for US ethanol producers,"" Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said.

Cooper highlighted that the extension and modifications to the 45Z clean fuel production credit, alongside the reinstatement of immediate expensing provisions for research and development, will create a favorable tax policy environment for ethanol producers.

The Section 45Z tax credit, also known as the Clean Fuel Production Credit, is a federal tax incentive established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The final version extends the 45Z credit through the end of 2029 -- two years beyond its current expiration date of Dec. 31, 2027.

Brian Jennings, CEO of the American Coalition for Ethanol, also praised the bill's passage, noting that the survival of the 45Z credit was unexpected when Trump took office.

""We're grateful to our Congressional champions for their steadfast leadership to support and strengthen the 45Z credit, which is remarkable considering the fact most other IRA-era tax credits were limited or phased out in the final package,"" Jennings said.

The legislation excludes emissions from indirect land use change from the calculation of a biofuel's credit value. That change would make it easier for corn-based ethanol to qualify for the credits, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.

While there were other improvements we had hoped to achieve in the final 45Z language, restoring transferability of the credit, removing indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, and restricting feedstock eligibility to USMCA countries will strengthen the credit from its original version, Jennings added.

""In terms of the credit term, we preferred the House language which would have extended 45Z through 2031, and we also urged Congress to specifically allow low-carbon farming practices to be monetized through 45Z with the feedstock calculator and guidelines USDA has released, but nevertheless ACE remains committed to working with federal agencies to implement the credit in ways that reward on-farm conservation practices and accelerate the use of homegrown, low-carbon biofuels.""

ACE has been working to help monetize low-carbon farming practices in 45Z through their 10-State USDA Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP).

Once farmers participating in the project have implemented reduced-till, 4R nutrient management, or cover crops, land-grant university scientists will collect soil samples and other field-level data about the resulting carbon benefits to better calibrate the GREET model and the USDA FDCIC to generate more reliable carbon scores for farming practices.

The 45Z credit, originally enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act, provides technology-neutral incentives for clean fuels based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.

The final version extends the 45Z credit through the end of 2029—two years beyond its current expiration date of Dec. 31, 2027.

""The president wants to go big on American energy dominance, and this legislation delivers,"" said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, a trade association that represents US ethanol producers.

The National Oilseed Processors Association and American Soybean Association, which represent US soybean, canola, flaxseed, safflower seed and sunflower seed crushing industries, praised the final passage of the bill, saying the reforms in the legislation represent a major win for the US oilseed processing industry and American farmers.

The new legislation caps 45Z credits at $1/gal (including for sustainable aviation fuel) except in the case of fuel produced from animal manure.

The new bill has delivered ""generational wins,"" the Iowa Soybean Association said on July 3, citing the extension of 45Z credits and increased Small Biodiesel Producer Credit to 20 cents/gal.

These changes provide some additional stability for the renewable fuels market generally but will cause some disruption in the sustainable aviation fuel and imported feedstock markets, analysts say.

The loss of tax credits for this feedstock will push UCO trade flows towards the EU, according to a Commodity Insights report on advanced biofuels in June.

Airoldi,,,,,https://www.businesstravelnews.com/Transportation/Air/Trump-Mega-Bill-to-Fund-New-Air-Traffic-Control-System,"The legislation included more than $12.5 billion to improve the country's challenged air traffic control system, with funds to remain available through Sept. 30, 2029.
The money will fund the new air traffic control system plan introduced in early May by U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.
Another $100 million was designated for air traffic controller advanced training technologies.
""Our country needs and deserves an air traffic control system that builds upon our safety record, handles 21st century air traffic volumes efficiently and provides innovation for our increasingly complex system.""
""Bold, necessary investments in air traffic control and Customs and Border Protection will make a meaningful difference in the traveler's experience.""","Congress on Thursday passed President Donald Trump's mega bill, sending it to the Oval Office for his signature. The legislation included more than $12.5 billion to improve the country's challenged air traffic control system, with funds to remain available through Sept. 30, 2029.

The money will fund the new air traffic control system plan introduced in early May by U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. About a third ($4.75 billion) of the ATC system budget was earmarked for telecommunications infrastructure modernization and systems upgrades. Another $100 million was designated for air traffic controller advanced training technologies.

The aviation and travel industry for years has called for upgrades to the system as the number of near misses at airports and equipment outages seem to have increased in recent years. The issue came to a head beginning in late April and into May after multiple equipment outages at the facility responsible for flights at Newark Liberty International Airport.

The outages led to some air traffic controllers taking leave due to the stress of the initial event on April 28, United Airlines reducing its schedule at the airport by 35 flights per day and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration temporarily reducing hourly flight movements at the airport through Oct. 25.

""Throughout this entire reconciliation process, support for modernizing our nation's airspace has remained firm because it is a smart investment that benefits all Americans,"" Airlines for America said in a Thursday statement. ""Our country needs and deserves an air traffic control system that builds upon our safety record, handles 21st century air traffic volumes efficiently and provides innovation for our increasingly complex system.""

""This legislation is a giant step in the right direction when it comes to improving America's travel infrastructure and security,"" U.S. Travel Association president and CEO Geoff Freeman said in a Thursday statement. ""Bold, necessary investments in air traffic control and Customs and Border Protection will make a meaningful difference in the traveler's experience.""

Additional Travel-Related Elements

Freeman's reference to CBP was for the $4.1 billion in the budget to hire and train at least 5,000 new U.S. CBP officers and $2 billion in CBP retention bonuses to address ongoing staffing shortages, which will help lower wait times at airports, according to U.S. Travel.

The bill also included $673 million to expand the biometric entry-exit system at ports of entry in the U.S., which will ""strengthen border security and unlock future Visa Waiver Program expansion,"" said U.S. Travel.

A tax credit on ""clean fuels"" production, which includes sustainable aviation fuel, was extended for two additional years, to Dec. 31, 2029. ""Growing domestic SAF production is expected to drive substantial job creation and economic activity in heartland communities,"" Americans for Clean Aviation Fuels executive director Jeff Grappone said in a statement. ""The entire SAF value chain—including the farming, aviation, manufacturing, oil and gas, and biofuels sectors—will continue to work together to ensure that clean aviation fuels strengthen American energy independence and security.""

The American Hotel & Lodging Association applauded the inclusion of tax provisions ""critical to the hospitality industry"" in a statement after the bill passed the U.S. Senate earlier this week. Those provisions ""prevent major tax increases on both hotel employees and businesses,"" AHLA president and CEO Rosanna Maietta said. They also ""provide small business hotel owners with the level of certainty they need to effectively operate amidst tremendous uncertainty resulting from years of inflation, trade impacts, and a softening of demand within the broader travel sector.""

Frustration Among the Praise

Not all travel-related elements of the bill will have a positive effect on travel. The bill also repealed incentives for the U.S. electric vehicle market, which could affect car rental companies with EVs in their fleets and corporations looking to include EVs in their programs.

Tax credits valid until 2032 will now expire by Sept. 30, 2025, which could end up pushing up the cost of EVs. The bill also eliminates Biden administration measures designed to give U.S. manufacturers a chance to survive Chinese auto competition, according to the New York Times, as demand for EVs and particularly hybrid cars increases.

These changes paired with the February suspension of the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program could spell upcoming challenges for the EV industry.

Meanwhile, U.S. Travel called out the fact that federal funding for Brand USA, the U.S. destination marketing organization, has not been restored. Its federal match was reduced from up to $100 million annually to $20 million as part of broader federal spending cuts.

U.S. Travel's Freeman also expressed frustration with the bill's ""steep increases"" to non-immigrant visa fees, which include a new $250 Visa Integrity Fee for visitor visas, and it raises the Electronic System for Travel Authorization fee for Visa Waiver Program travelers to $40 from $21.

""Failing to fully fund Brand USA is a missed opportunity—especially as the administration seeks to maximize a historic slate of global events on American soil,"" Freeman said. ""As Congress begins work on FY26 appropriations, it must fully fund Brand USA and ensure visitor fees are lowered, if not eliminated, wherever possible.""

Unite Here, the union that represents many hotel workers, called the budget ""a horror show that slashes services working-class Americans depend on to fund tax-cuts for bosses and the ultra-rich,"" Unite Here secretary-treasurer Nia Winston said in a Tuesday statement. ""It would transfer billions of dollars to ICE to ramp up their mass-deportation machine while taking healthcare away from 16 million people.”",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTN/uploadedImages/2015_Site_Maintenance/BTN_Link_PreviewLogo.png?n=3260&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-07-04 22:58:15.919803

“From this centre, two wings unfurl — one reaching westward across the Atlantic, the other eastward across the Indian and Pacific oceans — carrying with them the ambition of South African enterprise,” he ruminated.
The vision, Tau added, was for Africa to move from the periphery of global trade and for South Africa to transition from being primarily an exporter of goods to “a creator of value” and a connector of regions.
In addition, Tau announced that an Export-Import Bank of South Africa would be fully operational by 2028, as part of efforts to strengthen the country’s trade finance architecture.
South Africa was also pursuing a Clean Trade and Investment Partnership (CTIP) with the EU to mitigate the potential impact of CBAM, which South Africa would continue to oppose in parallel, potentially at the World Trade Organisation.","Trade, Industry and Competition Minister Parks Tau has reaffirmed South Africa’s ‘Butterfly Strategy’ for trade and exports, amid ongoing uncertainty over the future of trade relations with the US and concerns about the potential impact of the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) on exports to the bloc.

In his Budget Vote address, Tau said the butterfly strategy had its trade and export body rooted in Africa, with the “game changing” African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement as its central component.

“From this centre, two wings unfurl — one reaching westward across the Atlantic, the other eastward across the Indian and Pacific oceans — carrying with them the ambition of South African enterprise,” he ruminated.

The vision, Tau added, was for Africa to move from the periphery of global trade and for South Africa to transition from being primarily an exporter of goods to “a creator of value” and a connector of regions.

“We celebrate the rise of South African value-added exports under the AfCFTA to R820-million, but this is just the beginning.”

An automotive pact was also being finalised to integrate South Africa’s manufacturers into regional supply chains, while a Protocol on Digital Trade was also being progressed to position Africa as “our bedrock, resilient market”.

In addition, Tau announced that an Export-Import Bank of South Africa would be fully operational by 2028, as part of efforts to strengthen the country’s trade finance architecture.

In response to questions posed during the Budget Vote debate regarding fraught relations with the US, which could impose 31% tariffs on South African exports should the reciprocal-tariff pause be lifted on July 9, Tau again noted that a comprehensive offer had been made to “normalise” relations.

The offer, he said, carried “reciprocal benefits”, such as buying gas form the US to address the country’s so-called gas supply cliff in return for concessions for South African steel and automotive exports, as well as an intensification of counter-seasonal agricultural trade.

South Africa was also pursuing a Clean Trade and Investment Partnership (CTIP) with the EU to mitigate the potential impact of CBAM, which South Africa would continue to oppose in parallel, potentially at the World Trade Organisation.

Instead of “wallowing in self-pity” over CBAM, South Africa would seek to use the CTIP to mitigate its impact, with Tau highlighting an initial R90-billion commitment, which he said opened duty-free access for exports in key sectors, such as “dairy for the local production of Amarula, sustainable aviation fuel, new energy vehicles, green hydrogen, and battery components”.

Tau added that efforts were also under way to implement the country’s framework agreement with China, with a particular focus on diversifying exports to the giant Asian economy, while seeking to unlock trade and investment relations with countries in the Middle East as well as members of the BRICS Plus bloc.

“Through targeted trade missions, specialised exhibitions, and capacity building for exporters, we aim to propel our export value to R3-trillion by 2029/30, a cornerstone of our sustained 3% GDP growth target,” Tau said.",https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001210739_resized_parkstaubudgetvote07251022.jpeg,N,,2025-07-05 06:00:45.109148

Swiss company makes strides by powering an Audi with Gasoline made from the sun

Car enthusiasts have been trying to make the most of the sun’s energy for years. Gearheads have even attached panels to the back of Cybertrucks and installed big sun-trap rig-ups at home for overnight charging.

But these are all half-measures. What would make things easier is taking the sun’s energy and turning it into fuel for all cars.

Well, that’s the plan for Swiss company Synhelion, which has created gasoline made from the sun.

How? Well, it uses solar energy to turn a biogenic carbon source and water into synthetic drop-in fuels like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Synhelion has been working on gasoline made from the sun for years. And now the company has sent a 1985 Audi Sport Quattro around the Alps in a groundbreaking journey.

It previously powered a motorcycle journey, but this is the first time a car has used this source of fuel.

“We’ve shown that solar fuel can power a car in real-world conditions.

“It proves that our technology is ready for the road and that even iconic internal combustion engines can have a role in a green future,” said Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion.

Is this the future for renewable energy?

This isn’t the first time we’ve heard of alternative fuels.

Lamborghini says that this is the future, the only way manufacturers get to use iconic engines like the V8.

But others are opting for hydrogen-powered cars, which are similarly much, much greener.

For the most part, though, this new tech appears to be a very feasible method of running cars.

But like all renewable sources, Synhelion’s gasoline made from the sun will need to be affordable for everyone before saving the world.

“It’s wrong to think falling air cargo rates on key trade corridors automatically represent a boon for shippers.
Pricing tethered to market forces Air cargo data for June comes against a backdrop of mounting uncertainty.
The global dynamic load factor for air cargo in June reflected the market’s downward trend, falling 2 percentage points year-to-year to 56%.
Around 46% of their procured volumes remain in the spot market, reflecting a belief that rates may yet fall further.","Global air cargo spot rates declined for a second consecutive month in June, down -4% year-on-year as supply of capacity overtook demand for the first time in 19 months, and concerns over a more challenging second half of 2025 rose on the back of uncertainty over the prospects for international trade, according to new data from industry analysts Xeneta.

Niall van de Wouw, Xeneta’s Chief Airfreight Officer, called this market performance ‘unsurprising,’ adding that while politicians are continuing to trade economic blows in the form of tariffs, the latest monthly intelligence also signals consumers are ‘voting with their wallets’ and looking to save money on non-essential goods.

Global air cargo volumes were flat in June, up just +1% year-on-year, while available capacity measured over the same period edged up +2%.

“The air cargo market is losing altitude amidst so much uncertainty,” he said. “For consumers who were already under severe financial pressure from the rise in the everyday cost-of-living, the added cost of tariffs means they are more likely to think twice about buying many of the types of goods which are exported and imported by air.”

With tariffs, there are no winners

“When Xeneta reported April’s market data, we asked ‘how bad will it be?’ over the rest of 2025.That’s certainly top of mind now for airlines and forwarders, but also for shippers and consumers. Every economist will tell you that with tariffs there are no winners.

“It’s wrong to think falling air cargo rates on key trade corridors automatically represent a boon for shippers. With weaker consumer confidence, low rates are little comfort when underlying demand is deteriorating,” van de Wouw added.

Pricing tethered to market forces

Air cargo data for June comes against a backdrop of mounting uncertainty. The temporary suspension of new US tariffs is set to expire on 9 July for most countries – and on 13 August for China – clouding forward-looking demand. Simultaneously, a spike in crude oil and jet fuel prices, caused by conflict in the Middle East, has yet to lift freight rates because air cargo pricing remains more tightly tethered to market forces than to input costs, he said.

Compounding this trepidation is a weakening US dollar. As most airfreight contracts are denominated in local currencies, the greenback’s around -5 % depreciation (across several US dollar indices) has diminished the headline decline in dollar-based spot rates.

The global dynamic load factor for air cargo in June reflected the market’s downward trend, falling 2 percentage points year-to-year to 56%. Dynamic load factor is Xeneta’s measurement of capacity utilisation based on volume and weight of cargo flown alongside available capacity.

First half demand still grew +3%

Despite this turbulence, air cargo demand for the first half of 2025 still grew by +3% compared to the same period a year earlier, but the industry is preparing for a less rosy outlook for the remainder of the year given the effects of looming tariffs and curbs on US de minimis exemptions for cross-border e-commerce goods.

“Last month we said sentiment was driving a downturn, but now market fundamentals are starting to kick-in. In this environment, at a certain moment, something’s got to give.

“We are starting to see the longer-term effects of all this uncertainty because a lot of damage has been done. This might be the new reality for the foreseeable future as the industry is facing a much more challenging second half of the year,” Niall van de Wouw commented.

Most airfreight corridors saw a decline in June

Most airfreight corridors recorded year-on-year rate declines in June, underscoring a broad market slowdown. Routes from South-East Asia to both Europe and North America were particularly weak, posting double-digit drops in rates compared with the same period last year when prices had spiked.

In comparison, the North-East Asia to Europe corridor remained relatively steady. A surge in e-commerce volumes helped offset a shift in capacity toward the Asia–Europe market, keeping rates in balance. Backhaul routes from Europe and North America to Asia, however, continued their downward trend, reflecting persistent trade imbalances.

Only a handful of corridors defied the broader pattern. Rates from North-East Asia to North America climbed modestly, driven by jitters over the approaching end of the United States’ 90-day tariff truce. Transatlantic routes also edged higher: both westbound and eastbound spot rates posted single-digit increases year-on-year.

Faced with this uncertain landscape, shippers have adjusted their procurement strategies. The second quarter, typically the peak season for tendering, saw a notable shift. The share of mid-term contracts (three to six months) rose by eight percentage points compared to a year earlier, largely at the expense of annual or longer-term agreements. Yet, compared to the first quarter, the share of three-month contracts declined 12 percentage points, suggesting that some tenders earlier in the year proceeded out of necessity, particularly for shippers who place a premium on service reliability.

Freight forwarders continued their cautious stance in June. Around 46% of their procured volumes remain in the spot market, reflecting a belief that rates may yet fall further. Their wait-and-see approach favours flexibility over long-term commitments – for now.",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/XENETA-data-The-growth-in-global-air-cargo-volumes-came-to-a-standstill-in-June-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 06:00:51.853633

To that end, Atlassian moved its sustainability team into the legal and finance organisation, embedding sustainability into procurement, policy and investment decisions.","Don’t #@!% the planet – while many companies have mission statements at their core, Atlassian’s does not beat about the bush.

The Australian software company best known for collaboration tools such as Jira, Confluence, Trello, Loom and Rovo, has more than 300,000 customers and a global reach. Guided by Atlassian’s Don’t #@!% the Planet Guide, Jessica Hyman, the company’s Chief Sustainability Officer, has a clear mission: “We’re here to unleash the potential of every team – that includes leading on climate action.”

Jessica has overseen Atlassian’s sustainability journey for the past decade, building it from the ground up. The company’s approach is rooted in identifying the most material issues – those most closely aligned with Atlassian’s business and where it can exert real influence – that dictate its path to net zero by 2040. This process led Atlassian to focus on human rights, responsible technology and climate action.

Progress, not perfection

Atlassian’s culture of transparency – summed up in its value ‘open company, no bullshit’ core value – has shaped the company’s sustainability reporting and its willingness to admit where it has fallen short. “The journey has been one of progress over perfection, being really open and honest about our shortcomings along the way,” Jessica says.

Within a year of setting its ESG goals, Atlassian had achieved one – 100% renewable electricity goal in the first year, primarily through the purchase of renewable energy certificates. But Jessica is quick to point out that this was only the beginning. “Step one, get there, and then step two. How do you drive more impact?” she says. The company has since explored virtual power purchase agreements and voluntarily included work-from-home emissions in its reporting, reflecting the new realities of a distributed workforce.

Scope 3 emissions – those arising from suppliers and business travel – present the biggest challenge to most companies, including Atlassian. “Scope 1 and 2 are easy checkboxes, to be honest. Scope 3 is notoriously harder,” Jessica explains. For Atlassian, this means influencing 69% of its suppliers to set science-based targets and reducing business travel emissions by 25% – a tough ask as the company continues to grow.

Don’t #@!% the Planet Guide

The company’s signature initiative, the Don’t #@!% the Planet Guide, was born out of Atlassian’s role as an early adopter of science-based targets in the Australian tech sector. Jessica found herself fielding frequent requests from customers and peers: how did Atlassian set its goals and what lessons could others learn?

“One of our core values is to play as a team. How do we take that and manifest it for folks? We packaged up mostly what’s not worked and the headwinds that we face, as well as our success stories, so that others can get there faster and then share the success stories,” Jessica says.

The guide details everything from consultant recommendations to leadership buy-in strategies and progress tracking. “Not only what we did, but how we did it,” Jessica explains. “In the first month that it went out, I think it was downloaded 500 times – the demand is there”.

A second version of the guide followed, reflecting Atlassian’s commitment to transparency and continuous learning. “The thinking was how do we share what we’re learning so that others can move there faster,” Jessica says.

Employee engagement – and travel

Covid-19 brought unexpected lessons. The pandemic halted business travel, making emissions targets briefly easier to meet. But as travel resumed, Atlassian’s new distributed model – dubbed ‘Team Anywhere’ – meant the company’s more than 13,000 employees worldwide were travelling differently, often coming together from remote locations. “Travel behaviour is changing. So we need to understand – what’s the new baseline? Why are people travelling? What are the emissions hotspots?” Jessica explains.

To address these challenges, Atlassian has revised travel policies and begun exploring sustainable aviation fuel, a new tool in its emissions reduction arsenal.

“I do feel very optimistic when I think about FY25 to FY40. Do we have a plan to get after this? Yes. And today, are we behind? Yeah. And we have to kind of own that,” Jessica says.

AI, procurement, regulation and the role of the C-suite

Atlassian’s sustainability strategy is not confined to a single department. Jessica emphasises that success depends on buy-in across the business, especially from the C-suite. “Progress in this space cannot just live with a climate team or a sustainability team. You really need the entire business team to mobilise around you and take ownership,” she explains.

To that end, Atlassian moved its sustainability team into the legal and finance organisation, embedding sustainability into procurement, policy and investment decisions. “Being nested with finance has really helped the finance team set their own goals. They now have their own climate goals and are driving work without me, which helps me scale,” Jessica says.

Legal integration has also proved vital as sustainability regulation rapidly evolves. “There’s no better home for us than with the regulatory affairs and policy team that can help us understand how to prepare for some of that,” Jessica explains.

AI is another area of focus, particularly as Atlassian’s products increasingly leverage AI to help teams work smarter. The company recognises both the opportunities and risks associated with AI, including its energy demands and ethical considerations. Atlassian’s responsible tech practice is designed to ensure that AI is deployed in ways that align with the company’s values and sustainability commitments.

Atlassian has also worked closely with its procurement team to embed climate goals into supplier relationships. “We partnered with them to understand Atlassian’s detailed procurement process. How do I ask suppliers to set a net zero goal in that existing process?” Jessica says.

By leveraging supplier relationship owners, Atlassian ensures that climate conversations happen at the right level and that suppliers are supported, not intimidated, by the company’s expectations. For further support, Atlassian brought in consultants to offer free advice to top suppliers, helping them navigate the complexities of setting and achieving climate targets.

The path forward for Atlassian

For Atlassian, the sustainability journey is ongoing, marked by transparency, collaboration and a willingness to share both successes and setbacks.

“So much of our climate, human rights, foundation and social impact work is about making sure that what we're doing reflects our values,” Jessica says.

“Our founders started Atlassian with a vision of making sure that we do the right thing, that we take responsibility and that we set ourselves up to be a hundred year business.

“So all of these commitments are really authentic, and we really are putting in the hard yards when it comes to achieving them and then being open about when we've got headwinds in our way.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b175fda06f47d931abd548319069fe03:b2406a4c0797e56ef1d27134dd0a270e/gdansk-2.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 22:58:46.589007

Education

Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features.

Experience

Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written.

An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999. She stayed with Wheels, in print and later digital as well, until the publication made a cost-cutting decision to shed its freelance writers. She joined Driving.ca the very next day.

In addition to Driving.ca, she writes for industry-focused publications, including Automotive News Canada and Autosphere. Over the years, her automotive work also appeared in such publications as Cars & Parts, Street Rodder, Canadian Hot Rods, AutoTrader, Sharp, Taxi News, Maclean’s, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes Wheels, Canadian Driver, Sympatico Autos, and Reader’s Digest. Her non-automotive work, covering such topics as travel, food and drink, rural living, fountain pen collecting, and celebrity interviews, has appeared in publications including Harrowsmith, Where New Orleans, Pen World, The Book for Men, Rural Delivery, and Gambit.

The $4 trillion One Big Beautiful Bill Act is now ready to reach across the U.S. economy, slicing into every aspect of the national effort to address climate change and environmental injustice.

The 887-page legislation largely erases the landmark investment in cleaner energy, jobs and communities that a Democratic-led Congress made only three years ago in the Inflation Reduction Act.

It stomps out incentives for purchasing electric vehicles and efficient appliances. It phases out tax credits for wind and solar energy. It opens up federal land and water for oil and gas drilling and increases its profitability, while creating new federal support for coal. It ends the historic investment in poor and minority communities that bear a disproportionate pollution burden—money that the Trump administration was already refusing to spend. It wipes out any spending on greening the federal government.

We’re hiring!

Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.

President Joe Biden’s team left office expressing confidence that his climate legacy was secure because most of the $132 billion in private investment in clean energy manufacturing spurred by his programs was going to Republican districts and states.

But Republican members of Congress who spoke out in favor of clean energy—enough members to make a decisive voting bloc in both House and Senate—refused to hold up Trump’s larger agenda for the cause. The strategy of insisting on “one big” bill, coupled with political threats against would-be foes (two of whom announced in the past week they would not seek re-election), turned out to be a winning one for the president.

Amanda Levin, director of policy analysis at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the bill “a massive hit to both our clean energy economy, the US economy as a whole, and to our future from a climate perspective.”

David Shadburn, the legislative director at the League of Conservation Voters, said the environmental movement aims to make sure the public understands what was in the legislation and that those who voted for it are held accountable.

“We know that in the fight for clean air and clean water and a healthy environment that we can’t afford to stop fighting,” Shadburn said. “So we’re going to keep doing that, and we know that the public is on our side.”

Here are a few of the ways the bill will make it harder for the world’s largest historic contributor of greenhouse gases to cut its emissions and protect communities from the worst impacts of a warming world.

Slashing Incentives for Clean Energy

The bill’s cuts to clean energy tax incentives are expected to save the Treasury $499 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation’s scoring. Although it is one of the biggest offsets in the bill, it only pays for about 12 percent of the legislation’s $4 trillion in tax cuts.

But the economic impact could be profound. Trump has pledged to revive American manufacturing, but clean energy analysts expect it to have the opposite effect.

“Workers will suffer from factory closures and construction halts,” said a report this week from the think tank Energy Innovation. The analysis projected that job losses would reverberate for years, peaking at 900,000 by 2032, of which more than 230,000 would be manufacturing jobs.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

One of the cuts that will be most visible to consumers, and will happen most quickly, is the elimination of the $7,500 consumer tax credit for buying a new electric vehicle and the $4,000 tax credit for buying a used electric vehicle. The credits will be ending Sept. 30.

This sets up a summer of brisk EV sales as buyers try to beat the deadline, followed by a dropoff in sales.

While many auto dealers will lament this change, they won’t miss the aspects of this policy that were frustrating. For example, the $7,500 credit is only available on the 29 models that meet requirements under the Inflation Reduction Act related to where they were assembled and the sourcing of battery components. The eligibility gets updated each year, and right now it’s not available on many models, including top sellers such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E and all EVs sold by BMW, Kia and Volkswagen.

The company that stands to lose the most is Tesla, which has 10 of the 29 models that are eligible and remains the country’s EV sales leader even after recent sales decline and loss of market share. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who was part of the Trump administration before an attention-grabbing departure in May, had urged lawmakers to reject the bill.

Boosting Fossil Fuels

While the Biden administration had restricted oil and gas leasing in Alaska, the bill reinstates fossil fuel lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, with Alaska receiving a majority of the royalties from this new production. (This concession likely helped guarantee the vote of Alaska’s Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who was the last Republican holdout on the bill, in part over cuts to entitlement programs that would affect her vulnerable constituents.)

The bill repeals the IRA’s historic increases on oil and gas royalty rates, lowering them to 12.5 percent from 16.6 percent; brings coal royalty rates from 12.5 percent to 7 percent—changes that make drilling and mining on federal land more profitable for companies and less so for taxpayers. The bill also establishes mandatory timber sales; rescinds federal funding to protect old-growth forests and boost forest resiliency; and implements minimum leasing mandates for minerals in public lands and waters.

“This historic legislation will help usher in a new era of energy dominance by unlocking opportunities for investment, opening lease sales and expanding access to oil and natural gas development,” American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers said in a statement.

A last-minute addition to the bill would also provide millions of dollars of tax credits to U.S. companies producing metallurgical coal, often exported overseas for steelmaking. It also makes 4 million acres of known coal reserves available for leasing and authorizes mining on federal lands.

Ending Help to Communities and Businesses

Trump’s bill cuts off all the funding that the Inflation Reduction Act was pouring into communities—especially the most vulnerable ones—to help increase energy efficiency and climate resiliency and hasten their transition to cleaner energy.

An analysis by the REPEAT Project from the Princeton University ZERO Lab and Evolved Energy Research showed that the bill is expected to contribute an additional 470 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year by 2035, the annual equivalent of more than 100 million gas-powered cars on the road. Much of that impact would come from beyond the power sector.

The bill “moves to rescind unobligated funds that went to all these different types of grants to monitor pollution, … improve local air quality and reduce public health risks,” said Levin of NRDC. The affected programs represented “direct funding to nonprofits, to schools, to other local governments to support investments that the community itself wants to lead on,” she said.

A slew of initiatives—ranging from efforts to address air pollution at schools, to cutting heavy vehicle diesel emissions—were rescinded.

“Across the board, Republicans are using this bill to repeal clean air and environmental protections, rescind funding from environmental protections—all to justify and pay for tax cuts for billionaires,” said Shadburn, of the League of Conservation Voters.

The bill also rescinds the Inflation Reduction Act’s Environmental and Climate Justice Program, which provided grants for community-based initiatives in disadvantaged communities.

Already Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency had terminated funding for grants awarded under the program, for initiatives aimed at disaster preparedness, workforce development, air quality, flood control and high energy costs. The projects involved things like installing pollution notification systems and replacing lead pipes and were designed to strengthen communities against more damaging weather events while including community members in decision-making that affected their environment and health. Environmental groups had filed a class-action lawsuit to try to reinstate the canceled grants.

Now the bill rescinds all unobligated funding for the program for things like technical assistance and staff budgets aimed at supporting the successful implementation of the grants, said Zealan Hoover, former director of implementation at the EPA who oversaw the program under the Biden administration.

“This is another step by the Republican Party to try to undermine local communities’ ability to reduce pollution in their air and their water and solve problems,” he said. “The EPA has already been trying to terminate the grants, and now Congress is clawing back the money that would be used to pay the staff managing and implementing those grants and helping them be successful.”

Cutting Support for Public Lands

One of the few wins for the environment in the megabill was the stripping of an attempt to sell off millions of acres of public lands across 11 Western states. But the bill still carries an array of provisions opening up public lands to developers and the cutting of funding to agencies like the National Park Service.

“This is a full-scale assault on the air we breathe, the water we drink and the wild places we cherish,” said Stephanie Kurose, deputy director of government affairs at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. “Republicans just opened the floodgates to turning some of our nation’s most beloved landscapes into sacrifice zones for polluter profits, while ensuring that the voices of impacted communities are silenced.”

The proposed cuts will also be seen by most Americans, with $267 million in funding to the National Park Service for staffing rescinded.

“At a time when our national parks are facing record visitation and historic staffing shortages, lawmakers are making a choice to cut funding,” Daniel Hart, director of clean energy and climate policy for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement. “Their continued failure to champion national parks puts irreplaceable landscapes, historic treasures and visitor safety at risk.”

A Win for Biofuels and Big Commodities

While the bill slashes incentives and tax credits for clean energy, it accommodates the farm lobby’s push to extend tax credits for crop-based aviation fuels, which have been touted as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels but critics say is anything but.

The credit, known as the 45Z tax credit and established by the Inflation Reduction Act, gives producers and sellers of crop-based aviation fuels between 35 cents and $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel.

But the new bill gets rid of the existing requirement to calculate indirect emissions—those generated when agricultural land is expanded to grow corn or soy—when determining what qualifies for the credit. That, critics say, makes the fuel less “sustainable,” an attribute that some researchers question to begin with.

The bill’s passage comes as Congress has all but stalled out on negotiations over the Farm Bill, the massive legislation that covers food and farm policy, including food assistance for the poor and subsidies for farmers. In effect, the new measure contains a Farm Bill of sorts.

One of the big hits, critics say, will be to the poor. The bill is projected to slash food assistance for low-income people by nearly $186 billion over 10 years by tightening work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This will likely have ripple effects across farming communities.

“It’s unconscionable to cut funding for people in need to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy,” said Stephanie Feldstein, a director with the Center for Biological Diversity. “It will wind up harming rural communities, retailers and farmers themselves.”

The economic impacts will likely mean farmers who are trying to employ conservation and climate-friendly farming practices will have to cut back or stop altogether.

At the same time, the bill boosts farm subsidies for the country’s big commodity growers, especially corn and soybean farmers. The bill would increase crop price guarantees by as much as 20 percent, which would mostly benefit bigger, wealthier farms.

The American Farm Bureau Federation applauded the legislation when it passed the Senate. “Farmers and ranchers are the foundation of America’s food supply chain, and they need the certainty that this legislation will provide,” said its president, Zippy Divall, in a statement. “Improvements to farm safety net programs that reflect today’s agricultural economy and maintaining important tax provisions will directly benefit farm and ranch families.”

The Congressional Budget Office projects that the bill will increase mandatory spending on farm subsidies by more than $50 billion, the second largest source of new government spending after immigration enforcement. Most of that will flow to those who grow corn and soybeans, which largely end up in gas tanks as biofuels or as feed for confined livestock.

“It’s just pouring more money into the most destructive parts of our industrial food system,” Feldstein said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2223448276-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 17:04:44.610579

In an interview with Turkish news agency Anadolu, Uraloglu said the shift is being led by the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) directive recently issued by Türkiye’s Civil Aviation Directorate.
Under the new directive, the use, supply, and monitoring of aviation fuels will conform to international technical benchmarks, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
The SAF directive excludes humanitarian, medical, firefighting, and state-owned aircraft flights.
“We will continue our efforts to ensure that Türkiye achieves a strong and green aviation system, in line with international standards through regulations like the SAF Directive,” Uraloglu said.","Türkiye’s civil aviation sector is entering a “green era” that prioritizes environmental responsibility, domestic production, and alignment with global standards, Transport and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said Friday.

In an interview with Turkish news agency Anadolu, Uraloglu said the shift is being led by the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) directive recently issued by Türkiye’s Civil Aviation Directorate.

“Türkiye has taken a step toward a policy that is environmentally friendly and climate responsible, which is not only important for the environment but also for our industrial policies and energy supply security,” Uraloglu said.

The country’s aviation and transport strategies have been reshaped in line with its 2053 net zero emissions target, he noted.

Under the new directive, the use, supply, and monitoring of aviation fuels will conform to international technical benchmarks, including the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

The regulation aims to reduce dependence on imported fuel and foster domestic refinery investment, supporting a technology-driven production infrastructure.

Directive applies to all national and international air carriers

“This directive applies to all national and international air carriers operating international flights, airport operators, non-hazardous workplaces, and individuals licensed by Türkiye’s Energy Market Regulatory Authority, covering flights from Türkiye and operations involving aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight exceeding 5,700 kilograms (12,566 pounds),” Uraloglu said.

The SAF directive excludes humanitarian, medical, firefighting, and state-owned aircraft flights.

“The directorate will announce the required SAF use and the minimum emission reduction per liter before the end of the third quarter each year on its website,” he added. “Fuel suppliers must ensure SAF-blended fuel meets the emission reduction requirement, and air carriers will be obligated to consume the specified amount.”

He also stated that carriers departing from Türkiye will be required to load at least 90% of their fuel needs from within the country under the directive.

Uraloglu emphasized that SAF must meet ICAO's current standards and technical specifications. He added that Türkiye’s leading energy players, including refinery operator Tupras, are finalizing preparations to begin SAF commercial production by 2026.

Other major investors, such as SOCAR Türkiye, a subsidiary of Azerbaijan’s state-owned oil firm, are also taking part in the initiative.

“We will continue our efforts to ensure that Türkiye achieves a strong and green aviation system, in line with international standards through regulations like the SAF Directive,” Uraloglu said.",https://img.turkiyetoday.com/images/2025/7/4/turkiye-launches-green-era-in-civil-aviation-with-new-sustainable-fuel-directive-3203845.jpeg,N,,2025-07-04 15:08:00.523808

The global economy is moving into a new, low-carbon industrial era with or without any help from the former British colonies. The latest example comes from Switzerland, where the startup Synhelion has just showcased its new “solar gasoline” on a tour of the mountains, in the gas tank of a classic 1985 Audi Sport quattro.

What Is This Solar Gasoline Of Which You Speak?

If “solar gasoline” brings the e-fuels industry to mind, that’s close but no cigar. The emerging category of e-fuels, or electrofuels, generally refers to liquid fuels synthesized with green hydrogen, which is produced from water in electrolysis systems that run on electricity from renewable resources. Synhelion also uses renewable energy as the foundation of its system. However, the company deploys renewable energy — specifically, solar energy — in the form of heat.

The company’s integrated process focuses on deploying solar energy to produce syngas (synthetic gas composed of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) from biogas and water, through a thermochemical reaction. The reaction requires high heat, which is where the solar angle comes in. In effect, the syngas stores solar energy for later use, as a standard input for synthetic liquid fuels, including kerosene jet fuel as well as gasoline and diesel. “Such Sun-to-Liquid fuel closes the CO2 cycle, as it releases only as much CO2 during its combustion as was previously used for its production,” Synhelion states.

From Solar Gasoline To Solar Jet Fuel

As with e-fuels produced by water electrolysis, the result of Synhelion’s process is a drop-in replacement for fossil-based liquid fuels. That angle is particularly important in the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) movement. Conventional bio-based jet fuels have struggled mightily to qualify for use in aircraft. Currently they can be blended with traditional jet fuel, but they have yet to break through on a drop-in basis.

Aviation stakeholders have indicated that there is an economic case to be made for SAFs produced through the e-fuels pipeline. Synhelion provides SAF stakeholders with another option. The company surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar earlier this year with an SAF version of its solar fuel, produced at a facility in Spain.

A High Profile Solar Gasoline Showcase

The argument for replacing gasoline in an automobile with Synhelion’s solar gasoline is another kettle of fish, which explains the Audi Sport quattro showcase last month.

Synhelion used the occasion of the Supercar Owners Circle Classic Andermatt event in Switzerland last month to put its solar gasoline through its paces. The aim was to demonstrate that the company’s solar gasoline can replace its fossil-sourced counterpart without any modifications to an automobile — and without damage to the engine or any other part of a uniquely precious auto, of course.

“The 1985 Audi Sport quattro, part of the AMAG Classic car collection, became the first vehicle in history to run on solar gasoline produced at Synhelion’s industrial-scale plant DAWN in Jülich, Germany,” Synhelion pronounced in a press release on July 3.

“For the first time, we’ve shown that solar fuel can power a car in real-world conditions. It proves that our technology is ready for the road and that even iconic internal combustion engines can have a role in a green future,” added Synhelion Co-CEO and Co-Founder Philipp Furler.

What Is The Supercar Owners Circle?

For the record, the Supercar Owners Circle (SOC) is an exclusive network of auto collectors, recently acquired by the duPont Registry Group. Here’s what they had to say in the runup to last month’s Andermatt event:

“While SOC Classic, as the name implies, centers around vintage and classic metal like the Mercedes 300 SL Gullwing, Porsche 356, air-cooled 911s (including restomods), Alfa Romeos, Lancias, and old-school Ferraris, the mix of cars that showed up this year spanned several eras…Think Lamborghini Countach, Ferrari 512, F40, F50, Superamerica, and more.”

During the event, the solar-gassed Audi was driven by AMAG Group CEO Helmut Ruhl, who provided his feedback to the media. “What struck me most was how normal it felt — no difference compared to fossil gasoline, except for the significantly lower carbon emissions,” Ruhl stated.

“The car’s historic drive marks the debut of solar gasoline as a viable, drop-in fuel for existing internal combustion engines. No modifications were made to the Audi’s original 306 hp engine, demonstrating the compatibility of Synhelion’s renewable synthetic fuel with today’s vehicles and infrastructure,” Synhelion emphasized.

AMAG Loves Synthetic Fuels

SOC aside, AMAG is also a high profile showcase for synthetic fuels. The company, which bills itself as the biggest automotive firm in Switzerland, owns a mouthwatering collection of historic gasmobiles. AMAG also sells and services exceptional cars through its Classic division, and it is a Synhelion investor and customer, too.

Although AMAG states that it has no hearsay knowledge of any incompatibility between synthetic fuels and classic car engines, the company also notes that anecdotal evidence regarding compatibility is scanty. In order to reassure itself, and its classic car customers, the company recently engaged in a research effort to gather more data. “It was clear to us that the majority of owners of valuable classic cars would not embark on adventures with unexplored fuels,” explains the head of AMAG’s Classic division, Dino Graf.

The study was conducted by Empa (the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology), with support from the Swiss oil company Motorex. The study included extended engine component testing long with road tests and performance measurements on selected cars. “The result: Even classic cars can be operated in a climate-friendly manner in the future, as synthetic gasoline can be used safely in older engines,” AMAG reported.

Next Steps For Solar Gasoline

Synhelion began producing began producing fuels in quantity at the DAWN facility last year, and it has been busy since then. In addition to the classic car showcase and the SAF project in Spain, the company has fueled a motorcycle with its solar gasoline, and it has been pitching solar diesel as a drop-in replacement for steamboat engines.

The DAWN facility is located in Jülich, Germany. The output is only a few thousand liters per year, but that’s enough for the company to scout the globe for more opportunities to showcase its solar fuels.

It announced a sweeping $33 billion reais ($6 billion) investment plan centered in Rio de Janeiro. Through integrated refining, petrochemical and renewable fuel initiatives, the company aims to boost domestic fuel supply, support energy transition goals and stimulate industrial synergy across the value chain.

Boaventura and Reduc: The Heart of Integration

The core of the initiative lies in connecting the Boaventura Energy Complex in Itaboraí with the Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc). Together, these projects represent a R$26 billion investment, which is already included under Petrobras’ 2025-2029 Business Plan, wherein the service packages are currently in the bidding phase. Once operational, this infrastructure will enhance S-10 diesel output by 76,000 barrels per day (bpd), 56,000 bpd from quality improvements and 20,000 bpd from additional capacity. The project will also increase jet fuel production by 20,000 bpd and expand Group II lubricants output by 12,000 bpd.

Boaventura will also host a state-of-the-art biojet fuel facility producing 19,000 bpd of sustainable fuels, Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (“HVO”) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), alongside two 400 MW gas-fired thermoelectric plants. The power plants are designed to integrate with the nearby Itaboraí gas processing unit, participating in future capacity reserve auctions.

Circular Economy and Decarbonization at Reduc

At Reduc, Petrobras is exploring a lubricant oil re-refining unit with a monthly capacity of 30,000 m3 (6,300 bpd). This would enable the reuse of waste oil into high-value products, in line with circular economy practices. The facility has already gained regulatory approval for a co-processing test.

Reduc is also pushing renewable fuel production. A pilot to blend 1.2% corn oil into jet fuel has been successfully completed, paving the way for 10,000 bpd commercial-scale production. Diesel R5 with 5% renewable content is already in production and a Diesel R7 with 7% blend is under testing, reinforcing Petrobras’ ambition for low-carbon fuels.

In parallel, Petrobras plans to modernize its on-site power infrastructure with a new thermal plant to replace outdated steam and power generation equipment with investments of up to R$860 million. The company also plans to spend up to R$2.4 billion on maintenance shutdowns between 2025 and 2029 to ensure operational safety and efficiency.

Expanding Petrochemicals and Strategic Partnerships

Petrobras is also eyeing new petrochemical capabilities. Studies are underway for the local production of acetic acid and monoethylene glycol at Boaventura, materials that Brazil currently imports.

The system has been running for three months in a live operational environment, supported by European Innovation Council funding. The team behind the technology aims to scale it for commercial deployment.

The system captures carbon dioxide directly from ambient air and releases it using low-grade industrial waste heat, resulting in a purified CO2 stream. While the precise materials are not disclosed, the team said that it focused on optimising energy use and operational conditions to improve capture efficiency and enable industrial deployment.

“By advancing and integrating this technology across industries, we are not only reducing emissions but also creating economic opportunities through supplying high-purity CO2 that align with global sustainability goals,” said Professor Wolfgang Schmitt, who helped develop the system.

The system, which captures CO2 from the air while utilising low-grade waste heat from on-site industries, is intended to help meet the European Commission’s ReFuelEU Aviation legislation, which states that SAF must comprise 2% of fuel at EU airports by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2050. It also requires that e-fuels, produced from renewable electricity and sustainable CO2, make up 50% of the SAF.

“This project offers DAA [Dublin Airport Authority] an opportunity to explore carbon capture as a potential means of decarbonising our operations and industry,” said Andrea Carroll, Director of Sustainability at DAA.

These wastes contain triglycerides that can convert into biocrude through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), making them promising feedstocks for greener fuels.

Challenges in Meeting SAF Fuel Standards

However, SAF precursors must satisfy stringent criteria based on conventional fuels like Jet A. In particular, they require complete oxygen removal to prevent jet engine corrosion and must achieve a higher heating value (HHV) close to Jet A. Unfortunately, no biocrude derived from HTL has met all these standards to date.

Innovative Use of Mo2C Nanocatalysts for Biocrude Upgrading

To address this challenge, researchers from the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI) investigated the use of zeolite-supported molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanocatalysts. According to Science X Daily, these nanocatalysts effectively upgrade wet waste-derived biocrudes into SAF precursors that meet all essential criteria for the first time.

Methodology: Generating and Testing Mo2C Nanocatalysts

The team generated Mo2C nanocatalysts in the gas phase and dispersed them onto zeolite supports. They then tested the catalysts’ ability to remove oxygen from biocrudes and used them to upgrade wet waste-derived biocrude via HTL. The upgraded biocrudes underwent thorough characterization against Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) specifications.

Promising Results in Fuel Quality and Catalyst Reusability

The results demonstrated complete oxygen removal from the biocrude and a high heating value of 46.5 MJ/kg, closely matching Jet A fuel. Additionally, prescreening tests revealed that the average carbon number of the distilled SAF fraction was 10.6, near the 11.4 typical of conventional jet fuel. The upgraded biocrude also met all key SAF prescreening standards, including surface tension, density, viscosity, flash point, and freezing point. Notably, the Mo2C nanocatalysts retained their deoxygenation activity over multiple reuse cycles.

Conclusion: Pioneering Sustainable Jet Fuel Production from Wet Waste

This study, published in Science Advances, demonstrates for the first time that zeolite-supported Mo2C nanocatalysts can catalytically upgrade wet waste-derived biocrudes into SAF precursors that satisfy all critical fuel specifications.

The aviation sector is witnessing a transformative shift. As sustainability becomes an indispensable pillar of long-term viability, innovative approaches are needed not just in aircraft design or operations, but in the very fuel that powers flight. In a significant stride, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has introduced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform—a digital tool aimed at accelerating the uptake of SAF through smarter, simpler connections between suppliers and buyers.

This platform could prove to be more than just a technical facilitation tool. It may well evolve into a central mechanism for systemic change, particularly by reducing friction in the SAF supply chain and aligning market incentives toward emissions reduction goals.

Why a Matchmaker Platform Matters

Despite broad consensus on the critical role SAF will play in decarbonising aviation, access and procurement remain major bottlenecks. The SAF Matchmaker addresses this issue with a pragmatic digital solution that reflects a deeper truth—market alignment is as important as technological advancement.

Three key pillars underpin the platform’s design:

1. Centralised Efficiency

One of the most overlooked hurdles in SAF adoption is the fragmentation of its market. There is often no clear line of sight between producers who have SAF to sell and airlines looking to make sustainable purchases. By serving as a centralised hub where both parties can list and review opportunities, the platform eliminates time-consuming steps and reduces reliance on intermediaries. The absence of added fees further enhances its accessibility, inviting more participation and cultivating a broader ecosystem for voluntary SAF transactions.

2. Transparent Connectivity

Unlike conventional marketplaces driven solely by price competition, this platform foregrounds visibility. Airlines can indicate their interest based on current or future SAF volumes, while suppliers showcase their available and planned production. This matchmaking functionality simplifies the initial discovery process but leaves commercial negotiations to take place offline, ensuring confidentiality and flexibility.

Importantly, this fosters a network of direct engagements built on trust and relevance, rather than guesswork or limited supplier lists.

3. Enhanced Market Visibility

One of the more progressive features of the platform is the depth of information available about each SAF offer. Data includes feedstock sources, production location and technology, emissions reduction potential, and regulatory compliance with frameworks like CORSIA and the EU Renewable Energy Directive. This allows buyers to make informed decisions not just on price or volume, but on broader sustainability credentials, helping to align corporate ESG goals with procurement decisions.

A Pushback Against Inefficiencies

IATA Director General Willie Walsh has not shied away from critiquing existing market distortions. His comments highlight the tension between regulatory mandates and actual production incentives. Specifically, the EU’s 2 percent blending mandate has increased costs for airlines without proportionally boosting SAF output. Walsh has gone so far as to label the status quo a “great green scam,” referring to excessive compliance fees levied by some suppliers.

This backdrop underscores why initiatives like the SAF Matchmaker are more than digital utilities—they are instruments of market reform. By promoting transparency and reducing artificial barriers to entry, such tools help to rebalance power dynamics and foster fairer pricing environments.

Designed for Evolution

Initially limited to airlines and SAF producers, the Matchmaker platform is designed to evolve. Future access will expand to include non-aviation corporate buyers, potentially unlocking wider demand from sectors keen to support aviation decarbonisation through indirect SAF purchases or credit-based systems.

In doing so, the platform could also pave the way for multi-sector collaboration, introducing models where logistics firms, technology providers, and even public sector actors co-invest in SAF infrastructure or purchase agreements. Such synergies can amplify the sustainability benefits far beyond aviation alone.

The platform is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a dedicated digital space aimed at improving energy management in aviation. This makes the SAF Matchmaker part of a broader suite of tools, each one addressing a different facet of aviation’s complex energy transformation.

What This Means for the Industry

The launch of this platform signals a maturing SAF ecosystem—one where transparency, access, and innovation begin to converge. It reflects a growing consensus that sustainability must be embedded not just in ambition but in infrastructure and operations.

More subtly, it also highlights a shift in mindset: sustainability professionals are moving away from reliance on policy nudges or unilateral commitments. Instead, they are building architecture that lowers the friction of doing the right thing—platforms, frameworks, and toolkits that turn aspiration into action.

Such digital infrastructure is indispensable to closing the gap between climate targets and tangible outcomes.

Conclusion: Building Bridges, Not Walls

The SAF Matchmaker is more than a tool—it is a statement. A declaration that collaboration, not competition, will be the hallmark of aviation’s sustainable future. It also reflects a broader truth in the journey to net zero: systemic change requires systemic thinking.

By designing platforms that address not only supply or demand but also the mechanics of interaction between them, the industry is proving that progress can be purposeful and strategic. As aviation redefines its energy narrative, such initiatives will form the backbone of both accountability and acceleration.

The pilot project is designed to be scalable and aims to meet the rising demand for SAF in the region.

Oiltek, a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore-listed Oiltek International, is supporting the SAF roadmap and has a track record of building renewable energy facilities across Asia, including a 600 MTD integrated biodiesel plant in Bintulu. The firm also developed a POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent) oil treatment facility that supplies high-quality feedstock to global HVO producers.

SEDCE is also working with Apeiron Bioenergy, Asia’s largest used cooking oil (UCO) collector, to establish a sustainable UCO logistics and collection ecosystem in Sarawak. This partnership aims to secure a stable feedstock supply for the SAF plant while promoting circular economy goals.

SEDC Energy CEO Robert Hardin noted that SAF production requires hydrogen to convert feedstock into jet fuel, aligning the project with Sarawak’s broader ambitions in developing its hydrogen value chain.

The project comes amid mounting global pressure for aviation decarbonisation, as the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s CORSIA scheme enters its mandatory phase in 2027.

The first of these to enter into operation is the Hydrogen Mechanism, which is now open for stakeholder registration and subscription. The first round of matching demand and supply is reportedly planned for September 2025.

Dan Jørgensen, Commissioner for Energy and Housing, stated: “With the Hydrogen Mechanism launched today, we empower the European industry to seize competitive opportunities while advancing towards greater security of supply and decarbonisation. This is only the beginning of our work under the EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform, which shows that Europe is not just adapting to the future, it is actively shaping it.”

To note, hydrogen is expected to play a “key role” in decarbonizing hard-to-abate industries and is considered “essential” to the EU’s goals of climate neutrality by 2050 and its independence from Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2027.

This Hydrogen Mechanism is intended to match and aggregate demand and supply, help identify infrastructure development needs, and facilitate access to information on financial solutions.

In other news, in 2025, the EU unveiled the Clean Industrial Deal, a business plan outlining concrete actions to turn decarbonization into “a driver of growth” for European industries by supporting renewable energy sources, and the European Commission announced it will allocate over €250 million in grants from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) to 21 hydrogen infrastructure development studies.

It is also worth mentioning that the Commission reached a Common Understanding with the UK that outlines a renewed agenda for cooperation, with a focus on new energy technologies such as hydrogen. Furthermore, it signed agreements with the European Investment Bank (EIB), KfW Development Bank (KfW), Corporación de Fomento de la Producción (CORFO), and the Chilean Ministry of Energy to support Chile’s renewable hydrogen industry.

“We are excited by the prospect of fully welcoming SAS into the Air France-KLM family”, said Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM.","Air France-KLM today announced that it will initiate proceedings to take a majority stake in SAS. The Group currently holds a 19.9% stake in the Scandinavian carrier and since the summer of 2024, it has implemented a commercial cooperation between SAS, Air France and KLM in the form of extended codeshare and interline agreements, further strengthened by SAS joining the SkyTeam alliance.

Provided all the necessary conditions are met, Air France-KLM would fully acquire the stakes held by Castlelake and Lind Invest, bringing its own stake to 60.5%. The Danish State would retain its 26.4% stake in SAS and its seats on the Board of Directors.

The value of Air France-KLM’s contemplated investment in SAS would be determined at closing, based on SAS’s latest financial performance – including EBITDA and Net Debt. This transaction would be in line with the Group’s medium-term financial outlook.

Subject to the obtaining of all the necessary regulatory clearances and satisfaction of all conditions precedents, the ambition is to close in the second half of 2026.

The acquisition of this majority stake would give Air France-KLM control of SAS, which would become a subsidiary of the Air France-KLM Group. This new step would allow Air France-KLM and SAS to fully unlock their synergy potential via a comprehensive integration in all areas of business, including loyalty, and would extend beyond commercial activities. The Group would hold the majority of seats on the airline’s Board of Directors.

Air France-KLM’s interest in pursuing this transaction is driven by the significant improvement of SAS’s financial and operational performance, the success of the current commercial cooperation, as well as the Group’s confidence in the Scandinavian carrier’s long-term potential.

“We are excited by the prospect of fully welcoming SAS into the Air France-KLM family”, said Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM. “Following their successful restructuring, SAS has delivered impressive performance, and we are confident that the airline’s potential will continue to grow through deeper integration within the Air France-KLM Group.

However, the heavy carbon footprints of long-haul flights are also making air travel increasingly environmentally unsustainable and a serious concern. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents a breakthrough in sustainable aviation. Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from petroleum, SAF is produced from a diverse range of renewable feedstocks. As a strong advocate for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Indian industrialist and energy visionary Vasanth JB views Southeast Asia as a regional force that can lead the global charge toward cleaner skies.

What is SAF?

Unlike regular jet fuel, SAF is sustainable as an aviation fuel. It is produced from renewable feedstocks, like waste oils, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and even captured carbon dioxide.

The fundamental distinction lies not in its combustion properties as SAF performs identically to conventional jet fuel in aircraft engines. Sustainability comes from SAF’s lifecycle carbon profile. SAF feedstocks are specifically selected to avoid competition with food production, prevent deforestation, and minimize water consumption, and thus encompasses a comprehensive approach to sustainability. SAF production contributes to broader environmental goals rather than merely shifting environmental burdens from one sector to another.

In a world increasingly conscious of climate imperatives, few voices resonate with both clarity and conviction like that of Indian industrialist and energy visionary Vasanth JB. As a strong advocate for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Vasanth sees Southeast Asia not just as a passive consumer in the aviation transition, but as a regional force that could lead the global charge toward cleaner skies.

“The ASEAN bloc is poised for a fuel transformation. With the right policy coordination and industry participation, Southeast Asia could become the world’s most cost-effective, feedstock-rich SAF region.” - Vasanth JB during a closed-door session with energy executives in Kuala Lumpur.

The SAF Momentum in ASEAN: A Perfect Takeoff Runway

ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries are aligning their strategies with ICAO’s (International Civil Aviation Organization) CORSIA framework. It encompasses net-zero targets and lays the policy and infrastructure groundwork for widespread adoption of SAF.

Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam have made concrete contributions, starting from formulating SAF blending mandates, repurposing refineries, to securing long-term procurement agreements with international carriers.

According to Vasanth, the synergy among policy, industry, and airport infrastructure is creating “a golden corridor for green aviation” in Southeast Asia.

Airports Fuel the Future

One of the clearest indicators of progress is the commitment from major ASEAN airports to integrate SAF infrastructure into their fueling systems. These airports are:

●Changi International Airport (Singapore)

●KLIA (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)

●Soekarno-Hatta International Airport (Jakarta, Indonesia)

●Suvarnabhumi Airport (Bangkok, Thailand)

They are in various stages of feasibility studies and infrastructure upgrades for SAF blending, storage, and distribution pipelines. These upgrades will be rolled out in phases between 2026 and 2030, reflecting an accelerated transition to operational readiness.

Feedstock Richness: The ASEAN Advantage

A defining strength for ASEAN is its abundance of feedstock sources suitable for HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)-based SAF:

●Malaysia and Indonesia lead in palm oil waste and used cooking oil.

●Thailand and Vietnam offer large volumes of agricultural residues.

●Singapore is becoming the logistics and refining nexus

In fact, “feedstock availability and logistics integration give ASEAN an edge over other regions,” said Vasanth as part of his discussions with several SAF startups and biofuel traders across the region.

Harmonizing Regional Targets: The Next Milestone

The emerging policy harmonization across ASEAN countries is extremely promising for many players in the region’s biofuel sector. While blending mandates are currently under national jurisdiction, informal dialogues suggest a regional SAF target announcement. This will be potentially modeled on the EU’s ReFuelEU initiative.

A multi-nation regional target would reduce fragmentation, pool investment across borders, and give global investors a coherent, scalable framework for entering the ASEAN SAF market.",https://www.sangritoday.com/uploads/images/202507/image_870x580_68678ce7b19c1.webp,N,,2025-07-04 07:05:40.415553

Energy Complex (Itaboraí – RJ) and Reduc (Duque de Caxias – RJ) involves an estimated investment of R$26 billion. This amount is included in the 2025 - 2029 Business Plan (PN 2025 - 2029), and service packages for the projects are currently in the bidding phase.

This new structure will increase S-10 diesel production by 76 000 bpd, 56 000 of which will come from quality improvements and 20 000 from additional capacity. The project also provides for a 20 000 bpd increase in jet fuel production capacity and a 12 000 bpd increase in Group II lubricating oil production.

The project also includes a dedicated bio jet fuel plant at the Boaventura Complex, with a production capacity of 19 000 bpd of renewable fuels, including hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); and two gas-fired power plants at the complex, which will participate in capacity reserve auctions. The engineering project for the power plants has been approved, and the units will leverage synergies with the infrastructure of the Itaboraí Natural Gas Processing Unit (UPGN).

A lubricant oil re-refining project with a capacity of 30 000 m³/month (6300 bpd) is also under evaluation at Reduc. With the operation of the Boaventura Complex for Group II lubricant oil production, Reduc may repurpose existing units to re-refine used oil, applying the circular economy concept to generate high-value products from waste. The co-processing test has already been authorised by ANP and is expected to take place in 2025.

Decarbonisation at Reduc

Reduc has completed a test for producing the first jet fuel with renewable content (SAF) through co-processing, reaching up to 1.2% corn oil in jet fuel production. ANP authorisation has already been granted, and commercial production at Reduc is scheduled to begin in 2025, with a capacity of up to 50 000 m³/month (10 000 bpd).

Reduc already produces Diesel R5, with 5% renewable content, and has received ANP authorisation to begin testing a new 7% blend for Diesel R7 production. These initiatives reinforce Petrobras’ commitment to the decarbonisation of its products and the energy transition.

Petrobras plans to build a new thermal power plant at Reduc to replace obsolete steam and power generation equipment, with expected investments of R$860 million, enhancing reliability and bringing the refinery up to the highest international efficiency standards.

Investments of up to R$2.4 billion in maintenance shutdowns at Reduc are also planned from 2025 to 2029, to ensure the integrity, reliability, and safety of the facilities. Major shutdowns are scheduled for 2026 in the delayed coking and hydrotreatment units of the refinery.

Petrochemicals

In the petrochemical segment, a study for the production of acetic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG) is under evaluation at the Boaventura Complex. Acetic acid is an important raw material for the production of paint, PET, and the broader chemical industry. Brazil currently imports its entire acetic acid demand and complements MEG demand with imports.

In addition to Petrobras’ projects in the region, Braskem, a Petrobras affiliate, is planning to expand its polyethylene plant, increasing the unit’s production capacity by up to 230 000 tpy. The project, which uses part of the natural gas processed at Route 3 of the Boaventura Complex, is budgeted at around R$4 billion and remains subject to the necessary approvals by Braskem’s governance bodies.",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/brazil-02.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 12:15:15.081743

This time, SAF will be used on commercial flights departing from Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi Airport) to international destinations including Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Luang Prabang, and the Maldives.”

Bangkok Airways will begin using SAF blended at 1% with 99% Jet A-1 fuel, which can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an average of approximately 128 kilograms of CO₂ per flight.

As a leading regional airline, Bangkok Airways is committed to enhancing the quality of its services while upholding its core mission to create sustainable value for all stakeholders. The airline takes pride in delivering memorable and environmentally conscious travel experiences to its passengers, while actively contributing to the genuine and sustainable growth of Thailand’s aviation industry.

Bangkok Airways is committed to evolving into a truly “Sustainable Airline,” guided by the ESG framework, which is integrated across all aspects of its operations. The airline upholds responsibility in three aspects: Environmental, Social, and Governance. In terms of environmental responsibility, Bangkok Airways focuses on climate change management, waste management, efficient use of resources, and the adoption of alternative energy sources.

The company continues to explore comprehensive measures to improve fuel efficiency, conduct corporate carbon footprint reporting (Scopes 1–3), expand waste separation bins, and promote the upcycling of operational waste into products that benefit both society and the environment. The airline also encourages stakeholders to participate in environmentally friendly services and initiatives, such as the “Love Earth, Save Earth” project, now in its 8th year, which involves planting coconut trees to support the ecosystem of Koh Samui.

When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms, including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Introduction: From Pledge to Progress

Aviation is the lifeblood of global trade, tourism, and human connection. It links continents, underpins economic development, and powers globalization. Yet, it is also responsible for approximately 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions—an impact amplified by high-altitude contrails and nitrogen oxides that increase its total warming effect to nearly 3.5% of global warming. Unlike other sectors, aviation’s energy needs cannot be easily electrified or substituted. Long-haul aircraft require high energy density fuels that batteries and hydrogen cannot yet deliver efficiently or affordably.

That’s why Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is critical. SAF is the only near-term, scalable solution to cut aviation emissions. It’s a “drop-in” fuel that can be used in existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. When derived from waste-based feedstocks like used cooking oil (UCO), animal fats, and agricultural residues, SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel.

Yet despite this promise, SAF today accounts for less than 0.2% of global jet fuel consumption.

If we are to move the needle, the world must create conditions that accelerate SAF production, distribution, and consumption. That’s where ambitious SAF mandates come in—compulsory blend requirements set by governments to create market demand and trigger investment across the value chain.

This article explores:

The benefits of strong SAF mandates,

How SAF mandates are funded globally,

A detailed comparison between Singapore, the European Union (EU), and the United States (US),

And how Malaysia can craft its own strategic pathway toward SAF leadership in Southeast Asia.

Why SAF Mandates Matter: The Case for Regulatory Muscle

Markets do not scale sustainably without clear signals. In the context of SAF, voluntary uptake alone has not delivered the volume or consistency needed to meet the aviation sector’s climate goals. Without a mandate, airlines often defer SAF use due to cost premiums (2x–5x higher than fossil jet fuel), lack of infrastructure, or regulatory uncertainty.

Mandates change this by:

Creating predictable demand: Investors and refiners gain confidence that there will be buyers for their product.

Leveling the playing field: All airlines operating in a jurisdiction must comply, avoiding a first-mover penalty.

Driving innovation: Higher blend targets encourage new pathways, including power-to-liquid and advanced biofuels.

Building infrastructure: Airports and fuel suppliers are incentivized to upgrade logistics and blending capacity.

Generating transparency and accountability: With regulatory oversight comes traceability, monitoring, and reporting.

Mandates are not just a policy instrument—they are a market builder and a climate accelerator.

Singapore: Precision in Policy and Purpose

In 2024, Singapore became one of the first Southeast Asian nations to announce a SAF mandate. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) committed to a 1% SAF blending mandate at Changi Airport by 2026, with gradual increases envisioned toward 2030 and beyond.

At first glance, 1% may appear modest. But Singapore’s SAF strategy is anchored in pragmatism, infrastructure readiness, and coordinated funding.

Key Elements:

Voluntary ramp-up preceding the mandate: Pilot projects have already introduced SAF at Changi via airlines like Singapore Airlines and Scoot.

Price support via the CAAS Environmental Fund: The government will subsidize the price gap between SAF and fossil jet fuel for airlines.

Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Singapore actively collaborates with global SAF producers, logistics providers, and certification agencies.

Sustainability Certification: Feedstock must meet ISCC standards and align with ICAO’s CORSIA framework.

Funding Mechanism:

Government subsidies (direct support to airlines buying SAF),

Tax incentives for infrastructure investments (e.g., tanks, blending systems),

Private equity and VC mobilization via regulatory certainty.

Singapore’s approach is methodical and data-driven, aligning its SAF rollout with its Green Plan 2030, which includes carbon tax escalation and green finance reforms.

European Union: Regulation Meets Climate Ambition

No region has embraced SAF mandates with more vigor than the EU. In 2023, the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation was passed under the European Green Deal. It sets binding, escalating SAF blending targets for all EU airports and departing flights.

SAF Mandate Timeline:

2% by 2025

6% by 2030

20% by 2035

70% by 2050

1.2% synthetic fuels (e-fuels) by 2030

These are not suggestions—they are enforceable obligations with clear compliance mechanisms.

Policy Architecture:

Eligible Feedstocks: Only waste and residue-based inputs (e.g., UCO, animal fats, lignocellulosic biomass).

Certification: Mandatory ISCC-EU certification and alignment with RED II/III requirements.

Reporting: Airlines must submit verified SAF usage data annually.

Penalties:

Financial fines for non-compliance,

Market exclusion for non-conforming SAF producers.

Funding Support:

EU Innovation Fund: €10 billion available through 2030 for climate technologies including SAF production.

National subsidies: France, Germany, and the Netherlands offer SAF-specific grants.

EU ETS incentives: Airlines using SAF receive fewer emissions obligations.

Contracts for Difference (CfD): In development to guarantee SAF offtake pricing.

What Makes the EU Model Work:

Regulatory backbone (mandates),

Financial stimulus (public grants),

Industrial policy alignment (Green Deal),

Clear signal to producers and investors.

United States: Incentives Over Mandates

The U.S. does not have a national SAF mandate. However, it leads the world in financial incentives, using carrots instead of sticks to drive SAF adoption.

Key Instruments:

Blender’s Tax Credit (BTC): Offers up to $1.75/gallon SAF used, depending on carbon intensity.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA): Earmarks billions for biofuel and SAF infrastructure, valid through 2027.

California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS): SAF earns carbon credits, traded on open markets.

Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2): SAF producers earn Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs).

State-Level Support:

Illinois and Washington provide state tax credits,

Oregon offers low-carbon grants for airport blending infrastructure.

Additional Incentives:

Private sector momentum: United, Delta, JetBlue have signed multi-year SAF offtake agreements with startups.

USDA grants: Target feedstock innovation (algae, cover crops, municipal solid waste).

The U.S. model shows that subsidy-heavy frameworks, even without mandates, can catalyze early-stage market formation—especially in a risk-averse investment climate.

Malaysia’s SAF Opportunity: A Hybrid Model for a New Hub

Malaysia can—and should—draw upon global best practices to design a SAF mandate and funding model uniquely suited to its strengths:

Feedstock Abundance: Malaysia has a dense network of UCO, animal fats, and agricultural waste streams. FatHopes Energy’s decentralized collection system is already operational across the country.

Port & Trade Advantage: Located on the Straits of Malacca, Malaysia is strategically positioned to become a SAF export hub.

Refining Ambitions: FatHopes Energy is spearheading the development of Malaysia’s first commercial SAF refinery. This will be a beacon project for domestic consumption and international offtake.

Digital Traceability: Malaysia’s traceability infrastructure already meets ISCC and CORSIA requirements, allowing for fast-track certification.

Government Engagement: The National Energy Transition Roadmap and MyHIJAU initiatives offer a framework for embedding SAF into broader green growth plans.

What Malaysia Should Do:

Set a 1–2% blending mandate for KLIA and Subang by 2026, grow to 10% by 2030.

Create a SAF Producer Credit (like BTC) to lower entry barriers for refiners.

Launch a SAF Fund to subsidize airline purchases, modeled after CAAS.

Expand green tax incentives to cover SAF logistics, R&D, and export.

Embed SAF in ESG disclosure requirements for Malaysian public companies and GLCs.

Conclusion: From Policy to Progress

The SAF revolution is inevitable. The question is not if, but who will lead.

Mandates offer the clearest, fastest route to SAF scale-up. But they must be ambitious, enforced, and financially supported. Whether it’s Singapore’s precision, Europe’s regulation, or America’s incentives—the models show that different pathways can all drive impact, if underpinned by conviction.

Malaysia stands at the convergence point of feedstock potential, industrial capability, and geographic advantage. If we act now, we can go from being a feedstock exporter to a fuel exporter, from a green policy follower to a climate policy leader.

The version introduced on June 28, 2025, in the Senate would have required solar and wind projects to begin construction before the date of enactment, or they would be subject to a placed-in-service date of Dec. 31, 2027. Wind and solar projects beginning construction after June 16, 2025, would have been subject to the material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity requirements, as described below, and wind and solar projects that did not qualify for a credit or meet such requirements would have been subject to an excise tax.

Thanks to a last-minute deal from Sen. Murkowski of Alaska, the July 1, 2025, version of the bill passed by the Senate contained the same placed-in-service deadline for solar and wind projects, but only to the extent that they do not begin construction for tax purposes prior to 12 months after the date of enactment. This key provision allows solar and wind developers to safe harbor projects in 2025 and 2026 that will be placed in service in 2028, 2029 and 2030.

Additionally, the final bill adds no new limits on transferability, other than that credits cannot be transferred to prohibited foreign entities.

While the final version of the bill suggests that projects with planned placed-in-service dates in 2028, 2029 and 2030 can be safe harbored until 12 months after the President’s signature, clients should still consider beginning construction for projects with placed-in-service dates of 2028 or 2029 as soon as possible, since forthcoming IRS guidance that could affect the beginning of construction regime or related continuity safe harbor is possible.

McGuireWoods’ client alerts on the original version of the bill and the version passed by the House are available here and here.

A table summarizing the treatment of various credits under the final bill is below.

Beginning Construction

Despite favorable rules in the bill, McGuireWoods suggests that developers consider beginning construction on projects with a placed-in-service date of 2028 or 2029 as soon as possible.

Generally, the IRS recognizes two tests for a project to begin construction for tax purposes, the physical work test and the 5% safe harbor. Only one test must be satisfied to establish the beginning of construction. Once construction has begun, a taxpayer must make continuous efforts towards completion. Under a continuity safe harbor endorsed by the IRS, projects that begin construction in 2025 would have until the end of 2029 to be placed in service, and projects that begin construction in 2026 would have until the end of 2030 to be placed in service.

Under the physical work test, a taxpayer must perform physical work of a substantial nature on equipment that is an integral part of the facility. Off-site work must be performed pursuant to a binding written contract on components not normally held in the supplier’s inventory of the supplier that are critical to the project’s production of energy. For on-site work, work such as foundations uniquely designed to support electricity-generating equipment or other physical work of a substantial nature can establish the beginning of construction.

Under the 5% safe harbor, a taxpayer must, pursuant to a binding written contract, pay or incur at least 5% of the total cost of the facility and, for accrual-based taxpayers, take delivery of such components or expect to take delivery within 3.5 months of the execution of the binding written contract.

FEOC Rules

The bill would adopt a regime designed to stop credits claimed under 45Y, 48E, 45X, 45Q, 45Z and 45U from being claimed by or sold to certain prohibited foreign entities. For Section 45Y, 48E and 45X, this applies for credit claimed beginning Jan. 1, 2026. Additionally, (i) for Section 45Q, it applies beginning Jan. 1, 2026, and (ii) for Section 45Z and 45U, it applies beginning Jan. 1, 2026, in each case by determining if an entity is a prohibited foreign entity without regards to (b) and (c) under “foreign-influenced entity,” below.

Prohibited Foreign Entity: A specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity.

Specified Foreign Entity: Foreign entities of concern, as described in the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2021, include Chinese military companies operating in the United States, any entity on a list required by the strategy to enforce prohibition on imported goods made through forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, an entity listed as ineligible for Department of Defense battery acquisition in the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2024 or a foreign-controlled entity.

Foreign-Controlled Entity: Foreign-controlled entities include the government of a covered nation (the Democratic People’s Republic of North Korea, the Republic of China, the Russian Federation and the Islamic Republic of Iran); a person who is a citizen, national or resident of a covered nation, provided the person is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; an entity or qualified business unit incorporated or organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a covered nation; or an entity controlled by any of the listed foreign-controlled entities.

Foreign-Influenced Entity: Foreign-influenced entities are entities:

with respect to which, during the taxable year, (a) a specified foreign entity has the direct or indirect authority to appoint a covered officer, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of such entity, (c) one or more specified foreign entities own in the aggregate at least 40% of such entity, or (d) at least 40% of the debt of such entity is held in the aggregate by one or more specified foreign entities;

which, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement or other arrangement which entitles such specified foreign entity to exercise control over a qualified facility or energy storage technology, including (a) determining the timing or production of electricity or an eligible component, (b) determining which entity may purchase or use the output of a project, (c) restrict access to data critical to the production of storage or energy or (d) repair or maintain the facility or energy storage technology on an exclusive basis; or

which is party to a licensing agreement with a specified foreign entity that entitles such specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a qualified facility or energy storage technology or is longer than 10 years.

Material Assistance From a Prohibited Foreign Entity: Material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity is determined with respect to the “material cost ratio” of a qualified facility, energy storage technology or product line that produces eligible components. Generally, the material cost ratio for Sections 48E and 45Y is the portion of the cost of manufactured products, for 45X, is the cost of materials used to produce an eligible component, which come from sources other than prohibited foreign entities. The bill requires the IRS to issue safe harbor tables with respect to the cost of manufactured products and materials by Dec. 31, 2026, and states that until then, taxpayers may use the existing tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 to determine the cost of manufactured products and materials.

Additionally, the bill introduces new certification rules, but until the IRS issues guidance on these, taxpayers may rely on certifications from manufacturers or suppliers regarding the material cost ratio, provided that they do not rely on certifications they have reason to know are false. Existing contracts are exempt from the material assistance rules, provided that they were entered into prior to June 16, 2025, and relate to property that will be placed in service prior to Jan. 1, 2030.

A table summarizing the material cost ratios applicable under Sections 45Y, 48E and 45X is below:

Changes to Depreciation

The bill would eliminate (a) 5-year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System depreciation for solar projects that do not qualify for a credit under Sections 48E or 45Y and (b) the energy-efficient commercial building deduction under Section 179D for projects beginning construction after June 30, 2026. Solar projects may still be able to utilize 100% bonus depreciation under Section 168(k).

Master Limited Partnerships

The bill would cause hydrogen storage, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, hydro-power and geothermal activities to constitute “qualifying income” under the master limited partnership tax regime. This provision creates an interesting regime that could pass tax credits through to master limited partnership investors and provide a method of raising capital for capital-intensive technologies. Additionally, this provision appears to be a boost to the oil and gas industry, which already uses the master limited partnership structure and could benefit from the inclusion of Section 45Q.",https://www.mcguirewoods.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/MW-social-media-icon.jpg,N,,2025-07-04 04:00:07.008035

By merging the Reduc refinery in Duque de Caxias with the Boaventura Energy Complex in Itaboraí, Petrobras aims to transform its refining and petrochemical operations into a cornerstone of the global low-carbon transition. This initiative not only enhances refining efficiency but also positions Petrobras as a leader in sustainable fuel production, all while aligning with President Lula's vision for industrial revitalization and economic growth in Rio de Janeiro's central corridor.

Strategic Advantages in Refining Efficiency

The integration's core objective is to maximize production of high-value fuels while minimizing emissions. By upgrading the Reduc refinery's hydrotreating and delayed coking units, Petrobras plans to boost S-10 diesel output by 76,000 barrels per day (bpd) and jet fuel capacity by 20,000 bpd. These upgrades leverage advanced hydrogen recovery systems, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by over 80% compared to older processes.

The project's focus on operational excellence is underscored by its modernization of the GasLub Complex, which will produce 12,000 bpd of high-grade lubricants by 2029. Meanwhile, a new R$860 million thermal power plant at Reduc will replace outdated equipment, enhancing energy efficiency and reliability.

Investors should note that these upgrades directly address Petrobras' GHG intensity target of 30 kg CO₂e per barrel by an unspecified year, a metric that could improve its ESG ratings and access to green financing.

Biofuel Production: A Catalyst for Low-Carbon Leadership

Decarbonization is central to the project's success. The Boaventura Complex's new Bio Jet Fuel plant will produce 19,000 bpd of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), leveraging renewable feedstocks like corn oil. Early trials at Reduc have already demonstrated the viability of co-processing SAF with 1.2% renewable content, with commercial production expected to hit 10,000 bpd by late 2025.

Petrobras' BioRefining Program further expands with the authorization to test Diesel R7—a 7% renewable-content diesel—expanding from the current 5% blend. With global BIOQAV (aviation bio-kerosene) demand projected to grow at 12% annually until 2030, these initiatives position Petrobras to capture premium pricing in high-margin biofuel markets.

The scalability of these projects is bolstered by Brazil's abundant agricultural feedstocks, offering a competitive advantage in cost-efficient biofuel production.

Synergies with Braskem: Petrochemical Growth and Circular Economy

The integration's petrochemical ambitions are equally compelling. Braskem, Petrobras' 47%-owned affiliate, is expanding its polyethylene plant capacity by 230,000 tons/year near Reduc, utilizing natural gas from Boaventura's Route 3. This synergy reduces feedstock costs and aligns with Petrobras' goal of reducing imports of critical chemicals like acetic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG), both of which are 100% imported today.

Moreover, a proposed lubricant re-refining project at Reduc aims to process 30,000 m³/month of used oil, converting waste into high-value products. This circular economy approach not only cuts emissions but also creates new revenue streams from waste management—a model increasingly favored by global investors.

Aligning with Lula's Industrial Policy and Regional Growth

President Lula's administration has prioritized reviving Brazil's industrial base through strategic investments in energy and petrochemicals. The Reduc-Boaventura project directly supports this agenda by creating jobs in Rio de Janeiro's economically disadvantaged regions and reducing reliance on imported fuels and chemicals.

The project's total R$33 billion investment—split between Petrobras and Braskem—also signals long-term commitment to the region. With Brazil's ethanol subsidies and global sulfur standards evolving, the integration's flexibility in adapting to regulatory shifts further mitigates risks tied to compliance costs.

Investment Considerations and Risks

While the project's scale and alignment with global decarbonization trends are compelling, risks remain. Execution delays or cost overruns could strain Petrobras' capital allocation, particularly with R$2.4 billion earmarked for maintenance shutdowns through 2029. Additionally, regulatory hurdles—such as delays in ANP approvals for new biofuel blends—could slow revenue generation.

However, the project's early milestones, such as the REPLAN hydrotreating unit's completion in May 2024, suggest strong execution capability. For investors, Petrobras' exposure to rising biofuel demand and its leadership in low-carbon refining make it a compelling long-term play.

The company's target of $2.1 billion EBITDA growth by 2028—driven by efficiency gains and premium biofuel sales—supports a ""Buy"" rating for investors with a multi-year horizon.

Conclusion

The Reduc-Boaventura Integration is more than a refinery upgrade—it's a strategic blueprint for Petrobras to dominate the low-carbon energy transition. By enhancing refining efficiency, scaling biofuel production, and leveraging synergies with Braskem, the project creates a robust platform for value creation. Combined with Brazil's industrial policy priorities and the global shift toward sustainable fuels, Petrobras is poised to transform itself into a leader in the new energy economy. For investors, this is a rare opportunity to back a company at the intersection of decarbonization, regional development, and long-term profitability.",,N,,2025-07-04 01:59:12.934374

""This innovation is significant for us and we have been extensively using innovative products and technologies from China,"" said Yu, citing large purchases of Chinese-made solar panels and the deployment of Chinese wind turbines in TotalEnergies' projects worldwide.

TotalEnergies is also conducting local research and development in China to address global challenges. To better integrate its strategy and leverage Chinese innovation, the company established a new unit earlier this year aimed at enhancing synergy across its businesses in China and promoting technology exchange between China and its global operations.

According to Zhu Yicong, vice-president of renewables and power research at global consultancy Rystad Energy, China has seen a substantial increase in the installation of renewable energy capacity over recent years.

This strong momentum in adding new clean energy sources shows no signs of diminishing, indicating a sustained push in this sector, Zhu said.

The global consultancy projects a period of record-breaking expansion for China's solar sector in the near future. Their forecast specifically anticipates that the country's total installed solar PV capacity will exceed the significant threshold of 1,000 gigawatts by the close of 2026, highlighting the rapid scale of expected growth.

A large share of the world's total solar installations in 2025 is expected to take place within China, she said.

Yu identified China's ""vast market size"" as a key advantage, providing strong support for the practical application of technological innovation and fostering new technology pathways and business models with high efficiency.

He also highlighted China's ""complete industrial chain and strong manufacturing capabilities"" as crucial for the cost-effective deployment of new energy technologies, especially in renewables and storage.

TotalEnergies is collaborating with Chinese partners on developing clean energy products like sustainable aviation fuel, green power, hydrogen and carbon capture, while adopting Chinese innovations like solar components and storage systems in its global low-carbon business development, Yu said.

The platform will help connect airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers. When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

IATA hopes that the platform will address three main issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

IATA Director General Willie Walsh expressed his frustration with the current process earlier this year, describing the actions of some fuel suppliers as ‘profiteering’.

Referring to the EU mandate which is for airlines to mix 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply, Walsh pointed out that this had “…raised costs but not production.” He went on to say “It’s an outrage that suppliers are charging airlines compliance fees that value SAF at double its market premium over conventional jet fuel. That’s a billion-dollar windfall for fuel suppliers. This is the EU great green scam.”

About the launch of the SAF Matchmaker Platform, Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist said:

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,”.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The platform is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralised digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.",https://cdn.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Willie-Walsh-IATA-e1751296194489.jpg,N,,2025-07-03 22:59:20.084250

Cirium’s EmeraldSky is a new methodology which the company claims is the industry’s most precise independent standard for measuring both aircraft emissions and fuel burn. The system has achieved ISAE 3000 Reasonable Assurance from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and official accreditation from the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI).

The data has Wizz Air topping the table for efficiency with the lowest emissions intensity for last year when ranking the world’s 100 largest airlines by capacity. Wizz Air emits an industry low of 53.9 grams of CO₂ per Available Seat Kilometre (ASK) compared to a global average of 74.8. The airline has achieved this through a combination of high seat density on its aircraft, and newer fleets.

In the US, American low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines came second, emitting 54.4 grams, while Turkish carrier Pegasus came third with 57.1 grams.

In addition to Wizz Air and Pegasus, a further four European airlines made the global top 20, namely SunExpress (9th), Transavia (13th), Aegean Airlines (16th), Ryanair (20th).

Cirium’s report also ranked the ten largest airlines in the world by ASK. At the head of the table was Ryanair, emitting 63 grams of CO₂ per ASK, followed by Southwest Airlines, and Delta Air Lines.

The top 20 major airlines globally are pictured below:

Mike Malik, chief marketing officer of Cirium said that “what makes this data both encouraging and sobering [is that] while these airlines excel at reduced emissions intensity, total emissions continue rising with demand growth. Even the most efficient operators can’t offset demand growth through operational improvements alone yet.”

Malik added that:

“The data confirms what many in the industry suspected: seat density and fleet age matter more than almost any other factor airlines can control. While industry leaders are succeeding through these operational strategies, it also highlights how limited the levers for emissions reduction really are compared to the scale of the challenge.”

The new methodology does not currently factor in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its analysis. Cirum points out that “…current production covers only 0.53% of fuel demand and scaling requires massive infrastructure investment and years of development. Until airlines have consistent access to meaningful volumes, operational efficiency remains the primary lever they can pull today.”

The emissions calculations are built on a multi-layered data integration approach that combines several data sources:

Flight Operations Data: The system ingests actual flight tracking data, including gate and runway departure and arrival times. This real-world operational data replaces the theoretical great circle distance calculations used by many existing tools.

Aircraft Performance Models: The system incorporates detailed aircraft-specific fuel consumption models that account for individual aircraft characteristics, engine types, and configuration variables. These models consider factors such as aircraft age and operational weight that significantly impact fuel burn rates.

Operational Context Integration: The system accounts for operational factors such as taxi times, ground delays, air traffic control routing changes, and holding patterns that contribute to taxi/ flight times and therefore total flight emissions but are often excluded from simplified calculation methods.

Real-Time Data Processing: EmeraldSky processes this multi-source data through advanced algorithms that weight and correlate different variables to produce fuel consumption estimates. The system then applies standardised emissions factors to convert fuel burn data into CO₂.

Validation and Calibration: The platform continuously validates its calculations against actual reported fuel consumption data where available, using machine learning techniques to refine its models and improve accuracy over time.

That includes the green hydrogen industry, which is finding a place for itself in global food systems as producers scout for more sustainable alternatives to petrochemical fertilizers.

New Green Hydrogen Project Targets Green Ammonia

The latest news about sustainable fertilizer comes from the UK-listed firm ATOME. The company is planning to construct a new, $630 million USD fertilizer facility in Paraguay, which will deploy green hydrogen to produce ammonia-based fertilizer.

“Due to traditional fossil-fuel production methods, the fertiliser industry emits 2.6 billion tonnes of CO₂ per year – more than the shipping and aviation sectors combined,” ATOME notes, by way of explaining why a shift into green hydrogen is needed.

If you’re wondering how green hydrogen comes into the fertilizer equation, that’s a good question. Producing ammonia fertilizer requires a copious amount of hydrogen along with nitrogen (the chemical symbol for ammonia is NH3). In the conventional ammonia-based fertilizer industry, the supply chain lands on hydrogen extracted from natural gas or coal. The green hydrogen industry presents a more sustainable alternative.

ATOME plans to produce calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer at the new facility, with green hydrogen providing a fossil-free source of ammonia. Electricity from the hydropower facility will run electrolysis equipment, which jolts hydrogen gas loose from water. “Our process virtually eliminates harmful emissions at the point of production which leads to the displacement of up to 12.5 million tonnes of CO2 – from just one of our projects!” ATOME enthuses.

Green Hydrogen: Follow The Money

Stakeholders in the alternative hydrogen space have also explored bio-based and waste-based pathways to push virgin fossil sources out of the way of the hydrogen supply chain, but most of the investor money is currently focused on water electrolysis.

ATOME comes into the picture flush with cash and a string of well heeled industry collaborators including Yara, Hy24, AECOM, Natixis, IDB Invest, and ANDE among others. Earlier this year ATOME tapped Hy24 for up to $115 million USD to serve as anchor and lead equity investor for the Paraguay project.

Another major milestone occurred in April, when ATOME put up a lump sum of $465 million to engage the global engineering firm Casale to take the lead on EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) for the Paraguay fertilizer project. Located in Villeta, the new facility is expected to produce 260,000 tonnes (about 286,600 US tons) of fertilizer for markets in the Mercosur region. If all goes according to plan, Casale will begin construction later this summer and the facility will be up and running in time for sales to begin in 2028.

“Once constructed, the Villeta Project will service a developed and ready market in the heart of the largest food-producing region in the world, meeting critical demand for low-carbon fertilisers from the agriculture and food sectors,” Casale noted in a press release last April.

Casale CEO Federico Zardi also emphasized that his firm has been transitioning its traditional business into a low-carbon model for the past 10 years or so, enabling it to apply a considerable base of knowledge to the ATOME project.

“Through these technological advancements, we are delivering an extremely optimized design at Villeta, setting a precedent for sustainable fertiliser production at costs that are competitive with, or even lower than, conventional ‘grey’ fertilisers, paving the way to a sustainable agricultural future,” Zardi emphasized.

Follow More Money To Green Hydrogen

If you caught that thing about “competitive with, or even lower than, conventional ‘grey’ fertilisers,” that represents a sea change for the green hydrogen industry. Leading up to today, green hydrogen has struggled to compete on cost against the fossil energy supply chain. However, the script is beginning to flip. In addition to system optimization, the cost of electrolysis equipment has come down. Access to low-cost renewable energy also plays a role, as does qualification for public subsidies. ATOME notes that the Villeta project is located in a tax-free zone, for example.

Another downward driver of costs is favorable financing, for which the new fertilizer project also qualifies. Earlier this week the ATOME team contacted CleanTechnica by email with news that the project has just been approved for $50 million USD in concessional financing from the Green Climate Fund. Concessional provides more favorable terms than conventional, market-available financing.

“The concessional finance reduces the Project’s cost of capital and supports market competitiveness,” ATOME noted.

“This highly competitive funding, alongside competitive senior debt support from leading multilateral development institutions, will meaningfully lower the overall cost of capital, ATOME CEO Olivier Mussat emphasized in a press statement.

“By enhancing the value of the equity component, it importantly enhances the bankability and value of the Project equity and will assist in optimising returns for ATOME’s shareholders,” Mussat emphasized again for good measure.

A feature of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change,the Green Climate Fund bills itself the largest climate fund in the world. It provides financial support to developing countries in pursuit of their decarbonization goals under the Paris Agreement. The $50 million in financing for the fertilizer project will be administered through the International Finance Corporation branch of the World Bank Group.

Meanwhile, Here In The US …

ATOME anticipates that the seal of approval from GCF will provide a shot of adrenaline to the green hydrogen industry beyond the Villeta project. “GCF views the Project as a large-scale catalytic step towards decarbonising fertiliser production across South America and importantly will contribute to the sustainability, affordability and security of the food supply chain,” the company notes.

Meanwhile, here in the US, the green hydrogen industry already got a shot of adrenaline a couple of years ago, from the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The BIL carved out $7 billion to support the creation of new regional hydrogen hubs, leveraging the distinctive natural, infrastructural, and economical resources of different parts of the US.

The BIL also included a further carveout requiring natural gas to be represented in the program, but most of the emphasis was on green hydrogen produced from water or biomass with renewable energy.

That’s “was” as in “probably not gonna happen after all.” On May 30, Energy Secretary Chris Wright (this guy) canceled 24 clean energy programs totaling $3.7 billion, some of which were related to clean hydrogen.

That doesn’t necessarily mean the end of green hydrogen in the US. In Iowa, a modestly scaled, solar-enabled green hydrogen-to-fertilizer project is providing farmers with access to locally produced, carbon-free ammonia fertilizer.

On the larger end of the scale, keep an eye on Texas. BloombergNEF recently identified Texas as one of the few regional markets where green hydrogen has the potential to gain a competitive edge, and the global sustainable aviation fuel movement is providing green hydrogen stakeholders with a lifeline.

CORSIA is a global mechanism for reducing and offsetting carbon emissions from international flights, backed by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization.
ICAO's statistics showed that the scheme has already covered about 60% of total international aviation CO2 emissions.
However, some large developing countries, like China, India and Brazil, have not yet committed to joining CORSIA.
""This is a substantial figure, especially as many Vietnamese airlines are recovering post-pandemic and facing intense competition,"" the government statement said.","The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam has officially committed to participating in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation from Jan. 1, 2026, according to a Vietnamese government statement released on July 2.

CORSIA is a global mechanism for reducing and offsetting carbon emissions from international flights, backed by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization. Under CORSIA's framework, airlines need to offset any growth in CO2 emissions above 85% of 2019 levels. As such, this mechanism has been widely seen as a key stimulus of carbon credit demand.

ICAO's statistics showed that the scheme has already covered about 60% of total international aviation CO2 emissions. However, some large developing countries, like China, India and Brazil, have not yet committed to joining CORSIA. Vietnam's latest announcement sent an encouraging signal to indicate a higher level of readiness of developing countries.

The Vietnamese government said this move also marks a significant stride in the green transition roadmap for Vietnam's aviation sector, while also posing a considerable challenge for domestic airlines, according to the statement.

The ICAO on June 30 confirmed the registration of CAAV, an agency under Vietnam's Ministry of Construction, to participate in the voluntary phase of CORSIA commencing from Jan. 1, 2026, the Vietnamese government statement said.

CAAV SAID Vietnam has undertaken numerous preparatory steps for participation. The construction ministry has issued a circular regulating the management of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in civil aviation activities. CAAV has also implemented a monitoring-reporting-verification system for airline emissions and submitted international emissions data reports to ICAO for 2019-2024, the statement said.

In addition, CAAV has studied policies related to sustainable development from ICAO and the EU and organized various meetings with stakeholders to assess impacts and develop appropriate solutions for the CORSIA participation, according to the statement.

Financial impacts

However, CAAV warned that domestic airlines will face significant financial pressure due to the CORSIA participation. It is projected that the cost of purchasing carbon credits during the voluntary phase could range from $13 million to $92 million, depending on the market price of credits, which vary between $6 and $40/mtCO2e.

""This is a substantial figure, especially as many Vietnamese airlines are recovering post-pandemic and facing intense competition,"" the government statement said.

The CORSIA mechanism is structured in three main phases.

The Pilot Phase (2021-2023) applies to states that choose to participate voluntarily, followed by Phase 1 (2024-2026), which also remains voluntary. Phase 2 (2027-2035), however, becomes mandatory for states whose international aviation activities accounted for more than 0.5% of global revenue ton-kilometers based on 2018 data.

Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, and Landlocked Developing Countries are exempt from this obligation unless they choose to participate voluntarily, according to ICAO.

CAAV will continue to coordinate closely with the airlines and relevant agencies in the future to standardize policy proposals and deliver financial and technical support mechanisms, helping aviation enterprises effectively adapt to CORSIA's new requirements, the statement said.

Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical Joint Stock Company, operator of the 130,000 b/d refinery at Dung Quat, in March signed a consulting contract with Kellogg Brown & Root for a pre-feasibility study on sustainable aviation fuel. The contract will grant BSR access to advanced technologies and technical solutions for energy transition and carbon emission reduction while also creating opportunities to facilitate its investments in new energy and sustainable aviation projects.

National carrier Vietnam Airlines successfully conducted the first flight using SAF from Singapore to Hanoi on May 27, 2024, the government said in a statement in May last year.

The table below summarizes the most significant changes to key renewable energy tax credits under the BBB (click here to view the full table).
We will be issuing additional alerts on other elements of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill in the days to come.","Wind and Solar Projects. The evolution of the BBB included different approaches to termination of the clean electricity tax credits (IRC §§ 45Y and 48E), particularly as relates to wind and solar projects. As finally approved by Congress, the clean electricity tax credits generally would be unavailable for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027. Based on late edits to the legislative text, however, a grandfather rule would preserve eligibility of the credits for wind and solar projects that start construction before the date that is 12 months following enactment of the Bill. Eligibility for the credits for other projects will begin to phase out after 2032.

Imported Nuclear Fuel. An earlier Senate version of the BBB would have denied the zero-emission nuclear power production credit under IRC § 45U if nuclear fuel imported from China, Russia, Iran or North Korea was used for electricity production from a facility (subject to an exception for binding contracts in effect before January 1, 2023). Such prohibition represented an extension of the various foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions imposed on renewable energy projects under the BBB. While the FEOC restrictions largely remain intact in the final version of the BBB, the prohibition of use of imported nuclear fuel under IRC § 45U has been removed.

New Excise Tax. A surprise addition to the earlier Senate version of the BBB was a new excise tax applicable to wind and solar projects that violate the material assistance rules, which generally are intended to limit the use of materials obtained from persons or entities with ties to China, Russia, Iran or North Korea (“prohibited foreign entities”). Very generally, prohibited foreign entities include “specified foreign entities” (SPEs) and “foreign influence entities” (FIEs), with a SPE including a foreign entity of concern or other entity or person with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and a FIE generally including (i) an entity in which SPEs hold significant ownership interests or possess the ability to appoint directors or key executives or (ii) an entity that made certain sizable payments to SPEs during the previous taxable year. As drafted, the new tax would have been imposed on project equipment based on the degree to which a project exceeds material assistance cost ratios for materials sourced from prohibited foreign entities, up to 50% for wind projects and 30% for solar projects, and would have applied to wind and solar projects which either (i) begin construction after December 31, 2027, and before January 1, 2036, or (ii) begin construction after the date of enactment and before January 1, 2028, and are placed in service after December 31, 2027. The excise tax proposal, described by industry participants as potentially being the death knell for wind and solar projects, was excluded from the final version of the BBB.

Renewable Fuel. The BBB contains several key changes to the clean fuel production credit under IRC § 45Z, which provides a tax credit for the production of low-carbon-intensity transportation fuels. Most notably, the BBB extends the IRC § 45Z credit through the end of 2029. (The credit was originally due to expire in 2027.) Beginning in 2026, IRC § 45Z will only be available for fuel produced from feedstocks produced in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The BBB now caps the value of the IRC § 45Z credit at $1.00 per gallon (including for sustainable aviation fuel) except in the case of fuel produced from animal manure (e.g., renewable natural gas) for which the Treasury may provide for a credit value in excess of $1.00 per gallon depending upon the emissions rate of the fuel. These changes provide some additional stability for the renewable fuels market generally but will cause some disruption in the sustainable aviation fuel and imported feedstock markets.

Hydrogen. The BBB sunsets the clean hydrogen production credit under IRC § 45V for hydrogen projects that have not yet commenced by December 31, 2027. This is five years earlier than had been originally provided under the IRA.

As part of its sustainability roadmap, British Airways has committed to powering 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 (the UK government has since set a SAF Mandate).
Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres, stated, “We are proud to partner with British Airways in this strategic agreement to jointly tackle greenhouse gas emissions in aviation.
Together, we are contributing to the broader effort of reducing emissions in transportation.” Carrie Harris, Director of Sustainability at British Airways, added, “At British Airways, we see SAF as an important part of our BA Better World strategy.
In 2024 alone, SAF accounted for 2.7% of British Airways’ total fuel use and is contributing to our achievement of a 13% reduction in our carbon intensity since 2019.","EcoCeres, Inc., a leading pure-play renewable fuels producer, announced the signing of a multi-year agreement to supply British Airways with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This strategic partnership is expected to help the UK’s flagship carrier reduce lifecycle carbon emissions of approximately 400,000 metric tons, compared with use of the same volume of conventional jet fuel. This reduction is equivalent to the total emissions of flying ~ 240,000 economy class passengers on return flights between London and New York.

As part of its sustainability roadmap, British Airways has committed to powering 10% of its flights with SAF by 2030 (the UK government has since set a SAF Mandate). EcoCeres will provide SAF produced from 100% waste-based biomass feedstock, such as used cooking oil (UCO). This SAF has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces.

Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres, stated, “We are proud to partner with British Airways in this strategic agreement to jointly tackle greenhouse gas emissions in aviation. Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering, and this partnership exemplifies our dedication to providing innovative fuel solutions that will help the aviation industry meet its environmental targets. Together, we are contributing to the broader effort of reducing emissions in transportation.”

Carrie Harris, Director of Sustainability at British Airways, added, “At British Airways, we see SAF as an important part of our BA Better World strategy. In 2024 alone, SAF accounted for 2.7% of British Airways’ total fuel use and is contributing to our achievement of a 13% reduction in our carbon intensity since 2019. That’s why this new agreement with EcoCeres is so exciting - it's another important step forward on our journey to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”
