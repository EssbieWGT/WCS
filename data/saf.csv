Singapore will introduce a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy for outbound air travel in 2026. The details of this levy will only be introduced later. But we can expect an additional fee to be collected when we fly next year.

This levy is not for fun. International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme For International Aviation), will become mandatory worldwide in 2027. Airlines will be required to offset any carbon emission growth with either carbon credits or SAF.

I said in my speech that I fully support our move towards sustainability. As a small, low-lying island on the equator, we are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. We must do our part.

However, sustainability should not come at the expense of competitiveness. They must always go hand in hand. Because what good is sustainability for tomorrow, if we lose our lunch today ?

Departing from Changi Airport already costs more than other airports. Others such as KLIA, Incheon, Suvarnabhumi or Narita are all cheaper. Changi's charges are also expected to rise further in the years ahead, even before the new SAF Levy kicks in.

Our air hub is of strategic importance. It connects us to the world, enables trade, and directly supports tens of thousands of jobs. But the competition is cutthroat. Other airports are learning from us and working hard to improve on both service and efficiency. They will steal our lunch if we are not careful.

A Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc), Petrobras, reached a historic milestone in October 2025. She became the first certified refinery in Brazil to produce and market sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) along the route HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). This information was officially released by Petrobras, which reinforces the the country's leading role in the global energy transition.

Furthermore, international recognition was only possible thanks to ISCC CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification – Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). This seal was granted after authorization from the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), issued on May of 2025. Thus, the Reduce consolidated itself as national pioneer in the route of air decarbonization, raising the Brazil to a new level of innovation and sustainability.

Petrobras is present in the global energy transition

With ISCC CORSIA certification, Reduce proved that your process follows strict sustainability and traceability standards. The refinery is now authorized to produce SAF with up to 1,2% renewable raw material. In addition, you can market up to 50 thousand cubic meters per month, equivalent to 10 thousand barrels per day.

The advancement is aligned with the Future Fuel Program, from Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), which provides for reduce 1% of aviation emissions by 2027, in accordance with the LANE, ICAO. According to director William França, the achievement reinforces the Petrobras' commitment to a fair and sustainable energy transition. He highlighted that the progress demonstrates the essential role of innovation and modernization in Brazilian refining, ensuring environmental efficiency and competitiveness.

Brazil anticipates demands and takes the lead in green aviation

Although the mandatory use of SAF on international flights start only in 2027, Petrobras got ahead of itself and put the Brazil at the forefront of sustainable fuels. This strategy demonstrates leadership, planning and environmental commitment.

O director Claudio Schlosser stated that the coprocessing from Reduc is a efficient and sustainable solution, strengthening the fair energy transition. He stressed that the approach shows how national industry can anticipate global demands, ensuring cleaner and more competitive aviation.

A Henrique Lage Refinery (Revap)On Sao Jose dos Campos (SP), also tested the co-processing of vegetable oil, expanding the SAF production and consolidating the Petrobras as a global reference in the sector.

Certification reinforces commitment to sustainability

A ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) ensures sustainability and traceability in production chains of biomass and biofuelsThis seal proves that the Reduce complies global environmental standards and contributes directly to reduce carbon footprint.

In turn, the LANE, created by ICAO, aims to reduce emissions from international aviation e encourage the use of certified sustainable fuels such as SAF. Thus, the program strengthens the climate commitments of the Paris Agreement and promotes cleaner and more innovative industrial practices.

SAF is a ‘drop-in’ biofuel that is blended with conventional aviation fuel and used in aeroplanes without modification, to reduce the carbon emissions of flying.

By blending customers’ SAF into Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, the investment will boost green aviation fuel supplies to airports across southern England and Wales, including those at Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The company is also announcing that the facility will be the first of a new UK-wide network of SAF blending hubs it plans as part of its 2,000km pipeline network, creating a SAF Superhighway that will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to the jet fuel for 40% of flights leaving the UK’s airports.

Expected to be operational from 2026, the initial investment at Redcliffe Bay will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York a year, supporting the UK’s position as a global leader in green aviation.

The plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the UK and, in the case of Redcliffe Bay, south-west of England and southern Wales, by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when they become operational, which is expected later this decade.

Unblended SAF will initially be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock, before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. It will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel, to create the ready-to-use ‘drop-in’ fuel that is then distributed by Exolum’s national pipeline system.

The project includes several infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay, on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol. The plans include:

Conversion of existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.

Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.

Modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

Exolum North West Europe Lead, Stephen Land, said: ""Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the UK’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s world-leading position at the forefront of global sustainable aviation.

“The UK’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry.”

UK Department for Transport Aviation Minister, Keir Mather MP, said: “I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another major vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF Bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading.”

“We're also investing £63 million to support the production of homegrown SAF which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to UK flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the UK.""

Sadik Al Hassan MP, sustainable aviation champion and MP for North Somerset, said: “Exolum’s £4.5 million investment in their Redcliffe Bay facility marks a significant boost for North Somerset, helping support new technical jobs across the sustainable aviation supply chain in southwest England, whilst advancing the UK’s leadership in green aviation.

“Their vision for a sustainable aviation fuel ‘superhighway’ links delivery hubs to where the green fuel is needed most across the country, making the region more attractive for green investment in sustainable fuel production. It’s a clear signal that the green transition isn’t just possible but here.”

Dave Lees, CEO of Bristol Airport, said: “It’s fantastic to see this investment in our region, with blending facilities being a vital part of the future SAF supply chain that we need to decarbonise aviation. We’ve committed to working with our airline customers to meet the UK’s SAF mandate as part of our aim to be a net zero airport by 2050.”",,N,,2025-10-15 17:00:46.541145

Keir Mather promised that ticket prices will be “kept under continual review”, once the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill clears both Houses of Parliament.

MPs approved the draft new law at third reading in the Commons, and it faces further scrutiny in the Lords at a later date before it can become law.

The Bill paves the way for a new Government scheme to promote a “clear, predictable market price” for sustainable aviation fuels (Safs), by paying producers if Safs are sold for under a guaranteed “strike price”.

Where Safs are sold for above that price, the producers will pay back into the scheme.

It would be initially funded through a levy on aviation fuel suppliers.

The Conservatives called for a legal duty on the scheme’s managers to report on its impact on passenger air fares.

Shadow transport minister Greg Smith told the Commons: “This has been one of the most contentious areas surrounding this Bill and indeed the Government’s whole approach to net zero – what does it actually cost real people?”

He added his proposed amendment to the Bill, which did not pass by 319 votes to 151, majority 168, would “give the Government the opportunity – that in theory they should cheerfully embrace – to lock in that which they profess to believe, namely that the provisions of this Bill will have a plus or indeed minus £1.50 impact on air fares”.

At the despatch box, Mr Mather said the Government “is committed to delivering value for money” in the scheme by “controlling both the scale and the number of contracts entered into, and through the prices negotiated in each contract”.

He continued: “The impact on air fares is likely to rise or fall by less than the cost of a cup of coffee.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions.
Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term.
SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.
The specific ranges for 2030 and 2035 will be based on recent global market trends and domestic industry considerations.","The government of South Korea announced the release of its “Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Blending Mandate Roadmap,” introducing requirements for international departing flights to begin using fuel containing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), beginning in 2027, and with SAF content set to increase over the next few years.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

According to a recent report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), however, while SAF production is anticipated to double in 2025, it will still account for just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption.

South Korea’s new rules form the latest in a series of SAF mandates by jurisdictions globally, including the EU and UK, which each implemented a 2% SAF mandate beginning in 2025,

Under the new mandate, introduced by South Korea’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT) and Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE), international departing flights from Korea in 2027 will be required to use fuel with a 1% SAF blend, with blend mandates increasing to 3–5% in 2030 and 7–10% in 2035. The specific ranges for 2030 and 2035 will be based on recent global market trends and domestic industry considerations.

While MOLIT and MOTIE said that will include penalties for non-compliance will be included in the new mandate, they will be initially deferred. Additionally, the mandate includes flexibility mechanisms allowing up to 20% of the total SAF-blended fuel supply requirement for a given year to be deferred and fulfilled within the following three years. New airlines will be exempt from the mandate in their first three years of commercial operation.

Fuels that will be recognized as SAF in the mandate will be those that have achieved the carbon reduction level required by international standards based on the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and with bio-aviation fuel quality standards anticipated to be established in the first half of 2026.

According to South Korea’s Vice Minister for Transport KANG Hee-up, the new SAF mandate “represents Korea’s first step toward achieving carbon neutrality in international aviation, and will be remembered as a historic milestone that further elevates Korea’s status as the world’s eighth-largest air transport nation.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Airplane.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 12:01:17.298205

The airline plans to raise the SAF blend to 10% by 2030, aligning with its carbon neutrality goals.

Africa currently counts only five SAF projects, with a projected production capacity of 0.6 million tonnes by 2030.

Kenya Airways is expanding its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program as part of a strategy to reduce its carbon footprint and establish Kenya as a leading hub for green aviation in Africa.

According to Bloomberg, the airline launched on October 14 a series of four round-trip flights using a blend containing 2% SAF produced in Kenya. The first flight connected Nairobi and Paris, followed by routes to Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. The airline expects to complete the series by October 21.

Kenya Airways plans to progressively increase SAF usage to 10% by 2030, reinforcing its position as one of the frontrunners in Africa’s aviation energy transition. The carrier previously operated its first long-haul flight using SAF in 2023, sourcing the blend from Italy’s Eni SpA.

The company said the new initiative supports the global aviation industry’s target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and aims to promote energy self-sufficiency among African airlines.

Kenya Airways’ initiative also highlights the structural challenges facing the SAF industry in Africa. Only five projects are currently under development across the continent, with a combined projected production capacity of 0.6 million tonnes by 2030.

While Africa has abundant biomass and feedstock potential, a World Bank study stresses that efficient supply chain management remains crucial to ensuring consistent production and competitive pricing.

The report “Fueling Africa’s Flight: A Techno-Economic Assessment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Africa” notes that coordinated government support, international partnerships, and targeted investment in infrastructure and technology could enable Africa to emerge as a key player in the global SAF market.

The blended fuel will enter Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, supplying major airports across southern England and Wales, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter, and Cardiff.
The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill progresses in Parliament, which seeks to establish new subsidies and create a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF production.
This mechanism, funded by a levy on aviation fuel suppliers, is expected to reduce investment risk and help attract the necessary capital for new UK-based SAF projects.","Energy logistics company Exolum announced plans to invest £4.5 million (about US$5.99 million) to create the first independent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending facility at Redcliffe Bay in south-west England.

According to the official release, this infrastructure will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to the jet fuel used for 40% of all flights departing from UK airports.

The company is also planning to start a new UK-wide network of SAF blending hubs, aiming to establish a SAF Superhighway within Exolum's existing 2,000km national pipeline network.

Stephen Land of Exolum North West Europe said, “The UK’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a 'drop-in' biofuel that is blended with conventional aviation fuel and can be used in existing aircraft without requiring any modifications, offering a key tool for reducing the carbon emissions of flying.

Expected to be operational from 2026, the initial investment at Redcliffe Bay will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York a year.

The blended fuel will enter Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, supplying major airports across southern England and Wales, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter, and Cardiff.

Aviation Minister Keir Mather MP from the UK Department for Transport said, “We're also investing £63 million to support the production of homegrown SAF which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to UK flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the UK.""

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill progresses in Parliament, which seeks to establish new subsidies and create a revenue certainty mechanism for SAF production.

The proposed bill would create a guaranteed strike price (GSP) to ensure SAF producers receive a fixed price per unit of fuel.

This agreement supports Moeve’s Positive Motion strategy by promoting greater SAF adoption as the market evolves, helping to make it a more commercially viable solution for advancing the energy transition. ‘In a dynamic book and claim landscape, Avelia stands out as an initiative that has demonstrated real scale and credibility in accelerating SAF adoption. We are proud to join Avelia as its first strategic third-party SAF supplier and see this agreement as a key step in our ambition to lead aviation decarbonisation in Europe,’ says Carlos Barrasa, Moeve’s executive vice president for Commercial & Clean Energies.

Moeve is a leading SAF supplier in Spain, manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel at its La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva from used cooking oils, advancing the circular economy and supporting aviation decarbonisation. It is building a 2G biofuels facility in Huelva as part of a joint venture with the capacity to flexibly produce up to 500,000 tonnes of SAF and renewable diesel annually, and is targeting an overall annual SAF production capacity of 800,000 tonnes by 2030.

Avelia was launched in 2022 by Shell Aviation in collaboration with Amex Global Business Travel and Accenture, with support from the Energy Web Foundation (EWF). It offers a transparent, secure, credible and externally verified platform that helps businesses access the GHG benefits of SAF even when SAF is not physically available at their nearest location.

As of June 30 2025, Avelia helped inject over 41 million gallons of SAF into the existing fuel network at 17 airport injection point locations around the world, helping to abate over 370,000 tonnes of CO2-equivalent. 57 corporations and airlines have made transactions through Avelia.

In July 2025, Avelia announced its evolution into a multi-supplier platform, helping users access the GHG benefits of SAF from multiple SAF suppliers including Shell. The integration of Moeve into the platform means that airlines, corporations, freight forwarders and shippers will now have broader SAF supplier choice, including Moeve and Shell.

‘Avelia’s evolution into a multi-supplier platform is an important step in scaling access to SAF, and it is made possible through the collaboration of committed parties across the aviation value chain. Moeve’s role as Avelia’s first external SAF supplier marks a key milestone in our mission to help reduce emissions from aviation.

The plans include: Conversion of existing aviation-fuel storage tanks to handle SAF before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.","European energy-logistics company Exolum announced Oct. 15 its decision to invest £4.5 million (USD$6 million) in creating the U.K.’s first independent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending facility at Redcliffe Bay in South West England as part of new plans for a U.K.-wide network of SAF-blending hubs.

The announcement comes as the U.K.’s SAF bill, which creates new subsidies for SAF production, progresses to its next stage in Parliament.

SAF is a drop-in biofuel that is blended with conventional aviation fuel and used in airplanes without modification to reduce the carbon emissions of flying.

By blending customers’ SAF into Exolum’s national aviation-fuel pipeline network, the investment will boost green aviation-fuel supplies to airports across southern England and Wales, including those at Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The company is also announcing that the facility will be the first of a new U.K.-wide network of SAF-blending hubs it plans as part of its 2,000-kilometer pipeline network.

The creation of this “SAF superhighway” will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to the jet fuel for 40 percent of flights leaving the U.K.’s airports.

Expected to be operational from 2026, the initial investment at Redcliffe Bay will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York per year, supporting the U.K.’s position as a global leader in green aviation.

The plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the U.K. and, in the case of Redcliffe Bay, South West England and southern Wales, by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when they become operational, which is expected later this decade.

Unblended SAF will initially be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline.

It will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel to create the ready-to-use drop-in fuel that is then distributed by Exolum’s national pipeline system.

The project includes several infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation-fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol.

The plans include:

Conversion of existing aviation-fuel storage tanks to handle SAF before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.

Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF-blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.

Modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

“Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the U.K.’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s world-leading position at the forefront of global sustainable aviation,” said Stephen Land, Exolum’s lead for Northwestern Europe. “The U.K.’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the U.K.’s sustainable fuels industry.”

Keir Mather, the U.K. Department for Transport’s aviation minister, added, “I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another major vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading. We’re also investing £63 million (USD$84 million) to support the production of homegrown SAF, which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to U.K. flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the U.K.”

Sadik Al Hassan, a member of Parliament for North Somerset, said, “[Exolum’s] vision for a sustainable aviation fuel ‘superhighway’ links delivery hubs to where the green fuel is needed most across the country, making the region more attractive for green investment in sustainable fuel production.

1. Rise of renewables

Renewable energy has produced more electricity than coal for the first time, according to a report from energy think tank Ember.

Global electricity demand grew by 2.6% in the first half of 2025 – a rise that was more than met by increases in solar (+31%) and wind generation (+7.7%), the report says. With growth of 306 TWh – about the same amount of electricity that a country like Italy uses in a year – solar alone covered 83% of the increase in demand.

Coal generation, meanwhile, fell by 0.6%, leading to renewables’ share of global electricity rising 1.6 percentage points to 34.3%. Coal’s share fell by just over a percentage point to 33.1%.

Coal use and emissions fell in China and India as wind and solar met the growth in demand, the report adds. But its use grew in other major regions, with the European Union leaning on gas and coal to offset falls in hydro, bioenergy and wind generation and the US using more coal because clean sources did not rise enough to meet demand growth.

Concluding that the surge of solar and wind provides a “pivotal moment” to accelerate the energy transition, the report calls for governments to set ambitious targets and policies to speed up deployment of clean energy sources.

Emerging economies in particular, it says, still face barriers to renewables generation and need support from mature economies to overcome them.

The World Economic Forum's Coal to Clean platform works with energy, finance and civil society organizations to accelerate funding for the early retirement and repurposing of coal-fired power plants in emerging economies

2. Invest in grids and batteries - IEA

Amid the surge in solar, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) has highlighted the need to address supply chain and grid challenges.

In an announcement accompanying the agency’s Renewables 2025 report, Fatih Birol said that, driven by low costs and faster timeframes for permits, solar PV is on course to account for about 80% of the increase in the world’s renewable capacity until the end of this decade.

As renewables’ role in power systems increases in many countries, policy-makers “need to pay close attention to supply chain security and grid integration challenges,” he said.

The rapid rise of renewables is putting increasing pressure on electricity systems, the report notes, and with curtailment and negative price events appearing in more markets, it calls for urgent investment in grids, energy storage and flexible generation.

The report lowers its overall renewable energy growth forecast for 2025-2030 by 5% compared to last year to reflect policy, regulatory and market changes.

The report underscores the need to ensure power systems are flexible, resilient and sustainable – these will be the ""backbone of future economies"", according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Power Systems initiative.

The initiative works with a diverse range of stakeholders to drive the partnerships, strategies and innovations that will support future demand.

The interisland flights are Hawaiʻi’s biggest transportation carbon producer.
It’s going to take years, Green said, before technology exists to use electric aircraft to replace traditional planes for interisland flights.
It can reduce carbon emissions by 50%-80% when blended with standard aviation fuel, she said.
“I think across the airline industry, we are aligned that scaling the supply of cost-competitive, sustainable aviation fuel is going to be the key to addressing aviation carbon emissions,” James said.","Rylee Brooke Kamahele helped forge a landmark legal settlement requiring Hawai‘i to eliminate carbon emissions from the state’s transportation system in the next 20 years, including cars on all islands, ships and airplanes used for interisland flights.

Now, Kamahele and other plaintiffs in the historic Navahine settlement are pushing back against a major element of the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation’s plan for reaching the goal. The issue: the department’s proposal to use what’s known as sustainable aviation fuel or SAF— essentially the airplane equivalent of biodiesel — for interisland flights.

The department’s proposed plan to use the fuel aligns with the view of the aviation industry and fuel producers — as well as a local grower of oily plants that can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel — that SAF is the most practical choice to reduce emissions.

But the plaintiffs have a different view.

“The bottom line is to be completely carbon or 100% emission free by 2045: that’s just the bottom line,” said Kamahele, a 17-year-old activist, entrepreneur and actor from Mililani.

SAF, she said, is “not 100% carbon free, which is what we’re looking for.”

An alternative solution: “I’m very interested in fully electric planes,” she said.

The Department of Transportation says that’s not an option.

For zero-emission airplanes to replace jet fuel in 20 years, the department says, “there would need to be a very fast scale-up of electric battery aircraft technology for larger jets” carrying at least 100 passengers.

Given the nascent nature of electric aircraft, the department expects that by 2045, electric planes could make up only 10% of interisland flights.

The impasse underscores the challenge Hawaiʻi faces as it tries to keep the promises it made to the young plaintiffs.

Major Source Of Emissions

It’s one thing to electrify cars, trucks and boats and charge them using wind and solar power. Airplanes are different. Electric airplanes exist, but experts say they’re not big enough to transport the thousands of people who fly between Hawaiʻi’s islands each day.

The interisland flights are Hawaiʻi’s biggest transportation carbon producer. They make up more than half of all emissions related to civilian transportation in Hawaiʻi — and about 30% more than all forms of ground transportation combined.

Jeff Mikulina, a renewable energy consultant who helped craft Hawaiʻi’s energy policy, said the aviation component is “the biggest crux of this zero emissions goal.”

He said SAF is an attractive interim solution but the state needs to work toward electric planes while it pivots to SAF.

“Electrification of airplanes is going to be a winner,” he said.

Gov. Josh Green is less sanguine about electric planes.

In an interview, Green praised the young plaintiffs but said not all proposed solutions can meet what he called a “purity test.”

“This is a long game, when we’re talking about climate change, the Navahine settlement,” he said.

It’s going to take years, Green said, before technology exists to use electric aircraft to replace traditional planes for interisland flights.

“It’s going to have to be a lot of partners, and the young people are going to now be going to engineering school,” Green said, “and they’re going to come back, and they’re going to realize that these are not simple solutions.”

Final Plan To Be Released Wednesday

The state’s aviation challenge dates back to 2022, when a dozen teenagers, including Kamahele, sued the state Department of Transportation and then-Gov. David Ige, citing their state constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment.

They were represented by lawyers from Earthjustice’s Hawaiʻi office and Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based nonprofit organization that brings climate change suits on behalf of young people.

The complaint included allegations that climate change was damaging the lives of each of the plaintiffs. It also noted how a previously mandated zero emissions transportation target required the Department of Transportation to “take any actions necessary” to achieve zero emissions across all transportation modes, including interisland flights.

The plaintiffs argued the state was headed in the opposite direction.

Green settled in June 2024, essentially requiring the state to follow the law. The settlement lays out interim targets for 2030, 2035 and 2040 to ensure the state eliminates all emissions from transportation by 2045.

In June, the department issued a draft plan for how it would meet the milestones and sought public comments.

The final plan is expected to be released Wednesday. The department declined interview requests for this story.

The plan will likely include responses from the department to comments from Earthjustice and Our Children’s Trust. A fundamental flaw, the plaintiffs say, is the plan’s repeated reference to “net-zero emissions.” That would allow cars, boats and planes to continue generating carbon and for the state to offset the emissions by doing things like planting trees.

Kamahele noted the statute requires “real zero” emissions, not net zero.

“Net zero means that we just keep burning fossil fuels and we hide it with offsets,” she said. “That doesn’t protect future generations.

Settlement Envisions SAF As Interim Solution

The use of SAF is another issue.

The settlement actually envisions using SAF to meet the interim targets. It says the Department of Transportation must, “Support adoption by private stakeholders of zero emissions vehicles, sustainable aviation fuel, and other technologies.”

But the plaintiffs don’t see it as a long-term solution.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel (‘SAF’) is often made from corn ethanol, which increases carbon dioxide, air pollution, consumes a significant amount of land area, and must be shipped to Hawaiʻi, and is thus a non-solution for zero emissions transportation,” Earthjustice and Our Children’s Trust wrote in response to the department’s plan.

In addition, they wrote, the plan calls for the continued use of SAF well past 2045. The idea that zero-emission planes will make up only 10% of interisland flights by 2045 is “contrary to the Navahine Settlement, which commits to 100% zero emissions for interisland flights by 2045.”

Airline industry experts say there’s no other practical option.

Alana James is the sustainability innovation director for Alaska and Hawaiian airlines. The airline industry’s goal, she says, is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050; Alaska Air Group, which includes Hawaiian, is aiming for 2040.

The plan includes operating more efficiently, using next-generation airplanes and using carbon offsets.

But SAF is the most promising technology, James said. It can reduce carbon emissions by 50%-80% when blended with standard aviation fuel, she said. Plus, it’s ready to use now: airlines are already using SAF blends with existing engines and infrastructure.

One problem is capacity. There’s not that much SAF being produced. Alaska has agreements to buy SAF from West Coast refineries but still only consumed about 1% of its total aviation fuel from SAF last year, James said.

Another issue is price. SAF costs two to five times what conventional jet fuel costs. James couldn’t say what that would mean for someone traveling from, say, Oʻahu to Maui. But she estimated using SAF blends would mean a 25% increase in fuel prices, which would significantly impact ticket prices.

“I think across the airline industry, we are aligned that scaling the supply of cost-competitive, sustainable aviation fuel is going to be the key to addressing aviation carbon emissions,” James said.

Plan Calls For SAF Production Incentive

A key to driving down costs is support from state and federal taxpayers, similar to other green energies like solar, James said.

“SAF is going to require incentives to help reduce that cost gap to conventional fuels,” she said.

States like Washington, Minnesota and Illinois offer tax credits to support SAF. While the Hawaiʻi Legislature has yet to get on board, part of the Department of Transportation’s proposed plan is to create a SAF tax credit.

The bottom line: SAF will cost Hawaiʻi residents, in the form of tax incentives or higher interisland plane fares.

Hawaiʻi’s only refinery, Par Hawaii, already is betting big on SAF. In July, Par Hawaii announced a deal with Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation contributed $100 million for a 35.6% stake in a new joint venture, Hawaii Renewables, focused on producing renewable fuels at Par Pacific’s Kapolei refinery. By the end of this year, Hawaii Renewables expects to be able to produce 61 million gallons of SAF and other renewable fuels.

“We are slowly getting off the ground,” said Par Hawaii’s president, Eric Wright. “We do still have a long way to go.”

Par Hawaii is also working with Pono Pacific, a land conservation company that wants to ramp up production of a plant called camelina, whose oily seeds can be processed into SAF. The idea is to grow at least some SAF feedstock in Hawaiʻi rather than importing it.

“For the state to meet its goals, we’re really going to have to all work together on this,” Wright said.

Electric airplanes aren’t an option, James of Hawaiian Airlines, said.

Hawaiian now flies about 150 interisland flights with 128-seat airplanes. Current electric airplanes aren’t nearly that big.

Hawaiian has made an equity investment in REGENT Craft Inc., developer of what it calls an all-electric Seaglider, designed to fly on a cushion of air just above the ocean’s surface. The company says it has raised more than $90 million from other big-name investors, including Japan Airlines, Mesa Air Group, Thiel Capital, Mark Cuban and Lockheed Martin, and has orders for more than 600 Seagliders valued at more than $9 billion.

The company is targeting its 12-passenger plane, which is regulated as a maritime vessel, to enter service in 2026 or 2027 and a larger 50- to 100-passenger plane by the end of the decade.

Such technology is promising, James said, but added, “It’s going to take time before they’re going to really be able to make a dent” in reducing carbon emissions for interisland flights.

For the plaintiffs, meanwhile, SAF also won’t fly.

“It pollutes when you grow it,” Kamahele said. “It pollutes when you refine it. It pollutes again when you ship it to get to Hawai‘i, and then when you burn it here in Hawai‘i, it pollutes even more. Hawai‘i deserves real clean energy, not greenwashing.”

Exolum invests in UK’s first independent SAF blending facility

10:11 am

Uncategorized

Exolum, a European energy logistics company, will invest £4.5 million in a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending facility. The site will be located at Redcliffe Bay in south-west England. It marks the start of a national network of SAF blending hubs across the UK.

Supporting the UK’s Green Aviation Goals

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill moves ahead in Parliament. The Bill introduces new incentives for SAF production. It also supports the aviation sector’s shift towards lower emissions. SAF blends with standard jet fuel and works in aircraft without modification. Therefore, airlines can cut emissions without costly changes.

Expanding Clean Fuel Access

By blending customers’ SAF into its aviation fuel network, Exolum will supply greener fuel to key airports. These include Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff. As a result, the company will help the UK lead in clean aviation.

Building a SAF Superhighway

The Redcliffe Bay facility is the first in a series of planned blending hubs. Together, these sites will form a “SAF Superhighway” within Exolum’s 2,000km pipeline system. The network will give producers and importers direct market access. It will also provide sustainable jet fuel for about 40% of UK flights.

Driving Sustainable Growth

The facility is due to open in 2026. When operational, it could fuel up to 64,700 London–New York flights a year. The project will attract new investment in regional SAF production across south-west England and southern Wales.

Modern Infrastructure and Upgrades

Initially, unblended SAF will arrive by ship at Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock. It will then move by pipeline to Redcliffe Bay. There, it will be stored, blended and distributed nationwide. Exolum will also upgrade existing tanks, install advanced blending systems and add new pumps and filters.

Powering a Cleaner Future

With this investment, Exolum strengthens its commitment to sustainable aviation. Step by step, the company is building the infrastructure that will drive the UK’s transition to cleaner, greener energy.

Energy logistics company Exolum’s GBP4.5 million investment will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York. In line with the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate ramping up to 10% by 2030, the new facility at Redcliffe Bay is part of wider plans for a UK-wide network of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending hubs.

The Redcliffe Bay facility will be the first of multiple SAF blending hubs Exolum is planning as part of its 2,000km pipeline network, creating a SAF Superhighway to provide producers and importers with access to the jet fuel for 40% of flights leaving the UK’s airports.

Exolum’s UK fuel pipeline network currently delivers fuel to four out of 10 flights departing the UK each year. It delivers fuel for all flights from Stansted and Manchester Airports, around half of the flights from Gatwick and around a third of the flights from Heathrow. It also provides fuel supplies via road tankers for various regional airports, including Bristol, Exeter, Newquay and Cardiff.

The GBP4.5 million investment will, according to Exolum North West Europe Lead, Stephen Land, help turn the UK’s ambitions for greener flights into reality.

“The UK’s twin commitment to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry,” Land said.

The energy logistic firm’s plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the UK by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when the plants become operational.

For the Redcliffe Bay facility on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol, unblended SAF will be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock, before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. The SAF will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel to create a drop-in fuel distributed by Exolum’s pipeline system.

Plans to upgrade Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay include converting the existing storage tanks to handle SAF, installing a state-of-the-art blending infrastructure, and modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

Dave Lees, CEO of Bristol Airport said: “It’s fantastic to see this investment in our region, with blending facilities being a vital part of the future SAF supply chain that we need to decarbonise aviation. We’ve committed to working with our airline customers to meet the UK’s SAF mandate as part of our aim to be a net zero airport by 2050.”

He was joined by Sadik Al Hassan MP sustainable aviation champion and MP for North Somerset, who noted that the GBP4.5 million investment “marks a significant boost for North Somerset.” He underlined it will support employment across the region’s sustainable aviation supply chain.

A: Airport operators and concessionaires can use the report’s insights to embrace technology, streamline operations, and foster collaboration.","ICF's Aviation team recently released two reports for the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP): a Framework and Tools for Incorporating Technologies into Airport In-Terminal Concessions Programs and the supplemental Incorporating Technologies into Airport In-Terminal Concessions Programs - A Primer.

In the light of the increase in the use of technology in airport concessions programs, the main report is a practical guide for airport operators looking to deliver an advanced retail experience for their passengers. It highlights new and innovative technologies that airports and concessionaires are using enhance their relationships with the airport passenger. The report also offers insights into evaluating, selecting, and implementing technology to enhance customer experience, operational efficiency, and revenue generation. The Primer is a self-assessment tool, which provides a technical report for airport operators on the research effort.

We caught up with Tod Yankee, senior manager, global aviation commercial advisory, to find out more about key insights from the reports.

Q: If you had to summarize the reports’ biggest takeaway, what would it be?

A: Airports must treat technology as a core driver of passenger experience and revenue in concessions. This requires a holistic, data-driven, and collaborative approach that aligns digital innovation with evolving traveler expectations.

For airports where innovation is not a key element of their organizational culture, consider taking a “blue sky” approach. That means challenging the idea of what is possible without being encumbered with seemingly insurmountable constraints, as these can often be overcome with creativity and vision.

Q: Why is now the right time for airport operators to rethink the role of technology in their concessions strategy?

A: The convergence of new traveler behaviors, rapid innovations in technology, and rising competition means airports must act now to make technology a core part of their concessions strategy. Remember that your customer may be traveling through several other airports on their journey and experiencing what those airports offer.

Also, keep in mind that your airport is what passengers experience first when they arrive in your city or region and what they remember last when they leave. How can you leverage innovation to make sure that your customers’ impressions are favorable and positively memorable? Happy airport passengers spend more, so don’t risk being left behind.

Q: How does the new framework help airports move from concept to implementation?

A: The framework turns high-level ideas into actionable roadmaps, ensuring technology adoption is realistic, scalable, and aligned with each airport’s unique needs and goals.

Q: Can you share an example of how one of the featured airports successfully applied the framework?

A: Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) used processes similar to the framework’s principles. First aligning its innovation strategy with airport-wide business goals, then establishing a dedicated Innovation Division, they used cross-functional teams to pilot and scale new technologies like self-serve kiosks, mobile ordering, and “Just Walk Out” stores.

By collecting and analyzing sales and operational data (as recommended in the framework’s self-assessment tool), DFW was able to benchmark performance, optimize concession operations, and continuously improve both passenger experience and revenue—illustrating how the framework can turn high-level concepts into measurable, real-world results.

Q: How can airport operators and concessionaires navigate the changing landscape and position themselves for success?

A: Airport operators and concessionaires can use the report’s insights to embrace technology, streamline operations, and foster collaboration. This will help them stay competitive in a rapidly evolving industry by boosting efficiency, net revenues, passenger experience, and employee satisfaction.",https://www.icf.com/-/media/images/icf/insights/aviation/2025/9/advanced-retail-experiences-airports/acrp-aviation-reports-2025-icf-social-1200px.jpg?rev=e09b3008f8e84e0698c8b6d8a3d9eef6,N,,2025-10-15 08:01:08.617384

Paes Leme noted that these fuels can be used to replace planet-harming fossil fuels in sectors such as aviation, maritime transport, or the cement and steel industries.
Sustainable fuels are already used in these industries ""but they are not produced in sufficient quantities,"" he said.

For the first time, the world pledged to ""transition away"" from fossil fuels at COP28 in Dubai in 2023.","Brazil, India, Italy and Japan vowed Tuesday to quadruple their production and consumption of renewable fuels, hoping other countries will join the pledge during UN climate talks in November.

""We hope to have a good number of signatories"" by COP30, Brazilian foreign ministry official Joao Marcos Paes Leme told reporters in the capital Brasilia.

""Other European countries are also interested,"" he added.

Paes Leme was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of representatives from 67 countries in the run up to COP30 climate talks in the Amazon city of Belem next month.

The pledge involves quadrupling the production of sustainable fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen and some synthetic fuels by 2035, compared to 2024 levels.

Paes Leme noted that these fuels can be used to replace planet-harming fossil fuels in sectors such as aviation, maritime transport, or the cement and steel industries.

""These are sectors where decarbonization is difficult,"" because electrical energy has not yet succeeded in replacing fossil fuels.

Sustainable fuels are already used in these industries ""but they are not produced in sufficient quantities,"" he said.

The massive use of coal, oil, and fossil gas for energy since the industrial revolution is the primary driver of human-induced global warming.

The commitment to sustainable fuels ""is something we love to hear,"" said Francesco La Camera, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

However, he warned that some biofuels can be harmful due to the vast expanses of land required to produce raw materials such as sugarcane, soy, or corn.

""We have to be serious about what we say, sustainable fuel also means sustainable from the perspective of land use.""

For the first time, the world pledged to ""transition away"" from fossil fuels at COP28 in Dubai in 2023.

However many of the largest fossil-fuel producing nations—including Brazil—are planning to increase production in the coming years.

According to Airlines for Europe (A4E), which represents chief executives operating in the European aviation sector, airlines currently face high surcharges and limited price transparency, making large-scale SAF adoption impractical.

‘Derisk investment’

‘The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) must derisk investment in SAF production and bring down the cost of SAF,’ the group said in a statement.

‘Europe needs a market intermediary for SAF, more multi-year SAF allowances, a simple book-and-claim system, EU ETS revenues reinvested, and a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)-like mechanism, to reduce carbon leakage, fairly distributing SAF costs between EU and non-EU airlines – real tools to fast-track aviation’s decarbonisation.’

A4E added that the Fit for 55 package and SAF mandates in their current form ‘disproportionately increase’ the cost of flying through EU hubs and to EU destinations, as well as driving traffic, jobs, and, notably, emissions, to other global markets.

The group added that while European airlines are ‘committed’ to decarbonisation, this should not come at the cost of competitiveness, or accessible air travel.

‘Sober up’

Elsewhere, airline CEOs said that both the EU and national governments need to ‘sober up’ to the current geopolitical reality, given the importance of the sector to Europe’s economy – contributing over 4% of GDP and supporting more than 12 million jobs.

As they noted, industrial action in one member state – such as the recent air traffic controller strikes in France – can impact flights right across the bloc.

To prevent future disruptions, A4E called on EU leaders to ‘rewrite the script – require mandatory arbitration before a strike is even called, set a 21-day advance notice for any industrial action, protect overflights while ensuring local departures and arrivals are not impacted, and guarantee a right of redress for airlines.’

The CEOs also criticised what they called ‘unrealistic’ rules on delay compensation and cabin baggage, that ‘fail to serve passenger priorities or operational realities’.

Summit has been working for several years to develop a CO2 pipeline project that would span areas in South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and North Dakota, capturing CO2 produced at dozens of partnering ethanol plants and transporting it to North Dakota for secure geologic sequestration.
That facility, known as Gevo North Dakota, has operational CCS capabilities onsite.
Documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate Gevo and the DOE LPO are now considering altering the conditional commitment to support the proposed North Dakota SAF project.
“The conditional commitment will remain effective during the extension period in order to allow for modifications which satisfy the DOE LPO.","Gevo Inc. on Oct. 14 announced the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office has granted the company an extension of the conditional commitment for the $1.46 billion loan guarantee for its proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project.

Gevo in October 2024 received a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee with disbursements totaling $1.46 billion (excluding capitalized interest during construction) from the DOE for its proposed Net-Zero 1 project (NZ1) in South Dakota.

The proposed NZ1 project is an alcohol-to-jet biorefinery located near Preston, South Dakota, that was expected to produce 60 MMgy of SAF. During a second quarter earnings call held in August, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber said the NZ1 project is “plugging along, albeit slowly.” The development timeline for the project has been impacted by delays associated with Summit Carbon Solution’s proposed carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project.

Summit has been working for several years to develop a CO2 pipeline project that would span areas in South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and North Dakota, capturing CO2 produced at dozens of partnering ethanol plants and transporting it to North Dakota for secure geologic sequestration. Gevo’s NZ1 facility is among the facilities slated to be connected to the CCS system.

Development of the CCS project has been delayed by legal and permitting difficulties, including state-level legislation preventing the project from utilizing eminent domain to secure the pipeline route.

In South Dakota, Gov. Larry Rhoden in March signed a bill that aims to prevent the use of eminent domain for the development of CO2 pipelines, specifically targeting Summit’s proposed project. The following month, state’s Public Utilities Commission denied Summit’s pipeline application. Summit has signaled its intent to refile.

During Gevo’s second quarter earnings call, Gruber noted the company was continuing to work with the DOE and customers regarding the development of NZ1 and is waiting to see what happens with the Summit pipeline. In the meantime, Gruber said Gevo was shifting its resources and prioritizing the development of a 30 MMgy ethanol-to-jet project at its recently acquired corn ethanol plant in North Dakota. That facility, known as Gevo North Dakota, has operational CCS capabilities onsite. Documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate Gevo and the DOE LPO are now considering altering the conditional commitment to support the proposed North Dakota SAF project.

In an Oct. 14 filing made with the SEC, Gevo said it received a letter from the DOE LPO on Oct. 8 granting an extension of the conditional commitment until April 16, 2026. “The extension allows the company and DOE LPO to evaluate potential modifications to the project scope under the conditional commitment in order to address energy policies and priorities,” the company said in the SEC filing. “The conditional commitment will remain effective during the extension period in order to allow for modifications which satisfy the DOE LPO. The potential scope modifications include the construction of a lower cost 30 million gallon per year jet fuel production facility (ATJ-30) to develop jet fuel production at the company's existing ethanol and carbon capture utilization and storage facility in North Dakota and the optimal use of captured carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/epm/posts/web/2019/11/GevoLogoBigger_15729967454727.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 03:56:27.765178

The report also highlighted that during a recent Korea-U.S. working group meeting, Washington reportedly assured that holders of short-term business (B-1) visas and those entering under the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) would be allowed to engage in equipment installation and inspection activities, which could help speed up operations for Korean companies.

An industry official commented, “The quick return of essential personnel, just a month after the detention incident, demonstrates a rapid recovery. The resumption of the HL-GA project is expected to provide a significant boost to LG Energy Solution’s North American business.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/energy-13.png,N,,2025-10-15 03:56:39.468065

“The launch of our Toowoomba Terminal is the start of our plans to deliver [decarbonisation] benefits and meet the aviation sector’s growing demand through flexible, efficient and scalable SAF blending,” said Matt Doyle, CEO of Wagner Sustainable Fuels, in a statement on Wednesday.

“With the support from Boeing, we’re focused on bringing large scale SAF and renewable diesel production to Australia and integrating it into the global supply chain through the Brisbane Recycling and SAF Facility, which is currently under planning and development.”

SAF is made from oil derived from renewable sources, such as municipal solid waste, agricultural byproducts and vegetable oils. It has been identified as a way for the aviation industry to operate with lower greenhouse gas emissions.

Wagner said the facility makes use of FlyORO’s AlphaLite technology and support from aerospace company Boeing.

FlyORO’s website states that its machinery is housed in a 40-foot container, able to provide up to 2,160,000 litres of blended fuel per day, and can enable blends “of any single D7566 fuel with Jet A1” at up to a 50 per cent blend of SAF to jet fuel.

“Current global regulations permit commercial aircraft to use up to a 50/50 blend of SAF and fossil jet fuel. This will continue to rise as additional production pathways are certified,” added Boeing’s head of Asia Pacific Sustainability, Dr Kimberly Camrass.

“Wagner’s commercial blending terminal is a powerful step forward in aviation decarbonisation, boosting regional employment and opening new export markets. It will also provide important learnings to support the development of robust and scalable SAF supply chains within Australia.”

The announcement added Wagner has also become the nation’s first first RSB (Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials) certified SAF company.

Boeing announced in August last year that it had become an early investor in the sustainable aviation fuels division of the Wagner group, which also owns Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport.

The 2023 Boeing/CSIRO SAF Roadmap identified opportunities to develop a domestic SAF industry as well as the investment required in R&D to support emerging technologies. It predicted that jet fuel demand will grow by 75 per cent by 2050.

As reported by this title and others last year, Wagner, Boeing and others are partnered on a feasibility study on SAF production facility in Brisbane, with $760,000 support from the state government.

The Brisbane plant would use LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) process, converting ethanol from waste-based feedstocks, and with a planned capacity of 102 million litres of SAF and 12 million litres of renewable diesel per year.

Additionally, Wagner Sustainable Fuels has achieved another milestone by becoming Australia’s first Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) certified SAF company.
“This is a pivotal moment for sustainable aviation in Australia and demonstrates Wagner Sustainable Fuels’ commitment to addressing future challenges with solutions available today,” said Matt Doyle, CEO of Wagner Sustainable Fuels.
We are excited to partner with Wagner Sustainable Fuels and Boeing to lead the way in building a more sustainable aviation ecosystem in Australia.”","Wagner Sustainable Fuels has officially launched operations at Australia’s first dedicated Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending terminal, marking a significant step forward in the aviation and renewable energy sectors. In collaboration with Boeing [NYSE:BA] and technology partner FlyORO, the facility is set to play a key role in advancing sustainable aviation in the region.

The terminal, powered by FlyORO’s proprietary patented technology, is not only a first for Australia, but also the world’s first SAF blending terminal located at an airport. Its modular design allows it to scale with rising demand, making it replicable as the SAF industry continues to grow in Australia and across the Asia Pacific.

Additionally, Wagner Sustainable Fuels has achieved another milestone by becoming Australia’s first Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) certified SAF company. This certification ensures that customers benefit from a robust accounting process that guarantees SAF authenticity and chain-of-custody transparency.

“This is a pivotal moment for sustainable aviation in Australia and demonstrates Wagner Sustainable Fuels’ commitment to addressing future challenges with solutions available today,” said Matt Doyle, CEO of Wagner Sustainable Fuels. “The opening of the Toowoomba Terminal marks the beginning of our plans to deliver decarbonization benefits and meet the aviation sector’s increasing demand with flexible, efficient, and scalable SAF blending.”

Doyle added, “With support from Boeing, we’re focused on large-scale SAF and renewable diesel production in Australia, which will be integrated into the global supply chain through the Brisbane Recycling and SAF Facility, currently in the planning phase.”

Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or non-fossil fuel sources such as municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, animal fats, and vegetable oils. It significantly lowers carbon emissions throughout the fuel’s lifecycle, making it a more sustainable option for powering aircraft.

SAF blending involves mixing “neat” SAF with conventional fossil jet fuel, which, after testing and certification, becomes a drop-in aviation fuel that is compatible with current airport and aircraft infrastructure.

“Current global regulations allow commercial aircraft to use up to a 50/50 blend of SAF and fossil jet fuel, with this percentage set to increase as additional production pathways are approved,” said Dr. Kimberly Camrass, Boeing’s Head of Asia Pacific Sustainability.

Dr. Camrass further noted, “Wagner’s commercial blending terminal is a major step forward in the decarbonization of aviation, creating regional job opportunities and opening new export markets. It will also provide valuable insights to help build a resilient and scalable SAF supply chain in Australia.”

The Boeing-CSIRO SAF Roadmap forecasts a 75% increase in jet fuel demand in Australia by 2050. To meet this demand, Wagner Sustainable Fuels has partnered with FlyORO to deploy advanced SAF blending technologies for commercial, general aviation, and defense sectors in Australia.

“FlyORO’s modular SAF blending system, AlphaLite, doesn’t just reduce emissions – it creates a scalable platform for collaboration, co-investment, and transparency across the fuel value chain,” said Jonathan Yeo, CEO of FlyORO. “This integrated model supports our broader deployment strategy, which includes standalone facilities like the one operating in Singapore.”

Yeo added, “This is how we unlock speed and scale in the SAF sector. We are excited to partner with Wagner Sustainable Fuels and Boeing to lead the way in building a more sustainable aviation ecosystem in Australia.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Aircraft-refueling-at-Wellcamp-Airport-Toowoomba-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 03:57:02.839780

According to Dr Kimberly Camrass, Boeing’s head of Asia Pacific Sustainability, the new plant is a step towards fulfilling the 2023 Boeing/CSIRO SAF Roadmap, which identified Australia as being in a “prime position” to develop a domestic SAF industry and predicted a 75 per cent increase in jet fuel demand in Australia by 2050.

“Current global regulations permit commercial aircraft to use up to a 50/50 blend of SAF and fossil jet fuel. This will continue to rise as additional production pathways are certified,” she said.

“Wagner’s commercial blending terminal is a powerful step forward in aviation decarbonisation, boosting regional employment and opening new export markets.

“It will also provide important learnings to support the development of robust and scalable SAF supply chains within Australia.”

The news comes as Wagner is also partnering with Boeing to build what it says is Australia’s first fully integrated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in Brisbane.

The project last year secured $760,000 in Queensland government funding, and aims to start construction in 2026. It will use LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology to create ethanol-based fuel, with the expectation of 102 million litres of SAF per year.

Wagner says the SAF produced at its Brisbane facility will “integrate seamlessly with existing airline infrastructure and meet rigorous fuel standards”.

Still, global adoption of the green fuel remains minuscule, with SAF poised to make up 0.7% of aviation fuel this year, while air travel is expected to climb 6%, driving emissions higher.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2025/06/20250621141310_Flight.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 03:57:34.222280

In case you missed it, among the important takeaways, here are four of interest: 1.
RFS blending volumes send strong signal for 2026 and 2027, but small refinery exemption (SRE) reallocation questions remain.
Sioux Falls’ homefield advantage.
This was the first conference we have hosted in Sioux Falls in more than 20 years, and based on the overwhelming positive feedback we received from attendees, rest assured, Sioux Falls will become part of our regular rotation for conference sites.","Earlier this year, ACE members and friends gathered for our annual conference in Sioux Falls. It was an outstanding event in a new venue covering many topics and providing meaningful networking opportunities. In case you missed it, among the important takeaways, here are four of interest:

1. E15 legislation is a top priority in Congress. We have put great effort into the bipartisan bill to allow retailers to sell E15 year-round in all parts of the country, and Congress seems to have finally gotten the memo, which means the grassroots advocacy we have mobilized is paying off. During his keynote, Congressman Dusty Johnson (R-SD) thanked ACE for our advocacy and said there is “more than a 70% likelihood” this legislation will pass. We like those odds but implore you to keep Congress’s feet to the fire by using our online Action Center to send messages and make calls! There is also increasing pressure on Congress and the Trump administration to provide emergency financial aid to help farmers facing uncertain export markets, low prices, large crop surpluses and high input costs. What cannot be lost in this discussion is E15 year-round provides a market-based, long-term solution to increase domestic demand for corn, so we must finally get E15 legislation over the finish line in 2025.

2. 45Z buzz is real, yet clarity is needed. A big thank you is owed to the outstanding panel of experts from RSM, Christianson, and Mickelson & Company who provided valuable insight on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit during our conference. These companies explained the changes Congress made to 45Z and helped our ethanol companies make plans to maximize returns on investment. Hallway discussions during our event were almost entirely about 45Z. While there is significant enthusiasm, we still do not have final guidance for the credit, Treasury has said they do not expect to put out a proposed rulemaking until next year, and there’s no clarity on whether low-carbon farming practices can be used to help monetize 45Z. Therefore, we must remain vigilant in urging Treasury to speed up the proposed rulemaking and final guidance, and keep working to ensure low-carbon farming practices can be monetized through 45Z. This remains a top priority for ACE.

3. RFS blending volumes send strong signal for 2026 and 2027, but small refinery exemption (SRE) reallocation questions remain. The original RFS was signed into law 20 years ago and, despite some mismanagement from various administrations, it remains a bedrock for ensuring ethanol production and use in the U.S. The Trump administration deserves credit for proposing strong blending volumes for the 2026 and 2027 calendar years, including a minimum of 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuel and big increases for advanced biofuel and biomass-based diesel—which will help ensure excess supplies of these renewable fuels do not displace opportunities for E15, E30 and E85.

Despite strong RFS blending targets, questions linger about SREs. EPA is trying to follow caselaw from prior SRE litigation to work through a significant backlog of SRE petitions and decide whether exempt gallons will be reallocated to future years. The first Trump EPA allowed dozens of SREs without reallocating those blending volumes to other refiners, which caused RIN values to fall and reduced the incentive to blend E15 and E85. This time around, they are proposing to reallocate most or all of the SREs to future RFS blending targets, which is a very positive sign, but final decisions about the new approach to SREs and reallocation have not been made.

4. Sioux Falls’ homefield advantage. This was the first conference we have hosted in Sioux Falls in more than 20 years, and based on the overwhelming positive feedback we received from attendees, rest assured, Sioux Falls will become part of our regular rotation for conference sites.

Summit has been working for several years to develop a CO2 pipeline project that would span areas in South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and North Dakota, capturing CO2 produced at dozen’s of partnering ethanol plants and transporting it to North Dakota for secure geologic sequestration.
That facility, known as Gevo North Dakota, has an operational CCS capabilities onsite.
Documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate Gevo and the DOE LPO are now considering altering the conditional commitment to support the proposed North Dakota SAF project.
“The conditional commitment will remain effective during the extension period in order to allow for modifications which satisfy the DOE LPO.","Gevo Inc. on Oct. 14 announced the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office has granted the company an extension of the conditional commitment for the $1.46 loan guarantee for its proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project.

Gevo in October 2024 received a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee with disbursements totaling $1.46 billion (excluding capitalized interest during construction) from the DOE for its proposed Net-Zero 1 project (NZ1) in South Dakota.

The proposed NZ1 project is an alcohol-to-jet biorefinery located near Preston, South Dakota, that was expected to produce 60 MMgy of SAF. During a second quarter earnings call held in August, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber said the NZ1 project is “plugging along, albeit slowly.” The development timeline for the project has been impacted by delays associated with Summit Carbon Solution’s proposed carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) project.

Summit has been working for several years to develop a CO2 pipeline project that would span areas in South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and North Dakota, capturing CO2 produced at dozen’s of partnering ethanol plants and transporting it to North Dakota for secure geologic sequestration. Gevo’s NZ1 facility is among the facilities slated to be connected to the CCS system.

Development of the CCS project has been delayed by legal and permitting difficulties, including state-level legislation preventing the project from utilizing eminent domain to secure the pipeline route.

In South Dakota, Gov. Larry Rhoden in March signed a bill that aims to prevent the use of eminent domain for the development of CO2 pipelines, specifically targeting Summit’s proposed project. The following month, state’s Public Utilities Commission denied Summit’s pipeline application. Summit has signaled its intent to refile.

During Gevo’s second quarter earnings call, Gruber noted the company was continuing to work with the DOE and customers regarding the development of NZ1 and is waiting to see what happens with the Summit pipeline. In the meantime, Gruber said Gevo was shifting its resources and prioritizing the development of a 30 MMgy ethanol-to-jet project at its recently acquired corn ethanol plant in North Dakota. That facility, known as Gevo North Dakota, has an operational CCS capabilities onsite. Documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicate Gevo and the DOE LPO are now considering altering the conditional commitment to support the proposed North Dakota SAF project.

In an Oct. 14 filing made with the SEC Gevo said it received a letter from the DOE LPO on Oct. 8 granting an extension of the conditional commitment until April 16, 2026. “The extension allows the company and DOE LPO to evaluate potential modifications to the project scope under the conditional commitment in order to address energy policies and priorities,” the company said in the SEC filing. “The conditional commitment will remain effective during the extension period in order to allow for modifications which satisfy the DOE LPO. The potential scope modifications include the construction of a lower cost 30 million gallon per year jet fuel production facility (ATJ-30) to develop jet fuel production at the company's existing ethanol and carbon capture utilization and storage facility in North Dakota and the optimal use of captured carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biomassmagazine/posts/web/2017/11/GevoLogo_15101793359557.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 20:56:51.363746

The founder, Wade Black is an industry veteran with experience in both commercial and private aviation.","With a vision to transform business aviation, Magnifica Air was launched at the National Business Aviation Association Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) in Las Vegas.

The airline will begin operations in 2027 with a fleet of Airbus A220-300 and A321neo aircraft, completed in partnership with Comlux and delivered through Air Lease Corp.

Wade Black, a veteran in aviation, real estate, and luxury travel, will lead the airline as the chief executive alongside another seasoned aviation professional Sean McGeough who will be the airline’s chief development officer.

Talking to Corporate Jet Investor at the NBAA-BACE, McGeough elaborated the core concept behind Magnifica Air: “There’s a big white space between flying first and flying private, and we’re right in the middle. We’re going to redefine the category – we call it private class. It’ll be all the benefits of flying private: amazing cabins, concierge service, everything from black cars to great meals on board. It’ll be a privilege to fly again as opposed to a nuisance.”

“Magnifica Air is pioneering a new space between private aviation and first-class commercial travel,” added Wade Black, CEO. “We combine the privacy and intimacy of a private jet with the cultural relevance and operational scope of a world-class airline. This is more than transportation—it’s a movement, redefining how discerning guests experience the skies.”

Black said the airline will be carbon-neutral at launch in 2027, with over 7m gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) integrated annually into East Coast operations.

The airline is further exploring hybrid-electric aircraft for the future. “We don’t think of wellness or sustainability as add-ons,” added Black. “They are built into every layer of the Magnifica Air experience.”

On timing and market conditions, McGeough emphasised: “This is the time to start this airline. Businesses do well when they’re properly capitalised and when the opportunity presents itself right.”

Based in Florida, the airline will operate with 6–7 daily departures, connecting to Miami, New York, Los Angeles, Bay Area, Dallas, and Houston, with seasonal routes to Napa Valley and the Caribbean.

The founder, Wade Black is an industry veteran with experience in both commercial and private aviation.

The test flight was carried out using a production-model HondaJet fueled with a blend of HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) and HDO-SAK (Hydrodeoxygenated Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene). The aircraft took off and flew over the Greensboro area in North Carolina before safely landing at the company’s headquarters located at Piedmont Triad International Airport.

This flight represents the culmination of several years of engineering development by the Honda Aircraft Company team in cooperation with GE Honda Aero, a joint venture between General Electric and Honda responsible for the design of the HF120 engine that powers the HondaJet. The engines are produced by Honda Aero in Burlington, North Carolina.

While HondaJet aircraft in service have already operated on approved SAF blends of up to 50%, this latest achievement confirms full compatibility of the HF120 engine and the aircraft’s design with 100% SAF. GE Honda Aero previously conducted successful ground engine tests using the same fuels in 2022 and 2023, paving the way for this historic flight.

“We are extremely proud of our engineering team for proving that the HondaJet can operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel. This flight underscores our commitment to the future of sustainable aviation and marks another step toward Honda’s global goal of achieving carbon neutrality across all operations by 2050,” said Amod Kelkar, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of Honda Aircraft Company.

For a decade, the HondaJet has maintained its status as the most fuel-efficient aircraft in its class, thanks to its advanced aerodynamic design that preserves laminar airflow over the wing and fuselage, resulting in up to 20% better fuel efficiency compared to competitors. In October 2024, the company received the Sustainable Flight Department Accreditation from the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA).

The Massachusetts Port Authority proposal, which has faced years of opposition, would expand the Lawrence G. Hanscom Field located between Bedford, Lexington and Concord by adding 17 new hangars. The publicly-owned airfield holds the most private jets in New England, and an October 2023 report found private jets from the field accounted for an estimated 106,676 tons of carbon emissions over an 18-month period.

Activists on Tuesday aired concerns about increased carbon emissions from private jets that serve the wealthy. They drew attention to a Massachusetts Sustainable Aviation Fuel Workgroup report, which recommended that the state advance the implementation of SAF, a type of jet fuel made from renewable sources.

The working group report suggests that SAF has “the potential to dramatically reduce life cycle aviation emissions … and avoid indirect impacts on forests and croplands.” It also recommends creating a Massachusetts and New England Regional SAF Hub “to secure buy-in from key stakeholders, facilitate information sharing, and identify priority short- and long-term initiatives that build SAF momentum.”

But a new report from the D.C.-based think tank Institute for Policy Studies claims that utilizing SAF in this project or others will not help Massachusetts reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is not a “feasible” way to reduce emissions at scale.

“SAF won’t help the Commonwealth reduce emissions. Period. It will not scale at the pace of climate change. It is a diversion of money and attention in this moment,” Chuck Collins, co-author of the think tank’s report, said Tuesday.

“Hypothetical future use of SAF should not serve as a green light for expanding aviation. We find that SAF solutions provide minimal or negative greenhouse gas reductions,” the report says. It calls studying SAF “logical” but suggests “proposals to drive production or consumption of SAF through economic policy or subsidies do not make financial sense, as SAF currently and for the foreseeable future increases GHG emissions.”

Massport maintains that the renewable fuel “represents one of the most immediate and effective tools available today to reduce aviation’s climate impact and enable emission reductions without compromising reliability or safety.”

The agency is “committed to reducing aviation-related emissions and promoting more sustainable practices across all our facilities, including Hanscom Field,” Massport said in a statement to the News Service. “We understand there are a range of opinions, and we’re committed to continuing the conversation with our neighbors to find the right balance between environmental goals, airport operations, and economic growth.”

Lincoln resident Alex Chatfield criticized the focus on SAF in the midst of opposition to the Hanscom project.

“If Massport thinks that we will be distracted by the supposedly bright, shiny object of SAFs and accept the North Airfield project, because someday, a few decades from now, some highly expensive and still environmentally damaging but differently produced fuel is being sold there, they have badly underestimated our determination to stop this project,” Chatfield said.

Secretary of Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper in 2024 rejected a draft environmental impact report filed by Runway Realty Ventures and North Airfield Ventures to expand the Hanscom airfield. The developers are expected to submit a supplemental draft environmental impact report to address environmental and community impacts and concerns by the end of the year, Chatfield said.

“There is no way you can put in a whole bunch of essentially garages for private jets and still claim ever again, at least in the living memory of those of us in the room, to be concerned about climate. This is it. This is the inflection point for Massport,” Sen. Michael Barrett said during a State House briefing.

“The same in some ways is true for the Legislature and executive branch, also. It is going to be very, very difficult for your elected officials to make the case that we prioritize fighting climate [change] if this particular deal goes down,” Barrett continued.

Activists on Tuesday delivered another letter to Healey calling on her to put a stop to the project, after conservation and historic preservation groups delivered a different letter and petition to her in April.

Barrett recalled the decision of former Gov. Frank Sargent in the 1970s to reject the Inner Belt project, which Barrett said would have decimated neighborhoods in Somerville, Cambridge and Boston.

“Sargent took a look at that seeming inevitability and said, ‘Not on my watch – that is a bad decision. I’m thinking about the future, and I can see that this would get it wrong,'” Barrett said. “So we’re asking our current governor, who’s done so much good work on other issues, to appreciate that there is a precedent for her saying just, ‘No, not on my watch.'”

A petition created by the Stop Private Jet Expansion at Hanscom or Anywhere group, which calls on Healey to stop the expansion plans, has more than 14,500 signatures.

“It’s a matter of political will,” Rep. Carmine Gentile said. “Massachusetts has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. How can we take that goal seriously if we greenlight projects like this? We can’t,” Gentile said. “How can we tell working families to switch to electric cars, to insulate their homes, take the T while letting the ultra rich burn jet fuel to [take] quick flights to the Caribbean? That would be a moral failure.”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Barrett-Michael-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 18:56:42.909689

The Avioxx team joined more than 450,000 attendees in Lisbon this month for the World Aviation Festival 2026, one of the leading global events for aviation and innovation. The three-day gathering brought together sustainability directors, policymakers, and pioneering technology start-ups focused on AI-driven waste and fuel solutions.

A Focus on Sustainability and Innovation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and decarbonisation dominated the agenda throughout the festival. From keynote sessions to fireside discussions, industry leaders explored how aviation can meet rising demand for air travel while achieving Net Zero targets.

Glenn Morgan, Chief Technology Officer at IAG, reinforced the airline group’s commitment to decarbonising aviation and scaling sustainable fuel adoption, urging the sector to move from ambition to action.

Faith Taylor, Global Sustainability and Social Impact Officer at Kyndryl, delivered a resonant message:

“If we build with vision, integrity and sustainability in mind, we will reach Net Zero goals.”

She emphasised the critical role of renewable fuels such as SAF in making the sustainability transition both achievable and enduring.

Financing and Scaling Real Sustainability

Avioxx attended the panel discussion “How are we financing and scaling real, measurable sustainability in aviation right now?” where Nichola Bates, founder of XeleratedFifty, spoke about innovative funding models needed to connect legacy systems with the emerging green economy. She stressed that progress will depend on collaboration across industries rather than any single solution.

At Avioxx, innovation is at the core of this mission. The company’s patented waste-to-fuel technology provides a tangible solution to the challenge of SAF availability, helping aviation meet Net Zero mandates.

Lukas Kaestner, Chief Development Officer at ZAL, reminded attendees of the sector’s resilience and ingenuity:

“We have always been an industry that succeeds in making the impossible possible.”

That sentiment aligns with Avioxx’s vision. By producing aircraft fuel from non-recyclable waste, the company addresses global waste management challenges while cutting carbon emissions.

Scaling SAF for Net Zero

During the session “Scaling SAF and Practical Decarbonisation Strategies for Net Zero”, Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Officer at IAG, noted that while SAF supply could meet demand, production costs which are currently around three times higher than fossil jet fuel, remain a major barrier to widespread use.

Avioxx is tackling this head-on. Its ultra-clean SAF burns efficiently without creating contrails and performs on par with, or better than, traditional jet fuel. When produced at scale, it becomes cost-comparable with fossil alternatives. Fully renewable and sustainably sourced, Avioxx SAF has the potential to replace fossil fuels entirely.

As Dick Benschop, Chair of the Mission Possible Partnership, observed:

“Who knows that every flight they are sitting on already includes 2% SAF? It’s happening, but people seem unaware.”

Avioxx shares this conviction. Greater public awareness and transparency are essential to accelerating the transition to sustainable aviation. The change is already underway, and Avioxx’s technology is helping to make it possible.

Avioxx’s Role in a Cleaner, Circular Future

Avioxx’s waste-to-molecule technology not only produces cleaner, more efficient jet fuel but also diverts significant volumes of waste from landfill and incineration. By turning waste into value, the company supports the UK and global aviation industries in progressing towards Net Zero.

With SAF mandates coming into force and penalties for non-compliance on the horizon, now is the time to invest and scale.

The Avioxx 32,000 TPA SAF Plant

To meet growing demand, Avioxx has unveiled plans for its 32,000 tonne-per-year SAF plant, the company’s largest to date. Once operational, it will divert more than 300,000 tonnes of waste annually from landfill and incineration, converting it into sustainable jet fuel to power the next generation of low-carbon flights.

With strong airline partnerships, cutting-edge technology, and a clear strategy for growth, Avioxx is demonstrating that the transition to sustainable aviation is not only achievable but already happening.

October 9, 2025

Check against delivery

Good morning everyone.

Let me begin by thanking the NATO Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence for hosting us here in Montreal and inviting me to speak.

Thanks also to CDAI for co-hosting this wonderful event.

I’m so sorry to not be able to join you in person, but it’s a great privilege to be able address you virtually this morning.

The work that you do —your research, and your leadership in addressing the defence and security impact on climate change – has never been more important.

I am just shy of six months as Canada’s Minister of National Defence, just under a year serving as a cabinet Minister and just over 21 years serving as a Member of Parliament.

But before all of that – I spent years working on sustainability and climate change around the world, and previously served as President of Canada’s National Round Table on the Economy and the Environment.

So in a sense, today is an intersection of the last 40 years of my life – where national security meets natural security.

As Minister of National Defence, I know it is critical that we deter the effects of climate change to support operational readiness of the Canadian Armed Forces, community needs, and, by extension, our national security.

This can save lives, and deter an adversary who wishes to harm us.

When it comes to nature and the systems that sustain us — our wetlands, our waterways, pollination — there is no substitute.

Our security and our prosperity are fully dependent on a healthy and functioning environment — think of it as a three-legged stool that must be kept in balance.

And that balance is, lately, getting harder to achieve.

Our international system based on shared rules and norms is under strain.

War rages in Ukraine, instability persists throughout the Middle East, and tensions are simmering in the Indo-Pacific.

And our adversaries are active across a multitude of domains — cyber, space, quantum, artificial intelligence and the information space, too.

Every day there are new reports of Russian incursions into NATO airspace and of our approaches being tested.

At the same time, China is displaying increasingly aggressive behaviour toward its neighbours, as well as toward other countries with a presence in the Indo-Pacific, including Canada.

Amplifying all of these challenges right now is climate change — a threat multiplier that’s driving insecurity across the globe.

Against this backdrop, Canada and its Allies need to ensure our militaries are resilient and ready.

This means future-proofing our military by adapting to climate change and mitigating its impacts on our operations.

It also means working to ensure our actions don’t make it worse.

The changing climate has profound implications for National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces.

It poses a threat to all Canadians, especially Indigenous and Northern communities, and for our Allies.

It directly affects how our countries train, equip, deploy and operate. And nowhere is that clearer than in energy.

Fuels and energy are the lifeblood of any military.

Without secure supply chains at risk from climate disruption, fleets cannot move, bases cannot function, and operations cannot be sustained.

That’s why climate resilience isn’t just environmental policy — it’s operational policy.

It’s force readiness.

And it’s national security strategy, too.

At National Defence, we have already begun to integrate climate risk into our planning and operations.

In 2024, we completed a Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment across our real property footprint.

The results were sobering: 64% of our assets are at a high climate risk, especially in our coastal and northern regions.

That’s why we’re strengthening energy resilience in our bases and infrastructure, ensuring that new construction accounts for sea-level rise, flooding and permafrost thaw.

National Defence is the largest federal emitter of greenhouse gases, and we recognize that achieving our targets will be crucial in order for our government to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

Already, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by 38% since 2005.

DND is implementing measures to reduce emissions in its real property portfolio.

To do so, we are using energy performance contracts, purchasing clean energy, modernizing heating systems, decommissioning old buildings, and improving our energy management approach.

For nearly two decades, we’ve been working on research into alternative fuels.

Today, we are pursuing low-carbon fuels that meet military requirements — fuels that will help secure our military fuel supply chain, strengthen interoperability with our Allies, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our primary military fleets.

For example, the Royal Canadian Air Force has a net-zero plan for its air platforms — and sustainable aviation fuel is at the heart of that plan.

Until then, we are preparing our fleets for the day when sustainable fuels will become the norm. And we will get there.

And, as the framework nation for the NATO Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence, Canada is proudly hosting this key venue right here in Montreal.

Here, Allies and partners can share expertise, develop best practices, and strengthen our ability to confront the security impacts of climate change.

All this work shows that we are indeed capable of adapting and mitigating.

That we can future-proof ourselves as strategically as possible.

But adaptation and mitigation alone are not enough.

If we stop here, we are only treating the symptoms.

To truly safeguard Canada’s future, all our futures, it’s time to stop the fiction that

our planet’s carrying capacity is unlimited.

That we are not seeing stressors, that species aren’t being depleted and rendered extinct, that we’re not compromising the plant’s ability to restore itself.

Because when it comes to nature, there is no substitute.

Natural capital provides essential services — clean air, fresh water, fertile soils, flood control, climate regulation, pollination — without which, our life on this planet is impossible.

This natural capital also provides valuable products — medicines like penicillin and codeine, and technologies inspired by the natural world, like Velcro from burrs, and aircraft from bird flight.

By not protecting this critical wealth of natural capacity and the potential it promises, we run the risk of degrading or depleting altogether solutions to the defence and medical challenges of the future.

We cannot manage and sustain this critical resource, nature, if we don’t know how to measure it. Or even know how much of it we have.

We have a geological survey in Canada – but no biological survey.

There are encouraging developments: for example, Canada’s Water Agency is creating a new national water security strategy.

Yet here in Canada, we still don’t have a national survey or measure for our natural capital.

What is pollination worth to food sovereignty?

What is watershed integrity worth to clean water?

If we don’t answer these questions, we leave blind spots in our security planning.

And that is why the work we do here — to integrate climate, economy and security — must also integrate the environment.

In defence, innovation has always been about staying one step ahead of our adversaries.

Today, that increasingly means drawing lessons from the oldest and wisest systems of all: nature’s own designs.

Harnessing nature’s solutions is not just science — it’s strategy.

It’s how we keep our forces interoperable, resilient and effective in the future fight.

Bioprospecting and biomimicry aren’t just fancy buzzwords.

These are the next level of strategic advantage.

And nations that preserve their biodiversity and draw from their design will have decisive options.

We don’t have to look very far to see that artificial intelligence is accelerating this process.

It’s allowing us to design new materials and systems at speeds we never imagined:

think of wildfire suppression technology using satellites, AI, and a fleet of specialized drones.

We are already deploying some nature-based innovations in the form of scalable, dual-use infrastructure with natural or engineered features.

Everything from wetlands to reefs and barrier beaches that mimic ecological processes designed to reduce the risk of coastal flooding and erosion, while supporting biodiversity and local communities.

In fact, much of our economic activity is already financed by the “DNA Bank of Nature” — 500 million years of evolution, on deposit.

But you can’t manage what you don’t measure.

Nowhere is this issue more evident than in our Arctic.

Canada’s sovereignty and security in the region are non-negotiable.

And yet they are under increasing threat.

An Arctic warming at four times the global average means more access — and more interest—from competitors and adversaries alike.

That has significant security and sovereignty implications for Canada.

But defending the Arctic mustn’t come at the expense of the very environment we’re trying to protect.

Our Arctic ecosystems are fragile.

Sea ice is melting, making the North more navigable and vulnerable to intrusion.

Permafrost is thawing, threatening communities and critical infrastructure.

Ocean coastline is exposed for longer and eroding faster, placing at risk communities, cultural heritage and wildlife habitats.

If we treat the Arctic as a disposable resource, we risk undermining the very foundations of Canadian sovereignty.

This sovereignty relies on strengthening partnerships and effective management with territorial and municipal governments, Indigenous and northern communities and organizations, as well as other partners and stakeholders.

That’s why we need to think of this country’s natural capital like we do a retirement pension: we want to live off the interest and sustain the capital, not deplete it.

We need to balance development, national security and ecological integrity.

Have strength through sustainability.

Protect nature as a form of deterrence.

In military strategy, deterrence is about preventing harm before it happens.

We build credible defences not because we want to use them, but to avoid the devastating costs of conflict.

The same principle must apply to climate security.

Protecting and reinvesting in nature is a form of deterrence.

Where natural ecosystems are under strain, displacement and conflict are inevitable.

Water scarcity is already wreaking havoc along the Yellow River in China, Asia’s second-longest river; and it’s driving tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia along the Blue Nile.

Climate disasters alone displaced some 800,000 people in 2023, and some experts now predict up to 1.2 billion so-called climate refugees by 2050, those displaced by climate change and natural disasters.

In 2023, Canada saw 192,000 people internally displaced due to climate disasters like wildfires. This is the highest number ever recorded.

This puts a strain on the operational capability of the Canadian Armed Forces, which are increasingly called upon to respond to natural disasters as a force of last resort.

We are fortunate to have the necessary resources to respond, keep people safe, and protect critical infrastructure.

But this isn’t always the case in other parts of the world.

Disaster and ecological collapse fuel instability, as surely as an aggressor crossing a border.

That’s why I believe measuring our natural capital and protecting natural systems is also about preventing loss of life on a massive scale.

This is neither theoretical nor abstract for me.

In the 1980s, I was stationed for two years with the United Nations in Côte d’Ivoire.

In the nearby Sahel Region, I got to see the effects of desertification and soil collapse firsthand.

In hindsight, one can see how thousands of young men with no hope for a better future might be drawn into the ranks of extremist groups that provide money, camaraderie and purpose.

Today, we have groups like Boko Haram terrorizing communities in northern Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad.

In this conflict zone alone, 60,000 people have already paid with their lives.

This lesson is clear: if we don’t slow or reverse the effects of climate change, the bill will be paid in ever-increasing human suffering and insecurity.

My friends, in the defence and security domain, we invest in preparedness because it saves lives.

We build credible deterrence because prevention is always less costly than conflict.

I believe the same logic must apply to climate and nature.

Investing and restoring in our ecosystems and natural capital is strategic preparedness.

It is national defence.

And it’s natural security.

In the end, something is only worth defending if we can ensure there will always be something left to defend.

So, I’ll say it again.

We can replace equipment, we can rebuild infrastructure, we can resupply our forces dealing with the next climate disaster.

But we can’t replace nature — there is no substitute.

Our national and natural security are inextricably linked.

Priester Aviation as a partner in its program that enables private jet flyers to offset aircraft emissions associated with climate change.

George J. Priester Aviation’s clients may opt in on their own to participate in the program.

Director of Marketing Madison Priester says, “We believe that leadership in aviation means not only providing exceptional service, but also being responsible stewards of our environment.”

She adds, “Partnering with 4AIR allows us to give our clients meaningful options to offset and reduce their emissions today, while we work toward a more sustainable future for private aviation through the advancement of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.”

Clients can opt in to reduce their carbon footprint from flight activity by using verified carbon offsets, with the option to support Sustainable Aviation Fuel coming in the near future.

Each carbon offset corresponds to a verified reduction or avoidance of one metric ton of carbon dioxide, supported by projects that meet strict criteria and standards.

As the most viable near-term solution to reducing aviation emissions, SAF reduces the lifecycle carbon footprint of aviation fuel by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel, thereby significantly reducing the sector’s direct emissions.

4AIR’s sustainability programs, specifically tailored for business aviation, allow users to support science-based, independently verified emissions-reduction projects worldwide.

The partnership with 4AIR extends across George J. Priester Aviation’s full range of services, including aircraft management, charter, and jet card programs.

This means that every client, whether they own, operate, or charter aircraft through the Priester family of companies, can take part in meaningful sustainability initiatives.

Participants can choose to offset the carbon impact of their flights or contribute to advancing SAF production, ensuring that responsible environmental stewardship is available to all types of private aviation users.

Oliver Wyman says the aerospace industry can take several actions to tackle its supply chain problems.","Supply chain issues could cost global airlines more than $11 billion in 2025, according to a joint study from consulting firm Oliver Wyman and the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The report – “Reviving the Commercial Aircraft Supply Chain” – notes that the projected costs derive from significant delays in the production of new aircraft and parts – with the commercial backlog reaching a record 17,000+ aircraft in 2024.

The slow pace of production traces to the industry’s current economic model, geopolitical instability, raw material shortages, and labor shortages, the report says.

“Airlines depend on a reliable supply chain to operate and grow their fleets efficiently. Now we have unprecedented waits for aircraft, engines, and parts and unpredictable delivery schedules,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general.

Source: Oliver Wyman analysis

Short supply of new planes means that airlines are keeping older models flying – leading to estimated costs of $11 billion in 2025. The primary factors are excess fuel costs from using older, less efficient craft ($4.2 billion); additional maintenance cost of using older craft ($2.6 billion); increased engine leasing cost from engines spending more time on the ground during maintenance ($2.6 billion); and surplus inventory holding costs from stocking more parts due to supply chain uncertainty ($1.4 billion).

Additionally, supply chain issues are preventing airlines from deploying a sufficient amount of vehicles to meet passenger demand. In 2024, passenger demand rose 10.4% while capacity expansion was only 8.7% – and the rising passenger demand trend is expected to continue in 2025.

Oliver Wyman says the aerospace industry can take several actions to tackle its supply chain problems. These actions include supporting maintenance, repair, and operations (MROs) firms to be less dependent on OEM-driven commercial licensing models; enhancing supply chain visibility to spot risks early and reduce bottlenecks; using data to drive predictive maintenance and create maintenance platforms for optimizing inventory; expanding repair and parts capacity to speed up repair approvals; and adopting advanced manufacturing to ease bottlenecks.

“There is no simple solution to resolving this problem, but there are several actions that could provide some relief,” Walsh said. “To start, opening the aftermarket would help by giving airlines greater choice and access to parts and services. In parallel, greater transparency on the state of the supply chain would give airlines the data they need to plan around blockages while helping OEMs to ease underlying bottlenecks.”",https://www.consulting.us/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-10-14-081113875-Supply_chain_issues_could_cost_airlines_more_than__11_billion_in_2025_spot.jpg?webp,N,,2025-10-14 18:56:50.923484

LONDON (Reuters) -Chief executives of Europe's airlines called for more European Union support to increase the supply of green jet fuel and improve subsidies for its creation.

The EU began requiring airlines to use more sustainable aviation fuel this year, with a 2% minimum blending mandate set to rise to 6% by 2030.

""We have mandates but we don't have sustainable aviation fuel,"" said Luis Gallego, CEO of IAG, at a press conference for trade group Airlines for Europe on Tuesday.

The group includes the CEOs of Ryanair, easyJet, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways-owner IAG.

The CEOs said they wanted more help from the European Commission in creating a functioning SAF market as well as higher subsidies to encourage the production of the fuel.

As it stands, SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel.

""If SAF was the same price as jet fuel, we wouldn't need mandates,"" said easyJet CEO Kenton Jarvis.

Textron Aviation has four Cessna Citation jets at the static display, including the Ascend, Longitude, Latitude and CJ4 Gen2.

A mock-up of the Citation CJ3 Gen 3 – development of which was announced at last year’s NBAA show, along with “Gen 3” variants of the M2 and CJ4 platforms – is also at the static display.

In the hall, Textron Aviation is presenting a half-shell interior mock-up of the CJ3 Gen3, which is positioned to enter service in 2027.

Most notable is the debut of Ascend, with an example of the mid-sized jet landing at Henderson Executive airport in the morning on 13 October.

Ascend’s certification is imminent, Textron Aviation chief executive Ron Draper says on 13 October, describing the end of the process as “this close”, holding up a small gap between his thumb and forefinger.

Draper adds that the US federal government shutdown is not holding up certification of the Ascend, which has logged some 1,000 test-flight hours. Textron Aviation is a “document or two” away from the finish line.

Cessna recently rolled the first production example of the Ascend off its line in Wichita. The jet is a refresh of the company’s “XL” line, with upgrades going well beyond surface level.

“The Citation Ascend will be all-new interior, all-new cockpit, and even the engines have had technology inserted into them,” Draper says. “We’re thrilled that this will be certified soon.”

Textron Aviation is hopeful that Ascend’s certification will come shortly after revealing on 13 October that it has secured FAA certification of the Citation CJ3 Gen 2 and M2 Gen 2.

Certification of the M2 Gen2 comes after Textron Aviation completed nearly 300 test-flight hours with the FAA. The light jet variant comes with Garmin’s Autothrottle system as a standard feature, providing protection from engine exceedance incidents and reducing pilot workloads.

The airframer says that the Autothrottle system “supports the most-delivered light-entry jet’s capabilities by optimising engine power, simpliflying flight-management and increasing overall operating efficiency”.

Textron Aviation put the CJ3 Gen2 – the larger of the two light jets – through about 445 test-flight hours prior to clearing the final certification hurdle. The variant also integrates Garmin’s Autothrottle and, incorporating customer feedback, provides a bit more legroom for pilots as part of ”enhancements throughout the aircraft”.

REGULATORY AND CERTIFICATION CHALLENGES

Civil aviation regulators in Europe and North America have made “positive movements” in recent months, but Draper would like to see aircraft certification become less time-consuming. He recalls the “deep freeze” on moving products through certification during the Covid-19 pandemic and notes that, relative to those lows, aircraft certification processes “are back moving again”.

For example, Textron Aviation recently received FAA certification for advanced features of the Garmin G5000 avionics suite, including a synthetic vision guidance system, improved connectivity and a taxiway routing feature.

But the manufacturer’s only in-certification clean-sheet aircraft, Beechcraft’s single-engined Denali, has faced repeated delays, with certification of GE Aerospace’s Catalyst turboprop engine holding up the process. GE Aerospace finally cleared that hurdle in February, providing Denali with both an engine and a certification pathway.

That aircraft will compete for market share mainly against the Pilatus PC-12, with Denali seating four passengers in an executive configuration and up to nine passengers in a commuter configuration.

Textron Aviation now expects to secure type certification of Denali in 2026.

“There are some cases where they still need to move faster, and they’re working on that,” Draper says. “Sometimes, that is a resource issue with EASA or the FAA, [where] they’re one or two experts deep in a particular area.”

However, regulators recognise areas where they are thin and are “heading in the right direction”, Draper says.

“The FAA, I know they’ve been bashed a lot the past five years,” he says. “We can throw rocks at them over specifics – why is this taking so long, or that taking so long? I do see them listening and trying to react, so that’s not keeping me up at night.”

Draper says Textron Aviation is weighing in on the rapid changes underway at EASA and the FAA, pointing specifically to the USA’s air traffic control overhaul.

“We’re lending our voice to that, as well as continuing to push for speed and common sense in certain aircraft certifications and bilateral agreements,” Draper adds. “How do we get the FAA and EASA and all the other regulatory bodies around the world, how do we get them honouring bilaterals?”

Currently, Textron Aviation faces headwinds from getting products certificated country by country, a years-long process that holds up the rollout of new aircraft platforms, such as the Cessna SkyCourier utility aircraft. Draper would like regulators to smooth out those processes.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/1/1/113211_ascend_985706.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:57:10.636355

While fuel suppliers are responsible for providing fuel with the progressively stronger blends of SAF at airports, airlines are obliged to purchase the available fuel for their operations.

Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said that oil suppliers selling SAF were able to ""extract additional profit from airlines by charging these compliance surcharges,"" adding that this should prompt European regulators to eliminate the mandates.

""They have, in effect, facilitated price gouging by fuel suppliers in the name of the environment, and that's completely unacceptable,"" Walsh said.

Walsh did not specify which airlines had been impacted or which fuel suppliers were involved in price hikes.

SAF costs on average three to five times more than regular jet fuel.

Industry association FuelsEurope said there had been a ""significant and consistent decline of average SAF prices,"" citing third-party pricing data from Argus Media.

Energy companies have said they are not seeing enough demand for SAF to justify ramping up production, which some executives say is weighing on prices rather than driving them up. Several have scaled back SAF refinery projects in recent years.

Walsh was speaking in an interview on a separate report by IATA setting out $11 B in extra costs in 2025 caused by congestion in other parts of the airline supply chain.

Oliver Wyman says the aerospace industry can take several actions to tackle its supply chain problems.","Supply chain issues could cost global airlines more than $11 billion in 2025, according to a joint study from consulting firm Oliver Wyman and the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The report – “Reviving the Commercial Aircraft Supply Chain” – notes that the projected costs derive from significant delays in the production of new aircraft and parts – with the commercial backlog reaching a record 17,000+ aircraft in 2024.

The slow pace of production traces to the industry’s current economic model, geopolitical instability, raw material shortages, and labor shortages, the report says.

“Airlines depend on a reliable supply chain to operate and grow their fleets efficiently. Now we have unprecedented waits for aircraft, engines, and parts and unpredictable delivery schedules,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general.

Source: Oliver Wyman analysis

Short supply of new planes means that airlines are keeping older models flying – leading to estimated costs of $11 billion in 2025. The primary factors are excess fuel costs from using older, less efficient craft ($4.2 billion); additional maintenance cost of using older craft ($2.6 billion); increased engine leasing cost from engines spending more time on the ground during maintenance ($2.6 billion); and surplus inventory holding costs from stocking more parts due to supply chain uncertainty ($1.4 billion).

Additionally, supply chain issues are preventing airlines from deploying a sufficient amount of vehicles to meet passenger demand. In 2024, passenger demand rose 10.4% while capacity expansion was only 8.7% – and the rising passenger demand trend is expected to continue in 2025.

Oliver Wyman says the aerospace industry can take several actions to tackle its supply chain problems. These actions include supporting maintenance, repair, and operations (MROs) firms to be less dependent on OEM-driven commercial licensing models; enhancing supply chain visibility to spot risks early and reduce bottlenecks; using data to drive predictive maintenance and create maintenance platforms for optimizing inventory; expanding repair and parts capacity to speed up repair approvals; and adopting advanced manufacturing to ease bottlenecks.

“There is no simple solution to resolving this problem, but there are several actions that could provide some relief,” Walsh said. “To start, opening the aftermarket would help by giving airlines greater choice and access to parts and services. In parallel, greater transparency on the state of the supply chain would give airlines the data they need to plan around blockages while helping OEMs to ease underlying bottlenecks.”",https://www.consulting.us/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-10-14-081113875-Supply_chain_issues_could_cost_airlines_more_than__11_billion_in_2025_spot.jpg?webp,N,,2025-10-14 16:57:20.536740

Responding, Ms Sun said the sustainable aviation fuel levy will be paid by different parties, including aircraft operators.
The amount of the green jet fuel levy that each end user has to pay will be displayed transparently, she said.
Conversely, simply mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel across the board would impose unpredictable and unsustainable costs on airlines and passengers, she added.","SINGAPORE – Singapore can now impose a fixed levy on all departing flights after Parliament passed a Bill on Oct 14 to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel by airlines.

Sustainable aviation fuel, mostly made from waste materials such as used cooking oil, has been deemed the

most practical way to decarbonise

the aviation industry as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without any costly modifications.

The Bill was passed unanimously.

Presenting the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill for debate, Senior Minister of State for Transport Sun Xueling said the proposed changes will allow the green jet fuel levy to be paid to the CAAS, which will set up a fund to procure and manage such fuel.

Noting that green jet fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel, she said Singapore has chosen a “pragmatic and balanced approach” in setting a target for sustainable aviation fuel to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi Airport and Seletar Airport in 2026.

Singapore will collect the funds needed to procure green jet fuel in an upfront manner through the levy.

Preliminary estimates from the CAAS

had suggested that economy-class passengers may incur an additional $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights, such as those to Bangkok, Tokyo and London, respectively.

MPs such as Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang West) and Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Changi GRC) asked about the impact of the levy, and reasons for passing the costs on to passengers through higher air ticket prices.

More specifically, Ms Poh asked why the cost burden is to be borne solely by consumers, instead of airlines.

Responding, Ms Sun said the sustainable aviation fuel levy will be paid by different parties, including aircraft operators. It is calculated based on the ultimate user of the air transport service, she added, so aircraft operators will be allowed to pass the levy on to end users such as passengers or shippers.

The amount of the green jet fuel levy that each end user has to pay will be displayed transparently, she said.

Certain flights will be exempted from the levy, such as those used for flight training and for charitable or humanitarian purposes, she added.

Addressing a question by Mr Yip Hon Weng (Yio Chu Kang), Ms Sun said passengers transiting or transferring through Singapore will not need to pay the sustainable aviation fuel levy.

She acknowledged that transit and transfer passengers are a critical part of air traffic through Changi Airport.

Although they do not start or end their journeys in Singapore, they enhance the nation’s connectivity by supporting a broader network of destinations and higher flight frequencies, she said.

Ms Sun added that the Government plans to ensure that Changi Airport remains competitive enough for these passengers to continue choosing to transit or transfer through Singapore, and hence will not impose the levy on them.

Several MPs, including Ms Gho Sze Kee (Mountbatten) and Mr Yip, asked about how the levy could potentially affect Changi Airport’s competitiveness as a global air hub.

Responding, Ms Sun said airlines and passengers fly through Changi Airport for various reasons, including safety, network and connectivity.

The Government will keep a close watch on Changi Airport’s charges and costs, she said, adding that it has calibrated its approach to adopting green jet fuel with “safeguards” to maintain the air hub’s competitiveness.

Ms Sun said the Government has consulted the industry and assessed that starting with a 1 per cent green jet fuel adoption target is “manageable”, and will not increase air ticket prices significantly.

Under this model, the total amount spent on sustainable aviation fuel each year will be pre-determined based on the usage target set and the projected cost of the fuel, she noted.

“We can decide how much cost we want to bear, and provide cost certainty for airlines and passengers,” said Ms Sun, who assured the MPs that Changi’s competitiveness would not be adversely impacted.

Conversely, simply mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel across the board would impose unpredictable and unsustainable costs on airlines and passengers, she added.

Responding to Mr Dennis Tan (Hougang) on possible greenwashing due to the use of certain feedstock in sustainable aviation fuel that may create external pollutants, Ms Sun said the green jet fuel procured will comply with the requirements set out by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

She added that the Economic Development Board has been in discussions with existing energy firms on retrofitting current refinery units, while research institutes are investing in technology that can advance biofuel production.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/588e03f28957c5ef712849602237c7fb65f937ca53b1072eb97bc9cb04a803fd,N,,2025-10-14 11:57:06.326922

The company filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida, 11th Circuit, last Thursday (October 9). Verijet, which had a fleet of single-engine Cirrus SF50 Vision Jets, ranked as the 13th-largest U.S. operator of charter and fractional flight hours at its peak in 2023, having only launched as a company three years prior.

He highlighted that expanding the number of countries exporting ethanol could help elevate it to a globally significant commodity, a goal that Brazil strongly supports.

“If there is surplus to export ethanol, it’s a good idea. I think that more countries exporting ethanol can make ethanol an important commodity throughout the world. And we want to promote ethanol as a world commodity. So for Brazil, it’s great news if this will happen,” he said in response to a question from ANI about India’s potential ethanol exports.

He emphasized the importance of promoting ethanol as a global commodity, encouraging more nations to participate in its trade. A commodity is typically a raw material that is traded globally, falling into categories such as hard commodities like crude oil and gold, and soft commodities like agricultural products such as wheat and coffee.

India and Brazil have been strengthening their collaboration in the bioenergy sector, particularly focusing on advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and meeting higher ethanol blending targets. Ambassador Haczynski da Nobrega noted that the partnership between the two countries has grown over the past few years as both align their clean energy goals.

“Our bilateral relations in terms of bioenergy have been booming now for some years,” he remarked during the 13th Bio-Energy Summit, which focused on “Fuelling India’s Green Revolution: Forging Global Partnerships.” He also pointed out that Brazil has been sharing its expertise on incorporating ethanol into gasoline mixtures and developing engines capable of running on 100% ethanol or various blends.

For the past five to six years, Brazil has actively contributed to India’s ethanol development, the Ambassador noted. He referenced the commitment made during Prime Minister Modi’s state visit to Brazil in July to further enhance this collaboration.

The Ambassador also discussed the role of the Global Biofuel Alliance (GBA), co-led by India and Brazil, in advocating for ethanol as a crucial solution for decarbonizing nations in the Global South. “The Global Biofuel Alliance is now the place where Brazil and India are not only strengthening and deepening their collaboration but also promoting ethanol as a solution to decarbonisation to the world,” he said.

India, which has already reached a 20% ethanol blend in its gasoline, is now working toward a 30% target. The Ambassador underlined that while specific deadlines are not set, both countries are making steady progress in bioenergy integration.

“We cannot talk about deadlines. We can talk about steady progress. As you have now reached 20 per cent mix of ethanol and gasoline, we are about to reach 30 per cent mix,” he added, noting India’s emerging focus on sustainable aviation fuel as well.

The two countries are also increasing their cooperation in other sectors such as energy, agriculture, defense, and pharmaceuticals. Brazil is particularly keen to learn from India’s successful implementation of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). “India has a very valuable experience in promoting DPIs in your country. So we want to learn from you,” said the Ambassador.

Brazil has also made strides in flex-fuel technology, which allows vehicles to run on any ethanol-gasoline blend. “The flex-fuel motor is the successful experience of Brazil in moving towards larger blends of ethanol and gasoline,” the Ambassador explained, adding that cars with flex-fuel engines face no technical limitations in using various ethanol blends.

The growing partnership between India and Brazil, especially through the Global Biofuel Alliance, is becoming an important driver of global decarbonization efforts. However, Tarun Sawhney, Chairman of the CII National Committee on Bioenergy, cautioned that the development of sustainable aviation fuel would require significant investment and time.

The summit also focused on the role of crops like sugar, rice, and maize in India’s ethanol program, which supports energy security and benefits farmers. Sawhney highlighted India’s achievement of a 20% ethanol blend, with plans to increase it to 27%, and the potential for flex-fuel vehicles running on E100 (100% ethanol).

Additionally, the Indian government recently approved the export of Second Generation (2G) ethanol. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) issued a notification on September 24 allowing the export of 2G ethanol, which is produced from non-food sources like bagasse, agricultural residues, and other renewable materials. This ethanol must meet specific sustainability criteria, including low CO2 emissions, and must be certified by relevant authorities before export.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ethanol-pump.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 10:57:09.518526

Unlike a mandate, Singapore’s approach is not affected by fluctuations in the price of such fuel; and unlike incentives, it does not require “large and recurring fiscal commitments, which are not fiscally sustainable for Singapore”, she said.

“It helps to encourage (sustainable aviation fuel) production through clear demand signals, while ensuring that costs remain contained, predictable and fairly shared,” she said in Parliament at the second reading of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) (Amendment) Bill.

Singapore has set a target for this fuel to form 1 per cent of fuel use by 2026. The Bill, passed on Tuesday, allows this previously announced policy to be implemented.

It provides for CAAS to enact a levy, and create a fund and central procurement mechanism for sustainable aviation fuel.

The 1 per cent figure was chosen as it will not increase air ticket prices significantly, yet sends a firm demand signal to the market to spur production and industry development, said Sun.

Avoiding volatility

The amount that the government will spend on sustainable aviation fuel each year is pre-determined, based on the 1 per cent target and the projected price premium of the fuel compared to conventional fuels. This required amount is then collected via the sustainable aviation fuel levy: a tax paid to CAAS for outbound passenger and cargo flights from 2026.

CAAS itself – or an entity established by the agency – will procure, manage and allocate sustainable aviation fuel and credits for it.

“This allows us to secure better commercial terms with fuel suppliers and ensures that the levy proceeds are used in an accountable and effective manner,” said Sun.

The levy quantum for each year will not change even if the actual sustainable aviation fuel premium differs from projections. Instead, the amount of such fuel to be procured will be adjusted accordingly.

Singapore chose to avoid sustainable aviation fuel mandates and incentives – adopted by the European Union and United States, respectively – because of their downsides, added Sun.

Due to price volatility, mandates create significant cost uncertainty for airlines and passengers. An example is the EU’s requirement for sustainable aviation fuel to form 2 per cent of jet fuel use by 2025, rising to 70 per cent by 2050.

This fuel is “a nascent product that is subject to high price volatility” and airlines cannot hedge its price, she said.

“Simply mandating (its use) would impose unpredictable and unsustainable costs on airlines and passengers as sustainable aviation fuel prices may vary significantly.”

Meanwhile, subsidies “require large and recurring fiscal commitments, which are not fiscally sustainable for Singapore”.

She cited federal and state-level incentives in the US that lower the cost of sustainable aviation fuel and encourage domestic production.

In response to clarification questions from Members of Parliament, Sun said that the levy quantum in 2026 is expected to be within previously announced levels: For economy class, S$3 for short-haul flights such as to Bangkok, S$6 for medium-haul flights such as to Tokyo, and S$16 for long-haul flights such as to London.

She added that there are no plans to include transit and transfer passengers under the levy, in order to ensure Changi’s competitiveness as an international air hub.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/e29a24b8cf27561dc5210f5a3bb41b2f8ed004ec986f8b283b628591a3f82252?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-10-14 08:56:11.916064

The TK-930 D-wax catalyst uses a specially designed zeolite that has been fine-tuned with many small improvements.
“From our previous experience with SAF production, we knew a dewaxing catalyst would be critical, because the production of SAF requires dewaxing renewable feedstocks,” Ignacio explains.
Since then, five other customers around the globe have chosen the TK-930 D-wax catalyst as an easier step into SAF production, demonstrating this catalysts potential to advance SAF production worldwide.","What if a single catalyst could open the door to the fast-growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market? Meet TK-930 D-wax™! This dewaxing catalyst is making it easy for refineries to take their first step into renewable fuels production – while also delivering significant advantages in conventional fuel production.

To help us unpack the chemistry and market impact, we teamed up with Ignacio Costa, Technology Licensing Manager and a chemical engineer with a well-rounded understanding of both the science and business of fuel production.

A dewaxing catalyst designed to keep our fuel fluid

A dewaxing catalyst is vital in the production of winter-grade diesel and in processing renewable feedstocks because it directly improves cold flow properties. By enhancing these properties, the fuel remains fluid and reliable even in cold conditions. Without an effective dewaxing catalyst like TK-930 D-wax, fuels can crystallize and clog filters, leading to operational issues.

TK-930 D-wax is a selective dewaxing catalyst, that was designed to improve cold flow properties and minimize yield loss during the production of both conventional fuels (such as ultra-low sulfur diesel) and renewable fuels. The result is safer and more reliable fuels for everyone – from truck drivers to airline passengers.

“Every time you dewax a fuel, you will lose some valuable yields. But in short, what is outstanding of TK-930 D-wax is that even under difficult operating conditions, it delivers great cold flow improvements with minimal yield loss!” says Ignacio.

Ignacio Costa, Technology Licensing Manager at Topsoe

Isomerization capabilities are key to minimal yield loss

When crude oil or renewable feedstocks are converted into fuels like jet fuel, their properties must be improved to ensure they flow well at low temperatures. This is done using a dewaxing catalyst. Dewaxing catalysts need to carefully balance two chemical reactions: cracking and isomerization. Cracking involves breaking large molecules into smaller ones (undesired) and isomerization involves rearranging molecules to improve flow (desired). Both reactions happen on special materials called zeolites, which have tiny acidic spots that help trigger these two important chemical reactions. The TK-930 D-wax catalyst uses a specially designed zeolite that has been fine-tuned with many small improvements. This help encourage more isomerization and reduces cracking, which makes the process more efficient.

Ignacio explains: “The TK-930’s strong isomerization capabilities are the key to its exceptional cold flow properties and minimal yield loss. As an isomerization catalyst, our R&D team has been able to produce a catalyst with the right balance of acidity and metal content, which enables it to deliver the necessary activity without compromising performance. This outstanding work from our team helps maximize fuel yield and minimize unwanted byproducts.”

Adding to its value in the production of both conventional and renewable fuels, the TK-930 D-wax also effectively supports the removal of unwanted substances like sulfur, nitrogen and aromatics using hydrogen (through hydrogenation.

Stepping into the world of co-processing

Considering its great potential, it was no surprise that after its introduction in 2018, the TK-930 D-wax catalyst quickly set a new benchmark and became a key ingredient in hydrotreating units for both conventional and renewable fuels production (including sustainable aviation fuel) with Topsoe HydroFlex™ technology.

With ongoing shifts in the market, co-processing for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production started emerging as an even more promising opportunity:

In 2018 the ASTM approved Annex 1.2.2.1 to D1655 allowing the co-processing of up to 5vol% triglycerides, free fatty acids and fatty acids ester in petroleum refineries to be blended into jet fuel.

The same year, the Renewable Energy Directive, the EU Commission announced mandates on SAF where blend of traditional fuels with bio-based fuels was allowed. Mandates on SAF started in 2025.

In 2023, the European Commission adopted a delegated act (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/996) which specified how to monitor, certify, and account for the share of biogenic carbon in fuels produced by co-processing.

But the right solution for co-processing renewable feedstocks to SAF still had to be found.

A tried, tested and proven solution for SAF production

The TK-930 D-wax quickly became a leading candidate when we started exploring different solutions for co-processing.

“From our previous experience with SAF production, we knew a dewaxing catalyst would be critical, because the production of SAF requires dewaxing renewable feedstocks,” Ignacio explains.

“When we tested the TK-930 D-wax catalyst as a potential solution, we were amazed by the results. The catalyst supported SAF production through co-processing extremely well. We perform co-processing for SAF pilot tests at kerosene hydrotreater conditions, a unit not originally designed for dewaxing. This means the catalyst operates under harsh conditions, but despite this it still performs exceptionally well.”

At the ERTC conference in November 2024, we presented our successful co-processing test results with the TK-930 D-wax catalyst in collaboration with TotalEnergies. Since then, five other customers around the globe have chosen the TK-930 D-wax catalyst as an easier step into SAF production, demonstrating this catalysts potential to advance SAF production worldwide.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/IML-00010210%20%282%29%201.png,N,,2025-10-14 11:57:29.329089

This is the case in Japan, where the GEnx engine family recently surpassed five million flight hours, marking a new partnership and performance milestone in the local aviation market.

“Reaching five million engine flight hours in Japan underscores the GEnx engine’s proven reliability and safety record, as well as the deep trust placed in GE Aerospace by our airline partners — including Japan Airlines (JAL), All Nippon Airlines (ANA), and Nippon Cargo Airlines (NCA),” said Katsuya Okano, general manager of North Asia and the Pacific for GE Aerospace’s Commercial Engines and Services business. “From the very first GEnx-powered flight by Japan Airlines to today’s growing fleets across multiple carriers, we’re honored to be part of Japan’s aviation story — and we’re just getting started.”

A Harbinger of Change and New Opportunities

The arrival of the GEnx engine in April 2004 represented a major step forward in propulsion technology.

Starting as a blank sheet design — incorporating advanced technologies and materials developed after the GE90 engine entered service — the GEnx engine used lightweight, durable materials and advanced design processes to reduce weight, enhance performance, and lower maintenance costs. Designed for the Boeing 787 and 747-8 airplanes, the GEnx engine delivers up to 15% fewer CO2 emissions and is 15% more fuel efficient than its predecessor, the CF6 engine.

These innovations attracted attention and helped the company secure orders from global airlines, including Japanese aviation players.

Welcome to Japan

JAL was among the first airlines to select the GEnx engine, announcing its decision in November 2005 to power its fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners. This continued a long-standing relationship with GE Aerospace, as JAL had previously operated engines including the CT7, CF34, CF6, and GE90.

Seven years later, on March 26, 2012, JAL took delivery of its first GEnx-1B-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner at a ceremony at the Future of Flight Aviation Center. It was the first GEnx-1B-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner to be delivered.

The plane’s maiden flight, a month later, on April 22, was notable for several firsts: the first revenue-generating flight of the GEnx-1B engine and the first nonstop Asia-to-Boston flight, from Tokyo’s Narita International Airport to Boston’s Logan International Airport.

“GE Aerospace has consistently been a trusted partner in our growth journey. As a launch airline for the GEnx engine, we have seen firsthand its high performance, reliability, and efficiency in action. With its demonstrated track record throughout the years, the GEnx engine will continue to support JAL in achieving our long-term goals,” said Kyohei Takizawa, vice president of procurement at Japan Airlines.

NCA was another GEnx early adopter. In 2005, it was one of the first cargo airlines to order GEnx-powered Boeing 747-8 freighters, placing a firm order for eight, with an option for six more.

“From the very beginning of our 747-8 freighter operations, the GEnx engine has delivered the performance and reliability essential for our long-haul cargo missions,” said Toshiaki Kobori, senior executive managing director of Nippon Cargo Airlines. “GE Aerospace’s continued support has played a key role in maintaining the high operational standards expected in our business.”

A New Decade, with a New Alliance

The GEnx engine’s footprint in Japan grew further at the start of the 2020s.

On February 25, 2025, ANA selected GEnx-1B engines to power its order for additional Boeing 787 Dreamliners, building on its initial selection of the engine in 2020.

ANA has an extensive fleet of GE Aerospace– and CFM International–powered aircraft. In addition to the GEnx, ANA operates the GE90 and CF6 engines and CFM’s CFM56 and LEAP-1A engines.* The airline has also ordered GE9X engines to power its Boeing 777X planes, as well as LEAP-1B engines to power its Boeing 737 MAX fleet.

Improved efficiency and sustainability were cited as key drivers of ANA’s decision to select the GEnx engine. On this front, the GEnx-1B engine provides four times better time on wing than the competing engine on the Boeing 787. Like all GE Aerospace engines, the GEnx can operate on approved sustainable aviation fuel blends. With reduced weight, enhanced performance, and decreased maintenance requirements, the GEnx engine has become a leader in long-distance flights.

“We are pleased to build on our long-standing relationship with GE Aerospace as we continue to grow our fleet,” said Ryosei Nomura, vice president of procurement at ANA Holdings Inc. “The advanced design and great innovation behind the GEnx give us the confidence that these engines will continue their outstanding performance and contribute to our growth.”

A Growing Legacy

As the GEnx engine family surpasses 68 million flight hours globally, the contribution from Japan — now exceeding five million hours — stands as a testament to more than just time in the sky. It reflects the strength of long-standing partnerships and the shared confidence in performance, reliability, and service.

It’s also a strong sign of what’s ahead.

With recent GEnx selections by JAL and ANA for their new Boeing 787 Dreamliner orders, the GEnx footprint in Japan is set to expand even further. Together, we look upward and forward — toward the next five million flight hours and beyond.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), sustainable aviation fuel accounted for 0.3 percent of global airplane fuel production in 2024. By 2050, the IATA estimates that nearly 500 billion liters will need to be produced to reach the net-zero emission target. Through collaborative efforts, Iberia’s Círculo SAF aims to support the energy transition by promoting the development of SAF. Círculo companies purchase an amount equivalent to a set percentage of the carbon footprint generated by certain corporate and cargo flights operated by Iberia. This contributes to global emission reductions for the aviation industry, while allowing member companies to reduce part of their Scope 3 emissions.

As a member of this initiative, BBVA will be able to reduce emissions from its corporate flights on Iberia by 30 percent, within Scope 3, Category 6, which refers to emissions associated with employees’ business travel¹.

“Becoming a member of Iberia’s Círculo SAF means taking another step further in managing our carbon footprint, while supporting the aviation sector’s decarbonization efforts. A sector we included in our decarbonization targets in 2023, and one that requires both the development of cleantech and the participation of companies and governments to promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel,” said Leonardo Pereyra, Head of Direct Impact in the Sustainability Area at BBVA. He also stressed the importance of alliances of this kind “to propel the energy transition.”

Participating companies receive certification for the SAF used on Iberia flights. The SAF is certified according to the sustainability criteria established by the European Renewable Energy Directive (RED II).

Specifically, the sustainable aviation fuel Iberia uses to reduce the carbon footprint of Círculo SAF members comes from organic waste, such as used cooking oil. Emission reductions are calculated based on actual fuel consumption data for 2023, differentiated by route, type of aircraft and cabin type for flights operated in 2023. From there, the carbon dioxide equivalent conversion factor defined by the U.K. Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is applied, along with the percentage reduction in emissions achieved by using SAF compared with conventional fuel.

Benefits of using SAF

Sustainable aviation fuel – currently the only viable alternative and solution to reduce part of the aviation sector’s emissions, together with fleet renewal – can be produced from agricultural or forestry waste in its biological form (bioSAF), or from renewable hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the air (synthetic SAF or e-SAF), or from industrial processes (recycled carbon fuels).

According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), SAF is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 80 percent on a life-cycle basis (including everything from extraction or cultivation of raw materials to combustion in flight) compared with conventional kerosene.

BioSAF, which is produced from plant-based waste, also strengthens the energy transition and the circular economy. The waste used as raw materials for its production currently largely ends up in landfills, or is discarded on farms. Therefore, developing the SAF industry would improve waste management and turn it into a resource. Socially, it can boost job creation in agricultural areas where organic waste is collected to produce this fuel, helping to combat rural depopulation and contributing to prosperity in these regions. Another benefit of SAF is that it can be used without having to alter aircraft engines or airport infrastructure.

¹BBVA acquires SAF certificates equivalent to 30 percent of the emissions generated by flights booked on Iberia. Baseline year for calculation: 2023. This represents three percent of total Scope 3, Category 6 emissions, business travel, projected for 2025 (six percent using 2023 as the baseline).",https://www.bbva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Iberia-BBVA-combustible-vuelos-corporativos-1920x1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 07:57:21.716591

According to industry estimates, Russian airlines’ cumulative compliance costs between 2027 and 2035 will range from RUB 61–258 billion.
Projects to scale up production of sustainable aviation fuel are underway.
Establishing legal monitoring and offsetting frameworks provides the foundation for a transparent carbon trading system and integrates Russian aviation into global climate policy.","Starting September 1, 2026, Russian airlines must record fuel consumption and report CO2 emissions on all international flights. Amendments to Russia’s Air Code and federal greenhouse gas emission restrictions law, prepared by the Ministry of Economic Development in coordination with the Ministry of Transport, mandate compliance and establish the implementation timeline.

The amendments implement Russia’s integration into ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). Under the new rules, carriers must log fuel burn for each international sector, prepare CO2 emissions reports and submit them to the Ministry of Economic Development. The legislation establishes a system for accrediting independent verification bodies to confirm report accuracy. Specific monitoring methodologies and the accreditation procedure will be defined in secondary regulations.

CORSIA requires mandatory reporting and offsetting of emissions growth above an established baseline. If emissions exceed that baseline, an operator must either acquire carbon credits or use recognized low‑carbon fuels, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) or CORSIA‑eligible fuel (CEF).

Operationally, carriers will need to deploy software and automated data‑collection systems, and train staff for monitoring and reporting tasks. Verification of reports will become a recurrent operational expense, and any increase in emissions will generate additional costs for purchasing offsets. According to industry estimates, Russian airlines’ cumulative compliance costs between 2027 and 2035 will range from RUB 61–258 billion.

Authorities are developing measures to reduce these expenses. The Ministry of Economic Development is exploring the accreditation of Russian domestic carbon credits for use under CORSIA. Projects to scale up production of sustainable aviation fuel are underway. Should Russian climate initiatives and carbon credits gain international recognition, operators could use domestic offsets and reduce foreign‑currency outlays.

CORSIA has been in operation since 2019 and applies to carriers whose international emissions exceed 10,000 metric tonnes of CO2 annually. From 2026 the scheme moves into a phase of mandatory participation for most ICAO member states. Russia has been an ICAO member since the organization’s founding, but its participation in CORSIA has been voluntary until now. This regulatory framework enables Russian airlines to meet international standards and avoid operational restrictions in overseas markets.

Joining CORSIA also aligns with Russia’s declared strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Establishing legal monitoring and offsetting frameworks provides the foundation for a transparent carbon trading system and integrates Russian aviation into global climate policy.",https://ruavia.su/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/decarbonisation-green-fuel-green-engine-icao.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 11:57:38.473712

It raises vital questions about Britain’s – and the world’s – readiness to face the security threats posed by the climate crisis, none of which can be met if leaders keep treating climate and defence as separate issues.

This summer, wildfires linked to climate change brought Europe to its knees, wreaking economic havoc, overwhelming health systems and draining military resources. All over the world, climate breakdown is fuelling instability, conflict and displacement. The EU’s failure to break free from Moscow’s pipelines is jeopardising its energy sovereignty. Too many governments treat climate and security as separate priorities, but true security will depend on how quickly we integrate climate resilience into national defence.

As world leaders increase their defence budgets, they must redefine what security means. Nato’s pledge to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP, agreed this summer, should be used to invest in innovation, something the British military has a proud history of.

The navy’s shift from burning coal to oil before the first world war was controversial, but ended up strengthening the British fleet. Today, dual-use technologies – which have both civilian and military applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles and sustainable aviation fuel – can similarly reduce emissions while boosting military performance.

As the world accelerates toward a more sustainable energy future, how do you envision the global energy mix evolving in the coming decade?

SAMSUNG E&A expects the global energy mix to transition steadily from being fossil-fuel led to a more balanced mix where renewables, hydrogen, low-carbon fuels, and advanced energy efficiency technologies play a central role. The largest gains will be made in renewables, electrification, and clean molecules such as hydrogen and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Equally important will be the deployment of enabling technologies, such as carbon capture, digital twin, and AI-based optimization.

From your perspective, which trends and technologies are driving the most significant transformation in the global energy industry?

Decarbonisation is accelerating through investments in carbon capture, SAF, renewable hydrogen, and waste-to-energy solutions, while digitalisation is transforming engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) processes. AI, automation, and digital twins are improving project accuracy, productivity, and safety. Finally, integration is increasingly vital. Today, waste-to-SAF alliances, integrated hydrogen projects, and end-to-end digital ecosystems exemplify the impact of collaborative partnerships.

Can you highlight some of Samsung’s recent projects and milestones that reflect this transition?

In 2023, we announced our vision to become an “engineering company that builds a better future with advanced technology.” Since then, we’ve secured the Malaysia SAF project and won the FEED contract for the Indonesia LNG Project, which aligns with both energy security and decarbonisation in Asia and globally. Further, we are participating in the Middle East’s first eco-friendly plastic business.

We expanded in the hydrogen value chain through acquiring shares in Nel, and by developing our own zero carbon emissions water electrolysis technology (CompassH2).

Through our E&Able brand, E&Able Low (low carbon), E&Able Zero (zero carbon), and E&Able Circle (environment), we’ve launched solutions such as Efficien-C for carbon capture, WtoX for waste-to-energy integration, and Eco O&M for sustainable operations.

What makes ADIPEC 2025 an important platform for Samsung, and what are your key priorities and expectations this year?

ADIPEC is one of our major global marketing platforms. Over the past decade, it has allowed us to build long-term relationships with clients such as ADNOC, showcase our technologies, and engage with C-level decision-makers across the global energy ecosystem.

In 2025, our priority as a Platinum sponsor is to demonstrate how the convergence of AI, automation, decarbonisation, and safety innovation creates tangible value for clients and society by presenting solutions across three dedicated zones (E&Able, Integration, and S.A.Y + Go Quality).

Deepak Ballani, Director General of ISMA, emphasized, “India’s sugar sector has met its ethanol blending targets ahead of time.
Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, President of IFGE, stated, “India’s ethanol success demonstrates the strength of the collaboration between industry and government.

The organizations are also calling for GST rationalization on Flex-Fuel Vehicles (FFVs) and Smart Hybrid Vehicles, along with consumer incentives similar to those provided under the FAME scheme for Electric Vehicles (EVs), to help sustain the momentum of India’s ethanol revolution, as stated in a press release.

This appeal follows India’s achievement of E-20 ethanol blending five years ahead of schedule—a milestone that has drawn global attention and reinforced India’s commitment to sustainable mobility and energy security. The success highlights strong government leadership and the collaborative efforts of the sugar, bioenergy, and automotive sectors, positioning India as a leading example of global fuel transition.

Central to this progress is the sugar industry, which has invested approximately ₹40,000 crore to develop an ethanol production capacity of over 900 crore liters per year, putting it in a strong position to support blending beyond E-20. These investments have resulted in steady demand for sugarcane, faster clearance of cane arrears, improved cash flows for mills, the creation of millions of rural jobs, and significant research into high-yield feedstocks for sustainable ethanol production.

Deepak Ballani, Director General of ISMA, emphasized, “India’s sugar sector has met its ethanol blending targets ahead of time. To continue this revolution, policy continuity is crucial. With the ethanol industry providing 1,776 crore liters—well beyond the Oil Marketing Companies’ requirement of 1,050 crore liters—the sector is ready to support a 27% ethanol blend. However, without a clear roadmap beyond E-20, production capacities could remain underutilized, leading to idle investments, reduced mill revenues, and stagnated biofuel innovation. A phased, time-bound roadmap is essential to provide clarity on future blending milestones, vehicle adaptation standards, and advancements in biofuels like 2G/3G ethanol, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and green chemicals.”

The appeal also highlights financial strain caused by the lack of an increase in ethanol procurement prices from B-heavy molasses and juice over the past three years. This has put pressure on growth and could undermine the progress made so far. A clear roadmap beyond E-20 is therefore necessary to ensure fair utilization of existing capacity and continued improvement in farmer incomes.

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, President of IFGE, stated, “India’s ethanol success demonstrates the strength of the collaboration between industry and government. To sustain this momentum, it is crucial to announce a National Ethanol Mobility Roadmap for 2030 with clear targets beyond E-20. This will integrate vehicle adaptation standards, encourage advanced biofuels, and open pathways for green chemicals. Doing so will secure long-term investments, spur R&D in next-generation technologies, and solidify India’s position as a global leader in sustainable bioenergy.”

The joint appeal also underscores the importance of Flex-Fuel Vehicles and Smart Hybrids in India’s transition from traditional internal combustion engines to cleaner alternatives. These vehicles, capable of running efficiently on various ethanol blends up to E-100, could significantly reduce emissions and dependence on petroleum. However, the current GST rate of 43% on FFVs and Smart Hybrids remains a major obstacle, especially when compared to the much lower GST rate of 5% for EVs. With the right policy support, FFVs could help reduce India’s annual oil import bill by ₹50,000–₹75,000 crore, enhance energy independence under the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, and keep the country on track to meet its Net Zero 2070 commitment.

Reaffirming its commitment, ISMA emphasized that the sugar and bio-energy industries remain central to supporting Indian farmers and the nation’s transition to a cleaner, self-reliant energy future. Both ISMA and IFGE stressed that ongoing policy support will turn the current enthusiasm for ethanol into long-term benefits, ensuring stable farmer incomes, promoting industry growth, and laying the foundation for a cleaner transportation future in India.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ethanol-fuel-1.png,N,,2025-10-14 07:57:32.110335

Drivers of Market Expansion

Decarbonization Imperative

The aviation industry contributes approximately 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions. With tightening international climate regulations, SAF emerges as the most practical short-term solution to curb emissions without the need to replace aircraft or overhaul existing infrastructure.

Airline Sustainability Commitments

Leading carriers are securing long-term SAF supply agreements to meet corporate ESG objectives. Business aviation and corporate travel programs are also integrating SAF to align with sustainability goals.

For discerning Bell and Schweizer owners in the UK, the discussion around Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is becoming increasingly relevant, not just as an environmental commitment, but as an operational necessity and a way to future-proof their assets.

In the UK, the commitment to SAF is substantial, driven by government mandates and industry innovation. This “Green Rotor Revolution” is already impacting how helicopters are powered and represents the most immediate and effective path to reducing the carbon footprint of private and commercial helicopter operations.

Understanding the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Mandate

The UK government has set out clear, ambitious targets to stimulate the production and use of SAF. The UK SAF Mandate, which begins in 2025, requires fuel suppliers to ensure a minimum proportion of jet fuel is SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to at least 10% by 2030.

Drop-in Capability: Crucially, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel. This means it can be blended with traditional jet fuel (kerosene) and used in existing turbine engines—like those powering the Bell 505 and Bell 407GXi—without requiring any modifications to the aircraft or its infrastructure. This is the game-changing factor for helicopters, allowing immediate emissions reduction.

Emissions Reduction: SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. It’s produced from sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil (HEFA), agricultural waste, or even synthetic fuels created from captured carbon (Power-to-Liquid or PtL).

Future-Proofing Your Investment: As a helicopter owner, adopting SAF is a practical step toward future-proofing your investment. Manufacturers like Bell are fully committed to SAF compatibility, and as the mandate progresses, aircraft certified for high-blend SAF operations will be more desirable, likely retaining better value in an increasingly carbon-conscious market.

Bell’s Leadership in Sustainable Flight

Bell is a leader in ensuring its latest generation helicopters are ready for this transition. The powerful and efficient Safran Arrius 2R engine in the Bell 505 and the Rolls-Royce engine in the Bell 407GXi are already certified to operate on a blend of conventional and SAF. The industry is working toward certifying these engines for a 100% SAF blend in the coming years.

For private operators, this means:

Direct Emissions Reduction: Every flight using a blended SAF immediately contributes to a reduced carbon footprint, aligning private flying with broader sustainability goals.

Operational Continuity: Unlike other technologies (like hydrogen or electric power) that require completely new aircraft designs, SAF ensures that high-performance aircraft like the Bell fleet can continue to operate efficiently and safely for decades to come.

Future Availability: As the UK government’s commitment to SAF production strengthens, availability at UK airfields will steadily increase, simplifying logistics for private owners.

The Helicopter Advantage and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

While larger airliners consume enormous volumes of fuel, the helicopter sector’s operational model—frequent, shorter flights often into smaller, less-equipped airfields—presents a unique opportunity for targeted SAF deployment. By focusing on regional distribution and smaller-volume deliveries, the rotorcraft community can lead the way in ensuring the fuel is available where it’s needed most.

The commitment to SAF is about more than just mandates; it’s about maintaining the operational freedom and utility that helicopters offer in a sustainable way. For current or prospective Bell owners, embracing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the logical next step in responsible aircraft ownership, ensuring the thrill and utility of flying remain viable for the next generation of pilots.

Hydrogen offers a bold zero-emission promise, while electric propulsion brings silent, efficient flight — but both face steep challenges in range, weight, and infrastructure. SAF, on the other hand, is already in the tanks of commercial jets today.

Airlines can use SAF as a direct replacement for jet fuel, cutting emissions by up to 80% without changing aircraft or engines. Hydrogen and electric aircraft may define the distant future, yet high costs, safety hurdles, and battery limits mean widespread use is decades away. For now, SAF is the only scalable path bridging sustainability with real-world practicality.

By the 2030s, the industry could see a mix of all three — SAF leading the skies, hybrid-electric systems shaping short-haul routes, and hydrogen waiting on the horizon.

The data, aggregated through IBA’s NetZero Platform and published as the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative takes effect, highlights how airlines are beginning to align their fuel strategies with evolving emissions targets and regulatory incentives.

With the European Commission now publishing SAF-linked emissions allowances by operator, IBA’s analysis compares group-level SAF performance across intra-EU flights, revealing a widening gap between early adopters and slower movers.

Note: CO₂ exposure and SAF blend data from IBA NetZero Platform. Allowance figures are from the official EU list of free

ETS allowances for SAF use in 2024. (1) IAG total is aggregated across its airlines – e.g. British Airways (including Cityflyer & Euroflyer units) ~155k, Aer Lingus 60k, Iberia 7k, Iberia Express 118k, Vueling 157k allowances. (2) Air France–KLM total includes Air France 254k, KLM 90k, Transavia NL 24.6k, Transavia FR 10.9k allowances. (3) Lufthansa Group total includes Lufthansa 19.7k, Austrian 50k, Eurowings 109.8k allowances.

IAG and Air France–KLM have both established clear leads in SAF use, with average EU airport SAF blends of 3.9% and 2.5% respectively in 2024. Both groups are focusing on SAF uplift at their major EU hubs to maximise ETS benefits and help offset the higher costs associated with using sustainable fuel.

IBA’s analysis shows a two-speed SAF market emerging in Europe with SAS and Finnair demonstrating steady progress, reaching 1.1% and 0.4% SAF use respectively in 2024. Lufthansa Group remains more conservative, with 0.2% group-wide SAF use and a moderate 5% target by 2030.

Ryanair and Wizz Air currently show very limited SAF use, yet both have set ambitious 2030 targets of 12.5% and 10% respectively. Both carriers have also secured supply agreements with major producers, suggesting their operational usage is likely to rise as availability improves and ReFuelEU mandates take effect.",,N,,2025-10-14 04:56:25.141717

Book and claim is a chain-of-custody model, in which the administrative record flow does not necessarily connect to the physical flow of material or product throughout the supply chain (ISO 22095:2020).

By leveraging the book and claim model, the Avelia platform aims to reduce the life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) aviation emissions and enable greater participation in the sector’s decarbonisation efforts. The platform provides wider access to the GHG benefits of SAF across the aviation value chain.

This agreement supports Moeve’s Positive Motion strategy by promoting greater SAF adoption as the market evolves, helping to make it a more commercially viable solution for advancing the energy transition.

Moeve is a leading SAF supplier in Spain, manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel at its La Rábida Energy Park in Huelva from used cooking oils, advancing the circular economy and supporting aviation decarbonisation.

It is building a 2G biofuels facility in Huelva as part of a joint venture with the capacity to flexibly produce up to 500,000 tonnes of SAF and renewable diesel annually, and is targeting an overall annual SAF production capacity of 800,000 tonnes by 2030.

Avelia was launched in 2022 by Shell Aviation in collaboration with Amex Global Business Travel and Accenture, with support from the Energy Web Foundation (EWF).

As of June 30 2025, Avelia helped inject over 41 million gallons of SAF into the existing fuel network at 17 airport injection point locations around the world, helping to abate over 370,000 tCO2e. 57 corporations and airlines have made transactions through Avelia.

In July 2025, Avelia announced its evolution into a multi-supplier platform, helping users access the GHG benefits of SAF from multiple SAF suppliers including Shell. The integration of Moeve into the platform means that airlines, corporations, freight forwarders and shippers will now have broader SAF supplier choice, including Moeve and Shell.

Carlos Barrasa, Moeve’s executive vice-president for commercial & clean Energies stated: “In a dynamic book and claim landscape, Avelia stands out as an initiative that has demonstrated real scale and credibility in accelerating SAF adoption. We are proud to join Avelia as its first strategic third-party SAF supplier and see this agreement as a key step in our ambition to lead aviation decarbonisation in Europe.”

Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation, stated: “Avelia’s evolution into a multi-supplier platform is an important step in scaling access to SAF, and it is made possible through the collaboration of committed parties across the aviation value chain.

34th annual Global Business Aviation Outlook projects 8,500 new business jet deliveries valued at $283 billion over the next decade

Purchase plan growth fueled by fractional operators and new tax law

Aircraft utilization continues to grow as vast majority of operators plan on flying more or the same as they did this year

LAS VEGAS, Oct. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NASDAQ: HON) today published its 34th annual Global Business Aviation Outlook, which forecasts a record-setting number of new business jet deliveries over the next decade. The report provides unique insights into current industry trends and longer-cycle developments based on forecasting models and surveys of hundreds of business aviation operators across the globe.

Within the report, Honeywell predicts 8,500 new business jets with a projected value of $283 billion – the highest in the report's 34-year history – will be delivered over the next 10 years with an average annual growth rate of 3%. The strong demand for new jets continues to persist against a backdrop of increasingly complex macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. However, those factors have not slowed down the demand for new aircraft.

""The combination of recent economic growth, increasing demand for fractional ownership and a steady cadence of new aircraft development and technology upgrades have produced record levels of demand in business aviation,"" said Heath Patrick, president, Americas Aftermarket, Honeywell Aerospace Technologies. ""Operators are increasing their usage rates and in turn manufacturers are continuing to ramp up production to keep pace with growing demand. Over the next decade, we expect these record-setting levels of deliveries and usage to continue.""

Key findings in the 2025 Honeywell Global Business Aviation Outlook include:

New business jet deliveries in 2026 are expected to be 5% higher than in 2025.

New business jet deliveries are expected to grow by 3% annually on average over the next 10 years.

91% of those surveyed expect to fly more or about the same in 2026 compared to 2025.

20% of operators globally have at least one aircraft on firm order – up from 17% a year ago. The figure was higher in 2025 for the subset of Part 135 and equivalent operators (private jet charters, for example), where 28% of respondents mentioned they have an aircraft on firm order.

89% of respondents consider ""Performance"" among their top three most important criteria when purchasing an aircraft, which compares with 82% from last year's survey. ""Cost"" remains a distant second at 56%, which is down slightly from 60% last year.

Demand for fractional ownership continues to lead industry growth with Midsize and Super Midsize being the jets of choice for these customers. Among those surveyed, 12% of operators of wholly owned business aircraft say they also own fractional shares.

Fractional fleets have grown more than 65% since 2019 to roughly 1,300 aircraft now in service.

Growth from fractional operators, new economic policy contributing to higher demand

Operators surveyed indicated that the return of 100% bonus depreciation following the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) earlier this year is expected to spur additional business aircraft purchase activity. This federal tax incentive allows businesses to deduct a large portion of the cost of certain assets – including business jets – in the year they are put into use.

According to the survey findings, strong demand for fractional ownership is fueling large orders and contributing significantly to industry growth. The fractional ownership market has continued to outpace the industry in terms of growth, both in fleet sizes and flight activity. In fact, fractional fleets have grown more than 65% since 2019. Light, midsize and super midsize jets comprise 80% of these fractional fleets.

While 12% of current operators of wholly owned aircraft said they also own fractional shares, 15% more said they are considering purchasing them in the future. When asked for reasons why they are considering purchasing these shares, nearly 50% of respondents said they would increase the overall flying capacity of their operation and 30% said they would use their fractional program to optimize their current flight operations.

Flight Activity: Strong year-over-year growth in 2025

Operators are flying their aircraft noticeably more in 2025 when compared to 2024, with business jet flight hours up about 3% year over year after flight hours were virtually flat from 2023 to 2024. This growth is derived primarily from private operators and fractional ownership companies, where demand for charter flights has stabilized well above 2019 levels after fluctuating throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of regularly scheduled airline routes.

Corporate flight departments continue to lag in flight activity as they seek to optimize various cost elements of their flight operations. This is often achieved through selective use of wholly owned aircraft, charter flights, and fractional ownership.

When asked, operators expressed optimism about their outlook for future flight activity, with 28% saying they plan to fly more next year compared to this year and 64% saying they plan to fly about the same over the same time.

Regional Breakdown: Recent delivery trends continue

North America: North America is expected to receive roughly 70% of new jet deliveries over the next three years as 17% of operators have aircraft on firm order and the region comprises a massive 62% of the global fleet. There is optimistic sentiment from operators in North America driven by regulation changes in the U.S. headlined by bonus depreciation. Operators in the region follow the global trend of flight activity optimism, with just over 90% saying they plan to fly either the same or more hours over the next year.

Europe: Europe is expected to receive about 14% of new jet deliveries over the next three years, and the portion of operators with aircraft on order is higher than the global average. Europe maintains 11% of the global business aviation fleet, but 29% of these operators state that they have at least one aircraft on firm order. The flight activity sentiment mirrors the global trends with nearly 30% of operators expecting to fly more in the coming year and about 60% expecting to fly the same.

Latin America: Latin America will accept 7% of global new jet deliveries over the next three years. 15% of the global fleet is based in the region and 19% of current operators there said they have aircraft on firm order. These operators tend to be more optimistic about their flight activity growth in the coming year, with 33% of them anticipating an increase.

Remainder of the world: Asia-Pacific and the Middle East & Africa regions are forecasted to receive 5% and 3% of global deliveries, respectively. Both regions have hovered around these levels for the past few years, and the trend is expected to continue. Operators in these regions are less bullish on flight activity growth than the other regions, but still nearly 20% of the region's current operators expect to fly more, with most of the remainder still expecting to fly about the same amount in the coming year. The Middle East is poised for growth as positive regulatory changes and improvements to airport infrastructure will make it easier for business aviation entities to establish operations in and fly throughout the region.

Aircraft Purchase Priorities: Performance and cost remain king

Aircraft performance and cost continue to be the two primary purchase drivers for buyers of business aircraft, with aircraft range being the single most important specification. Other aircraft performance-related specifications such as payload, field performance and speed rank near the top of the list of purchase drivers.

Buyers surveyed who are purchasing new aircraft prioritize customer support and technology more than buyers of pre-owned aircraft. Specifically, buyers of new aircraft place higher value on good response time and technical support when compared with buyers of pre-owned aircraft.

When asked about aircraft technology, buyers of new aircraft said they consider advancements in fly-by-wire controls, connectivity and advanced safety features in their purchase decisions more than buyers of pre-owned aircraft.

Sustainability in Business Aviation: More fuel-efficient aircraft key to environmental improvements

For the fifth consecutive year, Honeywell also conducted an analysis of sustainability in business aviation and examined how operators are trying to lower their carbon footprint. Key findings in the report include:

81% of operators believe that developing new, more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines is at least moderately effective in helping to achieve sustainability goals.

61% think sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is at least moderately effective in reaching those same goals.

Among those who are taking proactive steps to improve the sustainability of their operations, 60% are acquiring more fuel-efficient aircraft, 56% are using SAF and 31% are flying at more efficient cruise speeds.

Regarding the adoption of SAF, cost and availability of the fuel continue to be the largest challenges.

Verijet’s bankruptcy highlights the continuing challenges of building large-scale charter operations around very small jets.","Florida-based charter operator Verijet has entered Chapter 7 bankruptcy, bringing a quiet end to one of the most ambitious attempts to reinvent short-haul private air travel around a single-engine jet and a promise of cleaner, more sustainable flying.

Court documents show the company listed between $1 million and $10 million in assets and up to $50 million in debts at the time of its bankruptcy filing on October 9, 2025. The filing follows months of lawsuits from customers and vendors and comes a month after the death of Verijet founder and CEO Richard Kane, who suffered a heart attack while cycling on September 13, 2025, at age 60.

Founded in 2020, Verijet bet heavily on the Cirrus SF50 Vision Jet, the single-engine personal jet typically favored by private owners rather than charter fleets. Kane’s vision was to create a “green air taxi” network linking small cities and regional airports, using the SF50’s lower fuel burn and noise footprint to deliver a cleaner, quieter alternative to conventional light-jet operations.

The company claimed that the Vision Jet’s fuel consumption — around 60 gallons per hour versus 100-plus gallons per hour for most twinjets — cut carbon emissions by about 40%, and said it would use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) wherever possible while offsetting remaining emissions to reach net-carbon-zero operations.

Verijet operated on a jet card model, selling prepaid flight hours in blocks starting at $25,000. Rates averaged about $3,000 per flight hour, with one-hour minimum per leg. The company marketed its pricing as competitive with turboprop charter options while offering faster point-to-point travel. However, unlike traditional fractional ownership or guaranteed-availability programs, Verijet’s terms stated that flights were “subject to aircraft and crew availability.” That clause became central to later disputes when customers found themselves unable to book flights or reclaim unused balances.

From its base in South Florida, Verijet expanded to Texas, California, South Carolina, the Northeast, and the Caribbean, at one point ranking as the 13th-largest charter operator in the United States by flight hours. By 2023, it appeared to be a breakout success story in the emerging light-jet charter niche.

That same year, Verijet signed a letter of intent to merge with a SPAC led by former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, which would have taken the company public and given Muilenburg a board seat. But the plan unraveled when Muilenburg’s New Vista Capital liquidated the SPAC before closing the deal.

Soon after, lawsuits mounted from customers who had purchased jet cards — prepaid flight packages that promised convenience but not guaranteed availability. Many cardholders claimed they were left with large unused balances after Verijet canceled flights and stopped operations. Vendors, lessors, and fuel suppliers also joined the creditor list as the company’s cash flow dried up.

By mid-2025, Verijet’s once-active fleet of around 20 Cirrus Vision Jets had shrunk to just a few aircraft. Flight-tracking data shows little activity in recent months, and the company appears not to have flown any flights since Kane’s passing. While Verijet’s website remains online, it has not been updated to reflect the bankruptcy filing or the current status of operations.

Verijet’s downfall underscores the difficulty of scaling air-taxi operations around very small jets. The Vision Jet’s low acquisition and operating costs made it appealing on paper, but limited payload and range meant the economics depended on consistently high utilization — something no operator has yet achieved.

Verijet’s bankruptcy highlights the continuing challenges of building large-scale charter operations around very small jets. The company’s fleet of Cirrus SF50s was less expensive to operate than traditional light jets, but limited range and payload restricted its earning potential.

Other companies have tried similar short-haul charter concepts in the past with mixed results. The Eclipse 500 “very light jet” programs of the mid-2000s, for example, also struggled to sustain utilization and profitability.

At the same time, the industry continues to pursue more efficient aircraft and lower emissions. Major manufacturers are certifying new models for 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use, and smaller operators are exploring hybrid-electric propulsion.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/10/02-Verijet-3-cropped.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 04:56:43.605976

Energy density requirements, weight limitations, and operational demands create an inescapable reality: these backbone industries need liquid fuel solutions to decarbonise.
Policymakers across the Asia Pacific are coming to terms with this reality and acting on it in an increasingly decisive manner.
Companies building regional low carbon liquid fuel capabilities now position themselves advantageously for the consolidation phase that inevitably follows market maturation.
The groundwork laid through APEC coordination will determine whether Asia Pacific leads global low carbon liquid fuel development or cedes first-mover advantages to regions already acting decisively on both climate and security imperatives.","As APEC leaders convene, the Asia Pacific region faces twin imperatives that demand coordinated action. Climate commitments will require deep decarbonisation across transport and industrial sectors while energy security concerns necessitate reduced dependence on volatile fossil fuel trade flows. Low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) offer a rare solution that addresses both challenges simultaneously, creating an US$800 billion market opportunity across the region.1

The scale of this challenge becomes clear when examining the hard-to-electrify backbone of regional trade. Aviation, maritime transport, heavy freight, and industrial processes form the circulatory system of the Asia Pacific's interconnected economies. These sectors move the goods and people underpinning regional prosperity yet face fundamental physical constraints that make electrification commercially unviable. Energy density requirements, weight limitations, and operational demands create an inescapable reality: these backbone industries need liquid fuel solutions to decarbonise.

These applications account for nearly half of liquid fuel consumption across major regional economies. With aviation demand growing 2.6% annually and freight at 1.9%2, the challenge compounds without coordinated intervention - this is precisely why LCLFs emerge as the critical market catalyst.

Policymakers across the Asia Pacific are coming to terms with this reality and acting on it in an increasingly decisive manner. Deloitte’s SAF Lighthouse tool provides airport-level demand forecasting, revealing where Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is likely to take off, driven by emerging mandates. This, paired with the current pipeline of SAF projects under development, and volumes of competitive feedstock available, make clear that there is a significant opportunity for the region.

However, realising this potential requires overcoming significant investment barriers. Our analysis in the Refined Ambitions report for Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation identifies five interconnected risks constraining private capital: demand uncertainty without harmonised policy, price volatility in fragmented markets, feedstock supply risks, technology risks beyond proven pathways, and policy uncertainty from inconsistent standards. These barriers persist across both developed and emerging regional economies, creating a coordination problem that no single jurisdiction can solve alone.

Understanding market development phases reveals why coordinated action creates competitive advantages. Four distinct stages characterise this evolution: export-led growth, domestic demand emergence, supply diversification, and consolidation. Companies securing partnerships during earlier phases capture disproportionate value as markets mature. Critically, competition between production pathways and feedstock supply is expected to reduce abatement cost significantly, making regional coordination not just strategically smart but economically essential.

The Refined Ambitions report points toward seven specific accelerators that can unlock investment barriers through coordinated regional action:

Increase market access - harmonise sustainability standards and trade frameworks

Increase risk mitigants - develop revenue certainty mechanisms and concessional finance

Reduce transaction frictions - standardise contract terms and regulatory processes

Send credible demand signals - coordinate policy and government procurement

Reduce information asymmetry - publish market benchmarks and supply/demand forecasts

Leverage innovation - coordinate R&D investments and technology deployment

Align value chain interests - facilitate partnerships and joint ventures

As outlined in Deloitte’s recent report, Accelerating Net-Zero: Critical Opportunities in Asia Pacific’s Climate Policy, the strategic imperative for regional leaders is clear – the only way to catalyse real change, at pace, regionally, is for policy to lay the groundwork for action, matched with private sector investment and innovation. APEC provides the coordination platform, but individual C-suite decisions across aviation, shipping, heavy industry, and fuel production will ultimately determine outcomes. The window for establishing regional partnerships narrows as other markets move decisively toward integrated approaches. In Deloitte’s recent 2025 CxO Sustainability Report, almost 50% of Asia Pacific C-suite surveyed noted that they are focused on developing new sustainability related products and services and actively implementing new technology solutions. SAF provides a key opportunity for these organisations.

Companies building regional low carbon liquid fuel capabilities now position themselves advantageously for the consolidation phase that inevitably follows market maturation. Those choosing fragmented national strategies risk higher costs, supply constraints, and competitive disadvantages as integrated regional ecosystems develop economies of scale and regulatory alignment.

The groundwork laid through APEC coordination will determine whether Asia Pacific leads global low carbon liquid fuel development or cedes first-mover advantages to regions already acting decisively on both climate and security imperatives.

The choice facing regional leaders is fundamental: build these capabilities together through coordinated partnerships or explain later why fragmentation was chosen when the stakes demanded integration and the pathway to success was clear.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -Fuel suppliers are using European Union green jet fuel mandates to inflate costs for airlines through surcharges, nearly doubling prices compared with market rates, the head of airlines body IATA said in an interview, calling for policy reform.

The EU began requiring airlines to use more sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) this year, with a 2% minimum blending mandate set to rise to 6% by 2030.

While fuel suppliers are responsible for providing fuel with the progressively stronger blends of SAF at airports, airlines are obliged to purchase the available fuel for their operations.

Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, told Reuters that oil suppliers selling SAF were able to ""extract additional profit from airlines by charging these compliance surcharges,"" adding that this should prompt European regulators to eliminate the mandates.

""They have, in effect, facilitated price gouging by fuel suppliers in the name of the environment, and that's completely unacceptable,"" Walsh said.

Walsh did not specify which airlines had been impacted or which fuel suppliers were involved in price hikes.

Sustainable aviation fuel costs on average three to five times more than regular jet fuel.

Industry association FuelsEurope said there had been a ""significant and consistent decline of average SAF prices,"" citing third-party pricing data from Argus Media.

Energy companies have said they are not seeing enough demand for SAF to justify ramping up production, which some executives say is weighing on prices rather than driving them up. Several have scaled back SAF refinery projects in recent years.

Walsh was speaking in an interview on a separate report by IATA setting out $11 billion in extra costs in 2025 caused by congestion in other parts of the airline supply chain.

Global Push Toward Aviation Decarbonization Despite increasing commitments to reduce emissions, the global SAF market continues to face supply shortages and scalability barriers.
A Step Toward Cleaner Skies Through its participation in Avelia, Moeve adds momentum to the ongoing transition toward low-carbon aviation.","Spanish energy company Moeve has become the first external supplier of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to join Shell’s blockchain-based Avelia platform, a global initiative designed to accelerate the use of cleaner aviation fuels. The collaboration marks a major milestone in efforts to scale SAF adoption within the aviation industry, which continues to face challenges in meeting decarbonization goals.

According to reports shared after the signing of the agreement, Shell confirmed that Moeve’s participation expands the reach of Avelia by introducing a new independent producer into its ecosystem of airlines, fuel suppliers, and corporate buyers. The development is seen as a significant step toward broadening supply chain participation and promoting transparency in the SAF market.

Expanding the Blockchain Network for Clean Aviation

Launched in 2022, Shell’s Avelia platform was created in partnership with Amex Global Business Travel and Accenture to streamline SAF transactions through a blockchain-based “book and claim” model. This digital framework enables airlines and corporate travelers to purchase the environmental benefits of SAF even when physical supply is not available at their departure locations.

The system allows buyers to claim verified emission reductions while fuel suppliers record and validate the actual use of SAF at participating airports. By mid-2025, Avelia had already facilitated the use of more than 41 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel across 17 airports worldwide. The inclusion of Moeve as a new supplier is expected to strengthen this digital marketplace, improving availability and traceability of low-carbon fuels across the aviation sector.

Moeve’s Role in Sustainable Fuel Production

Moeve produces SAF from used cooking oil at its La Rábida Energy Park in Spain, contributing to circular economy practices and waste-to-fuel innovation. The company has outlined plans to significantly expand its production capabilities, targeting a capacity of 800,000 metric tons per year by 2030. This growth is expected to enhance Europe’s supply of renewable aviation fuels and support the region’s broader energy transition objectives.

The partnership with Shell positions Moeve as a key player in the emerging digital ecosystem for sustainable fuels, enabling greater coordination between producers, distributors, and corporate clients through blockchain verification. This collaboration also reinforces the role of digital transparency and traceable carbon accounting in building confidence among buyers and regulators.

Global Push Toward Aviation Decarbonization

Despite increasing commitments to reduce emissions, the global SAF market continues to face supply shortages and scalability barriers. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported in June that SAF production is projected to double in 2025, reaching approximately 2 million tons. However, even at that level, SAF would represent only 0.7% of total global airline fuel consumption, underscoring the urgent need for expansion and investment.

Industry analysts note that initiatives like Shell’s Avelia and partnerships with independent producers such as Moeve are essential to bridging the gap between demand and supply. By leveraging blockchain for verification and accountability, the aviation sector gains a trusted mechanism to measure real emissions savings and build a transparent market for sustainable fuels.

A Step Toward Cleaner Skies

Through its participation in Avelia, Moeve adds momentum to the ongoing transition toward low-carbon aviation. The collaboration highlights how technological innovation—particularly blockchain—can foster coordination among diverse stakeholders, from producers to corporate travelers, in addressing the aviation industry’s environmental impact.

As aviation continues its pursuit of net-zero emissions, partnerships combining renewable fuel production and digital transparency tools are expected to shape the future of sustainable flight, moving the sector closer to its decarbonization goals.",https://www.cointrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/moeve.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 14:57:26.900592

Unlike Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Chapter 7 begins a process of liquidation where a company’s assets are sold off and the proceeds distributed to creditors. It typically ends the bankrupt company’s existence.

In documents filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida late last week, Verijet said it has assets valued between $1 million and $10 million and liabilities of between $10 million and $50 million. It has between 200 and 1,000 creditors.

Verijet operated a fleet of Cirrus Vision SF50s and billed itself as a green alternative in private air travel, with plans to increase its use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and reach total net zero for all greenhouse gas emissions.

From its base in South Florida, the company grew rapidly, adding service to Texas, California, South Carolina, the Northeast, and the Caribbean. At one point, it was the 13th-largest private jet operator in the U.S.

Verijet’s apparent success brought attention from major players in the airline industry, and in 2023 it signed a letter of intent to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) led by former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg. The deal would have given Muilenburg a seat on Verijet’s board and taken the combined business public, but New Vista Capital opted to liquidate the SPAC rather than move forward.

Starting around that same time, Verijet was hit with lawsuits from customers who said they purchased “jet cards” for flights that Verijet canceled, delayed, and ultimately could not complete. The company maintained that its jet cards did not guarantee availability.

In September, Verijet founder and CEO Richard Kane died at 60. According to financial news website TheStreet, the carrier has not operated flights since Kane’s death.

Part III – Agentic AI Looking ahead, agentic AI represents the next paradigm.
Job Displacement & Reskilling: Agentic AI will automate not just routine work but decision-making.
Closing (Call-to-Action) To conclude, let’s turn to the original question – is an AI-powered economy sustainable?
[1] Energy demand from AI – Energy and AI – Analysis – IEA [2] Bogmans C et al (2025) Power Hungry: How AI Will Drive Energy Demand, WP/25/81, IMF working papers, published 10 April 2025.","Is an AI-Powered Economy Sustainable? And more importantly – what do we need to do to make it so?

Let’s start with the numbers, because context matters.

If AI were a country, how much energy would it consume?

According to the IEA[1], AI-driven data centres used about 415 terawatt-hours of electricity globally in 2024 – that’s 1.5% of global demand. That may sound small, but here’s the catch: energy demand from AI tripled between 2023 and 2024.

The IMF[2] now projects that by 2030, AI’s electricity use could reach 1,500 terawatt-hours (TWh), surpassing global EV consumption and approaching India’s total energy demand. Judging from the speed of adoption, even this estimate may understate reality in the next five years.

Part I – The Paradox

Does that mean we are doomed? Not necessarily. AI is both part of the problem and part of the solution.

On the problem side, training large models is resource-intensive. Emissions, water use, and compute demand dominate discussions, and for good reasons.

On the solution side, AI is already cutting costs and emissions in energy, transport, manufacturing, and healthcare, creating new businesses and products that previously thought not possible.

Innovation is also reducing the resource burden. For example, Deep Seek, a Chinese model launched this year, demonstrated training methods that dramatically lower compute and water requirements.

Another trend is moving away from huge general-purpose models to smaller, specialised models[3]. In healthcare, for instance, Diabetica-7B outperformed GPT-4 on diabetes tests. Domain-specific models are emerging in law, retail, finance, education and other sectors – more efficient, precise and fit for purpose.

The message is clear: the way we deploy AI – not the technology itself – will determine whether it accelerates sustainability or undermines it.

Part II – The Business Lens

Let’s ground this in concrete examples.

In Retail: Tesco, with more than 4,000 UK stores, uses Roambee, an AI-powered supply chain platform. By optimising inventory, logistics, and deliveries, Tesco save tens to hundreds of millions annually.

In Energy management: Octopus ’s tech platform, Kraken, manages charging for nearly 180,000 EVs – about 1GW of flexible capacity, equivalent to a nuclear power plant. That’s AI balancing the grid in real time, saving £1 billion in costs and supports UK’s net zero ambitions.

This is crucial because curtailment – which means switching off renewable generation to avoid overloading the grid, costing the UK £152 million in compensation for not producing energy. AI grid optimisation can help us avoid those losses while making the energy system more resilient as we upgrade our infrastructure.

In Utilities: Southern and Anglian Water use AI radars to detect sewer blockages early. This reduces costs and prevents environmental damage, demonstrating the value of preventative maintenance.

In Pharmaceuticals: AI is transforming drug discovery and trials. 86% of AstraZeneca’s small-molecule projects predict which molecules to design next and shorten optimisation cycles. In pathology, AI image analysis cut workloads speeding up biomarker identification. In safety testing, drug failures occur due to unexpected liver toxicity. The company built a Bayesian neural network to predict drug-induced liver injury – the model predicts and quantifies risks learning from new data.

Last year, I spoke with a group of Audit Committee chairs of the largest European listed companies on AI innovation. Using AI, a company was able to establish a global patient database for rare diseases because AI could identify patterns traditional methods could not. That makes treatments more financially viable for small patient groups.

Generative AI is also used in interacting with trial subjects and patients, reminding patients of medication schedules, monitoring feedback and vital health signals, leading to better health outcomes.

Across sectors, the message is consistent: AI can deliver real savings, unlock new businesses, and accelerate sustainability and impact.

Part III – Agentic AI

Looking ahead, agentic AI represents the next paradigm. AI agents – virtual, physical, and decision-making – collaborate with humans, handling entire processes with humans supervising strategically.

The paradigm shifts from human-in-the-loop as executor to human-on-the-loop as supervisor is a trend I called out at the Public Funds Forum last September, speaking to US state pension funds and treasurers in California, who asked whether AI was overhyped or not.

Things develop fast – we did not even use the term agentic AI then – it is very much a term that came into our vocabulary this year.

Agentic AI matters for sustainability because it allows scaling without proportional costs or resources, controlling energy and compute demands. End-to-end workflow design reduces waste and redundant operations. Streamlined decision-making improves resource utilisation.

But before we celebrate agentic AI as a sustainability upgrade, let’s pause. There are blind spots too.

As agents interact, unpredictable behaviour may arise, for example, competing for compute or destabilising power grids.

Even if an agent optimises a process – logistics or R&D – the footprint of the underlying infrastructure (chips, semiconductors, cooling water) is rarely factored into the agent’s objective function. Sustainability is not “by default.” It must be designed in.

Governance agents can provide guardrails, but they are only as good as the rules we give them. If sustainability metrics are not explicitly encoded, the system might optimise for cost, speed or growth only. That could lock us into highly efficient but unsustainable systems.

My key takeaway is that Agentic AI can amplify sustainability, but only if objectives, governance and social impacts are explicitly designed into the system. When we think we have less to worry about with straight through processes, we might actually have more to do upfront. Predicting every eventuality and assessing externalities as an ongoing learning process.

You might be wondering – Christine, you haven’t talked about the elephant in the room – job displacement and workforce reskilling. And what about careers? How do we build multi-stage careers in a world where we are expected to live longer, but our job security is being reshaped by technological disruption?

These questions are critical – because AI’s sustainability challenge is not only environmental, it’s also social.

Job Displacement & Reskilling: Agentic AI will automate not just routine work but decision-making. That creates efficiency, but it also reshapes the skills that remain valuable. Without reskilling pathways, we risk widening inequality between those who can pivot and those left behind.

Health & Wellbeing: The always-on nature of digital tools, constant reskilling pressure, and algorithmic monitoring can strain mental health. Physical health may also be affected as automation displaces roles tied to active, embodied work.

Multi-stage Careers: With longevity increasing, careers will no longer follow a simple linear arc of education, work, and retirement. Disruption accelerates the need for portfolio-style careers, where people retrain, pause, and re-enter, sometimes in a field that is completely different. Yet our pension and benefits systems are still designed for stability, not dynamic shifts.

Part IV – The Path Forward

So where does this leave us?

We should not think of AI as inherently sustainable or unsustainable. It is a tool, and its impact depends on the choices we make today.

Four choices, in particular, will shape whether AI becomes an accelerator of sustainability or a source of fragility:

Build Efficiency – prioritise smaller, specialised models and smarter training methods.

Optimise Systems – use AI make grids, supply chains, infrastructure and healthcare more resilient and less wasteful.

Encode Governance – design rules and social safeguards so AI optimises for sustainability not just cost and speed.

Redefine Human Sustainability – create pathways for reskilling, support wellbeing, and reimagine career and pensions for a longer, more disrupted future.

Closing (Call-to-Action)

To conclude, let’s turn to the original question – is an AI-powered economy sustainable?

The answer is: it can be — if we make deliberate choices.

AI will not determine our sustainable future. We will. And here’s where you come in. As consultants, you are in a unique position to guide clients on:

Translating AI innovation into business strategy.

Exposing blind spots that leaders miss.

Ensuring growth today does not undermine resilience tomorrow.

If you succeed, AI won’t just power economies – it will power the transition to a net zero, human-centred, and future-ready society.

But the bill extended a tax credit for producing clean fuels including sustainable aviation fuel.","A Dutch company planning a sustainable aviation fuel production facility southeast of the Tri-Cities has cleared an important regulatory hurdle for the project.

State Department of Ecology officials in early September determined that SkyNRG’s manufacturing facility, being pursued by its North American unit SkyNRG Americas, would not create significant environmental impacts. The agency’s determination still set requirements for the company and project, from air and water quality precautions to mitigating reduction of habitat for ferruginous hawks.

But company officials said in a statement to the Tri-Cities Area Journal of Business that Ecology’s decision is a critical milestone and they will continue to work with state and local stakeholders so the project continues to move forward.

“This brings SkyNRG closer to realizing a first-of-its-kind facility in the U.S. that will deliver domestic sustainable aviation fuel while advancing innovation and economic opportunity to Eastern Washington and across Washington,” said Nick Zollman of SkyNRG Americas in a statement.

SkyNRG’s facility will convert gaseous feedstocks into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel using chemical processes.

Once operating, the facility will produce an estimated 50 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel annually. It already has agreements in place with those wanting to buy its fuels.

SkyNRG has not released details about construction costs for the facility. Company officials have said construction will create up to 600 jobs and the facility itself about 100 jobs once production begins in 2029.

While federal policy toward some clean or renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has soured, sustainable aviation fuel has largely been spared similar treatment.

Congress’ passage of H.R. 1, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, scaled back credits for sustainable energy that were instituted a few years ago, such as those supporting the purchase of new and used electric vehicles or installing solar panels on homes.

But the bill extended a tax credit for producing clean fuels including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit initially went through 2027 but now extends through 2029.

The Walla Walla County site provides access to transportation networks and potential synergy with other regional efforts to harness agricultural waste for energy production and other industrial purposes.

Washington State University is globally the top contributing organization to scientific literature in the sustainable aviation fuel field, based on an analysis of articles, papers, editorials and news items published between 2001-23.

Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Laboratory at WSU Tri-Cities and co-director of the WSU-Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Bioproducts Institute, was the most cited author.

The SkyNRG project is the one the state has thrown support behind. It received a $1.5 million grant from the state Department of Commerce, as part of the Governor’s Economic Development Strategic Reserve Fund.

“This project aligns with our strategic growth priorities around clean technology and innovation,” said Joe Nguyen, director of the state Department of Commerce, in the statement announcing the grant. “In addition to furthering Washington’s leadership in clean energy and sustainable aviation, it creates family-wage manufacturing jobs that strengthen the local economy and community.”

SkyNRG has had to adjust its original plan to move forward. According to state documents, the company moved the facility to a different area of the business park than originally planned. The new site, located farther from the Columbia River, will have fewer environmental impacts.

Ecology’s recent determination also requires SkyNRG to make improvements to the intersection of Boise Cascade Road and Highway 12 if current state plans to widen and realign the highway don’t proceed. That is a possibility, as state and county officials propose further breaking up the next phase of expanding and rerouting the key route between the Tri-Cities and Walla Walla.

Zollman said the company is grateful for its partners as it looks to next steps.

“Important work lies ahead as we advance a project designed specifically to meet the benchmarks set by state and local partners,” he said.",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/Focus/Construction%202025/Project-Wigeon-2025-layout-v2.jpg?height=635&t=1760371759&width=1200,N,,2025-10-13 12:57:00.010003

GREENSBORO, N.C., Oct. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Honda Aircraft Company today announced it has become the first twin-turbine very light business jet manufacturer to utilize the HondaJet on a successful test flight running a 100% blend of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).

A production-model HondaJet was fueled with a mix of Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) and Hydrodeoxygenated Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (HDO-SAK) fuels and flew over the Greensboro area before successfully landing at the company’s world headquarters at Piedmont Triad International Airport. This test flight represents the culmination of significant efforts made by a Honda Aircraft Company engineering team, in cooperation with GE Honda Aero, a joint venture between General Electric and Honda responsible for the design of the HF120 engines equipped on the HondaJet. Under the joint venture, Honda Aero, Inc. produces the engine in Burlington, NC.

HondaJet aircraft currently in service have been operated by customers on approved SAF blends of up to 50%. GE Honda Aero successfully completed tests of the HF120 engine on the ground utilizing 100% SAF fuel blends in 2022 and 2023, providing an early demonstration of the feasibility of the HondaJet’s recent test flight.

“We are immensely proud of our Honda Aircraft Company engineering team carrying forward our commitment to the future of aviation by demonstrating that the HondaJet is capable of operating on a 100% SAF blend,” said Amod Kelkar, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Honda Aircraft Company. “This achievement is a step toward aligning our business activities with the global Honda goal of decarbonizing our business activities by 2050.”

Kenya Airways flew a Boeing 787-800, which was powered by a blend of biofuel and jet fuel in May 2023, marking the maiden flight by the national carrier with reduced emissions.
This facility could meet 15 percent of Kenya’s current jet fuel demand and 10 percent of its projected demand in 2030,” the study said.
ENI biofuel is mixed with jet fuel at a 50:50 ratio, making it ready for use in aircraft.
The Italian oil firm set a target of producing 200,000 tonnes of biojet (a blend of biofuel and jet fuel) annually two years ago.","Kenya needs a minimum of Sh30.45 billion ($235 million) investment to produce biofuel (sustainable aviation fuel) for airlines and replace up to 15 percent of the current jet fuel, according to a study by the World Bank.

The study shows that the funds can be used to set up the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) facilities that can produce up to 4,000 barrels per day (BPD) of biofuel by refining vegetable oils and waste oils.

The findings come amid a growing push globally to blend jet fuel with biofuels and shift to low-emission aviation fuel, a move that has potential to cut up to 80 percent of the carbon emissions by aircraft.

The study focused on how to resolve challenges and leveraging advantages to establish sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) across Africa. It focused on Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria and South Africa given their dominance in Africa’s aviation sector.

Kenya Airways flew a Boeing 787-800, which was powered by a blend of biofuel and jet fuel in May 2023, marking the maiden flight by the national carrier with reduced emissions. The aircraft flew from the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

“A 4,000-BPD HEFA plant producing SAF from UCO and castor oil requires an estimated investment of $235 million. This facility could meet 15 percent of Kenya’s current jet fuel demand and 10 percent of its projected demand in 2030,” the study said.

Local consumption of jet fuel stood at 732.34 tonnes last year, meaning that the investment could meet at least 109.86 tonnes of the fuel.

“Kenya has the potential to produce HEFA–based SAF using castor oil and UCO. Its existing infrastructure, including its petroleum pipeline network and Nairobi’s role as a regional aviation hub, provides a strong foundation for SAF production,” the study further said.

The report noted that government commitment to transition to clean energy, existing high-quality petroleum infrastructure and abundance of vegetable oils like castor seeds have placed Kenya at a vantage position to shift to low-emission aviation fuels.

Italian company ENI is currently involved in the local production of castor seeds in Makueni, Kwale, and Taita Taveta counties. The seeds are processed at its hubs in Makueni and Kwale before being shipped to Italy for production of biofuel at its refineries in Venice.

ENI biofuel is mixed with jet fuel at a 50:50 ratio, making it ready for use in aircraft. The Italian oil firm set a target of producing 200,000 tonnes of biojet (a blend of biofuel and jet fuel) annually two years ago.

Airbus and Boeing –the two biggest manufacturers of commercial jets in the world— have already publicly declared their plans to scale up use of biofuel.

Airbus conducted the first ever long-range flight of its A380 Jumbo fully running on biofuel in 2022 while Boeing has an ambitious target of manufacturing jets that are fully powered by similar fuels by 2030.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation says that a significant portion of SAF production will come from developing countries and emerging markets, where biogenic feedstock is abundant and renewable energy potential is high.",https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/resource/image/5228408/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/18b090f30d803d49bcf0df999b8ea61d/NQ/biofuel.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 10:56:52.379717

NBAA and the industry also made meaningful progress on business aviation security, with the rollout of a new FAA plan for removing personally identifiable information from the agency’s Aircraft Registry.
Safety, security, taxes and trade – these enduring concerns for business aviation figured prominently in the Washington policy arena in 2025.","As the calendar progresses toward year’s end, it’s a good moment to consider NBAA’s advocacy work to advance business aviation’s policy agenda, and the implications for the coming year and beyond.

For example, safety, the industry’s highest priority, was in focus perhaps as never before, as a series of troubling incidents and tragic accidents galvanized government leaders and the American public around ATC modernization as a national priority.

NBAA was a founding member of the Modern Skies Coalition, a group of more than 50 aviation organizations, that secured congressional legislation providing a $12.52 billion down payment for a brand-new ATC system, with investments in new technologies, facilities and controllers. In the coming months, all stakeholders will need to remain focused on achieving our modernization aims, and preserving America’s aviation leadership.

As the administration considered agreements with trading partners, NBAA underscored the importance of the civil aviation sector, which has a $104 billion trade surplus, and supports 1.8 million jobs.

Key to this success story is the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, which creates a fair and even trading landscape for aviation, while maintaining high safety, manufacturing and certification standards.

NBAA welcomed a return to the 1979 agreement’s “zero-for-zero” approach to tariffs on aerospace products as part of this year’s trade agreements with the UK and EU, and we will continue working to ensure it is reflected in future trade arrangements.

The year also included a welcome development on the tax front, with the passage of NBAA-supported budget legislation containing permanent reinstatement of immediate expensing, or bonus depreciation, for new and used aircraft. Economists have long cited the success of this allowance in helping American companies upgrade key competitive assets, while supporting business aircraft manufacturing jobs.

The same budget bill also extended by four years the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit incentivizing production of sustainable aviation fuel to 2031.

NBAA and the industry also made meaningful progress on business aviation security, with the rollout of a new FAA plan for removing personally identifiable information from the agency’s Aircraft Registry.

In hundreds of comments submitted to the FAA to highlight the need for the new protections, NBAA members noted that publicly available, personally identifiable aircraft information has enabled flight-stalking by anyone, with any motive. Going forward, NBAA will work with the FAA to strike a balance allowing information for legitimate uses while safeguarding sensitive personal data.

AI and energy security are key tailwinds for cleaner power

Multi-speed transition is playing out, but the long-term trend is unchanged to deploy $150trn in green technologies

The global megatrends of electrification and energy security are persuading investors in the green transition to look past short-term headwinds when allocating capital, according to senior executives at Nomura Greentech’s Sustainable Leaders Summit in Salzburg, Austria.

About $150 trillion of capital is required by 2050 to fund the global energy transition and despite recent inflationary challenges and slower progress from countries such as the US, there is a great deal of optimism about investing into green technologies.

While the cost of capital for renewables has reset at a higher level amid inflationary forces – a 200bps rise since 2021 with most of that increase coming since the third quarter of 2022 – executives viewed this as a sign that speculative capital is making way for long-term investors who see the inevitability of transitioning to sustainable energy systems.

There are reasons for optimism in all major markets including Europe, China and the US.

EUROPE – ENERGY INDEPENDENCE

Europe is committed to eliminating its dependence on Russian gas via its REPowerEU plan, which is accelerating the region’s decarbonization ambitions. Imports of Russian gas dropped from 150 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2021 to 52 bcm in 2024 – with the overall share of Russian gas imports falling from 45% to 19%, according to the European Commission. This intensifying focus on energy security means that the bloc continues to roll out renewable energy more quickly, with almost half (47%) of electricity in the EU now coming from renewables. Installed wind and solar capacity has increased by 58% cumulatively between 2021 and 2024.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also caused wider tremors among neighbouring countries, prompting them to prioritise defence spending in order to become more self-reliant in the event of a wider conflict. Germany has announced plans to nearly double its defence budget to €650 billion ($764 billion) over the next five years. Companies such as Fernride have spotted a trillion-dollar opportunity to create regional champions in the sphere of automated armoured vehicles in combat zones, at ports and for freight logistics on public roads. Fernride’s AI-based human-in-the-loop technology means that one driver can operate up to 50 trucks remotely to address massive shortages of commercial drivers (400k) and trained soldiers (300k).

Europe has also made considerable progress on installing electric vehicle (EV) chargers. Take Germany, - the bloc’s biggest country - where more than 145k public charge points have been installed and a forecasted slowdown in EV car sales has not materialised.

EUROPE – REGULATORY LEADER

Europe has also used its strength in regulation to encourage the adoption of green technologies across multiple sectors as illustrated by ReFuel EU, which aims to boost the supply and demand of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by increasing SAF and eSAF mandates over time. SAF is derived from hydrotreated esters and acids while eSAF is a synthetic fuel drives from renewable energy such as solar, hydro or wind.

The FuelEU Maritime Mandate is another example of EU regulation taking a leadership role to drive change. The rules set increasingly strict limits on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels, aiming for an 80% reduction by 2050 for commercial vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports. The International Maritime Organization created its own net zero framework earlier this year encompassing a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for emissions.

In stark contrast to these sectors and to emphasise the powerful impact of effective regulation, summit participants cited the petrochemicals industry where regulatory drivers and subsidies are in short supply. Entrenched interests are high, and an oversupply of conventional petrochemicals is keeping prices low, meaning alternatives that carry a green premium struggle to compete with incumbents selling cheaper, higher-emission products.

CHINA – A LOW CARBON INDUSTRIAL CHAMPION

China’s decades-long investment into photovoltaic (PV) technology has paved the way for more affordable solar power across the globe. China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels (such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules) exceeds 80%, more than double China’s share of global PV demand, according to the International Energy Agency.

As a result, the levelized cost of PV solar power – which includes the cost of building the plant – has declined by 88% over the past 15 years; removing green premiums has been key to mass adoption.

In addition, China’s rapid rollout of battery technology for EVs has accelerated adoption at home and abroad.

The chart below shows that more than half of China’s vehicles will be electric by 2030.

US – MARKET FORCES DRIVE CAPACITY UPGRADES

While the US renewables market is contending with political headwinds arising from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and tariffs on imports of PV panels, aging grid infrastructure and greater power demand from investments in AI data centers could offset these negative effects.

The OBBBA reduces Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for wind and solar but preserves full credits for energy storage and clean firm technologies through 2033. Tariff escalations and geopolitical tensions have intensified supply chain challenges, but as a result, a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing and alternative sourcing has emerged, even across hard to decouple supply chains such as critical components for batteries and PV modules.

High growth in the US power market is projected over the next 15 years as demand continues to outpace supply due to significant growth in sectors requiring near-term power. Over the last two decades, improved energy efficiency for lighting, appliances and heating and cooling meant that the compound annual growth rate for energy demand was about 0.4% per year but the new era of AI, EV penetration and electrification of everything is set to substantially increase demand to 3.5% per year until 2040, according to McKinsey data.

Historically, energy has not been a constraint on computing; even as higher internet traffic increased data center workloads by nine times between 2010-2020, overall energy use stayed flat because of more and more efficient chips. But the AI era is set to turn that paradigm on its head, leading to a 17-64GW shortfall in peak power demand by 2030, which will likely require fast-built solar and battery storage to fill the gap.

Every US region is in need of energy infrastructure upgrades and replacements to minimize impacts of congestion and increase reliability. All three major components of the electric grid - generation, transmission and distribution - have an identified investment gap, which is projected to grow to a cumulative $197 billion by 2029, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in existing energy infrastructure. The US utility industry expects to see about a ~1.6x increase in capital expenditures into critical infrastructure over the period of 2026-2030 representing $1.3 trillion in capex from 2026-2030.

In short, executives increasingly see a-multi-speed transition playing out with China using its industrial scale to take the lead on renewables and EVs while Europe uses the stick of regulation and energy independence to advance the green transition. The US faces short term challenges, yet it has already laid strong foundations to build resilient systems for an electrified, digital future.

Yet, in this fervent quest, an unexpected contender has surfaced, offering even greater potential: green methanol. While hydrogen has been in the spotlight, green methanol presents a viable, immediate solution with far-reaching applications. This shift could transform industries and redefine energy strategies worldwide. As nations like Germany, Japan, and South Korea advance their hydrogen initiatives, places like Tasmania in Australia are exploring this promising alternative. The impact of this development could reshape the future of global energy consumption.

The Global Hydrogen Race

Countries around the world have been actively pursuing hydrogen as a clean energy source, with Germany, Japan, and South Korea leading the charge. These nations have established strategic partnerships to import hydrogen, signaling their commitment to a sustainable energy future. Meanwhile, regions like the Middle East, South America, and Oceania are gearing up to become major exporters. Among these, Australia stands out, particularly the state of Tasmania, known for its 100% renewable energy profile and strategic location.

Tasmania’s potential for producing green hydrogen has attracted significant interest, especially in the northern part of the state. However, previous projects have faced technical and infrastructure challenges, stalling progress. Now, a new approach is emerging that could overcome these hurdles. The company ABEL Energy is proposing a paradigm shift: transforming hydrogen into a denser, more versatile form with immediate global demand. This strategy could position Tasmania as a key player in the global energy market.

“China Makes Fuel From Thin Air”: Hydrogen Harvesting System Shocks Scientists While Oil Industry Collapses

Green Methanol: The New Frontier

The transformation from hydrogen to green methanol is a game-changer. By combining green hydrogen with carbon captured from sustainable biomass, green methanol is produced with a neutral carbon footprint. This versatile material serves multiple purposes:

Providing a clean marine fuel;

Acting as a feedstock for green chemicals;

Serving as a basis for sustainable aviation fuel.

ABEL Energy has partnered with Worley to launch the Bell Bay Powerfuels project, aiming to produce 300,000 tons of green methanol annually by 2028. This initiative has attracted A$330 million in public incentives, drawing international attention and potential acquisition by Zen Energy. The project underscores a growing sentiment within the energy sector, suggesting a potential shift away from hydrogen in favor of methanol.

Introduction

Massachusetts is one of the few states considering policies to subsidize Sustainable Aviation Fuels, or SAFs. This IPS report reviews the flawed policy recommendations from a recent report by an ad-hoc SAF working group convened by Massport, a state agency.

The report of the Massport’s ad-hoc Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Working Group claims that SAFs “have the potential to dramatically reduce lifecycle aviation emissions to near zero by 2050.” It offers recommendations about SAF, including further research on its emission reduction potential, the prospects for the local industry, and the use of subsidies to encourage early adoption.

This IPS paper reviews the best available science to determine the feasibility, energy requirements, affordability, and timetable regarding SAF. It finds that, unfortunately, aviation growth cannot be reconciled with the Massachusetts plan that requires emission reductions, unless low-emission fuels are available now. Yet all recent discussions regarding SAF are hypothetical and notably devoid of any commitment or timetable regarding the implementation of SAF.

The findings of the IPS report indicate that hypothetical future use of SAF should not serve as a green light for expanding aviation. We find that SAF solutions provide minimal or negative greenhouse gas reductions. They will not be available on a timetable that will contribute to the 2050 Massachusetts emissions plan. And in any scenario, they would require massive public subsidies.

These critical drawbacks are explained at length in the full report. A summary follows.

Key Findings

Sustainable Aviation Fuels won’t help Massachusetts reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

As the Commonwealth reduces GHG emissions in many sectors, aviation emissions continue to rise. The CO2 emissions from jet fuel consumed in the Commonwealth today are 5.9 megatons per year and growing, while the City of Boston’s emissions today (all sources except aviation) are 6.0 megatons per year and falling. The technical options to address aviation emissions by 2050 are limited.

Supporting basic research aimed at improving the efficiency of SAF production is prudent. However, proposals to drive production or consumption of SAF through economic policy or subsidies do not make financial sense, as SAF currently — and for the foreseeable future — increases GHG emissions.

While subsidies can be enacted at the state level, the subsidy required to drive the wholesale conversion to SAF would be unfundable.

SAF solutions will not be available at scale on a timetable that will have any significant benefit to the 2050 Massachusetts GHG plan.

E-fuel technologies are not realistic for Massachusetts.

The huge diversion of clean energy to e-fuel production will increase GHG emissions and be prohibitively expensive.

CO2 emissions are five times lower if we direct new clean electricity to the grid to displace natural gas, instead of using it to create e-fuel SAF. Put another way, a switch by Massachusetts to e-fuel based on grid electricity would save 5.9 MT of fossil jet emissions but add 21 MT of grid emissions, for a net increase of 15.1MT of CO2 per year.

To displace current fossil jet fuel use with e-fuel in Massachusetts would require annual subsidies of $2.9 billion to $16.5 billion. This is 2 to 12 times the entire annual Massachusetts Transportation budget of $1.37 billion.

The magnitude of electrical power required to produce e-fuel to meet Massachusetts aviation requirements is much more than the Commonwealth generates today.

Until the utility grid is completely decarbonized, every kWh of clean electricity generated must be applied toward the maximum reduction in CO2, and not toward the inefficient production of e-fuel.

In general, SAF simply isn’t a feasible way to reduce emissions at scale.

The most severe and unsolved problem with SAF is that its use increases CO2 emissions.

Any of the SAF production scenarios would require massive taxpayer subsidies.

Land use for crop-based fuels would compromise food security and lead to deforestation with attending reductions in CO2 sequestration. Inexplicably, the SAF Working Group’s recommendations fail to exclude proposed subsidies for this pathway.

Technical options to reduce aviation emissions by 2050 are limited: electric aircraft will only address a fraction of short-haul flights.

Conclusion and Recommendations

The two best ways to decrease CO2 emissions from aviation today are:

Ensure that inefficient modes of aviation are avoided. The Commonwealth should implement policies and infrastructure to transition short-hop local flights using small aircraft, like Cape Air, to electric aircraft as soon as possible. The Commonwealth should also reduce the use of private luxury jets, which produce the highest CO2 emissions per passenger mile. Subsidies for these aircraft should be eliminated.

Replace short flights with high-speed rail or other electric ground transportation. A significant portion of Massachusetts’s jet fuel is used for flights to the Northeast Corridor. The Commonwealth, working with other corridor states, should prioritize the development of true high-speed rail through legislation, eminent domain, and other methods. This presents the Commonwealth’s greatest opportunity to cut aviation-related GHG emissions by 2050.

Aviation emissions can only be reduced this century by flying less — particularly eliminating wasteful or inefficient trips — and by investing in low-emission ground transportation. Relying on speculative, expensive SAF far in the distant future is a dangerous excuse to avoid confronting jet aviation’s greenhouse gas problem now.

Data compiled by IBA‘s NetZero platform reveals a major difference between the low-fare giants and established carriers like IAG and Air France-KLM.

Ryanair’s average SAF blend at EU airports was just 0.02%, and Wizz Air’s was even lower at 0.01%. This compares dramatically with IAG’s 3.9% blend.

Despite their current low uptake, both carriers have set some of the most aggressive long-term goals in the industry, pointing to a potential rapid shift in their fuel strategy as supply constraints ease and regulatory mandates take full effect.

While their operational use of SAF is negligible today, both airlines have committed to significant targets by the end of the decade. Ryanair has set a 12.5% SAF blend target by 2030, the highest reported ambition among the major groups analyzed, with Wizz Air aiming for a 10% SAF blend by 2030.

Both carriers currently face substantial CO₂ exposure within the European Union, as measured by IBA NetZero, with Ryanair at an estimated 996,000 tonnes and Wizz Air at 242,000 tonnes.

Low SAF usage means they are currently missing out on the financial benefits offered by SAF-linked allowances under the ReFuelEU scheme, which provides a credit against costs from the Emissions Trading Scheme.

This suggests their current low operational usage is a reflection of the initial scarcity of available fuel rather than a lack of intent. Their usage is anticipated to increase significantly as SAF volumes become more widely available and as the ReFuelEU mandate, which require all EU airports to offer a minimum percentage of SAF, starting this year, are enforced.

The report warns that the risk lies in future limits on SAF availability and increasing carbon prices, which could force prices up..

“For slower adopters, the risk is that supply constraints and carbon price pressures will narrow future options, forcing later procurement at higher cost. With the first ReFuelEU mandate beginning this year, 2025 credits will be a clearer test of execution. The advantage will rest with those treating SAF not as a short-term burden but as a strategic asset,” say the authors.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SAF-refueling-003.jpg-e1731596256925-1024x702.png,N,,2025-10-13 09:00:34.759130

Coming at an opportune moment when the trading week began with choppy moves, the announcement has been a small ray of sunlight to the stock of oil giant investors, which are gaining slightly in the initial London trading despite the more general jitters in the market over the trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

The shares of Shell, which trade on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker SHEL, opened just slightly higher, up 0.4 per cent to trade at about PS26.50 in the mid-morning. This increase is in the face of a flat FTSE 100 index itself, in the face of the lingering fears in the aftermath of the sharp sell-off on Wall Street last week.

The joint venture with Moeve not only supports Shell in the expanding SAF market but also shows the strategic shift of the company to low-carbon solutions, which makes a significant part of the long-term expansion strategy when regulators and stakeholders increasingly pressure companies to decarbonise the aviation industry.

Dismantling the Moeve-Shell Partnership

The core of this change is the Shell Avelia platform, a digital marketplace that was introduced in 2022 in collaboration with American Express Global Business Travel and Accenture. Avelia is based on a book and claim system where the airlines, fuel manufacturers and corporate clients can exchange certificates to use SAF without the actual delivery at each airport.

This system is based on blockchain technology that handles the issue of transparency, traceability, and verifiable claims, addressing one of the largest obstacles to scaling green fuels, which will demonstrate their environmental impact.

Moeve (formerly Cepsa and the second-largest Spanish oil refiner) is a major force at the table. The company has been increasing its production of SAF at its state-of-the-art La Rabida Energy Park plant, where waste-based feeds such as used cooking oil are used to produce drop-in fuels that can be used by the existing aircraft engines.

Moeve also intends to achieve a scale of 800,000 metric tons annually in output by 2030, which is a very high target, yet it is perfectly aligned with the world aviation aim to reduce emissions by as much as 50 per cent by mid-century.

Through incorporating in Avelia, Moeve will have access to an international market network of purchasers, comprising large airlines and organisations that are keen to neutralise their carbon footprints. In the case of Shell, this will be a milestone in broadening the supplier base of the platform to the outside operations of the platform.

Since its inception, Avelia has already certified more than 41 million gallons of SAF in 17 airports around the globe, yet the introduction of external participants such as Moeve is likely to accelerate the adoption of SAF.

According to industry pundits, this would see SAF being able to increase its portion of the total aviation fuel to something significant, 5-10 per cent by the close of the decade, as opposed to the paltry 0.7 per cent it has at the moment, which has been projected to grow to 10 per cent by the close of this year alone.

The partnership is symptomatic of a wider trend in the industry, in which the use of the industry experience of oil giants in renewables is taking place. SAF is a high-margin opportunity for Shell, which has already invested billions in hydrogen, biofuels, and charging of electric vehicles.

As aviation contributes approximately two per cent of all CO2 gases globally, the certified green fuel market is booming with mandates in the EU, which mandate 6 per cent SAF by 2030 and policies in the UK, which also mandate similar requirements.

Green Transition Strategic Implications to Shell

The agreement provides Shell with a point of contention over the speed at which it is selling off fossil products. In early 2021, the company announced its plan for the Capital Markets Day with a promise of PS10-15 billion annual returns to shareholders till 2025 and devoting up to 25 per cent of capital investment to low-carbon projects. SAF can be well placed within this structure, and it provides a transition between old-fashioned oil trading and energy services of tomorrow.

In the case of Moeve, the tie-up makes it more visible in the foreign markets. Being a comparably new participant in the SAF, which rebranded in 2024, the Spanish company can leverage an established network of logistics and the credibility of Shell.

The combined capability of the two (Shell being a digital expert and Moeve a production powerhouse) might reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of the supply chain, which will make SAF more competitive compared to conventional jet fuel, which is 2-4 times cheaper in terms of gallon-per-gallon prices. There is a feeling of optimism among the environmental groups because they feel that the news is a tangible move towards dealing with the promises of the Paris Agreement.

Nevertheless, there are still hurdles to overcome, a shortage of feedstock, and expensive initial capital investments may limit growth unless the government intervenes in the form of subsidies or carbon taxation. Such innovations benefit the UK with its Jet Zero strategy, which seeks to have net-zero aviation by 2050, which would result in thousands of green jobs in refining and distribution.

Share Price Dynamics: A Sceptical Rebound

In 2025, Shell shares have fallen by approximately 5 per cent since the year-end due to declining oil prices and negative geopolitical impacts on the company. The primary measure, Brent crude, rose 1 per cent today to approximately 72 per barrel, following a fall to five-month lows on Friday due to optimism that U.S.-China rhetoric would de-escalate.

The Moeve deal was another tailwind, with traders referring to it as a boost in interest in Shell’s diversified portfolio. Shell slightly outperformed its counterparts: BP fell 0.2 per cent as TotalEnergies in Paris rose 0.1 per cent.

The resilience of a PS10,000 investment in Shell over the last five years would have increased to approximately PS14,100. The company has recently paid 1.32 million shares back to the market as a buyback, demonstrating its confidence in the valuation.

In the future, Shell will provide more hints on the performance of trading with its third-quarter update, which will be presented later this month. It is projected to have a stable LNG, which is a boon in Shell earnings, yet refining margins are tightened due to oversupply.

Shareholders will be keen on the performance of the Moeve integration into the actual revenues, and this would be able to increase tens of millions of dollars in Shell SAF’s book in the near future.

Staying on the Broader Market Turbulence

The current FTSE 100 index covers volatility. Asian markets crashed on the profit taking, the U.S futures are signalling a possible recovery after Donald Trump reversed his tariff move against China.

In the case of UK energy stocks, the industry beats 1% a week, indicating optimism in hydrogen trials and wind offshore auctions, but with Russian threats of a hybrid invasion of the European grids, there is an element of risk.

Here, the SAF push of Shell would make it a progressive thinker. When Big Oil is struggling with dwindling mega-profits (down 30% as of 2022), such renewable investments as this joint venture may insulate dividends and fuel future growth. Shell has a forward yield of 4.2 per cent. and a price-to-earnings ratio of 8.5, which makes it a defensive income-seeking stock.

With the aviation industry racing to sustainability, the alliance between Shell and Moeve may be groundbreaking. To the shareholders, it’s a disturbance of the fact that in a transition period, flexibility is not greenwashing, but good business.

It remains to be seen whether this leads to a long-lasting surge or ends up being dampened in the vagaries of oil; however, one thing is clear: the skies are turning greener and Shell is in the flight.",https://www.abcmoney.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Leonardo_Lightning_XL_Shells_Avelia_blockchain_platform_integr_3-min.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:05.189583

“This is the 21st century, we’ve got to do better.” Electric aviation This is what brought McNabb to nlmtd.
It encompasses different modes of aviation, including an air taxi network, unmanned aviation and swarm flying, where several aircraft fly in close formation.
With nlmtd, I believe we can make it happen.” This way he helped introduce various innovations to the aviation industry.
Reversing the consulting model McNabb never considered himself a consultant.","Aviation veteran Clive McNabb has joined nlmtd with a clear ambition: restore the magic in flying. Not by going back, but by finally moving the industry forward into the 21st century: “We’ve got so much engineering capability, and yet we’re still stuck on two engines under a wing.” We spoke to McNabb about his vision and how it can become a reality.

Flying used to be special. Clive McNabb remembers it well, growing up in a family with a history in aviation. “I’ve been hanging around airports since I was 12. Still today, I’m happiest under the wing of a 747. How this 400-tonne piece of metal gets into the air – that’s amazing.”

McNabb started working in the industry at 20, and 48 years later he still is. Along the way, he has worked for companies like Britannia Airways, KLM, Scarabee Aviation Group, as well as aviation consultancies including NACO, and It’s in the Air. His own passion is still the same as when he was 12, but he sees the magic of those early days is gone.

“I was standing at the gate in Las Vegas, about to get on a 777 with KLM back to the Netherlands. I looked around and nobody was engaged. They were oblivious to the ballet going on all around them: all the engineers that were checking the aircraft for safety, the maintenance, loading the aircraft, planning the most optimal route – everybody takes it for granted nowadays. We should be in absolute awe.”

From service to mass transport

It’s not that he blames the travellers. The problem, he maintains, is that “we’ve forgotten we’re a service industry.”

“Our role is connecting people and cultures worldwide. And everybody loves traveling, but it’s no fun if you’re stuck in queues and crammed in tight aeroplanes. It’s all low-fare, low-cost now. We’ve become a mass transport industry.”

“Around 750 new aircraft of various types are being developed right now, almost all electric.”

This has also stifled innovation. “Airlines are running on razor-thin margins. And their business day-in day-out is keeping a schedule and flying safe, which they do incredibly well, but it means they aren’t open to a change of business model, because it risks that model of stability and costs them a fortune.”

From magic to shame

All in all, clinging on to the old has stripped aviation of much of its former glory. Especially since the lack of innovation is also slowing down the transition to sustainable aviation. The magic of flying has been replaced by flight shame.

This doesn’t mean there hasn’t been any progress, McNabb acknowledges. “Apart from the continued move to sustainable fuel, the fuel economy is also completely different nowadays. Today’s aeroplanes are much more efficient.”

There’s a very good reason most people don’t know this though, which also points to the lack of fundamental change: aeroplanes still look basically the same as when McNabb entered the industry almost five decades ago.

“We’ve got so much engineering capability, and yet we’re still stuck on two engines under a wing,” he says. “This is the 21st century, we’ve got to do better.”

Electric aviation

This is what brought McNabb to nlmtd. As part of the Amsterdam-based innovation and management consultancy, he wants to help finally usher in a new age of aviation.

And he sees possibilities everywhere, because even though Boeing and Airbus are stuck in the past, there are countless start-ups working hard to take aviation into the future. Undoubtedly the most important step in realising this ambition is the development of electric planes.

“We’re further along than many people think,” McNabb notes. “Around 750 new aircraft of various types are being developed right now, almost all electric. And yes, some of them aren’t going to make it, but there’s so much innovation. Right here in the Netherlands, we’ve actually got the most electric aircraft movements in the world.”

While the weight and capacity of batteries still put a limit on the distance an electric aircraft can cover, McNabb emphasises this is not as big of a problem as it is made out to be.

“We can already fly 600 kilometres, but with the newest batteries, we will soon be able to fly up to 1,000 kilometres. If we look at Europe, that’s nearly 50% of all commercial flights, meaning that as battery technology improves, the range will only expand further, and we could potentially decarbonise the vast majority of flights.”

Regional air mobility

A concept that fits seamlessly into this shift towards electric aviation is regional air mobility. It’s also McNabb’s “absolute passion.”

Regional air mobility uses smaller aircraft to provide fast, flexible transport between cities and regions that are too close for traditional airline routes but too far or inconvenient for ground travel. It encompasses different modes of aviation, including an air taxi network, unmanned aviation and swarm flying, where several aircraft fly in close formation.

“These are all technologies we can use to make aviation sustainable,” McNabb explains. “The challenge now is to bring them to the market. To see which concepts work in which situation, have open and honest conversations about what’s feasible and desirable, and develop working business models around them.”

Operations guy

This is a crucial part, because the aircraft are only one piece of the puzzle. “There’s so much to work out: new revenue streams, better passenger experience, human-oriented security, new airline opportunities, new IT. This is not the old way, not just transporting people. This is something completely new and different – and very cool.”

It’s also where McNabb’s own expertise comes in. “I’m an operations guy. I’m really about the business. About how you can make an innovation work, both for the passenger experience and cargo. I get into the details – loading the aircraft, managing passenger streams, emptying toilets, and so on. I ask myself and people around me: ‘Is that going to work? Would you use this?’”

“Until now I never had the support to drive it over the line. With nlmtd, I believe we can make it happen.”

This way he helped introduce various innovations to the aviation industry. At Schiphol, for instance, he was involved in the development of new self-service systems. For TSA, he helped make the security process at US airports more user friendly. He also founded the company Res2, which offers a Departure Control System.

Reversing the consulting model

McNabb never considered himself a consultant. But when he learned about nlmtd, he saw a huge opportunity to help accelerate the transition to new modes of aviation.

“One of my friends, who’s CEO of a US airport, once said to me: ‘I want to get access to the consultants who really know the business, but I don’t like the consulting model: I have to go to proposal, the consultants turn up, promise me the world, charge a lot of money and in the end give me a report I could have written myself. Can we not reverse this model?’ Well, that’s the nlmtd model – they reversed it.”

A crucial part of this model is that nlmtd doesn’t have to wait for a client to hire them. “We’re all entrepreneurs. We can start an innovation platform. For years I’ve had this passion for electric flying and regional air mobility, but until now I never had the support to drive it over the line. With nlmtd, I believe we can make it happen.”

Bring it together

Manuel van Lijf, lead for nlmtd’s Travel & Transportation sector team, is happy to welcome McNabb aboard. “I have known Clive for almost two decades and I’m very glad our paths are crossing again,” he says. “Clive brings decades of aviation knowledge and is determined to change the industry from the inside out with his passion for e-mobility. This is exactly the sweet spot for both nlmtd as well as our travel clients worldwide.”

Having joined in September, McNabb has already started setting things in motion. “I’m activating my network, telling people that I’ve joined nlmtd and we can finally work together. I’m really excited, I want nlmtd to be the spider in the web to bring this together.”

Of course, he’s aware of the many challenges still ahead – an industry full of big companies that don’t want change, regulations that have to be changed, legacy systems, and much more – but he’s hopeful it can be done. “Big changes have happened before. And also: it’s really cool. And if it’s really cool, good for the passenger and the environment, then why don’t we do it?”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-10-13-072320494-2025-10-10-013537791-Clive_McNabb_wil_vliegen_weer_magisch_maken___door_de_luchtvaart_eindelijk_naar_een_duurzame_toekomst_te_brengen_spot.jpg?webp,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:09.514728

With India recently permitting the export of 2G ethanol, how do you foresee this decision shaping the future of the country’s biofuel industry?
Ans: India does have a potentially very advantageous position when it comes to feedstock for 2G ethanol.
It’s also going to be critical to ensure that the current 2G ethanol plants that are being commissioned can scale successfully.
In terms of scaling up 1G and 2G ethanol, what steps is Novonesis taking to reduce production costs and improve efficiency?","In an exclusive interview with ChiniMandi’s editor Prakash Jha, Hans Ole Klingenberg, Vice-President for Marketing and Strategy, Household Care and Industrial Biosolutions, Novonesis, shared valuable insights into the rapidly evolving biofuels sector. Klingenberg, with extensive experience across the U.S., South American, and European markets, discussed the growing significance of second-generation (2G) ethanol, a key renewable fuel derived from non-food biomass. As India positioning itself as a major player in ethanol space, Klingenberg highlighted the country’s unique advantage in feedstock availability for 2G ethanol production. With the recent policy shifts allowing 2G ethanol exports, India is poised to enhance its biofuel capacity, contributing significantly to both its energy security and environmental sustainability goals.

Q. With your vast experience in US, South American, and European markets, what are the key differences you’ve observed in the adoption of biofuels across these regions? How does India fit into this global landscape?

Ans: India has had some very impressive growth rates for biofuel expansion. In fact, we have never seen a rollout in any part of the world move this quickly or this smoothly, thanks to a very determined and structured approach by the Indian government. We applaud the government for finding a balanced way to manage both feedstock availability, as well as the rollout of new plants. The government’s structured approach in setting targets, mandates and timelines helped to create a very clear signal to the market. This is something that has also been instrumental in Brazil and the US. In these contexts, we have seen that the role of carbon markets, and related policy support has been critical for producers to invest and grow the low carbon fuels market as well. We hope for continued support from the India government as it continues its journey to decarbonize the transport industry in India, and we see room for additional expansion here.

Q. What role do you see biofuels playing in the global transition to renewable energy, and how does this align with Novonesis’ strategy for Household Care and Industrial Biosolutions?

Ans: Liquid renewable biofuels are a critical component in decarbonizing transport. In fact, it is the cheapest and greenest way to decarbonize road transport quickly. It also presents a fantastic way to create other social benefits as it supports local farm communities and jobs. It ensures less dependence on fossil fuel imports, and it provides a means for cleaner burning engines and less air pollution in the cities. As such, we see biofuels as being an instrumental tool that can be used here and now. As the world makes transitions towards low carbon strategies, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution towards mobility. Biofuel will be key, but also one among several solutions towards cleaner and greener transitions.

Biofuels also serve as a bridge to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. Long term, it’s also possible that biofuels may be used as an alternative for aviation fuels. Investing in biofuels now also creates the potential to invest and become a leader in future solutions for not just road transport, but also for heavy transport solutions that are greener.

Q. With India recently permitting the export of 2G ethanol, how do you foresee this decision shaping the future of the country’s biofuel industry? What opportunities does this open up for scaling up production, and what steps will be crucial for overcoming potential challenges in meeting global demand?

Ans: India does have a potentially very advantageous position when it comes to feedstock for 2G ethanol. So, it will be very interesting to see how this industry scales. It opens up potential new sources of income for the biofuel industry and for India as a whole.

Some of the critical things that will be very important to pay attention to when it comes to the 2G ethanol market is the premium and the mandates that are made available to this specific fuel category, as it is more expensive than 1G ethanol. As an example, in the EU there is a premium price afforded to 2G ethanol, but right now those prices are still relatively low, and will likely need further government support to allow the industry to fully scale. It’s also going to be critical to ensure that the current 2G ethanol plants that are being commissioned can scale successfully. In the past, there have been challenges to get this process technology up and running. However, we are optimistic that the industry is becoming more mature and is getting to a stage where it is able to get to true scale and thus be able to grow this market.

Allowing exports of 2G ethanol will facilitate price discovery, thus helping to establish a clear reference point for potential investors in the advanced ethanol sector. This is currently lacking in the local market. A continued trade/ demand certainty through exports would build trust and draw investments in this space, which is essential to scale up the industry.

Q. How do you perceive India’s agricultural landscape as a resource for the biofuels industry, especially in terms of raw material availability for 1G and 2G ethanol?

Ans: I think the critical piece here is to make sure that there is a continual focus on balancing feedstock supply and feedstock demand. Here, I think India actually offers a best practice for balancing the use of raw material. There is an annual accounting for feedstock availability of broken grains / rice, corn and sugar. This enables the Indian government to determine how much feedstock availability is reasonably available for biofuel generation, and work forwards to create standards and mandates for how much feedstock may be offered towards ethanol production in a given year. This ensures that there’s always a balance in resource utilization, and it promotes growth and expansion of value for farmers by giving them several outlets for crops, be it for food, or fuel.

This also allows the government to flexibly pivot if demand is stronger from say food rather than fuel, or vice versa – thus making sure that crops are not wasted or left in excess stock thereby resulting in low output prices for farmers. India has significant biomass availability so it can play a pivotal part in developing and scaling up the 2G industry – complementing ethanol production from existing feedstock and furthering India’s energy security and sustainability ambitions.

Q. With India’s strong push towards biofuels, especially in light of the ethanol blending and export policies, do you foresee a significant increase in investment in India’s biofuel sector?

Ans: We have seen very significant investments in India’s biofuel infrastructure in the past few years, and in fact, that investment path has been so strong that it’s helped India achieve its 20% blend rate 5 years ahead of the initial timeline. With 20% blending being reached this year, it seems evident that there will be a pause in investments here in the coming year while the government works to reassess the balance of feedstock and what the future blend rate should be. From our outside perspective, it does look like India has potential to grow higher than 20% blend given the amount of feedstock available, and also with the new growth potential that could be unlocked through future agricultural productivity gains. This could potentially enable India to move closer towards the type of setup that, for example, Brazil has, where they’re planning an increase in their blending mandate from 27% to 30% ethanol, and still meeting all their goals in terms of food availability, energy independence and decarbonization.

Q. What role do you believe biofuels will play in India’s energy security strategy, and how can they help the country move towards achieving its net-zero emissions goals by 2070?

Ans: Biofuels are a critical tool here. India’s approach to biofuels have been very holistic and unique in many ways. Having already displaced 1/5 of the gasoline pool in road transport is an amazing accomplishment. The potential to add another 7% blend rate is certainly there for 1G ethanol. In addition to that comes the potential that 2G ethanol represents – which could significantly reduce emissions from the current baseline in not only transportation but potentially also in biochemical production (with ethanol being the precursor molecule). Down the road there could potentially also be a biodiesel blend that could be say 5 to 10%. Through SATAT scheme, the Government is also enabling development of biogas/ CBG ecosystem – one of the very few countries to have blending target in CNG vehicles and PNG supplies.

In this world, India has become one of the leading global forces in biofuels, and biofuel technology. As we think longer term, down the road there is also the potential for use of these biofuels in new areas such as sustainable aviation fuel and marine fuel (HVO). So, as we electrify more vehicles on the road, there’s potential to pivot some of that road biofuel towards airplanes, which will not be easily decarbonized with electric systems. Here India’s focus and investments in biofuels now, can position India as a leading player in these future markets.

Q. Looking ahead, what do you think the future holds for biofuels in India’s transport and energy sectors?

Ans: As with other regions and countries, I think India should play to its strengths. And that means thinking about what mix of different technologies are going to best suit the diverse needs of India across both the transport and energy segments. This means looking at different renewable technologies, be they solar, wind, biofuel, gasification or other technologies.

India does seem to have some of the same characteristics as countries like the US or Brazil, where you have very strong natural agricultural resources. India is also a very strong technology player and has a very strong and highly skilled workforce to build strong new renewable industry sectors. For those who lead the path, there is a real opportunity to become one of the leading global players in these future energy spaces. So, we believe there is a tremendous amount of opportunity for India when it comes to future renewable energy sources. For example, with the anticipated increase in CBG capacity and the implementation of blending targets for CNG supplies, India is poised to achieve largest volume substitution of natural gas with biogas/CBG in both transport and heating sectors.

Q. As India becomes a major player in the biofuels market, what do you think are the opportunities for international collaboration in terms of R&D, technology transfer?

Ans: India has the benefit of stepping into biofuels after several decades of technology development in the Americas. That also means that India has the potential to leapfrog and start with the newest technology and then adapt it to the specific needs of the Indian market. As such, we see a lot of potential for collaboration, both when it comes to engineering technology for bioethanol plants, as well as the biology that gets put into those biorefineries. As an example of that, we are currently working to make advanced yeast technology available early on for India to take advantage of. This is technology that has been developed in the US over several years, and India in this case has an opportunity to leapfrog to the latest generation of this technology early in the buildup of this industry. From here, we imagine India can also play a very strong role in developing new technology, for example when it comes to 2G ethanol, where we see India taking a leading role in beginning to build out this type of factory based on feedstocks that are uniquely suited to the India market, but also other global markets.

Q. As a leader in biosolutions, Novonesis is known for its innovative approach. Could you share some of the cutting-edge technologies or projects Novonesis is working on that could potentially revolutionize the biofuels industry, especially in emerging markets like India?

Ans: As I mentioned before, our advanced yeast technologies are some of the most important new technologies that we’re working to bring to our valued customers in India. These new advanced yeasts are both able to produce more ethanol, and they are also more robust toward a variety of changing production conditions. These new yeasts are also able to produce some of the enzymes that are necessary to run the bioethanol process, all in one simple biosolution. Looking beyond this type of yeast, we’re also looking to innovate new solutions that can help Indian bioethanol customers diversify their revenue streams. This includes new technologies for extracting more corn oil, that can be used as a feedstock, for example for biodiesel. Additionally, our biosolutions could upgrade the value of the DDGS, the animal feed product that also comes out of an ethanol plant, such that this feed component becomes more valuable to end customers. This provides a basis for a broader and more robust income base for bioethanol refineries in the future.

Novonesis also has a portfolio to augment biogas recovery/ yield by significant margins, helping improve the economics of the plants.

Q. Given Novonesis’ international footprint, how is the company engaging with countries like India to promote biofuel adoption, and what kinds of partnerships or collaborations are you exploring in the Indian market?

Ans: We work very closely with all the players across the value chain in the India biofuels market. That includes first and foremost our very dear customers as well as our close distribution partners. We also engage directly with a number of coalitions and stakeholders that support this industry, such as the Indian Federation for Green Energy, as well as other industry groups that support and contribute towards sustainable mobility and bioenergy. As such, we are seeking to make sure that we support the industry as a whole and help advocate for a balanced and sustainable approach to biofuels.

Q. In terms of scaling up 1G and 2G ethanol, what steps is Novonesis taking to reduce production costs and improve efficiency? How do you plan to address challenges for ethanol production?

Ans: We have been investing and innovating in biofuels for many decades, and we will continue to invest and innovate in biofuels for many more years to come. It means that we’re constantly looking for ways to improve productivity and profitability for our customers, as well as to drive value through diversification of revenue streams or other benefits that may help our customers sustain better operations. Over the past 10 years, we have thus helped our global customers improve their profitability every single year, year over year, with new technologies. We anticipate that this trend is going to continue both for 1G as well as for 2G, as we still see significant potential to improve and advance technologies for biofuels. So, we are very excited about continuing to innovate and support our customers and see this industry as holding significant promise for the future.

Q. Finally, as the biofuels industry faces both opportunities and challenges, what are Novonesis’ long-term goals in this sector? How do you envision your company contributing to the global push towards a greener, more sustainable energy future?",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hans-Ole-Klingenberg.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 09:01:15.749817

This change reflects decades of global conservation efforts. Despite ongoing threats, the green turtle population has risen by nearly 28 per cent since the 1970s. The species remains vital to marine ecosystems and human cultures worldwide.

Ecological Importance of Green Sea Turtles

Green turtles are keystone species in tropical marine environments. They maintain coral reefs and seagrass meadows, which support diverse marine life. Their grazing helps keep seagrass beds healthy and prevents overgrowth. These turtles also have cultural, spiritual, and economic roles in many coastal communities.

Conservation Measures Leading to Recovery

Efforts have focused on protecting nesting females and eggs on beaches. Community-based initiatives have reduced unsustainable harvesting for food and trade. The use of Turtle Excluder Devices in fishing gear has lowered accidental capture. Successful projects in Ascension Island, Brazil, Mexico, and Hawai’i have helped some subpopulations approach pre-exploitation numbers.

Remaining Threats to Green Turtles

Despite population gains, green turtles are still far below historic levels before European colonisation. Direct harvesting, both commercial and non-subsistence, remains a major threat. Fisheries bycatch causes mortality. Coastal and marine habitat destruction from development continues to harm nesting and feeding grounds.

Impact of Climate Change

Climate change is increasingly threatening green turtle habitats. Rising temperatures affect nesting beaches and hatchling survival. The Southwest Pacific subpopulation, including Raine Island in Australia, has seen declining hatchling production over several years. This signals urgent need for climate resilience in conservation plans.

Future Conservation Priorities

Sustained global conservation is essential to maintain and build on current recovery. Protecting habitats is as important as protecting turtles themselves. Healthy oceans and coasts are critical for turtle survival and human well-being. Coordinated efforts across countries and communities remain key to long-term success.",https://i0.wp.com/www.gktoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-13-10_41_40-AdobeStock_381020782_449435_reduced.jpg-1200%C3%97630.png?fit=1144%2C617&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-13 03:56:40.773328

IP Group PLC (LSE:IPO) CEO Greg Smith talked with Proactive's Stephen Gunnion about the group’s potential future royalties following Pfizer’s announcement that it is acquiring obesity drug developer Metsera.

The transaction valued the business at up to $7.3bn, including $4.9bn in upfront cash. Metsera has a portfolio of promising therapeutic candidates and combinations with four programmes in clinical development and several next-generation programmes with IND-enabling studies ongoing, aimed at addressing key unmet needs via fewer injections while achieving improved efficacy and tolerability.

Smith explained that IP Group is the licensor of the fundamental technology behind Metsera’s lead compounds. If those drugs are approved and reach the market, Smith said the company could benefit from “some quite substantial royalties.”

He added that Metsera aims to begin Phase 3 trials by the end of 2025, with analysts forecasting first sales by 2029 or 2030. Smith said the underlying technology originated from the work of Professor Stephen Bloom at Imperial College in London.

Smith also addressed how this royalty stream could shape IP Group’s long-term strategy, suggesting that ongoing revenue might support its permanent capital model.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a critical solution, but its high costs and limited supply have hindered adoption. Blockchain technology is now reshaping SAF supply chains, accelerating ESG compliance and unlocking new revenue streams through transparency, tokenization, and market innovation.

Accelerating ESG Compliance: Transparency and Trust

Blockchain's

ledger technology addresses a core challenge in SAF: verifying environmental claims without double-counting. , Accenture, and Amex Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) launched Avelia, a blockchain-powered book-and-claim platform, to track SAF's environmental attributes. By mid-2025, Avelia had facilitated 33 million gallons of SAF usage, avoiding 300,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions, according to . The platform's distributed network ensures that airlines and corporations can share credits for emissions reductions, enabling stakeholders to report progress toward ESG goals with confidence, as covered by .

This transparency is critical for ESG compliance. For instance, Shell Aviation has committed to abating 45% of its corporate travel emissions through SAF by 2030 (as reported in Sustainability Magazine). Avelia's co-investment model allows businesses to share the premium costs of SAF, reducing financial barriers and fostering collaboration (also described in the Sustainability Magazine piece). As Eva Wan, Shell Aviation's head of aviation digital strategy, explains, blockchain creates a ""single source of truth"" for stakeholders, ensuring credibility in emissions reporting (as discussed by NRI Digital).

Unlocking Revenue Streams: Carbon Credits, Tokenization, and Market Expansion

Beyond compliance, blockchain is enabling SAF supply chains to generate revenue through innovative mechanisms.

Carbon Credit Trading: Blockchain streamlines carbon credit management by automating verification and transactions via smart contracts. A 2024 World Economic Forum study found that blockchain-enabled supply chains can reduce emissions by 10–15% through optimized logistics and transparent reporting (

). For SAF, this means verifiable carbon credits can be traded in real time, aligning with regulatory frameworks like the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, as noted in the sustainability study.

Tokenized Assets: Platforms like Avelia are tokenizing SAF's environmental attributes, creating digital assets that represent ownership of emissions reductions. These tokens can be traded or used to meet corporate sustainability targets (reported in the Decripto article). Tokenization also extends to raw materials and production processes, enabling traceability from feedstock to fuel. For example, IoT sensors integrated with blockchain can cryptographically hash data on CO₂ levels and geolocation, ensuring compliance with sustainability standards (as described by NRI Digital).

Market Creation: Blockchain is fostering new markets for SAF by addressing scalability issues. Avelia's ""Bring Your Own SAF"" feature allows companies to contribute their own SAF to the platform, increasing flexibility and participation (covered in the Decripto piece). This model has attracted major players like Google, Delta Air Lines, and Bank of America, demonstrating the platform's scalability (reported in Sustainability Magazine).

Challenges and the Road Ahead

Despite its promise, blockchain-enabled SAF faces hurdles. Scalability and interoperability remain technical challenges, while energy consumption of blockchain networks raises sustainability concerns (highlighted in the sustainability study). Additionally, small-scale producers may lack access to these technologies, risking inequity in the transition to SAF.

However, the pace of innovation is accelerating. By 2025, Avelia is expanding to air freight, broadening its impact (as noted in Sustainability Magazine). Meanwhile, advancements in IoT and smart contracts are reducing costs and improving data accuracy (as reported by NRI Digital).

Conclusion: A Strategic Investment Opportunity

Blockchain is not just a compliance tool-it's a catalyst for transforming SAF supply chains into revenue-generating ecosystems. For investors, the convergence of ESG mandates, carbon markets, and technological innovation presents a compelling opportunity. As the aviation sector races to meet net-zero targets, blockchain-enabled platforms like Avelia will play a pivotal role in scaling SAF and monetizing sustainability.",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd2e8a97cbc002.png,N,,2025-10-13 04:56:10.789279

Thai Seaplane has commissioned the Faculty of Environment at Kasetsart University to conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA.
“To mitigate impacts, our engines and propellers are mounted above the fuselage, preventing collisions with marine life,” Mr Kasinpoj explained.
Thai Seaplane has partnered with **Thalang Technical College** to provide **scholarships and mechanic training**, preparing local youth for aviation-related jobs.
“We want Phuket’s young people to build their futures here, not have to leave the island,” Mr Kasinpoj said.","Mr Rodko told The Phuket News the initiative aims to make Phuket the regional hub for seaplane travel across the Andaman Sea, offering short, direct flights between the island and key destinations such as the Similan Islands, Krabi and Koh Lipe.

“Phuket will serve as the main gateway,” Mr Kasinpoj told The Phuket News. “Passengers will be able to land here and connect directly to nearby islands. We aim to reduce travel time, strengthen tourism, and create new opportunities for the local community.”

The company is currently awaiting final operational approval from the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) and the new Phuket Governor, following advice from Vice Governor Samawit Suphanphai to allow time for review. The seaplane operator is also coordinating with the Aeronautical Radio of Thailand (Aerothai) on the testing phase.

If approved, Thai Seaplane will initially bring in five aircraft, expanding to a fleet of 30 within five years, Mr Kasinpoj said.

“Each aircraft can carry up to 10 passengers, with retractable wheels allowing them to take off and land on both land and water,” he added.

The company’s first seaplane, registered ‘HS-TSP’, is now stationed in Phuket. The chosen hub site will be off Koh Taphao Yai, off Phuket’s east coast, selected for its calm, deep water and proximity to Phuket Town.

The water-based ‘runway’ requires only 600 metres of surface and a depth of 30-50cm, which Mr Kasinpoj said makes operations “less disruptive than traditional boats or ferries”.

He highlighted the time savings compared to existing routes:

* Phuket Airport to the Deep Sea Port: 10 minutes

* Phuket to Koh Kradan: 25 minutes (instead of 5–6 hours by boat)

* Phuket to Koh Lipe: 40 minutes

* Phuket to Krabi: 15 minutes

* Phuket to Koh Phi Phi: 10 minutes, with an estimated fare of about B4,000 (US$120) per trip.

The service will initially connect Phuket and Trang under a controlled testing ‘Sandbox’ programme hoped to launch next month, allowing Aerothai to monitor environmental effects, including engine noise, oil residue, and coral impact. If results show no negative effects, commercial operations could begin by mid-2026, Mr Kasinpoj explained.

Thai Seaplane has commissioned the Faculty of Environment at Kasetsart University to conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment (EIA. The study covers marine ecosystems, air and water quality, and the potential effects on coral reefs and marine mammals such as dugongs.

“To mitigate impacts, our engines and propellers are mounted above the fuselage, preventing collisions with marine life,” Mr Kasinpoj explained. “Unlike speedboats, seaplanes don’t produce underwater vortexes that damage coral reefs.”

The company also plans to transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and recycled oils in the near future to lower its carbon footprint.

All EIA results and community feedback will be made public once the report is finalised. “We’re committed to transparency and ensuring safety and sustainability,” said Mr Kasinpoj.

Beyond tourism, the company aims to strengthen Phuket’s aviation workforce. Thai Seaplane has partnered with **Thalang Technical College** to provide **scholarships and mechanic training**, preparing local youth for aviation-related jobs. Each aircraft will require about **six pilots** and a full team of mechanics and ground crew, creating long-term employment opportunities for residents.

“We want Phuket’s young people to build their futures here, not have to leave the island,” Mr Kasinpoj said. “Our goal is to grow a Thai-led aviation sector that connects communities and opens the skies to new possibilities.”

Thai Seaplane currently has five pilots, including two licensed Thai seaplane pilots ‒ the first in the country ‒ trained in Germany and the Maldives with Trans Maldivian Airways (TMA), the world’s largest seaplane operator. Future Thai captains will be trained under a mentorship model, with one foreign captain training up to five local pilots at a time.

The project, entirely privately financed, will also support emergency medical transport and strategic operations in addition to tourism.

Over the next three years, the company expects to expand routes to cover the entire southern region, with Phase 3 connecting the Andaman Coast to the Gulf of Thailand.

“This project is about more than transport,” Mr Kasinpoj said. “It’s about positioning Phuket as the leader in sustainable aviation, where air and sea meet ‒ connecting people, protecting nature, and strengthening the region’s economy.”",https://www.thephuketnews.com/photo/listing/2025/1760328092_1-org.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 01:58:34.298330
