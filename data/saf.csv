Speaking at a media roundtable in Singapore on Wednesday, IATA Director-General Willie Walsh said, “Transporting sustainable fuel from one region to Europe just to meet a mandate isn’t the solution. Doing so actually adds to the fuel’s carbon footprint.”

Sustainable aviation fuel is considered a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, but global production remains low. IATA estimates that SAF production will reach just 2 million metric tons in 2025, only about 0.7% of what airlines are expected to consume that year.

As per news report, Walsh also pointed out the disconnect between policy and reality. “If you require the use of a fuel that isn’t widely available, you’re not making any real environmental progress,” he said. He further noted that the push for SAF production is also driving up the cost of regular jet fuel, placing additional financial strain on the airline industry.

The EU has implemented targets to increase SAF usage in aviation as part of its broader climate goals, but IATA argues that without enough regional production capacity, such mandates may end up doing more harm than good.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-10.png,N,,2025-07-16 23:06:24.634369

Established by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), APSAC aims to help countries in the region strike a balance between economic growth and environmental responsibility. It will focus on practical areas such as the development of cleaner aviation fuels, carbon auditing, and carbon market strategies.

The non-profit centre will also serve as a hub for collaboration, bringing together governments, industry leaders, and academic institutions to work on joint projects. It will provide technical assistance and training to support the creation and implementation of sustainable aviation policies across Asia-Pacific.

While the centre’s physical location has yet to be announced, all operations—including staffing and infrastructure—will be fully funded by CAAS.

CAAS has formed an advisory board to guide APSAC’s work. The board includes senior leaders from major aviation, energy, and finance players such as Airbus, Boeing, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Neste, Singapore-based investment platform GenZero, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). A memorandum of understanding was signed on July 14 to formalize this partnership.

Singaporean officials believe air travel demand in the Asia-Pacific region will triple in the next two decades. At the same time, many countries in the region are setting net-zero emissions goals, creating a need for solutions that support both growth and sustainability.

Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS and Chair of APSAC, said the new centre would offer countries a range of policy tools suited to their national needs. “Countries in the Asia-Pacific are looking for ways to grow responsibly. This centre will help them move forward with practical options,” he said.

Australian and UK partners trialled the fuel technology in a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft for a special VIP flight.

SAF is a certified ‘drop-in’ fuel used in both military and civilian aviation around the world.

When blended with fossil-derived fuel in accordance with international standards, It requires no modifications to aircraft or fuel infrastructure and has the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to fossil-derived fuel.

The SAF used on this mission, fuelling a 33 Squadron MRTT aircraft at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, ahead of a TS25 mission was supplied through Defence’s strategic fuel partner, Viva Energy.

Director General Fuel Capability, Brigadier Mark Baldock, says Talisman Sabre provides a valuable opportunity to trial new fuel technologies in a realistic operational setting.

“This is about improving energy security. Proving the viability of alternate fuels enhances fuel resilience by diversifying our supply chains. There is also the important benefit of reducing emissions, ” Brigadier Baldock said.

“Exercises like Talisman Sabre gives us a perfect opportunity to work with industry and international partners to trial next-generational fuels in ways that support capability and climate resilience.”

“We are building upon our current fuel system to ensure that it is fit for the future. We are doing it in lockstep with our industry partners, our international allies, and our own people on the ground and in the air.”

Flight Lieutenant Michael Que Hee, a pilot at 33 Squadron flying the mission, says that from a user perspective the switch to SAF was seamless.

“From the cockpit, there’s no difference, the aircraft flies exactly the same,” Flight Lieutenant Que Hee said.

“Knowing we are helping to enhance the fuel supply chain and reducing emissions just by doing our job makes it even more rewarding.”

Aircraft technician Leading Aircraftman Tikiri Lamb involved in the VIP flight preparation, echoed the same sentiment from the tarmac.

“With the same equipment and process, it’s just like refuelling with standard aviation fuel,” Leading Aircraftman Lamb said.

“It’s great knowing we are contributing to something bigger, while still doing our job the same way we always do.”

SAF is made from renewable feedstocks like used cooking oil, waste fats, and pant oils. It is part of a broader effort to accelerate Defence’s transition to cleaner energy in support of fuel security and resilience.

Defence’s use of SAF reflects key objectives outlined in the 2024 National Defence Strategy, the Defence Net Zero Strategy, and the Defence Future Energy Strategy, driving greater energy independence, climate responsibility, and fuel security.

""Like so many people across Colorado, you probably didn't know that CDOT does things with aviation across the state,” said David Ulane, CDOT’s aeronautics division director.
Nine employees within the Colorado Department of Transportation work exclusively on aviation projects, supporting the state's 76 public-use airports from Denver International Airport to the small Mineral County Airport in Creede.
The aeronautics division's work includes funding airport infrastructure projects, like helping pay for a runway at Del Norte's airport in southern Colorado.
It’s usually a federal funding factor in there usually, but this airport’s not eligible for federal funding,” said Shahn Sederberg, CDOT’s aeronautics division communications manager.","COLORADO, USA — Out of thousands of Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) employees, there are nine people that cannot complain about highway traffic.

""Like so many people across Colorado, you probably didn't know that CDOT does things with aviation across the state,” said David Ulane, CDOT’s aeronautics division director.

Nine employees within the Colorado Department of Transportation work exclusively on aviation projects, supporting the state's 76 public-use airports from Denver International Airport to the small Mineral County Airport in Creede.

""There's 3,300 people or so that work for CDOT. There's precisely nine of us that don't do surface transportation,"" Ulane said.

The aeronautics division is funded entirely through state aviation fuel taxes:

2.9% state sales tax on jet fuel

4 cents per gallon for non-commercial users

6 cents per gallon for users like single engine airplanes

The current budget for CDOT aeronautics division is $53 million, all from aviation fuel taxes. None of it relies on the state’s general fund or federal grants. During COVID, when air travel plummeted, the budget was $17 million in 2021.

“Our revenue goes up and down as fuel sales go up and down,” Ulane said.

The aeronautics division's work includes funding airport infrastructure projects, like helping pay for a runway at Del Norte's airport in southern Colorado.

“We built a runway, which is really unheard of to do with state and local funds. It’s usually a federal funding factor in there usually, but this airport’s not eligible for federal funding,” said Shahn Sederberg, CDOT’s aeronautics division communications manager.

Sederberg shared the story of a Del Norte teacher who was able to be life-flighted out of the Del Norte airport to Pueblo, likely saving her life.

“The teacher was successfully life-flighted to Pueblo for emergency surgery instead of facing a potentially fatal ambulance ride to Alamosa,” Sederberg said. ""It was really cool to see someone who never uses the airport for anything else, but in that situation, saved their lives.”

The division also operates 13 high-altitude aviation weather stations that provide real-time weather information to pilots at locations including Berthoud Pass, Copper Mountain, Sunlight and Monarch Pass. In 2020, CDOT added aviation weather cameras to all 13 stations.

""It used to be only Canada and Alaska prior to 2020 that had any dots,"" Ulane said, referring to the weather camera network map. ""We know somehow, somewhere that what we did is going to keep somebody from perishing in an aircraft accident.”

The division also administers a surplus airport equipment program, helping smaller airports acquire expensive snow removal equipment from Denver International Airport at reduced costs. Denver sells used snow blowers worth $800,000 to $900,000 new for $50,000, with CDOT covering 80% of the cost.

“Those pieces of equipment are several $100,000 and for small airports like, let's say, Granby or Kremmling, that's something that may be out of the reach of those local airports,” Ulane said. ""For $10,000, a small community can have a very nice piece of snow removal equipment that they would not otherwise have.”

Looking ahead, the division is preparing for emerging aviation technologies including battery electric airplanes, hydrogen hybrid aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel, which will require new infrastructure considerations.

""Because right now, there's no aircraft charging stations in Colorado, and they take a lot more power than, let's say, a Tesla or something else,"" Ulane said.

These nine CDOT workers have to drive to Watkins to get to their office. Just don’t ask them about road conditions.

""When I walk around with the CDOT logo on my shirt, I get questions a lot, ‘Well, what the heck's going on with I-25 or I-70?” And I'm like, ‘I don't know, but if you've got any issues with airports, let's talk,'"" Sederberg said.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/dfe47df6-1d00-41c5-952c-314e4931c778/20250717T002125/dfe47df6-1d00-41c5-952c-314e4931c778_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-16 23:06:42.727737

""This project proves that profitable SAF production doesn't have to wait on future infrastructure,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics.
""We're proud to bring our FT technology into a project that's changing the game,"" said Matthew Viergutz, CEO of Velocys.
“Legacy FT technology drives up cost and complexity at a time when projects need to move faster and prove bankability,” Viergutz said.
Syzygy Plasmonics earlier this year announced the launch of front-end engineering and design (FEED) with Kent for the NovaSAF 1 project.","Velocys on July 16 announced it will supply its Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology to an electrified biogas-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project under development in Uruguay by Syzygy Plasmonics. The proposed facility, NovaSAF 1, will convert dairy waste into SAF using only renewable electricity and waste-derived gases.

A final investment decision on the project is expected to be made during the fourth quarter of 2025, with planned operations commencing in early 2027. Once fully operational, the project is expected to have the capacity to produce 500,000 gallons of SAF annually.

Houston-based Syzygy Plasmonics has developed light-driven chemical reactors that electrify and decarbonize fuel and chemical production. The NovaSAF platform converts biogenic CO2 and methane into ultra-low carbon fuels using renewable electricity. According to the company, this e-reforming technology produces the ideal 2:1 hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide syngas ratio for FT synthesis directly from biogenic methane and CO2. Syzygy Plasmonics said the process eliminates the need for water-intensive steam reforming or expensive electrolyzers, which radically simplifies the SAF value chain.

Velocys’ micoFTL reactor system, a modular FT technology package, will convert the resulting syngas into SAF. Velocys announced the commercial launch of microFTL in June. According to the company, microFTL combines microchannel FT reactors, a high-activity catalyst engineered at Oxford University, and deep FT process expertise, creating a scalable, cost-efficient, ready-to-deploy technology package that increases yield while lowering both CapEx and OpEx.

""This project proves that profitable SAF production doesn't have to wait on future infrastructure,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""With Velocys, we're bringing in a complete, modular solution that drives down overall production costs and is ready to scale. Uruguay is only the start.""

""We're proud to bring our FT technology into a project that's changing the game,"" said Matthew Viergutz, CEO of Velocys. ""This is what innovation looks like—fast, flexible, and focused on making SAF production affordable.""

In its June announcement, Velocys explained that conventional FT systems were designed for fossil-based megaprojects. “Legacy FT technology drives up cost and complexity at a time when projects need to move faster and prove bankability,” Viergutz said. “microFTL is different. It’s efficient, modular, and already proven with a variety of feedstocks. We’re giving developers and integrators the tool they need to bring low-carbon fuels to market—at a cost that increases project value.”

Velocys microFTL technology has already been deployed in a landfill gas-to-diesel project in Oklahoma and a biomass-to-SAF project in Japan.

This pivotal development, announced on July 10, 2025, comes at a crucial juncture for the aviation industry. While SAF is widely recognized as the most viable immediate solution for reducing life cycle GHG emissions in aviation—with the potential to cut emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel when used neat—its production remains severely limited. Current estimates from IATA project that SAF production in 2025 will reach only 2.1 million tonnes, representing a mere 0.7% of total jet fuel production.

Since its launch in 2022, Avelia has established itself as a frontrunner in scaling SAF adoption. The platform enables companies to access the GHG benefits of SAF without being constrained by its physical availability at specific locations, thanks to its innovative ""book and claim"" mechanism. As of March 31, 2025, Avelia had already garnered the participation of over 57 corporations and airlines. This collective effort has led to the injection of over 33 million gallons of SAF into the global fuel network across 17 airport injection points worldwide, resulting in a substantial abatement of over 300,000 tonnes of CO2e.

The expanded Avelia platform introduces several key functionalities designed to enhance transparency, flexibility, and industry participation. A major change is the shift to independent data hosting, with Accenture now responsible for managing all platform data.

Furthermore, Avelia is evolving from a single-supplier platform (previously only accepting SAF supplied by Shell) to a multi-supplier solution. This significant change will allow users, including airlines, corporations, and freight forwarders, to access and manage the GHG benefits of SAF from various suppliers.

In another groundbreaking move, Avelia is looking to introduce a BYOS (Bring Your Own SAF) model. This feature will empower airlines to manage a larger portion of their SAF portfolio within Avelia, including SAF purchased outside of Shell's supply network or SAF that would otherwise have been tracked offline. The BYOS model is expected to further support the credibility of book and claim solutions at an industry level and significantly accelerate SAF adoption by providing a unified, digital registry.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-16 16:18:39.251494

Q&A: Ships to use bioblends to comply with new IMO rule

Q&A: Ships to use bioblends to comply with new IMO rule

Sao Paulo, 15 July (Argus) — Bioblends are the best short-term option for ships to comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations set to be approved in October, according to Andrea Lucchesi , professor at the University of Sao Paulo and an expert on the impact of maritime regulations. Lucchesi, who presented research on the potential economic impacts of the IMO-approved carbon pricing mechanism at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) 83 in April, spoke to Argus about the recent IMO agreement and the future of decarbonization in shipping. Edited highlights follow. Under the current IMO carbon pricing mechanism, which fuel emerges as the main solution for decarbonization? New studies are being conducted in this regard. As the details of the mechanism will still be defined in October, there is no clarity regarding the next bunker fuels, especially because we cannot just consider the decarbonization potential, but also the cost of port infrastructure and vessel adaptation. Also, the ports will adapt very slowly. What I can say is that the first fuel to be adopted in the transition phase will be the marine biofuel blends, because of their economic viability, emissions reduction potential and supply availability. Is the agreement, as it progressed in MEPC 83, economically and environmentally successful? The agreement approved on 11 April is historic. It is the result of more than seven years of negotiation and is the first to regulate an entire sector of the economy at the international level. Therefore, we consider the agreement a success, even though it has been modified from its initial design, and it is sufficient to achieve the goal of decarbonizing the maritime sector by 2050. Have the GHG reduction targets been made too flexible over the many years of debate? The study I conducted for the IMO aimed to measure the impact of this pricing mechanism, because if we try to accelerate decarbonization beyond market capacity, we will see very strong consequences, especially in developing countries. A more rigid goal is not appropriate. Do you believe the agreement will be approved in October as it was designed, despite the US opposing the measure? Yes. The US will try to influence the matter, but there is considerable support for the measures. They have already been widely debated in recent years. Is the mechanism, as it progressed in the April meetings, economically viable for the entire maritime chain to adapt? The agreement will impact countries very differently. We were careful to assess the impacts on food inflation and the potential impact on malnutrition in developing countries. There will be socioeconomic impacts, so the measures needed to be gradual, as they will be. For example, there needs to be time for ships to be retrofitted, investment in technical measures to increase efficiency, and fuel replacement. Another point is that port technology needs to be adapted. Therefore, the mechanism should begin pricing in 2028, with reduction targets ranging from a modest 4-17pc for the first year. In any case, the sector will have to adapt, because the agreement will be effective in punishing those who do not comply. This agreement will work. The IMO is an institution with the capacity to effectively monitor and punish, and there are mechanisms in place to do so. How much is expected to be raised from the carbon pricing? The revenue generation potential, as it stands today, is $1bn/yr in the initial years, with a growth trend in subsequent years. This revenue is intended to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of the mechanism on small island nations and developing countries.

Overview of Air Travel’s Environmental Impact

Air travel is essential for connecting people and goods but has significant environmental impacts. The aviation industry contributes 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, a figure likely to rise with increased travel. Additionally, aviation fuel combustion releases greenhouse gases like nitrogen oxides, exacerbating climate change. Other environmental effects include noise pollution, habitat disruption, and resource depletion from aircraft manufacturing and maintenance.

The Urgency of Addressing Carbon Emissions

As climate change worsens, reducing carbon emissions is crucial. The IPCC stresses the need for significant cuts in greenhouse gases across all sectors, including transportation, to keep global warming below 1.5°C. Being aware of our carbon footprint, especially when flying, is vital for sustainability. Each flight adds to environmental damage, and informed travel choices can contribute to meaningful climate action.

Taking Action: Simple Steps to Reduce Your Environmental Footprint

While the challenge of climate change can seem daunting, small actions, when taken collectively, can lead to substantial progress. Here are practical steps that travelers can adopt to reduce their environmental impact:

Choose Alternative Transport: For shorter distances, consider taking trains or buses, which typically have a lower carbon footprint compared to flying.

Opt for Direct Flights: If air travel is necessary, select direct flights over connecting ones. Takeoffs and landings are fuel-intensive, so reducing these stages helps cut emissions.

Travel Light: Packing less reduces the weight of the aircraft, improving fuel efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.

Support Sustainable Airlines: Choose airlines that prioritize sustainability and have initiatives like carbon offset programs or investments in fuel-efficient aircraft.

Offset Your Carbon Emissions: Consider purchasing carbon offsets for your flights, which fund renewable energy, reforestation, and other projects that help neutralize the emissions generated by your air travel.

Be Mindful of Frequency: Assess the necessity of each trip. Could a meeting be conducted virtually instead? Reducing the frequency of flights can significantly lower overall emissions.

Advocate for Change: Support policies and initiatives that promote sustainable aviation and invest in research for greener technologies. Encouraging systemic change amplifies individual efforts.

By adopting these practices, travelers can contribute to a collective effort toward more sustainable air travel, supporting the fight against climate change.

Understanding Your Carbon Footprint in Air Travel

What is a Carbon Footprint?

A carbon footprint measures the total greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, produced by an individual, organization, or activity. In the context of air travel, this refers to the emissions associated with flights.

Air Travel Emissions

Compared to other modes of transportation, air travel is far more carbon intensive. The carbon footprint of a flight varies depending on factors like flight distance (short, medium, or long) and the type of aircraft.

Emission Estimates:

Short-Haul Flights: Typically result in more emissions per kilometer traveled, as takeoffs and landings consume a disproportionate amount of fuel.

Long-Haul Flights: While these flights may cover greater distances, they can sometimes be more fuel-efficient per passenger due to sustained cruising altitudes.

Why Corporate Travelers Should Care

Businesses play a crucial role in combating climate change through sustainable travel practices. By implementing eco-friendly policies, companies can reduce their carbon footprint, enhance their reputation, and gain a competitive advantage as clients expect responsible practices.

How to Offset Your Carbon Footprint

Understanding Carbon Offsetting

Carbon offsetting involves investing in projects that reduce or capture carbon emissions, such as reforestation or renewable energy projects, to balance out the emissions generated by your travel.

Carbon Offset Programs

Numerous carbon offset programs are available through airlines, third-party platforms, and environmental organizations. When choosing a provider, look for transparency, certification, and measurable impact to ensure your investment leads to tangible emissions reductions.

Sustainable Airline Choices

Many airlines are now adding sustainability programs to their operations. They invest in fuel-efficient planes and start carbon offset programs. Choosing airlines with good sustainability practices can help lower your environmental impact.

Practical Tips for Reducing Your Carbon Footprint While Traveling

Flying Direct vs. Connecting Flights: Direct flights are more fuel-efficient since takeoffs and landings are the most fuel-intensive stages of air travel.

Pack Light: Reducing luggage weight can improve fuel efficiency, leading to lower carbon emissions.

Choose Economy Class: Flying economy class reduces your carbon footprint per passenger, as it allows more people to share the flight’s total emissions.

Emerging Technologies in Sustainable Aviation

As a traveler, there is only so much you can do with the options available to you. The positive is that the travel industry is aware of its impact on the climate and is actively working on new technology to help lessen its impact on the world. Some key new ways airlines are taking initiative:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from renewable resources, that has the potential to significantly reduce aviation emissions. As SAF becomes more widely adopted, it could play a major role in making air travel more sustainable.

Electric Aircraft

Electric planes are still being developed. They could change the aviation industry by removing emissions from short regional flights.

Advanced Aircraft Designs

Next-generation aircraft are being designed for better fuel efficiency, utilizing lightweight materials, improved aerodynamics, and more efficient engines, all of which reduce overall emissions.

Mike Berners-Lee is the author of A Climate of Truth: Why we need it and how to get it","To fly or not to fly? That is the question environmentally conscious people are increasingly grappling with. Sometimes taking the plane seems the only viable option, perhaps when time is tight or when a loved one lives far away.

I think we can have some flying as part of a sustainable future – but only if we put a few misleading myths to rest and instead lay out some realistic opportunities to cut its impact on global warming.

The first myth is that so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can solve the problem. It is a complete misnomer, as SAF turns out not to be sustainable at all.

Here’s why. There are three main types of SAF. The first is fuel from waste products, especially cooking oil. The problem is, the whole world’s waste cooking oil supply would be enough to power only 2 to 3 per cent of flights. The second is synthetic SAF, produced from raw materials such as captured carbon dioxide using energy from renewable sources. The process involved is so inefficient (at least 2 kilowatt-hours of electricity input per 1 kWh of fuel generated) that it is a self-defeating use of our limited renewable power. The third type of SAF is created from crops, so needs a lot of farmland. The detrimental pressure that this puts on both our food system and on nature is a big problem. The hard reality is that sustainable aviation fuel really isn’t a “game changer”.

The next piece of wishful thinking I often come across is that we can decarbonise aviation through electrification or by using hydrogen as a fuel. Electrification will be practical only for short-haul flights because the weight of batteries renders it unworkable for long-haul operations. Hydrogen is tricky because it takes up so much space, even when compressed to 700 times atmospheric pressure. This means it needs to be stored in large, pressurised cylinders, making it unfeasibly bulky compared with liquid fuels.

The good news is that I also see some clear opportunities that aren’t getting enough attention.

The closest thing we have to an elusive silver bullet to make aviation greener has flown under the radar until very recently. Contrails – those high, cloud-like streaks left by aircraft engine exhaust fumes – account for over 60 per cent of the climate change impact of all our flights, and much more if you look at the short-term impacts over, say, 20 years.

They do this by reflecting heat released at Earth’s surface back down, acting like a blanket. But the overall impact of a contrail is complex. Not only do they trap Earth’s radiant heat, but on a sunny day they can have a cooling effect by reflecting incoming sun rays. This happens only in the daytime, and they cool most when contrails are above a darker surface, such as an ocean. The more frequent, warming effect happens most at night when they occur over warm, dark surfaces.

It is possible to manage contrails by making small tweaks to flight paths: taking a plane above, below or around a specific pocket of weather that will cause them to form. When flying over a sunny ocean, it may even be an advantage to deliberately create them. Small tweaks to just 1.7 per cent of all flight paths could have the effect of cutting the contrail warming impact by nearly 60 per cent. All that is required is some real-time modelling built into the flight path calculation, and no more flexibility than is already routinely applied to avoid storms and other aircraft.

It is a relatively cheap solution, one that just needs the aviation industry to get behind it. Once contrail management is in place, there may even be a role for SAF, as it burns more cleanly and could be used to mitigate contrails on the worst-offending flights.

Does this mean we can all relax about the climate impact of flying? Sadly not. But it might help us continue to fly when we have a good enough reason to do so.

Neste will supply 7,400 tonnes of neat SAF at Singapore Changi Airport from July 2025 to July 2026.

In line with plans to decarbonise its operations, DHL Express has agreed a year-long sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply at Singapore Changi Airport.

The CORSIA-eligible fuel is being supplied by SAF produced locally at Neste’s refinery in Singapore.

The deal marks one of Asia’s largest SAF deals by volume in the air cargo sector. It is also one of the largest SAF agreements purchased by DHL in Asia-Pacific and marks the company’s first direct purchase of SAF for flights between Singapore, Asia and the Americas.

Carly Nyberg, senior vice president, commercial, renewable products at Neste said: “the agreement leverages SAF production and supply capabilities in Singapore.”

He also noted it “demonstrates how Neste is working with DHL globally to help the company achieve its air transportation decarbonisation targets using a solution that is available at scale today.”

How will the SAF be used?

Neste’s MY SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. The SAF, which can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel, reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle.

The blended fuel will be delivered into Changi Airport’s fuel distribution facilities using the Neste’s integrated supply chain from its Singapore refinery.

The fuel will account for up to 40% of the overall fuel blend composition and will be used to refuel DHL Express’ five Boeing 777 freighters based at DHL’s South Asia Hub at Changi. The freighters currently depart from the airport 12 times a week.

Describing the agreement as a “significant milestone,” Christopher Ong, DHL Express Singapore’s managing director, said, it will “enable us to gain new strides in emissions reduction in air transport.” It will also allow customers to benefit from more sustainable shipping options.

“As one of the largest users of SAF globally, DHL Express is leading the way towards more sustainable logistics and driving voluntary demand for SAF adoption,” Ong added. “We’re not just meeting the industry standards but setting them.”

How much SAF does Neste’s Singapore refinery produce?

Neste’s Singapore presence started in 2007 when it announced plans to build the world’s largest renewable diesel refinery in the country. The facility originally opened in 2010, with expansion plans revealed in 2018 to double the facility.

The €1.6 billion investment in its Singapore refinery provided Neste with additional production capabilities. In addition to renewable diesel and renewable feedstock for polymers and chemicals, production capabilities for SAF were introduced when the expanded facility opened in 2023.

The refinery’s total production capacity currently stands at to 2.6 million tonnes of fuel annually. This includes up to one million tonnes of SAF.

The SAF supplied to DHL will contribute to Singapore’s SAF mandate. From 2026, all airlines departing from the country will be required to use SAF, with a 1% target uplift initially. This will rise to 3-5% by 2030.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DHL.jpg,N,,2025-07-16 13:21:21.991839

The Dawn of a New Fuel: Green Diesel's Ascendant Market

The green diesel market is experiencing a period of unprecedented expansion, driven by a global imperative to mitigate climate change and enhance energy security. Unlike traditional biodiesel, green diesel is a hydrocarbon produced through advanced hydrotreating processes, making it a ""drop-in"" fuel that requires no engine or infrastructure modifications. This critical advantage is fueling its rapid adoption across the transportation sector. The primary impetus for this growth stems from robust government policies, such as the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the United States and the European Union's Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), which mandate the blending of renewable fuels. The increasing shift toward sustainable energy is a core driver for the market's future. Corporate sustainability pledges and the financial incentives created by Low Carbon Fuel Standards (LCFS) and carbon credit programs are further accelerating market penetration, creating a powerful economic case for both producers and consumers of this cleaner alternative fuel. This confluence of regulatory pressure, corporate responsibility, and technological readiness has set the stage for a significant scaling of the green diesel industry through 2025 and beyond.

Titans of the Tank: Profiling Green Diesel's Production Heavyweights

The green diesel market is led by a cadre of established energy giants and specialized biofuel producers who are aggressively expanding their production capabilities. Neste Oyj, a Finnish company, stands as a global leader, reporting substantial revenues of USD 21,601.1 million in 2024. In the United States, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), a joint venture between Valero Energy and Darling Ingredients, is a dominant force with a total annual production capacity of 1.2 billion gallons across its two facilities. The DGD plant in Norco, Louisiana, alone boasts a capacity of 982 million gallons per year. In the first quarter of 2024, DGD's sales volumes averaged 3.7 million gallons per day, generating an operating income of $190 million. Phillips 66 is another key U.S. player, having expanded its Rodeo, California, plant to a capacity of 800 million gallons in 2024, making it the second-largest facility of its kind in the country. Chevron Corporation also remains a leading producer, with its renewables division contributing to the company's strong Q4 2024 earnings of $3.2 billion. Meanwhile, Repsol of Spain made waves in October 2024 by launching ""Nexa,"" its brand of 100% renewable diesel, directly at its service stations.

Unveiling 2025's Most Promising Startup Ventures

Beyond the established players, a new wave of innovative startups and targeted investment is broadening the horizons of the green diesel market. In Nebraska, the Love's Heartwell Renewables plant is on schedule to commence operations in 2025, adding 80 million gallons of annual capacity to the U.S. supply. Demonstrating the rapid pace of development, New Rise Renewables began its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in Reno, Nevada, in February 2025, with a capacity to produce up to 3,000 barrels per day. In a significant technological adoption, Acelen Renewables announced in 2024 its use of Honeywell's advanced Ecofining technology, targeting a production of 20,000 barrels per day of both renewable diesel and SAF. A notable investment in Canada's growing market comes from Imperial Oil, an ExxonMobil affiliate, which is investing around $560 million to construct the nation's largest renewable diesel facility; this plant is expected to start producing 20,000 barrels per day in 2025. Highlighting the emergence of novel production pathways, Swiss cleantech firm Synhelion, which creates fuel from solar energy, is poised to enter the market, backed by key offtake agreements.

Charting Worldwide Green Diesel Production Volumes

Global production in the green diesel market is surging, with the United States taking a decisive lead in capacity expansion. U.S. renewable diesel production capacity was forecast to hit an impressive 5.1 billion gallons per year by the end of 2024. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that daily production would average 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, with a forecast to rise to an average of 234,000 bpd in 2025. This forms part of a larger trend that saw total U.S. biofuels production, including ethanol and other biofuels, reach a record 1.39 million barrels per day in 2024. The expansion in renewable diesel was a significant contributor to this record. Despite the strong annual growth, the market experienced some short-term headwinds, with U.S. production dipping to an average of 170,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2025, a 12% decrease from the same quarter in the previous year, partly due to profitability challenges. Meanwhile, in Europe, which holds a significant share of the global market, local demand remains robust, with the region consuming more than 95% of its own green diesel production in 2025.

From Farm to Fuel Tank: The Diverse Feedstocks Powering Green Diesel

The viability and sustainability of the green diesel market hinge on a diverse and resilient feedstock supply chain. Currently, the industry relies heavily on readily available fats, oils, and greases. The most common inputs include recycled animal fats (tallow), used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, and various vegetable oils. These materials are processed to create high-quality fuel that is chemically similar to petroleum diesel. Looking ahead, the industry is actively expanding its feedstock options to enhance supply chain resilience and reduce competition with food production. Significant research and development efforts are focused on so-called second and third-generation feedstocks. These include lignocellulosic biomass, such as wood, agricultural grasses, and crop residues, which are abundant and do not impact the food supply. Other promising future sources include municipal solid waste and forest residues, which support the principles of a circular economy by valorizing waste streams. Feedstock certification frameworks like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) are becoming crucial for ensuring transparency and traceability.

Tapping into Third-Generation Biofuel Potential in 2025

Among the next wave of feedstocks, algae is generating significant excitement as a potential game-changer for the green diesel market. Considered a third-generation feedstock, algae can be cultivated on non-arable land and can utilize wastewater or saltwater, minimizing competition for land and freshwater resources. Many species of microalgae are particularly promising due to their high lipid oil content, which can range from 20% to as high as 50% of their biomass, making them an ideal raw material for biofuel production. The global market for algae-based green diesel is already gaining traction, reflecting the growing investment in this area. However, scaling up production to commercial levels faces hurdles. Techno-economic analyses conducted in 2025, based on future productivity targets, indicate a high minimum fuel selling price, estimated at 2.2 €/L for fuels produced via lipid extraction and 3.4 €/L for those produced via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). Overcoming these cost barriers through continued research and technological advances in cultivation, harvesting, and processing will be key to unlocking algae's full potential.

Nations Leading the Green Diesel Charge

A handful of nations are at the forefront of the green diesel market revolution, driven by ambitious climate policies and strategic investments. The United States currently leads the world in production capacity, with 22 operational renewable diesel plants as of January 2024 and a projected capacity of 5.1 billion gallons per year by the year's end. In Europe, which collectively accounts for a major share of the global market, countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands are notable leaders. Their progress is underpinned by strong policy frameworks, particularly the EU's Renewable Energy Directive, which mandates a greater share of renewables in transport. Finland is also a key player, home to the pioneering global producer Neste. To the north, Canada is making significant strides, highlighted by Imperial Oil's $507 million investment in a renewable diesel facility in Alberta, set to come online in 2025. Brazil is another nation showing increasing interest, with a focus on developing its capacity through the adoption of advanced hydrotreating technology to leverage its vast agricultural resources for fuel production.

The Technological Vanguard, Innovations Driving Green Diesel Production Forward

Technological advancement is the engine powering the scalability and cost-competitiveness of the green diesel market. The dominant production method is hydrotreating, also known as Hydroprocessed Vegetable Oil (HVO), a process where renewable feedstocks react with hydrogen under high temperature and pressure. This technology creates a ""drop-in"" fuel that is chemically indistinguishable from petroleum diesel. Leading technology providers like Honeywell offer specialized solutions, such as their Ecofining™ process, which was adopted by Acelen Renewables in 2024 for a large-scale project. Following the core hydrotreating step, additional processes like hydrocracking and isomerization are often employed. Hydrocracking breaks down larger molecules to improve fuel efficiency, while isomerization rearranges molecular structures to enhance performance in cold weather. Beyond HVO, researchers and companies are developing other pathways, including catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP), which shows great promise for converting solid lignocellulosic biomass into refinable bio-oil, a key focus of research in 2024.

Sealing the Deal: Key Distribution Pacts and Offtake Agreements of 2024

The growing acceptance of green diesel market is clearly reflected in the increasing number of significant distribution and offtake agreements announced in 2024. These deals are crucial for guaranteeing demand for producers and securing a stable supply of low-carbon fuel for end-users. In a landmark deal for the aviation sector announced in July 2024, Diamond Green Diesel committed to supplying an initial 1 million gallons of neat sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to World Fuel Services for use by JetBlue at New York's JFK Airport, with an option for 4 million additional gallons. In ground transport, Colonial Oil partnered with Neste in February 2024 to significantly boost the availability of renewable diesel in Savannah, Georgia, and the wider southeastern U.S. European aviation is also advancing, with low-cost carrier easyJet signing a memorandum of understanding with Spanish energy company Moeve in late 2024 for SAF supply on key Spanish routes from 2025 through 2030. Highlighting innovation, Zurich Airport Ltd. signed a pioneering offtake agreement in December 2024 with Synhelion to purchase 30,000 liters of solar-generated diesel annually starting in 2027 for use in its ground vehicle fleet.

The Road Ahead: How 2025 Policies are Shaping Market Acceptance

The trajectory of the green diesel market into 2025 and beyond is intrinsically linked to the strength and stability of government policies and corporate commitments. Regulatory frameworks like the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) have been instrumental in creating the initial demand and investment security for the industry. Similarly, in Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) has accelerated the adoption of green diesel by mandating its inclusion in the transport fuel mix. The growing demand is not purely policy-driven; corporations are increasingly adopting green diesel to meet their own sustainability targets and reduce their carbon footprint. This is especially true for hard-to-abate sectors like heavy-duty trucking and aviation, which see green diesel and SAF as one of the most viable, immediate pathways to decarbonization. As of 2025, the synergy between robust regulatory mandates, financial incentives from carbon markets, and a proactive corporate sector has created a fertile ground for the continued, rapid expansion of the green diesel market.

The NovaSAF 1 facility will convert dairy waste and biogas into drop-in jet fuel with a nameplate capacity of 500,000 gallons annually, using only renewable electricity and waste gas—no green hydrogen, no complex gasification.

At the heart of the project is Syzygy's light-driven GHG e-Reforming technology, which produces the ideal 2:1 syngas ratio for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis directly from biogenic methane and CO₂. This breakthrough eliminates the need for water-intensive steam reforming or expensive electrolyzers, radically simplifying the SAF value chain.

To convert that syngas into high-yield jet fuel, Syzygy has selected Velocys and its microFTL technology, known for reliability and for maximizing fuel output, both critical factors in driving down the total cost required to produce synthetic fuel.

""This project proves that profitable SAF production doesn't have to wait on future infrastructure,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""With Velocys, we're bringing in a complete, modular solution that drives down overall production costs and is ready to scale. Uruguay is only the start.""

""We're proud to bring our FT technology into a project that's changing the game,"" said Matthew Viergutz, CEO of Velocys. ""This is what innovation looks like—fast, flexible, and focused on making SAF production affordable.""

NovaSAF 1 Project Highlights:

Nameplate Capacity: 500,000 gallons/year of ASTM D7566-compliant SAF

Feedstocks: Dairy waste, biogenic methane, and CO₂

Power Source: 100% renewable electricity

Technology: Syzygy's NovaSAF™ platform + Velocys' microFTL™ technology

FID: Q4 2025 | Start of Operations: Q1 2027

Q Yes—I recognise that there are a lot of benefits of SAF, but I am wondering how the Bill can help that along.

Gaynor Hartnell: I think it is worth mentioning some of the environmental benefits specifically of producing SAF in the UK. They are focused on the second generation—that is, SAF that comes from waste. We have problematic waste to deal with in the UK, and it is better in terms of the proximity principle if we deal with our own waste domestically. There are various different feedstocks that the SAF mandate is seeking to encourage that have not traditionally been used, so it is aiming to expand the feedstocks to things such as end-of-life tyres. We currently export a lot of that waste to India, and we have heard in the news about the devastating environmental and health impacts that that has. If we deal with our own waste domestically, that is an environmental benefit; we will import somewhat less, but the aviation fuel we use at the moment is largely imported.

The main benefits of producing the SAF in this country are economic. The Government have realised that and they support it as part of their growth agenda, which it plays to.

Paul Greenwood: To round that out, if you listen to Rob’s comments, which I thought were very insightful, about the complexity of this and the need to ensure you get the right projects, with the right feedstock, at the right size and with the right basis, that to my mind is classic market distortion. Fundamentally, you are intervening in a market and saying, “I’m going to decide what is going to happen in this marketplace and I’m going to incentivise it to happen with a tariff.” The best way to do that is effectively to set a very clear demand signal, which happens through the SAF mandate, and let the market go and work that.

I do not buy into this idea that the market is incapable of supplying second-generation SAF; I had breakfast this morning—not because I was coming here today—with an Asian supplier who I deal with, who let me know that they had taken a final investment decision on a second-generation SAF plant in Asia that will be starting up in 2028. These things are happening; the market is responding. You are deliberately intervening in the marketplace with very good intentions, but it will distort that market signal. There is no doubt about it.

Mr Paul Kohler (Wimbledon) (LD) - Hansard - -

Q Mr Greenwood has made a compelling critique of the basics—“We have a mandate; why do we need the RCM? There might be unintended consequences.” I know you disagree with him, but I would like to hear why you disagree with him.

Gaynor Hartnell: These projects are first of a kind, pretty much. This waste-based stuff is not being produced at scale anywhere in the world yet. It is very challenging to build one of these projects. There are numerous risks. You have Philip New coming later to give evidence; he has written a report on that, so you could ask him what those risks are. This addresses the showstopper risk if you like, which is the revenue certainty that a SAF producer can rely on when going to a bank and asking to borrow the millions or billions of pounds that it costs to build one of these projects.

In the UK, we now have many precedents of other large-scale projects that are driven by environmental requirements, from renewable electricity generation to carbon capture and storage. Those various different projects are all supported by some sort of equivalent to the contracts that will be let under this revenue certainty mechanism, whether it is a contract for difference for electricity or whatever. It is par for the course. We are not asking for this just because everyone else gets it so we should get it too. There is a competition for capital, among other things. If there are supported projects in terms of revenue stability, it will be easier for the capital to flow to those projects. This is a new mechanism. We are seeking new types of SAF production pathways. It is incredibly complex, and it is necessary.

Underlying all of this, the SAF mandate creates a market for greenhouse gas certificates, and the price of those certificates will be variable. It is very much built on a preceding policy—the renewable transport fuel obligation for road transport. That was just a demand mechanism without any accompanying equivalent to this revenue certainty mechanism. We import 85% of our road fuels, and we are not doing a very good job, I must say, given the opportunity, at preserving those early movers of projects that were built in the early days. Getting project funding is challenging, and it is not made easier by the fact that we have some early movers that are not managing to keep their renewable fuel projects going. I am talking about the bioethanol producers.

Rob Griggs: I agree with what Gaynor says. Ultimately, UK SAF projects are competing for investment against other renewable projects across the UK economy that have similar types of support—CFDs for energy and hydrogen and other types of things. In some way it is levelling the playing field a little for SAF compared with other forms.

I am here representing airlines; I am not representing producers. We want and we need SAF, and we want it as cost effectively as possible. We have seen all the evidence, given the nature of our mandate, its design, the global market and the work of Phil New that Gaynor referenced, which specifically asked that question: you have a mandate; why do you need an RCM? Everything suggests that given all those dynamics, without some form of revenue certainty you will not get that investment in the first-of-a-kind plants that we need to prove out the technology and get that initial set of volumes on a really aggressive timeline for 2030.

As airlines, on balance, we want the system to be competitive. We expect there to be imports as well as domestic production, but we think that without that UK 2G supply kick-started by the RCM, we will struggle and then we risk the buy-out. That is why we support it. On top of that, if it goes right, you get a UK industry better for your security, and jobs domiciled in the UK. It is a win-win, notwithstanding that as airlines, that is not necessarily our primary goal, but it is a huge benefit, so why not support it?

Alice Macdonald - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I want to pick up on the monitoring point. For example, say a consumer feels that they have had to pay a little more for a flight that is more environmentally friendly; how soon would you be able to quantify whether that mechanism had had an effect? In a year’s time, would you be able to say that it has meant that the carbon has been decreased by x amount?

Jonathon Counsell: Definitely. All SAF has to be independently assessed for its life cycle emission savings. Before we purchased it, we have to prove that, and as I said, get an independent authority to test the life cycle emissions. We will be able to declare publicly, of any SAF that we use, the independent assessment of its life cycle savings.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: If you look at the mechanics of how it works for meeting the mandate, there is a minimum threshold that we set when buying compliant fuel. In this case, compliant fuel is kerosene: fossil-based kerosene blended with SAF. When we pay for the supply, we get the product transfer documents, which have the sustainability criteria associated with that specific batch of SAF. At that point we can very accurately calculate the emissions saving. In terms of planning, we have to set a range, because there is some variation depending on the pathway and the SAF provided. Building on what my colleagues here have said, there is an opportunity for the UK both in home-grown production and up and down the value chain in the development and export of the technology and the financing and trading of SAF in the longer term. We have what is seen as a gold standard for sustainability criteria, especially going to 2G SAF and the conversion of waste into usable fuels, which addresses multiple issues at the same time and is something that we can export to the rest of the world.

Mr Kohler - Hansard - -

Q To your point on the RCM, the money you put into the RCM will bring down your overall costs, because the premium on SAF will go down, will it not?

Jonathon Counsell: Absolutely—we hope that eventually, as you scale up SAF supply, the cost will come down. Will it ever come down to jet fuel levels? I do not think it will, because of the factor cost element. I agree with Paul Greenwood, who said earlier that one of the disadvantages we have in this country is high energy costs. We are doing SAF contracts with SAF suppliers in the US, where their energy costs are one third of those in this country, so we are at a disadvantage.

On 2G SAF, however, I think we have some real advantages: we have some sites, we have expertise and we have feedstock, both waste biomass and municipal solid waste. We put 20 million tonnes of municipal solid waste into landfill; we even ship 5 million tonnes of it to Europe. That is energy. We should be using it to make SAF. Those advantages can overcome the energy disadvantage in the short term. Hopefully we will sort out that energy disadvantage, but as we scale up those plants that SAF price should come down. It is an investment, but we do not want to double-pay for it.

Luke Ervine: Just to add and clarify, I think Luke Taylor asked a question earlier about ways to pay for the SAF mandate. We have always been very clear about paying twice through things such as the ETS scheme. We would love to see those revenues used to reinvest in the decarbonisation of the aviation industry. Given the economic value it returns and the Government’s growth agenda, we believe that creating a SAF industry also creates jobs and a lot of economic prosperity. The Sustainable Aviation report in 2023 estimated that the UK SAF industry would create about 60,000 new jobs by 2050 and about £10 billion gross value added by the same time. There is a benefit here for the UK economy as a whole purely in terms of the SAF industry, and using some of the taxes we currently pay to fund the RCM would be very helpful.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: I do not have much to add to what has already been said, but the cost of SAF means that the cost of fuel will go up in the long run, even with the RCM. In our minds, the RCM is something that unlocks production, as opposed to something that brings the cost down. The primary role we see for it is in getting production up so that supply can meet demand in the short run. Ultimately, though, we will have higher costs because of SAF, especially as eSAF and power-to-liquid comes in, and those costs will have to be passed through.

We are doing a huge amount to try to be as efficient as we possibly can; that is where the investments in aircraft and how we operate come in. As they say, the best energy is the energy you do not use, and in that way we are trying to manage our costs in the same way we have for the past 30 years, but I completely agree that we have to be wary of adding on to the costs we are already paying in the name of sustainability, both right now and in terms of meeting the mandates.

Lewis Atkinson (Sunderland Central) (Lab) - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Building on the point Mr Ervine made about the potential wider economic contribution of SAF, I am particularly interested in the jobs. We have heard that 70% of existing fuel is imported, and therefore a significant part of your economic supply chain is essentially providing economic benefit overseas. Could you say a little more about—if we get this off the ground, as it were—how far you think that value chain and economic benefit will shift into the UK from imports? In particular, could you talk about the potential regional economic benefits of SAF, as opposed to being concentrated on London and the south-east?

Jonathon Counsell: From our modelling and analysis, we still want to have the flexibility to import SAF, because there is a global market there and we do not want to put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage by saying that all mandated SAF has to be produced in the UK. We still want access to imported SAF, particularly 1G SAF; we do not think the UK has much competitive advantage in producing 1G SAF. We think roughly 50% feels about right, and you have to compare it around that. Our view is that, of the mandated SAF, approximately 50% should be produced here in the UK—but, as I said earlier, not all of that will need the revenue certainty mechanism.

One of the key points that I want to make is that the revenue certainty mechanism is for those plants that cannot get funding: they are early stage, first-of-their-kind technology, and cannot get tracker funding because it is perceived to be too high risk by the investment market, and they cannot get that revenue certainty through any other mechanism, so therefore they rely on this mechanism. We think that roughly half of that 50% will need the revenue certainty mechanism.

A good example is LanzaJet in Teesside, the speedboat project that I mentioned earlier. That does not need the revenue certainty mechanism because we at IAG are providing the company with a long-term committed take-or-pay offer. We are giving the revenue certainty to LanzaJet, so that project does not need it; but other projects do, typically including the municipal solid waste projects that take black bag waste. They are at a very early stage, using less mature technology, and they are massively capital intense projects. They definitely need the revenue certainty mechanism, so we must ensure that it is targeted.

As Luke said, we think that by 2030 there could potentially be 10,000 extra jobs in the UK from that UK production. We can share a piece of analysis that we did through Sustainable Aviation that showed what that looks like for each region of the UK. We think there is certainly potential to build plants in Wearside, Teesside, Humberside and south Wales; if we get the policy right, we think there could be up to 14 plants within the next 10 years, which will deliver £1.8 billion in GVA by 2030.

However, the big prize will come in 2050: 60,000 jobs and £10 billion in GVA. We are creating a new energy industry for the UK. I have to congratulate the Government: we have potentially the most powerful package of SAF policy in the world, with the mandate, the revenue certainty mechanism and the advanced fuels fund. Taken together, they mean that we are the envy of the world and we have a huge chance to be a world leader on SAF production.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: To add to that, it would also enable UK aviation to grow. Our estimates are that each aircraft based in the UK supports around 400 jobs and £27 million of GVA. We have over 150 aircraft in the UK as it is, we have three aircraft going to a new base in Newcastle shortly and we absolutely intend to continue with the growth in the UK. By having the RCM unlock SAF production and SAF supply, that opens the doors to us to continue growing, while also decarbonising. That is a massive part of the economic benefit that the RCM helps to unlock, beyond the obvious effects of supporting jobs and production on the ground in the SAF industry.

Luke Ervine: Just to add a note on benefits, it is important to recognise the cost of not having the RCM. We have spoken a lot today about the buy-out. The UK is unique in its ambition to have a 2G SAF mandate, so the cost of not having the RCM is important. If we do not have it, we pay buy-out, and then we are going to lose out regionally to other areas, such as Europe and the US, that do not have those 2G SAF mandates, so it is important that we recognise that there is a cost of not having the RCM.",https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/static/UK_Parliament/img/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-16 13:21:38.995853

Swedish group Sandvik mitigates impact of tariffs

Stockholm — Swedish metal-cutting and mining equipment engineering group Sandvik reported a bigger-than-expected drop in second-quarter core profit on Wednesday but said it had fully mitigated the effect of tariffs in the period.

Operating profit before amortisation and items affecting comparability fell 8% from a year earlier to 5.63bn kronor ($577m), against a mean forecast of 5.86bn in an LSEG poll of analysts.

“We will continue to take mitigating actions to limit the effect of new trade policies if and when they become reality,” CEO Stefan Widing said in a statement.

The company has said it would be able to increase production capacity in its US facilities. It had more than 14% of group revenue in the US last year. Reuters

Finnair blames labour disputes for reduced profit

New York — Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year sales forecast on Wednesday after beating estimates for second quarter profit on strong demand for its cancer drug, Darzalex, and strength in its medical device business.

The company also reduced its expectations for tariff-related costs to $200m from $400m for the year, citing the Trump administration’s pause on levies on China and other retaliatory tariff measures.

""We were able to absorb that and still raise our EPS (earnings per share) guidance by 25c on the year,"" CFO Joseph Wolk said.

On an adjusted basis, the drug and medical device maker earned $2.77 per share for the quarter, above analysts’ expectations of $2.68 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.

EU’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate under fire

Singapore — The International Air Transport Association on Wednesday stepped up criticism of the EU’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate as a costly initiative that is not helping the environment as regional supplies there remain low.

“The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it, because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs,” IATA’s director-general Willie Walsh said at a media round-table in Singapore.

IATA estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered a low-carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel, is expected to reach 2-million metric tons, or 0.7% of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025.

“Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” Walsh said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel. Reuters

Hybrid work models affecting Workspace

Bengaluru — London-focused flexible office-space provider Workspace reported on Wednesday a drop in quarterly occupancy, as larger customers vacated its properties, and warned that another major customer’s exit will lead to further decline in the second quarter.

Workspace has seen property valuations decline since the pandemic, as businesses ditched larger office spaces and opted for hybrid work models.

The company leased a monthly average of 93 new office spaces in the quarter, compared to 102 spaces in the prior year.

The company, which leases space to small businesses ranging from fintech firms to podcasters and people using AI to write music, said like-for-like occupancy dipped 0.3% to 82.2% in the first quarter.

U.S. formally opens tariff probe into Brazil... The Trump administration has launched a formal Section 301 investigation into Brazil’s trade practices, raising the threat of sweeping new tariffs and intensifying bilateral tensions. The probe, targets Brazil’s regulatory actions against American tech firms and broader policies that Washington says discriminate against U.S. companies and products. The investigation will examine a wide array of Brazilian measures, including: digital trade restrictions, ethanol market access, intellectual property enforcement, judicial interference, tariff and non-tariff barriers and environmental policies.

Carney signals tariffs likely to stay, trade talks with U.S. to intensify... Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Tuesday that while trade negotiations with the U.S. are expected to “intensify,” there’s little indication that President Trump is prepared to lift sweeping tariffs. Carney underscored his focus on Canada’s industrial base, saying a strong economy “includes a strong steel industry… auto industry… aluminum industry, and copper industry.” The White House has said the threatened tariffs would not apply to USMCA-exempt goods, though Trump has increasingly sidestepped the accord with unilateral import taxes.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday said Mexico will take action if an agreement with Washington regarding new tariffs is not reached by the Aug. 1 deadline set by Trump. “We hope to reach an agreement ... if an agreement is not reached on Aug. 1, we will be informing of other actions,” said Sheinbaum. She also hopes to announce measures next week in conjunction with tomato producers related to Washington’s announcement on Monday that it will begin charging a duty of 17.09% on imports of fresh tomatoes from Mexico. “We think we can reach a deal. But we have to prepare for every scenario... We have to have alternatives,” Sheibaum said.

The Trump administration finalized a trade agreement with Indonesia, reducing the proposed tariff rate from 32% to 19% in exchange for $15 billion in U.S. energy purchases, $4.5 billion in agricultural imports, and an order for 50 Boeing jets. Trump also signaled that countries not negotiating tailored rates — mostly smaller U.S. trading partners — would likely face a flat tariff of “probably a little over 10%.” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the nations with goods being taxed at these rates would be in Africa and the Caribbean — places that generally do relatively modest levels of trade with the U.S.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) stepped up criticism of the European Union’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate as a costly initiative that is not helping the environment as regional supplies remain low. IATA estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered a low-carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel, is expected to reach 2 MMT, or 0.7% of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025. Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a 6% SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. “Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” the head of IATA said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel. By IATA’s assessment, he said “the cost that they’re charging is way in excess of the actual cost of the limited supplies of sustainable fuel.”

Raizen shuts historic sugar mill to cut debt... Raizen SA, the world’s largest sugar producer, said it was shutting down for an indefinite period one of its largest plants in Brazil, the Santa Elisa mill, to help manage its 30 billion reais ($5.41 billion) debt. The company will sell 3.5 MMT of sugarcane to six firms, raising 1.045 billion reais ($188 million). The 90-year-old plant was key to Brazil’s ethanol program. Industry group CEISE Br warned the shutdown could disrupt equipment and service contracts. Raizen is also selling other assets as sugar prices hit a four-year low.

Texas braces for screwworm threat... Texas and federal officials are ramping up screwworm monitoring efforts as outbreaks in Mexico inch closer to the U.S. border, threatening the state’s $15 billion cattle industry. USDA and state labs, in partnership with Texas A&M, are deploying a five-point defense plan that includes border inspections, sterile fly releases and major facility upgrades. At a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing, lawmakers warned that a Texas infestation could cause up to $4.3 billion in producer losses annually, a total economic loss of over $10 billion and disrupt the national food supply.

Brazil beef exports to U.S. ‘under analysis’ after tariffs... Brazilian meatpackers are weighing whether to make new shipments of beef products to the U.S. after President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on Brazil last week, the president of Brazilian beef lobby ABIEC, said. Since Trump’s announcement, meatpackers have been scrambling to reschedule and redirect shipments and production, with some companies already deciding to temporarily halt production destined for the United States.

Cash hog index remains choppy... Since halting a pullback from the seasonal high, the CME lean hog index has alternated “up” and “down” days. The latest quote is down 6 cents to $107.19 as of July 14. August lean hog futures, which are now the lead-month contract, finished Tuesday at a $3.265 discount to today’s quote.

Such amendments apply to emissions rates published for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.","On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA), which makes permanent or modifies key provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) and scales back numerous energy tax incentives enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The following is a summary of certain general business tax, clean energy tax credit and international tax provisions of the OBBBA. All section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

General Business Tax

Bonus Depreciation (Section 168(k) and (n))

Permanence. The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100 percent bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) for qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025.

Qualified Production Property. New Section 168(n) allows an immediate deduction for 100 percent of the cost of “qualified production property.” Generally, qualified production property is any domestic manufacturing, refining, agricultural production or chemical production facility the construction of which begins after January 19, 2025 and before January 1, 2029 and that is placed in service after July 4, 2025 and before January 1, 2031.

Domestic Research and Experimental (R&E) Expenditures (Section 174A)

Domestic R&E. The OBBBA restores immediate expensing of domestic R&E expenditures under new Section 174A for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. This reverses the five-year amortization requirement that took effect in 2022 under the TCJA. Section 174A does not allow expensing of amounts paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (including oil and gas).

Capitalization. Capitalization and amortization of domestic R&E expenditures remains available upon election.

Business Interest Limitation (Section 163(j))

EBITDA Calculation Reinstated. The OBBBA permanently returns the limitation on business interest deductibility to an EBITDA-based formula, reversing the more restrictive EBIT-based test in effect since 2022. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Ordering. The OBBBA provides that the Section 163(j) limitation is calculated prior to applying any interest capitalization provisions (subject to certain exceptions) and requires taxpayers to first apply their allowed business interest deduction against business interest that would otherwise be capitalized. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Expansion of Qualifying Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Clean Energy Expansion. The OBBBA expands the definition of “qualifying income” under Section 7704 to include income from the transportation or storage of certain clean fuels, production of electricity from certain clean sources and other energy-transition infrastructure.

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) (Section 56A)

Intangible Drilling and Development Costs. Corporate operators of oil and gas assets can reduce adjusted financial statement income (AFSI) by any deductions for intangible drilling and development costs allowed under Section 263(c) and, correspondingly, are required to include in AFSI any depletion expense reflected in their applicable financial statements with respect to such intangible drilling and development costs. This change is relevant for purposes of determining whether a corporate taxpayer is subject to CAMT and, if so, the extent of its CAMT liability for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Partnership Transactions (Section 707(a)(2))

Self-execution. The OBBBA confirms that Section 707(a)(2), which addresses disguised sales between partners and partnerships, is self-executing. This eliminates any ambiguity about the enforceability of the disguised sales rules with respect to disguised sales of partnership interests in the absence of final regulations.

Deduction for Qualified Business Income (Section 199A)

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the 20 percent deduction for qualified business income.

Excess Business Loss Limitation (Section 461(l))

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the limitation on excess business losses for noncorporate taxpayers, which was set to expire after 2028. Excess losses will continue to be converted into net operating losses carried forward to future years.

Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs) and Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs) (Subchapter Z)

QOZ Renewal. The OBBBA renews the QOZ program with new QOZ designations to be made on July 1, 2026 and each July 1st every 10 years thereafter. New QOZ designations will go into effect on January 1st of the year following the designation.

QOF Renewal. Similarly, new QOFs will be established with respect to newly designated QOZs. Investors in QOFs will be able to defer capital gains for up to five years. In addition, taxpayers will receive a partial basis step-up in their investment if their holding period is at least five years and recognize no gain if their holding period is between 10 and 30 years.

Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Gain Exclusion (Section 1202)

Holding Period. Non-corporate taxpayers can exclude from taxable income gain on the disposition of QSBS if such stock was held for five years and certain other requirements are satisfied. The OBBBA changes the holding-period requirement for QSBS issued after July 4, 2025 to allow a 50 percent exclusion for QSBS held for three years, a 75 percent exclusion after four years and full exclusion after five years.

Cap Increases. For QSBS issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the maximum gain that can be excluded from the disposition of QSBS of a single issuer from $10 million to $15 million. In addition, the maximum gross asset threshold for a C corporation to be a qualified small business increased from $50 million to $75 million. The increased amounts are indexed for inflation for subsequent years. These changes apply to QSBS issued after July 4, 2025.

Clean Energy Tax Credits

Clean Electricity Production and Investment Credits (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Wind and Solar. The OBBBA phases out the Section 45Y and 48E credits for wind and solar projects. Wind and solar projects that begin construction on or after July 5, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit. Wind and solar projects that begin construction prior to July 5, 2026 are eligible for the Section 45Y or 48E credit under the rules that existed prior to the passage of the OBBBA.

Fuel Cells. The OBBBA adds qualified fuel cell property to the property eligible for the Section 48E credit at a 30 percent rate. Fuel cell projects are not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or the zero greenhouse gas emissions rate requirement. Fuel cell projects are not eligible for any credit adders.

Other Technologies. The OBBBA modifies the phase-out rules under Sections 45Y and 48E for non-wind and non-solar projects. For any such projects that begin construction in 2034 and 2035, the Section 45Y and 48E credits are subject to a 25 percent and 50 percent reduction, respectively. Any such projects that begin construction in 2036 or later will not qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit.

Domestic Content Adder. The OBBBA makes the domestic content percentage requirements under Section 48E consistent with those under Section 45Y for projects that begin construction on or after June 16, 2025. Prior to the passage of the OBBBA, the domestic content percentage requirement under Section 48E was 40 percent but under Section 45Y ranged from 40 percent to 55 percent depending on when construction began.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

Extension. The Section 45Z credit is extended by two years to include transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2029.

Feedstock. After December 31, 2025, transportation fuel must be exclusively derived from feedstock that is produced or grown in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

Emissions Rate. The emissions rate for a transportation fuel may not be less than zero; however, an exception allows negative emissions rates for fuels derived from animal manure. Further, the emissions rate shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use changes. Such amendments apply to emissions rates published for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The value of the Section 45Z credit for sustainable aviation fuel is reduced from $1.75 to $1.00 for each gallon produced after December 31, 2025.

No Double Counting. To qualify for the credit, the transportation fuel must not be produced from a fuel for which the Section 45Z credit was allowable.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

Rate Parity. The base credit rate for carbon oxides captured from an industrial source and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $12 to $17 per metric ton so that it is equal to the base credit rate for permanent sequestration. Similarly, in the case of direct air capture facilities, the base credit rate for carbon oxides captured and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $26 to $36 per metric ton. Such increases apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Wind Components. The Section 45X credit is terminated for wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Metallurgical Coal. Metallurgical coal that is suitable for the production of steel (regardless of whether production occurs inside or outside of the United States) was added as an applicable critical mineral. This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Phase-out. The phase-out of the Section 45X credit was modified so that the credit (other than with respect to metallurgical coal) is subject to a 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent reduction in 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Section 45X credit terminates for metallurgical coal after 2029 and for other applicable critical minerals after 2033.

Battery Modules. The definition of “battery module” was changed to require each module to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.” This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Integrated Components. The OBBBA allows manufacturers to claim the Section 45X credit on multiple primary components that are integrated, incorporated or assembled into secondary components if (a) the primary components are produced in the same facility as the secondary components, (b) the secondary components are sold to unrelated persons and (c) at least 65 percent of the direct material costs to produce the secondary components are attributable to primary components that are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

Termination. The Section 45V credit is terminated for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2027.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules

The OBBBA restricts taxpayers with connections to certain countries or foreign entities from claiming credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E. The FEOC rules largely relate to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea (as well as certain listed foreign persons and entities, which are not discussed below). In general, a taxpayer is prohibited from claiming credits under any one of the following circumstances:

The taxpayer is a “specified foreign entity.”

A specified foreign entity includes, among others, (a) the government of China, Russia, Iran or North Korea; (b) a citizen or national of one of those countries (provided that such person is not a U.S. citizen, national or resident); (c) an entity organized in, or having its principal place of business in, one of those countries; and (d) an entity owned more than 50 percent by persons described in clauses (a) through (c).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The taxpayer is a “foreign-influenced entity.”

A foreign-influenced entity includes an entity with respect to which (a) a specified foreign entity has authority to appoint board members or officers, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent of such entity, (c) multiple specified foreign entities own at least 40 percent of such entity or (d) at least 15 percent of the debt of such entity is held by specified foreign entities.

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the credits under Sections 45U and 45Z for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer receives “material assistance” on a project from specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities.

A project is deemed to receive material assistance if the material assistance cost ratio for the project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The threshold percentages increase over time and range from 40 percent to 90 percent depending on the year, credit and technology. The material assistance cost ratio is computed as a fraction, with the numerator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components not manufactured by specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities, and the denominator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components.

The Secretary of the Treasury is required to issue safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026 identifying total direct cost percentages attributable to manufactured products and components. Until the safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on the percentages in the domestic content safe harbor tables in IRS Notice 2025-08, certifications from suppliers regarding direct costs and certifications from suppliers stating that manufactured products and components were not manufactured or produced by a specified foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

For these purposes, a foreign-influenced entity also includes an entity that made payments to a specified foreign entity in the prior taxable year pursuant to a contract, agreement or arrangement that allows the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise “effective control” over a project or the production of any components (Specified Foreign Entity Payments).

This restriction applies to the credits under Section 45Y and 48E for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 (on a project-by-project basis) and to the Section 45X credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

In addition, if a taxpayer makes Specified Foreign Entity Payments within 10 years after a project claiming the Section 48E credit is placed in service, the full amount of the credit claimed is subject to recapture. This restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

International Tax

Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) (Now “Net CFC Tested Income” (NCTI)) (Section 904)

Rate. The OBBBA modifies the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion rules such that a corporation’s effective GILTI rate will increase from 10.5 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the GILTI rate to 13.125 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Currently, a taxpayer can effectively exclude 10 percent of a controlled foreign corporation’s qualified business asset investment (QBAI) from the taxpayer’s GILTI inclusion calculation. The OBBBA eliminates this QBAI exclusion for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) (Now “Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income” (FDDEI)) (Section 250)

Rate. Similar to those modifications made to the GILTI regime, the OBBBA modifies the FDII rules such that a corporation’s effective FDII rate will increase from 13.125 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the FDII rate to 16.4 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Similar to QBAI with respect to GILTI, the OBBBA eliminates the QBAI exclusion for FDII for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

It also marks a key milestone in the rollout of the EU Flight Emissions Label and ReFuelEU Aviation, while helping to accelerate the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels to cut flight emissions.","The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Air France-KLM have signed an agreement to prepare for partnering on the EU Flight Emissions Label (FEL).

The FEL was introduced at the end of December 2024. It aims to provide trustworthy and consistent information to consumers on sustainable travel. Air France-KLM is the first airline to announce its intention to voluntarily adopt the label, and hopes that as well as being “a means to enhance communication on [its] decarbonisation strategy to passengers” it will also have “the final goal of securing a competitive edge in the industry”.

When operational, the FEL will provide passengers with information allowing them to view and compare the estimated Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of their flight (expressed in kilogrammes of carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO2eq)) “enabling them to make more informed purchasing decisions”.

Under the Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) signed with EASA, Air France-KLM will test and then implement the digital FEL platform.

The FEL’s full remit is “to empower passengers with information on flight-related emissions, allowing them to make informed decisions when booking and comparing flights. The label will also increase accountability within the aviation sector by establishing a harmonised emissions calculation methodology, data reporting, and emissions display for all airlines in the European Union”

The FEL was set up because of the perceived lack of a common methodology and criteria for estimating flight emissions. The Commission said that this “leads airlines and ticket sellers to report emission levels using disparate methodologies which are not necessarily comparable. The Flight Emissions Label aims to change this by setting out a reliable and harmonised methodology for estimating flight emissions, considering factors like aircraft type, average passenger numbers and freight volume on board, as well as aviation fuel used”.

When searching for flights or booking tickets online, a dedicated logo will be displayed alongside the flight emissions data. “This will help passengers make informed decisions and protect them from misleading greenwashing claims,” says the Commission. “The Flight Emissions Label will support aviation’s transition to net zero by ensuring fair competition among airlines, promoting the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), and supporting fleet renewal. Since the estimations are based on actual consumption data, it will also encourage airlines to operate more efficiently and sustainably.”

Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, stated: “I warmly welcome the decision by Air France and KLM to become the first airlines to join the EU Flight Emissions Label. This decisive step turns their commitment to decarbonisation into concrete action, reinforcing fair competition, transparency, and trust. It also marks a key milestone in the rollout of the EU Flight Emissions Label and ReFuelEU Aviation, while helping to accelerate the uptake of sustainable aviation fuels to cut flight emissions. I encourage other airlines to join this initiative, driving a more sustainable and transparent future for European aviation.”

Airlines from both EU and non-EU countries, covered under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 “ReFuelEU Aviation”, can voluntarily join the FEL. Only those airlines that have joined are allowed to display emissions to their passengers in the European Union, in accordance with Article 6(5) of the Regulation. The European Commission and EASA are encouraging airlines to join the FEL if they want to display flight emissions and use these estimates when, for example, offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or other emissions offsets to passengers.",https://cdn.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FEL-Background-image-phone-screen-verified-logo-v2-1-e1752661563205.png,N,,2025-07-16 14:17:37.521887

If just 10% of that market could be made into SAF from corn ethanol, that would generate an additional 6.5 billion bushels of new corn demand.
The decision to block the bill, “will ensure ethanol plants remain here in Iowa, and that Iowa remains the most competitively advantaged to produce ethanol,” Sauer says.
“This will set Iowa ethanol plants up for potential expansions.” Every state understands the repercussions of stalling CO2 pipeline development, including Sauer and his team at ICGA.
POET, the world’s largest producer of biofuels, commended Reynolds’ veto.","Iowa corn growers and ethanol producers now have a fighting chance to capture future market share thanks to the veto power of Gov. Kim Reynolds. In early June, Reynolds chose to veto HF 639, a bill that many believed would have prevented carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects from happening in Iowa.

Several prominent voices affiliated with Iowa’s farming economy spoke out in favor of Reynolds’ decision. That support was accompanied by a respectful acknowledgement of the complexity of CCS projects, specifically pipelines, and their impact on property rights and eminent domain.

While South Dakota’s openness to carbon pipeline projects remains in flux, Iowa now joins Nebraska, Minnesota, Illinois and North Dakota as states with a foundation in place for the operation of current or future carbon pipeline routes. On December 12, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approved the state’s first carbon pipeline route. On the same day, North Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission took essentially the same action. Nebraska has approved multiple pipeline routes to move CO2, as has Illinois.

Veto Decision Brings Clarity

Although there was no specific language in HF 639 that outright banned CCS projects in Iowa, provisions in the bill would have prevented such activity through the use of new restrictions on eminent domain for CO2 projects and new restrictions on permitting.

Reynolds provided a lengthy explanation regarding her decision to veto: “Reasonable people can—and do—disagree about when the government, or a private company acting with government approval, should be allowed to take private land,” she wrote. “That debate is as old as the Republic. At its core, it asks how we protect individual property rights while still building the infrastructure—roads, utilities, pipelines—that modern life depends on.

“I respect both sides of that debate. I’ve consistently said that if eminent domain is used, it must be rare, fair, and a last resort. But HF 639 isn’t just about eminent domain,” she continued. “It goes much further—and in doing so, sets a troubling precedent that threatens Iowa’s energy reliability, economy and reputation as a place where businesses can invest with confidence.”

The day after Reynolds’ veto, Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley called for a special session to consider overriding her decision; the idea received support from over two-thirds of the House. Senate leaders, however, said a special session—also needing sign-off from two-thirds of the lawmakers in that chamber—was unlikely. At press time in late June, a special session did not appear to have momentum.

Speaking to Ethanol Producer Magazine after the veto in early June, Ryan Sauer, vice president of market development for the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said, “In the end, property rights are important, but so is finding new demand outlets as farmers continue to produce more corn.”

Sauer says ICGA’s members are seeing significant challenges in the farm economy right now, specifically farm profitability due to high input costs and low commodity prices. The ability of Iowa farmers to grow corn for lower-carbon ethanol production over the next decade will, in part, be made possible through CCS. It’s key to the industry’s future.

“This will help unlock low-carbon fuel markets around the world such as sustainable aviation fuel,” he says, explaining that the global jet fuel market is projected to grow to about 120 billion gallons over the next decade. If just 10% of that market could be made into SAF from corn ethanol, that would generate an additional 6.5 billion bushels of new corn demand.

Crop projections from the USDA highlight the significance of Sauer’s point. As of early June, the USDA had projected that 1.8 billion bushels of corn will have unmet demand from the 2025 planted crop. That unmet demand could grow as high as 2.5 billion bushels over the next several years.

“These new markets are key to ensuring farmers have new demand for their corn as yields continue to increase and countries like South America continue to grow more corn,” he says.

Reynolds included a specific example of a CO2 pipeline in the works (by Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy) as a reason why the bill needed to be blocked. Reynolds said the bill’s call for new insurance mandates and an arbitrary 25-year limit on CO2 pipelines would have killed projects like the one SIRE is developing.

Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, said Reynolds’ decision will allow farmers and producers alike to accelerate investment in U.S. energy innovation. Skor also said her team looked forward to working with elected officials to find a balanced policy solution.

For Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw, part of the issue with the legislation was its inaccuracies. “Any thoughtful review of this bill would determine that it would lead to higher energy prices for Iowans, hamper future economic development, hold back job creation and stifle new markets,” he said. Shaw believes that Reynolds studied and deliberated over the legislation, ultimately looking beyond anti-pipeline rhetoric that was “as inaccurate as it was loud.”

The bill’s impact would not have been limited to CO2 pipeline projects. Some of its provisions applied to all hazardous liquid pipelines. Those provisions would change permitting rules across the board and inject uncertainty into critical energy projects, including those focused on oil, gas and fertilizer, Reynolds wrote.

The premise that safety concerns provided justification for stopping CO2 pipelines in Iowa was also dismissed by Reynolds in her decision rationale. She cited robust regulations already in place by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).

Pending updates to CO2 pipeline safety requirements under review by PHMSA could also enhance protocols currently in place. Since December 2023, PHSMA has seen a 10-fold increase in CCS projects under development nationwide. A report provided to PHMSA by the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, by 2050, the mileage of CO2 pipelines in the U.S. could expand by as much as 10 times the current number of more than 5,000 miles in operation. This projected growth, in part, is prompting PHMSA to consider enhanced federal pipeline safety requirements.

In addition to addressing safety concerns, Reynolds also spoke to the economic reality of CO2 pipelines in relation to other states. She pointed out that other states have already created a framework that will enable such development and Iowa will not be left out.

“Iowa leads the nation in biofuels,” she said in her decision. “We are at the forefront of turning corn into low-carbon energy—a leadership position we risk losing if we block the infrastructure that makes it possible. Other Midwestern states, like Nebraska, Illinois and North Dakota are already moving forward with carbon capture projects that would put Iowa at a competitive disadvantage if this bill became law.”

Sauer echoed Reynolds’ rationale related to the economic possibilities for Iowa. The decision to block the bill, “will ensure ethanol plants remain here in Iowa, and that Iowa remains the most competitively advantaged to produce ethanol,” Sauer says. “This will set Iowa ethanol plants up for potential expansions.”

Every state understands the repercussions of stalling CO2 pipeline development, including Sauer and his team at ICGA. Keeping the door open for CCS to happen in Iowa will ensure it doesn’t become disadvantaged to places like Nebraska that have already begun pursuing a carbon pipeline as the markets build out for low-carbon fuels.

POET, the world’s largest producer of biofuels, commended Reynolds’ veto. “At a time when commodity prices are low, these CO2 investments will expand market access for Iowa corn, biofuels and bioproducts across the globe, increasing the value of every bushel of corn and every acre of Iowa cropland,” said Jeff Broin, POET founder and CEO. “This decision will bring benefits to Iowa farmers for generations to come.”

POET has already started working to develop a CO2 capture plan with Tallgrass, an infrastructure company with pipeline operations in multiple states for several products including oil, natural gas and CO2. POET’s Fairmont bioprocessing facility in southern Nebraska will capture CO2 and transport it via the Tallgrass Trailblazer line to a permanent underground sequestration site in Wyoming. Tallgrass is converting an existing natural gas pipeline that has operated for more than a decade.

Under the Trailblazer Community Benefits Agreement, POET’s commitment will also support additional direct funding to the landowners who have agreed to site the pipeline on their property and the communities that are hosting the infrastructure.

South Dakota’s Role

Although Iowa’s current stance on CCS infrastructure and CO2 pipeline development is (post veto) ostensibly affirmative, the full realization of a project like Summit Carbon Solutions may not be quite as clear as some may have hoped.

Minnesota’s PUC has said that before any work begins on the portion of the pipeline that runs through the state, work must have already started in neighboring North Dakota, the storage destination for the CO2 that would be moved by Summit. North Dakota has had its share of regulatory wrinkles with CO2, but like Nebraska and Illinois, it does now appear primed for pipeline work to begin.

And then there is South Dakota. Like Reynolds, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden also made a momentous decision on CO2 pipeline development. Rhoden’s determination, however, was nearly the opposite of Reynolds’. “I am no stranger to discussions about eminent domain and property rights,” Rhoden wrote, explaining his long history fighting for private property rights as a legislator and landowner.

Rhoden signed HB 1052, a bill that bans eminent domain for carbon pipelines. Although the decision may be viewed as a setback to those in favor of using the tool to help develop the South Dakota portion of Summit’s multi-state project, Rhoden offered another perspective.

“I also want to ensure that we keep South Dakota ‘Open for Opportunity,’” he wrote. “HB 1052 does not kill the proposed project. Rather than viewing this legislation as an obstacle, I encourage Summit and others to view it as an opportunity for a needed reset. Voluntary easements for this proposed project will still be able to move forward and are not impacted by HB 1052.

“The ethanol industry will remain a crucial part of our state’s economy,” Rhoden said. As South Dakota’s place in any in-state or multi-state CO2 project continues to play out, Sauer and his team believe the stakes and situation are clear in Iowa.

“We are working hard on E15 expansion, but we need more,” Sauer says. The ability for CCS projects to happen in Iowa “will ultimately position corn farmers to take advantage of any low-carbon fuel market and ensure future generations of farmers can enjoy the same success and prosperity we have seen for the past two decades.”

“On a personal basis, I can see that there is a strong argument now for the inclusion of video,” Director General Willie Walsh said in Singapore on Wednesday. “Based on what little we know now, it’s quite possible that a video recording, in addition to the voice recording, would significantly assist the investigators.”

The idea of cockpit cameras has been fiercely debated for decades, but has been thrust into the spotlight once again in the wake of last month’s Air India crash in Ahmedabad. A preliminary report into the accident that killed 260 people on board the Boeing Co. 787 aircraft and on the ground revealed that the fuel-supply switches were switched off — dooming the jet almost immediately after takeoff.

Authorities have so far only released a short transcript that shows one pilot asking his colleague why he turned off the fuel supply, to which the second pilot answered he had not.

It isn’t clear if this was the extent of the cockpit conversation, and authorities didn’t identify which pilot said what, leaving the key question of how the switches were moved to a cut-off position unanswered. Still, Walsh said the initial report was more comprehensive than expected.

Walsh, in Singapore for events including a summit on aviation safety, reiterated his optimistic outlook for the industry, which has weathered disruptions from conflicts to escalating geopolitical tensions. While some carriers have scaled back their Asian operations, only travel between the US and Canada has been significantly impacted by the Trump administration’s tariffs, according to Walsh.

IATA projects 5.8% growth in air travel demand this year. Over the longer-term, Walsh cautioned that travelers will have to pay higher fares due to the rising cost of meeting climate goals.

The cost of complying with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation will hit $1 billion this year and balloon to about $15 billion over the next decade, Walsh said.

He pointed to Singapore’s plan to add a levy to ticket prices next year to purchase cleaner fuel as a good model for stimulating demand for sustainable aviation fuel. Other regions, like Europe, may struggle to meet their SAF goals as production remains scarce, Walsh said.

Singapore’s Changi Airport, which typically ranks as one of the world’s most popular and recently broke ground on a vast new terminal, is also an industry leader in sectors like automation, according to Walsh.

“Compared to what I see in Europe, it’s like night and day,” said Walsh, who was previously the chief executive officer of British Airways. “Aviation is truly valued in this region.”

Growing demand for renewable fuel is reshaping crop decisions across the Southern United States, where farmers are rapidly expanding winter canola production. Traditionally grown in the U.S. Northern Plains, canola is now gaining traction in Southern double-crop rotations—driven largely by a strategic partnership between Bunge, Chevron and Corteva Agriscience.

Interest in winter canola production has been focused on the potential for winter oilseeds to contribute to the U.S Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge goal of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050.

The partnership combines Bunge’s grain origination and processing, Chevron’s fuel distribution, and Corteva’s proprietary genetics to position winter canola as a leading feedstock for renewable fuel. Central to this strategy is a new oilseed processing facility in Destrehan, Louisiana, which is slated to begin processing canola by 2026.

To meet projected demand by 2026, the strategic partnership launched a pilot program in the 2023–24 marketing year, contracting 5,000 acres across western Kentucky and Tennessee. By 2024–25, the initiative expanded to over 35,000 acres spanning Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Missouri (Pioneer, 2024). Reported insured acres from USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) confirm this growth (Figure 1), with average increases of nearly 500% across Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee—highlighted by 7,500 acres in Tennessee and 25,000 in Kentucky.

Based on the anticipated crush capacity at the Destrehan, LA facility, near-term canola demand could reach 100,000 to 150,000 acres across the Southern United States. Over the longer term, the partnering companies project demand could rise to nearly 1 million acres as infrastructure and markets scale (Heslip, 2024).

Early reports from Kentucky and Tennessee suggest winter canola average yields of 40–65 bushels per acre. Contract prices for 2024 (2025 crop year) hovered around $12 per bushel, depending on contract timing, acres contracted, and freight costs. Gross revenue of $480-$780 per acre provides many mid-south farmers with a viable financial alternative to traditional soft red winter wheat production (Gross revenue of $420-$468; University of Kentucky and University of Tennessee 2025 Crop Budgets).

Many growers report lower input costs compared to winter wheat, contributing to higher profit margins at current price levels. Currently, acreage contracts are being offered to producers for fall planting. Acreage contracts provide producers with a defined number of acres at a specified price. Production is not specified in the contract; the contract writer takes all production for the contracted acres at the set price. Before entering a production contract, producers need to fully understand the terms and conditions, including production practices, delivery, and quality specifications.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt27de21f7bb17ee4b/687793adb16d914694ff9161/canola-GettyImages-157331241-alexxx1981.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-16 09:09:39.269702

""I've been critical of the EU targets because I don't think they're going to be achieved,"" International Air Transport Association director-general Willie Walsh told reporters in Singapore.

""I struggle to see how we will have sufficient sustainable aviation fuel available to meet the near-term target.""

EU rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 before soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

But a study published by Airlines for Europe, an industry group representing 17 carriers, estimated that SAF production would be 30 percent below levels necessary to achieve the goal in 2030.

""I think the EU in particular needs to reevaluate the targets that they've set,"" Walsh said, adding however that the industry target of net-zero emissions by 2050 was still achievable.

He said IATA had been reluctant to the idea of setting some near-term targets.

What the EU should have been doing was to assess the current and future production of green fuel ""and then set a target relevant to the production"", according to Walsh.

""The idea that we're setting targets when we're not seeing the production of sustainable fuel makes no sense whatsoever,"" he said.

Walsh said individual airlines in Europe ""are buying SAF outside of the EU to comply with their targets"", which he said also ""doesn't make an awful lot of sense"" because of the carbon footprint generated by transporting the fuel.

To ensure the step-by-step practicality and safety of this initiative, the development of the novel project is structured around four key areas.

«Ocean capture is more efficient than DAC,» Steve Oldham, Captura CEO

Phase 1 will serve to clarify the feasibility and design of the ambitious project, where the partnering organizations will work on defining use cases, as well as requirements and technical criteria for establishing a viable water-to-e-SAF pathway.

In the following phase, activities will center around advancing and refining SeaO2’s electrochemical technology that will be used to efficiently extract carbon dioxide from seawater, as well as ultrapure water to be used for hydrogen production.

During Phase 3, the project will test and customize steps for turning captured CO2 into alcohols and olefins—two materials that are vital components for the production of sustainable aviation fuel. For the needs of the project, the team of developers will use innovative reactor designs and catalysts.

Lastly, in the final phase of development, the project will undergo a techno-economic analysis, where the team will assess the integrated water-to-e-SAF process, evaluating it against traditionally used kerosene to determine the cost-effectiveness and scalability of this approach.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CH-Homepage-Post-size-2025-07-16T132842.348.jpg,N,,2025-07-16 09:09:55.200251

Under enterprising projects to tackle climate change, the European Union demands that airlines gradually raise the quantity of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) they utilise to fuel planes. Airlines, however, grumble that the method is not widely available and too costly.

Why is IATA critical of EU green targets?

“I’ve been critical of the EU targets because I don’t think they’re going to be achieved,”

International Air Transport Association director-general Willie Walsh briefed journalists in Singapore.

“I struggle to see how we will have sufficient sustainable aviation fuel available to meet the near-term target.”

How much SAF is required under EU rules?

According to impending EU legislation, carriers will need to include either in their fuel mix 2% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) beginning this year, 6% by 2030 and then increase to 70% beginning in 2050.

However, an analysis published by Airlines for Europe, which represents 17 carriers, estimated that among major producing regions, SAF production will be noted as 30% less taken together than what the aim suggests by 2030.

“I think the EU in particular needs to reevaluate the targets that they’ve set,”

Walsh stated, adding, however, that the industry goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 was still possible. He stated IATA had been hesitant to the concept of putting some near-term goals.

Is the EU setting targets without fuel supply data?

What the European Union should have been accomplishing was to evaluate the current and coming production of green fuel,

“and then set a target relevant to the production”,

He said.

“The idea that we’re setting targets when we’re not seeing the production of sustainable fuel makes no sense whatsoever,”

Walsh stated.

He further stated individual airlines in the EU

“are buying SAF outside of the EU to comply with their targets”,

Which he expressed also

“doesn’t make an awful lot of sense”

Due to the carbon footprint caused by transporting the fuel.

What makes SAF essential to aviation decarbonization goals?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a biofuel made from renewable plant and animal materials such as used cooking oil, fats, and other biomass feedstocks. SAF is meant to substantially reduce carbon emissions compared to petroleum-based jet fuel. SAF is vital for the aviation industry’s ability to meet target emissions, such as net-zero emissions by 2050. SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 80% and, in certain cases, 94% depending on the provided feedstock and type of process.",https://brusselsmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/IATA-chief-urges-EU-to-revise-airline-green-fuel-targets.webp,N,,2025-07-16 11:07:34.707397

Dear reader,

The farmers are back. As the European Commission gears up to announce later today its plans for the EU budget post-2027 — including how much of the pie agriculture should receive — farmers have returned to the streets of Brussels, apparently planning this time to leave a pile of boots outside the EU executive’s headquarters.

Farmers are not the only ones fearful of cuts to their spending. Ahead of the announcement of the multiannual financial framework, nature campaigners have warned about the dangers of slashing support for biodiversity, and climate groups fear defence will win out over decarbonisation.

“In the negotiations on the next MFF, decision makers must keep the EU’s long-term investment needs front and centre,” says Clara Calipel, research fellow at the Institute for Climate Economics think-tank. “This includes the climate transition, which is hampered by an investment gap of over €300bn annually.”

Calipel urges policymakers to ensure the budget becomes “a cornerstone in a long-term investment framework for the EU, offering stability in turbulent times, providing predictability to private economic actors, and helping reduce the climate investment gap in a timely and cost-effective manner”.

I’ll be following developments in Brussels today and will update you in tomorrow morning’s newsletter.

Legal risks of calling alternative aviation fuels ‘sustainable’

Elsewhere, UK non-profit Opportunity Green argues airlines, financial institutions and other associated businesses should stop using the term “sustainable aviation fuel” to describe fuels being touted as greener alternatives to fossil kerosene to power aircraft. It says the term is misleading and could leave organisations open to legal risks.

Instead, companies should label them as “alternative fuels” and include information on their full lifecycle environmental impacts, the report argues.

While the future of the EU Green Claims Directive is decidedly shaky, the non-profit says the bloc’s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive already prevents companies from providing false or incomplete information about a product to consumers and includes articles on green claims. And the EU directive on “empowering consumers for the green transition” prohibits “sustainable” from being used as a generic claim to demonstrate environmental performance without the inclusion of a product’s social performance, it notes.

Over in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority has the power to fine companies misleading consumers, including through greenwashing, under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, which came into force in April.

Retailers face real repercussions under DMCC

Indeed, writing just over a year after the DMCC was introduced, Duncan Reed and Roni Rossa from law firm TLT urge all retailers to ensure their houses are in order. The act carries real financial and reputational repercussions for those that fail to comply, they warn.

“While the CMA has allowed businesses a grace period of three months to comply with the rules on fake reviews, we may well see the CMA’s first multimillion-pound fine for greenwashing in the UK in the near future,” write Reed and Rossa.

“Retailers need to act now to review their advertising claims — past, present and future — and implement internal processes and systems to ensure they are not misleading the average consumer.”

Gas for tech giants

Meanwhile, Troutman Pepper Locke partner Jennie Simmons says US federal policies are driving fresh interest in oil and gas, but underlines that private equity companies are also continuing to explore opportunities in low-carbon areas such as nuclear, solar and energy storage.

One reason for this attention from investors in all energy sources is the US’s exploding electricity demand driven by artificial intelligence-heavy data centres. Where once tech companies were boasting about their green credentials, they may increasingly look to broaden their horizons to include gas.

Simmons quotes Tailwater Capital co-founder and managing director Jason Downie, who says: “If you had asked me five years ago whether these tech giants would be advocating for natural gas, I’d have said no way. But they understand that energy reliability is non-negotiable.”

Until tomorrow,

“The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it, because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs,” Iata’s director-general Willie Walsh said at a media roundtable in Singapore.

Iata estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered

a low-carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel,

is expected to reach two million tonnes, or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025.

“Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” Mr Walsh said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel.

By Iata’s assessment, he said “the cost that they’re charging is way in excess of the actual cost of the limited supplies of sustainable fuel”.

“The EU in effect has facilitated monopoly suppliers to increase prices with no environmental benefit,” said Mr Walsh, adding that the region needs to re-evaluate its SAF targets.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a 6 per cent SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. The EU is offering some subsidies for SAF purchases by airlines, Reuters reported in June.

On the supply front, at least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have started up or are earmarked to start production in 2025 , targeting exports regionally and to Europe. Singapore is among key exporters of the green fuel to the EU.

Mr Walsh also questioned the use of palm oil as a means to produce sustainable fuel.

“I think that you could argue there is sustainable palm oil and there is palm oil that wouldn’t be considered sustainable, and I think in some parts of the world there it’s too black and white,” Mr Walsh said.

We need to have a much more “nuanced approach” to the usage of palm oil as a feedstock and “much more detailed assessment of the sustainability of the feedstock”, he added.

Under the new collaboration, the companies are targeting the expansion of regenerative agricultural practices across 240,000 acres of farmland by 2030, as they aim to deepen supply chain resilience, support farming communities in the implementation of regenerative practices, and unlock opportunities for scaling sustainable agriculture.

According to PepsiCo, the creation of a more resilient agricultural system is critical to its business, as the company sources 35 crops and ingredients from more than 60 countries for its food and beverages. The company recently announced a new goal to drive the adoption of regenerative agriculture, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres of land used to grow crops and ingredients for its products by 2030.

Iowa contributed more than 15% of the US’ supply of corn last year. As such, efforts will be led on the ground by nonprofit organization Practical Farmers of Iowa, which will provide tailored agronomic advice, technical guidance and incentive payments to help farmers transition to regenerative practices, as well as enrollment and verification services.

Participating farmers will receive support to adopt techniques such as cover cropping, reduced tillage, and nutrient management.

Jim Andrew, PepsiCo’s Chief Sustainability Officer, said:

“By working with farmers to understand what’s best for their farms and partnering across the supply chain we can accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices that can result in healthier soil, reduced emissions, and improved crop yields and livelihoods for farmers. This collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and Practical Farmers of Iowa creates shared value and long-term sustainability that we believe will strengthen our business today and in the future.”

Cargill has said that this collaboration will support its commitment to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland and provide training on sustainable agriculture practices and improve access to markets for 10 million farmers by 2030.

Pilar Cruz, Chief Sustainability Officer at Cargill, said:

“This partnership is about delivering practical, measurable results – starting on the farm, where the food system begins. By coming together across the value chain, we can help create the conditions for regenerative agriculture to take root and grow.

Q Thank you for joining us. I think we are in a slightly unusual position, in that we are all competing to try to make slight improvements to legislation that we all agree is necessary and positive. My question is about the source of the funding for the RCM. The Government made it clear that their preference is that it comes from a levy on users. An alternative, which we see in other jurisdictions, is that it comes from ETS sources, which would slightly more directly couple the emissions component to the consumption. The intention to not predicate the source of funding on the money being provided is clear. Do any of the panellists have an opinion on those two options and the path that the Government have taken for the funding source?

Gaynor Hartnell: There are really only two options for the levy: airlines or aviation fuel suppliers. A large part of why aviation fuel suppliers were chosen may have been because, administratively, they are the obligated party when it comes to the mandate. They are expected to pass the cost of the mandate through to airlines—their fuel customers. They would be expected to pass the cost of the levy to airlines, or indeed, if the levy actually brings in money—these are very small balances of money in comparison with the balances to do with the mandate—they would be expected to pass those costs back to the customers. The aim is to deal fairly with a fairly small amount of money. It is not the additional cost of the sustainable aviation fuel; it is just the cost of levelising and stabilising it, which is a sliver in comparison.

Rob Griggs: For us as airlines, the funding is a critical issue about fairness and accountability. As Gaynor said, the understanding is that the levy will be on the supplier. The issue for us is that we understand that the costs are likely to be passed through to airlines. We just want to make sure that that is transparent. We have seen through the early stages of the mandate that there is some concern that excessive compliance fees are perhaps being put on to the SAF. Voluntary SAF seems to be a lot cheaper than mandated SAF and there is not necessarily a clear reason for that. We want transparency in terms of how the levy is passed through.

As Gaynor said, in theory, if the market price for SAF is high—if there is relatively little of it—it is likely that the suppliers will actually pay into the counterparty. We want to make sure that if money is essentially being paid back to the counterparty from the producers, that money does not just go to the suppliers and sit there. There should be a transparent mechanism, however it works, through which that money then comes back to airlines and airline customers. It has to work both ways, essentially.

How do you do that? We have looked at ETS for a long time. You are right that in the European Union, the emissions trading scheme funds are used: for example, to help to close the price gap on SAF. We are not doing that, which has competitiveness implications for UK SAF, separate to the RCM. Of course there are ways to make sure that it is a two-way street.

Paul Greenwood: We have to recognise that if the desire is to pass the cost on to the passengers, the airlines and the people who are shipping freight around the world by plane, then we should put the charge on them. That is the most direct way of doing it. There are charges now that are put on airlines and on freight directly. There is no reason why you cannot do this as well. I do not buy the argument that it is a relatively small amount of money, therefore we should just put it on to the fuel suppliers and they should deal with it. I do not think that is right. I certainly do not agree with the idea that this is because “the polluter pays”—that is erroneous and a false statement.

We do not know how much this will be, because we do not know how many projects there will be, what the costs will be, or how the CFD mechanism will go. We do not know what the cost of this will be. I support what Rob is saying: if this is something imposed upon us, I do not wish to profit from it but I do want to pass 100% of it on to the consumer of my fuel. The only way I can do that is if I know what it is ahead of time, so that I can bill them the exact amount of money so they pay the exact amount. At the moment, this legislation talks about market share, but market share moves and changes. Therefore it is a very imprecise way of doing that.

Ours is a very fine margin business. If you get this wrong, you will make the UK a less attractive market. We have to understand that fundamentally people will do different things around their molecules. One data point worth remembering is that about 70% of the jet fuel consumed in the UK at the moment is imported. Effectively, we rely on people bringing jet to market to sell it profitably. If they are uncertain around the cost of that jet fuel, they will potentially look to sell it into different markets, which can lead to energy security and market dynamic issues. There are unintended consequences here that need to be thought through very carefully.

Q Thank you all for joining us. The evidence that you have given so far has been very helpful. There was a question earlier about waste hierarchy and the availability of waste feedstocks as one source of raw fuel or raw material for some of the second-generation SAF. Is enough being done across Government, in a holistic way, to ensure that the goals of the SAF mandate, the RCM and this Bill are achieved? Is enough being done to ensure that the things that are needed—waste feedstocks, the reforms to planning and energy production for eSAFs—are in place? What is going to hold back what we are trying to achieve in this Bill, and what needs to be done elsewhere?

Jonathon Counsell: That is a really strong point. There is a key question about the waste hierarchy, which Gaynor spoke to. Currently, waste going to SAF is treated the same way as incineration or energy from waste, but the analysis is clear that we can get twice as much energy capture from producing SAF than from producing energy from waste. We feel that you are getting a lot more bang for your buck from using waste to produce SAF than from other things, which we think should be reflected in aviation being prioritised in the waste hierarchy.

On renewable energy, last year the Sustainable Aviation road map made it quite clear that 3G SAF—where you basically electrolyse water to get hydrogen and you capture CO2 from the atmosphere—is going to take a lot of renewable electricity. We are going to need a lot more of that within the UK if we are going to support a domestic power-to-liquid market.

Luke Ervine: In addition to that, we need to think about other areas of SAF, when we talk about SAF having a nominal value associated with its ability to reduce greenhouse gases. We are working alongside the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and the Department for Business and Trade to understand how carbon can form part of the solution, and decarbonising the SAF that we are producing is also key. We are also working side by side with the Treasury to understand what the revenues from the ETS look like.

That has been quite successful in the last few years, especially since the advent of the jet zero taskforce, which was a really key turning point. I think we are going to continue in that vein to work cross-departmentally and across industry to work through some of these finer details. I think it has been very useful to be part of the Jet Zero Council; we are actually a co-chair, alongside Mike Kane, of the jet zero taskforce. Carrying on in that vein is very important and useful.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: This also enables us to reduce our dependence on used cooking oil imported from elsewhere in the world as a feedstock for first generation SAF. A strategic move towards 2G and 3G also gives more flexibility and capability for the market to scale up in the long-term, and allows it to use waste products from the UK, as opposed to having to ship it in from China or south-east Asia.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - -

I just have a pushback or challenge on the comments about SAF being popular. An earlier pushback, too, was on the £1.50 per passenger on top of tickets. Does that suggest that this might be easier to sell—easier to promote—to passengers than you might have suggested in the first place? I think the suggestion was that certain demographics and certain airline customer groups will be more or less in favour and able to pay it.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: To add to that, for us, the average leisure traveller would say—to put it in colloquial terms—“It’s your problem to solve. We want you to do it, but we’re not going to pay for it.” With corporates, they have their own corporate targets, so from a B2B—business to business—perspective, they want to hit those.

Jonathon Counsell: I will answer the risk question. Yes, without the policy, we have no 2G SAF, so we would be dependent on the 1G market, which will cap out in the early 2030s. We are not going to achieve our decarbonisation targets without 2G SAF. That is the biggest risk without the Bill.

The biggest risk with the Bill is buy-out. If the incentive does not produce enough SAF—we understand the buy-out is there to manage short-term supply shortages, but if we have long-term buy-out, which we have seen in the ground transport fuels market—that is policy failure. Essentially, that huge cost is £6,000 per tonne of SAF, and if that cost comes straight back to the airline, it will go on air fares, but you do not get any decarbonisation—you get huge cost and no decarbonisation. That is our biggest risk.

Luke Ervine: Some of the risks of the RCM that we need to be cognisant of include covering too much of the mandate with the RCM. We do not want to lock ourselves into high prices forever and a day. Obviously we want that to stimulate the part of the market that needs that support, so we want to leave enough room for competition.

The other thing we need to think about is how suppliers might bear some of the risk that is presented in the RCM—how some of the cost of capitalising the fund, or any cost of compliance failures that they may face, might be passed through to airlines and consumers. That key area of transparency is therefore important. This needs to be well thought through, but we also need to do it quickly because we are reaching a pivotal point in terms of buy-out where we will have to just pay for no decarb.

Lahiru Ranasinghe: Ultimately, the RCM is a derisking measure. It is a stepping stone towards what we want, which is a functioning SAF market. It is a complicated challenge. There is a lot of work to be done over the coming stages and throughout the process to make sure that we end up with a competitive UK SAF market so that producers can compete on a global scale, and, crucially, we as airlines can compete on a global and European scale by keeping flying affordable and continuing to grow in the UK. On an environmental level, if there is x amount of growth coming through the UK, which is supporting an environmentally robust SAF mandate, and production in the UK, as opposed to that going elsewhere in the world, that is driving sustainable growth on a global scale.

Jonathon Counsell: On the amendment question, I do not think we need to look at any amendments at this stage. On the targeting of the scheme, we should make it an opt-in scheme for the projects that need it. We do not want a blanket scheme to cover all 2G SAF because that is not needed, but we could have projects opt in with some qualifying criteria—for example, projects that are early stage, first of a kind or high risk, and that cannot get funding without the scheme.

I would not say SAF is popular—that is probably going a step too far. It is fair to say there is greater acceptance of SAF as a solution, but let us be clear: nobody wants to pay for it. However, we accept that there is a cost to the net zero transition, and our job is to minimise that cost as far as possible.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - -

Q Thank you both. A lot of the criticism and cynicism over the value of SAF and its environmental benefits are around the fuel source or feedstuff—you have alluded to it. The Bill concentrates on second and third generation SAF. Do you see that as enabling a lot of the potential greenwashing of SAF that may have been behind all that cynicism? Does it address some of those challenges?

As a follow-up question, similar to one that I asked the previous panel, what do you see as some of the challenges across Government that will hold back your ability to produce more SAF? You referred to the ability to use some of the feedstuff to produce second generation SAF mixing, but I think planning and energy will be among the responses as well.

Sophia Haywood: On sustainability and fraud, I have been working on sustainability certification over a number of different fuel types. We have ISCC, which is like an auditing process that we generally have to go through—there are other providers out there—to be able to prove the sustainability of our fuel. This is a very complicated and rigorous process, and I have gone through it many times on different types of fuels.

On the sustainability piece, the guidance that has been put out already in the SAF mandate is very high, and we have to go through a lot of that auditing process. To your point about the risk of fraud and other challenges around greenwashing that potentially could have happened in the past, I think the UK has done a good thing there with how it has approached this, so I support the approach that we are taking. That is not necessarily in this Bill; I would say that that has more already been laid out in the mandate rules.

On what else we would like to see, potentially, through this, as I said before, there is a piece around the SAF allowances—this is a scheme currently in Europe that is funded through ETS revenues. Obviously, you are always taking from somewhere with funding, but you are trying to take at least from a funding source that is coming directly from industry, and using that to then fund the industry back with SAF. I think that has good bones and good structure, and I would love to see that being fleshed out.

On a more practical level, for sure, there is planning. We have just had a recent example that some of my engineers have told me about: waiting two months for an answer on a very small question. It is not because of the quality of the planning teams; they are fantastic. It is the fact that they are quite constrained and there are not enough of them. I suppose there is a potential short-to-medium-term fix there, but also a longer-term fix in terms of thinking of the skills that we need moving forward. We automatically think of more engineering and STEM roles, but we also need the rest of the value chain to be adequate in terms of workforce and other things.

I alluded earlier to the details of the mandate being really good on the sustainability piece, but there are some very complex rules that we are still consistently trying to navigate six months on. There are different interpretations to different questions—for example, in the nitty gritty of how hydrogen is treated or the rules around electricity and displacement. They are more in the detail, but we end up spending quite a lot of time on them as a company trying to break through into this market.

Equally, it is a learning experience for my colleagues doing these projects all across the world. We have other projects going on in India and Australia. As a Brit, I want the UK to be our flagship and our first, and I am working hard to make sure that it is, but as I always say to people, I am competing with my colleagues in Australia and all over because lots of people want SAF. It is about how we can make it as efficient and easy as possible, keeping in mind all the good sustainability criteria, to get steel in the ground here in the UK.

Noaman Al Adhami: From our perspective, the route we are using—the Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene route—is an American Society for Testing and Materials route that is approved already. On sustainability, the feedstock criteria are well defined in the SAF mandate. All the types of feedstock that are eligible to produce SAF are well defined. We are complying with that. The greenhouse gas and carbon intensity are other factors for measuring sustainability. For our project, without carbon capture, we are at minus 80% or minus 85% from the fossil equivalent. With carbon capture, we will go negative—we will go to even more than minus 200%. That is key for us.

On what could be done better, planning is always an area where we need improvement in terms of time. There is also connection to the grid, for example—grid connections take a very long time. We decided to produce our own power on site using a biomass boiler rather than waiting for a grid connection because the answer we got was that we will get it by the end of the 2030s—2039—and we cannot wait until then.

Another requirement, which is very specific to us, is to get connected as early as possible to the carbon network once we start producing SAF by the end of 2029, especially when there is a unique benefit for the UK. By the way, that is very unique to the UK. No other country has a SAF mandate that is about carbon scaling and at the same time has the capability to capture CO2. That is also unique in Europe because the UK and Norway together have 75% of the carbon capture capacity in Europe. It is really very unique to the UK. Our ask is to get connected to reduce carbon intensity, provide a better price per certificate, and also pay, because we do not need subsidy for carbon capture. We are ready to pay the transport and storage costs to the Government for carbon capture. Those are the three main points.",https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/static/UK_Parliament/img/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-16 06:03:07.398061

Q29 For transparency, I should declare that I have visited Zero Petroleum on a couple of occasions and met with people there. Mr McKiernan, your product is a power-to-liquid product; it is not derived from feedstocks or waste. Do you think that a power-to-liquid solution is the long-term solution for sustainable and synthetic fuels for aviation use? Do you worry that any part of the Bill incentivises short-term solutions over long-term solutions?

Doug McKiernan: On the first part of the question, given my knowledge of the sector as an engineer, I do not believe that there is a long-term solution other than power to liquid. At the moment, in the ASTM fuel standards, there are a lot of bio-based, sugar-based and food-waste solutions. In my view, those are not truly scalable, and their cost will only ever go up, because of the shortage of land and so on. The power-to-liquid side is truly scalable. The feedstock is air, water and renewable energy. It is extremely clean, and it gives the industry the opportunity—in, say, 10 or 15 years’ time—to move to fuels that are even more performant than current fossil-based fuels.

We are very supportive of the Bill, and we think it will be useful for us if it goes through. It will give confidence to the sector and bring investment, which then helps to bring capability to the UK. It is a great way to kickstart the e-fuels industry, which is the medium to long-term solution, not a short-term solution. We have been working in this sector for only five years. Because of our education system, we probably have some of the best talent in this sector globally, and we are able to recruit that.

We have already made significant inroads into the quality of the fuel, which is over and above anything else that is now available—and when I say that, I mean globally available. This little company that we have—and it is little—has been able to outperform some of the bigger competitors in the field. Towards the end of this year, we will submit our product to the ASTM governing body to get it certified. The intellectual property that we are generating is key to the UK. We need to make sure that the IP is generated here in the UK and kept here because I believe that in five years from now all the big decisions around e-fuels—all the important ones—and the freedom to operate will have been worked out, and we do not want that to be worked out anywhere other than in the UK. It will enable us to kickstart the energy generation within the UK so that we have a sovereign capability for energy generation. I hope that answers your question.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q It does. I have one brief additional question, mindful that we have only 20 minutes with you. Off the back of that protection of UK IP, do you think the Bill could be strengthened to bring in greater protection of technologies such as those that have been developed by Zero and other companies in the UK, so that when the strike price is set it does not end up with foreign-owned technology being incentivised in the United Kingdom? Do you believe that you, along with others that have similar technologies, can scale fast enough to meet the other side of the coin of this Bill, the SAF mandate?

Doug McKiernan: That is a very good question. I think we are in a race. At the moment we need the Bill to give confidence to investors. That will help us to scale. That is the main benefit in the short term. With regard to the IP, there needs to be a mandate somewhere in Government to support core e-fuels development. A lot of small companies at the moment are not getting that, so we are at risk of going abroad with the technology. The Aerospace Technology Institute heavily sponsors hydrogen and electric, but does not really support the core technology of e-fuels. Although we have this mandate, which we think is great, there is a bit of a gap there that could do with addressing.

Luke Taylor (Sutton and Cheam) (LD) - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q You have given a really helpful view of the long-term solution. I do not think many would argue with PtL being the solution for the industry. This question is similar to one I have asked other panel members: how do other parts of Government, other levers and other enablers need to be brought in place to enable you to do what you need to do? What conditions does the Bill need to set? What do you see as the main challenges for the Government to act? You have spoken about skills. What else needs to be done in the Bill to enable you to be successful and for the Bill to achieve what it needs to achieve?

Doug McKiernan: Coming back to the IP, there needs to be some sort of support for e-fuels core technology development. That is very important. If you want e-fuels to be part of the future, we need to make sure that that research is supported in the UK and that when it is supported in the UK there is proper IP regulation of that. That needs to be mandated as part of the support from the Government.

What is happening in the aviation area is clearer cut, because you cannot get the energy density into an aircraft with hydrogen or electric, so it is kind of obvious, but I think it is a solution for a lot of the fossil-based fuels, including gasoline and diesel. I think what we will end up doing is that, if we can develop that core technology, it is then transferable to other sectors, and with that we will be able to deal with the real problem, which is the end-to-end solution of getting renewable energy to the consumer. That is the real challenge.

At the moment, we are talking about sustainable aviation fuel, but actually there is a lot of energy in the North sea that is not getting used because of the challenge of the cost of getting it from there to the consumer. This is where e-fuels come in. The Bill would help to move us in the right direction to start to tackle that problem, because you would have these companies with the new tech working out how to make that viable. There is a very good, well researched paper by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the US and the Department of Energy. It was done back in 2021.

I had a conversation with our CEO and the board one day and realised, “We’re not actually a fuels company, although we’re called Zero Petroleum and we’re making jet fuel and gasoline. We’re actually an energy transmission company, because all the problems we have with renewable energy are solved by liquid hydrocarbons”. If you look at the paper I referred to, done back in 2021, the cost of getting energy from the North sea in a cable to the consumer is probably forty to fiftyfold what it is if you wanted to do it with a liquid hydrocarbon. That is the fundamental problem that we are going to struggle with going forward. We are slowly going to morph as technology and engineering rather than policy dictate what the solution is.

Mr Paul Kohler (Wimbledon) (LD) - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Using carbon dioxide to produce SAF is a wonderfully seductive and brilliant solution. You are addressing the regulatory obstacles, but what are the technical obstacles?

Doug McKiernan: To be perfectly transparent with everybody, with carbon dioxide at the moment I think the direct air capture, compared with where we are, is a bit of an Achilles heel. It is probably around two to four years behind in its scale-up, in terms of being able to keep pace with our scale-up, but actually there is plenty of biogenic carbon dioxide around for large-scale commercial plants here in the UK, which could be a stepping stone to the direct air capture. A lot of the work with direct air capture at the moment talks about the cost of it; you can sequestrate the carbon dioxide in the ground. That is not what we want to do as a petroleum company; we want to put that carbon dioxide into a liquid fuel, and then it is net zero. You have carbon dioxide and water coming out of the exhaust—whether that is a turbine or internal combustion engine. If you capture the carbon dioxide again with the direct air capture, you are then net zero.

When you integrate that direct air capture with our process, the cost of direct air capture is probably reduced by 80%, because we have an exothermic reaction going on, and the majority of the cost in direct air capture is in the de-absorption of carbon dioxide. Once you have absorbed it from the air, you have to heat up the catalyst again—or the material that has absorbed it—to get the carbon dioxide out again, and we have an exothermic reaction. We would not have those costs associated with our process. Integration of our direct air capture with our power-to-liquid solution in three to four years’ time would be quite a mature technology, and definitely scalable within the UK.

Q Partly because you are based in Oxfordshire, my mind goes to universities. I wondered—based on what was said by a previous contributor—where we are with this technology compared with other countries. I do not know whether you are working with universities, but I am sure you are working with young people to develop skills. Is there is a risk, if the Bill is not passed and we did not get the RCM, that some of the skills that you are developing will be lost to other countries?

Doug McKiernan: There is no question about it. The people who we have recruited have been researching, and have done not only doctorates but post-docs in this area. They have been working in it for nine or 10 years, hoping that there was a company out there that would recruit them and turn their R&D into a reality. These people are very passionate about their career and what they want to do. They are not going to work for the money; they come to make a difference. We have recruited a lot of those people. They will go wherever the company is that will make what they want to do happen.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Good afternoon. You have talked about the sourcing of aviation fuel and blending SAF as well as fossil fuel for aviation. Shell is clearly a global company, but the Bill’s underpinning is the United Kingdom’s domestic fuel security. Where does Shell sit in terms of viewing domestic fuel security for aviation use within the United Kingdom? Do you think the Bill will deliver on not just that primary goal but increasing UK-based SAF production?

Ruben van Grinsven: That is a really good question. We are looking globally at various opportunities to build SAF production plants. The second and third generations especially are more challenging than the first generation. To make the investment case robust, we need to solve a whole number of challenges—some are around ensuring that we can make the technology work, and some are around financing. But a lot of it has to do with the value of the product that we make, and the certainty around the value of the product.

The revenue certainty mechanism being discussed in the Bill is very compelling. There is always a combination of different factors. It is partially fundamentals about whether we can get the right feedstocks, but part of it is also about the certainty we have about the price we are going to get for our products. The revenue certainty mechanism is absolutely very helpful.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q That is helpful, but on this particular point about UK-based production, a global company like Shell—there is nothing wrong with this position; it is what you do—will source SAF from wherever it is cheapest around the world. Does the Bill go far enough to pump-prime UK-based production so that a global giant like Shell—nothing wrong with being a global giant—will choose UK-based plants, or will the mechanism in the Bill not produce SAF at a cost that you think is competitive for your usage, blends and potential future use when compared to that from suppliers overseas?

Ruben van Grinsven: There are two elements. One is whether we can invest in a UK plant. That is hard to tell at this point in time for two reasons. We do not fully understand all the details associated with the Bill. I think the principles are very promising, but there are many things that need to be detailed out, which, at the end of the day, will decide how appealing the investment is going to be. There is a lot of that.

Can UK-produced SAF be competitive in a global market? I think that depends a little bit on the type of technology, but it is also very timebound. At this point in time, this is not the cheapest place to make e-SAF, just because power is more expensive than other places in the world. But if we continue to build out the renewables, as I have seen in plans before, I think there are going to be more affordable electrons around that can then be converted into e-SAF. In the longer term, e-SAF can be competitive.

For other technologies, I think things are less location dependent. Ethanol to jet, for instance, is very feedstock dependent, and I think that the UK can be as competitive as other places. Again, the fundamental competitiveness is one element. The other element is whether the whole investment case makes sense, and part of that is financing —and part of the financing is driven by revenue certainty. It is not just the fundamentals but the whole package that determines the attractiveness of the investment.

Q I think it is fair to say that the international supply chain is becoming more constrained and that there is a more protectionist international global economy. Can you give us a flavour of some of the economic and logistical challenges that you would face, importing SAF into the UK? As a follow on, if there is a requirement around energy security to set up shop in the UK, given the known knowns, would you look for subsidies from the current Government to set up production in the UK?

Ruben van Grinsven: I am afraid I cannot fully answer that question because it is not the part of the business that I am in. I am not importing SAF to the UK, so I do not know how trade limitations are currently impacting SAF supply. I would have to ask a colleague and come back to that question. It is also hard to predict what the future is going to bring for global trade and how protectionism will impact the global free trade of all types of fuels.

If you produce domestic fuels, that is, of course, going to be helpful if you want energy security. I must say, though, that if you look at the volumes that we are talking about today, the energy security element in the early days is going to be limited because of the volume of the fuels involved.

Q Mr Downie stole my question, so I will develop it a bit further. The RCM sets the levy on to the fuel producers who will likely pass it on to passengers. You operate internationally and see mechanisms being implemented elsewhere in the world. We mentioned the alternative of using the ETS to fund the RCM. How do you see the advantages of one system or the other, and where have you seen alternatives implemented elsewhere that have worked well?

Ruben van Grinsven: That is a good question. First and foremost, the UK is ahead of pretty much everybody else when it comes to developing those mechanisms. I know the EU is basically inspired by the RCM and trying to come up with a similar framework, which it will be announcing in September in the sustainable transport investment plan. I think the initial thoughts are indeed to fund that through ETS.

I do not have a strong preference between ETS-funded or levy-funded. The most important thing is that it is clear, transparent, consistent and predictable. Once we know the details and find out how the whole mechanism will work, we can perfectly live with the levy mechanism—as long as it works practically. So we do not have a strong preference between ETS or levy funding.

Q You have just mentioned that you are looking broadly at SAF production and how that is going to play out into the future. Compared with other northern European countries, the UK has excellent access to renewable energy, and we had a very early responding hydrogen industry. What do you see as the UK’s unique opportunities in SAF production?

Ruben van Grinsven: There are two elements. One is the fundamentals: affordable renewable energy, other feedstocks, then the cost of building plants, labour, and everything else. At the moment, in terms of the fundamentals of renewable electricity, the UK does not have a clear advantage because power prices are slightly more expensive, and most of the renewable power in the UK is intermittent. That is an important thing that needs to be overcome.

You have a slight disadvantage compared with, for instance, the Nordics, such as Sweden and Finland; they have a lot of hydro and stable baseload renewable power. On the fundamental side, especially for power, I think there are other places that are currently a bit more competitive. However, many of the other elements, such as feedstock supply, labour and knowledge, are quite similar.

The biggest differentiator is probably the legislative and regulatory landscape. You are creating a market through mandates, which I think is extremely powerful. If you also increase investment certainty through an RCM, that element is unique and, at this point in time, very helpful.

Chris Vince - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Obviously, the Bill is trying to make it easier for us to produce SAF in this country, which is really important. I gather—if this is correct—that part of your role is to source SAF around the world. Do you feel there will be a greater need, and therefore a strong argument that we should be pushing ahead with SAF and producing it here in Britain? Although you said you cannot commit to where you will buy your SAF because of cost, would you say you will be in a place where you need more and more—and so it is very likely that you will have to source SAF from Britain, because you will need as many sources as possible?

Ruben van Grinsven: Especially for the second and third generation, SAF needs to develop. I think the consensus is that HEFA-based SAF is, at this moment, the most mature and affordable, so it is a great option. However, we also all believe that we are going to run out of feedstock at a certain time.

If you want to continue decarbonising aviation, you need additional forms of SAF—and that is where the second and third generations come in. We need to start developing those now, to learn how it is done and establish the technology and the fundamentals behind it. Starting that now is essential, and doing it in the UK could potentially give you a head start. If you do this before everybody else, you would have a technological and commercial head start, which could be an advantage.

Q If the Bill becomes an Act, Shell will find itself in a peculiar place given that it will be both a levy payer, as a fossil fuel producer, and a developer of SAF potentially looking to benefit from the strike price. The Government put an analysis in the public domain on Second Reading: they suggested that the ultimate cost to the end user, such as somebody getting a flight—there will be a different calculation for those using air freight—will be plus or minus £1.50. Witnesses earlier suggested that that might be a “conservative” estimate—in their own words. Where would Shell see the ultimate cost pass on to the end user?

Ruben van Grinsven: The principle makes sense: at the end of the day, additional cost will find its way to the end user. We do not have enough information at this point in time to calculate what the cost is going to be because a lot of the details of the Bill are unknown. We would like to better understand how this is going to work, what the volumes are, what the timing is going to be, and how we will organise the contracts between the supplier and the off-taker. There are a lot of things that we do not know at this point, and therefore it is difficult to model what the final cost of the levy is going to be for the end consumer. I do not know; it is difficult to answer.

On top of that, I think it is going to change over time. Over time, if the market is short and the prices are high, money might flow towards the levy, so it would be like a negative levy but then it might turn into a positive levy. It is very difficult to assess that and put a number on it.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Good afternoon, Mr Gorman. I will lead with the question that I asked the previous witness about end-user cost. Clearly, Heathrow’s business model relies on you having many people coming through and getting on aircraft, or arriving in the UK on an aircraft. If the cost of flying were to increase significantly, that might impact Heathrow’s very business model, with fewer people being able to take those flights. Some of the evidence we have heard today seems to challenge the Government’s presumption, presented on Second Reading, that any cost increase to the end user, as a result of the Bill and the SAF mandate, would be plus or minus £1.50. Do you share the Government’s view on that, or do you share some of the other witnesses’ views that that might be optimistic?

Matt Gorman: Let me start by saying that we take this issue very seriously, for the reasons you have outlined. It is central to our business. SAF is key to delivering the industry’s net zero transition plan: it is about 40% of the solution. I do not think that anyone can forecast the future costs and prices with exact certainty, but I will say that we test all our demand forecasts for Heathrow against a range of different carbon price scenarios, from low to high—“high” being the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero’s high scenarios. We do that because it is important for us to understand and our investors to understand, and because climate disclosure legislation now requires us to share that information in our annual report. We have concluded that demand for flying from Heathrow remains robust even in high carbon price scenarios in future. We are confident about that.

The Government have shared their analysis on the revenue certainty mechanism and the reasons behind it. That is one of the carbon costs that consumers will bear—there are clearly others—but I come back to the point that all our forecasts have shown that demand is robust.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q In respect of procurement of SAF to be available at the airport, will the Bill safeguard domestic fuel security? I ask that question largely through the lens of the challenge to Heathrow if fuel were suddenly to be unavailable in the United Kingdom for you to supply to the airlines on site. Is there any way that the Bill could be improved to shore up the domestic security position?

Matt Gorman: It is a good question. We welcome the Bill. As SAF is so important, the sector and Heathrow have advocated over a number of years both the mandate, which was passed as legislation at the beginning of the year, and the revenue certainty mechanism. It has benefits for energy security, green jobs, growth and decarbonisation. That has been one of the drivers for the sector to support it. The decarbonisation benefits are clear. On jobs and growth, earlier witnesses talked about the industry studies showing up to £10 billion of GVA and 60,000 jobs by 2050.

Energy security is one of those reasons. As SAF is a key part of the industry transition plan around the world, there will be global trading of SAF. Kerosene is a global commodity today; SAF will be in future. We think we will import some. However, the sector is supportive of domestic production, which is why we are so supportive of the Bill. I should say that Heathrow is not directly in the fuel value chain—we do not buy, make or sell fuel—but we are very involved in the debate, because it is so significant. All the fuel producers and investors we talk to say that the revenue certainty mechanism will help to unlock investment decisions in the UK. I am not sure whether the Bill could be improved to do that even more. I do not have a view on that.

Julia Buckley - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q My second question is about your role at Heathrow. We heard from earlier witnesses that, because the generation fuels are drop-in fuels, they are fairly confident that they could rely on existing infrastructure for storage and so on. As the person in charge of Heathrow, our largest airport, how confident are you that existing infrastructure and storage spaces can accommodate drop-in fuels?

Matt Gorman: Very confident, from everything we hear from fuel suppliers in this space. Looking at the different bits of infrastructure, starting briefly with aircraft and engines, the main aircraft and engine manufacturers are in the process of certifying all their aircraft to run on 100% SAF. In a sense, we do not have to worry about that problem immediately, because—apart from dedicated flights—we do not have 100% SAF flowing through pipes, but that is clearly their goal. I forget the exact dates, but I think that by the end of this decade they will all be doing it, if not before.

On pipelines and aircraft infrastructure, one of the main reasons that we have focused on SAF is that it requires upstream investment in production facilities, but it does not require changes in airport infrastructure or planes. That means that as soon as you can start producing SAF, you can start cutting carbon. As an illustration, at Heathrow, partly in anticipation while waiting for some of the Government market signals to develop and kick in, we introduced a landing charge incentive—a financial incentive. It started at 0.5% a couple of years ago, and now 3% of all the fuel being used at Heathrow is SAF, which has dropped into our systems without any issues. I should also say that 17% of the total global production of SAF is now uplifted through Heathrow.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q The SAF mandate is 10% by 2030. The EU target is much lower: 6%, I think. Our target goes up to 22% by 2040, but elsewhere the target increases more dramatically. As Heathrow is such a large user—17% is a massive component—will the mandate be achievable alongside the goals and targets set out in the Bill? You have said that other things need to be done and that this is part of a suite, but I guess the question is whether this is enough. Do you need to see more aggression and more ambition, with investment in firms through skills and through the measures we have drawn out from previous witnesses around the protection of IP? Do you see this as enough?

Matt Gorman: I think this is a very strong start from the UK. I was smiling when the Shell representative said that the EU had been inspired by the measures that the UK is taking. Joking aside, I have talked to fuel suppliers and investors to get a sense of how they are seeing the market. They say that this package, with the mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism, is a really strong policy package from the UK.

To answer your question, Heathrow has been invited by the Government to submit updated proposals for our expansion plans by the end of this month. Within them, we will be setting out our views on our future trajectory to net zero. We think that the mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism are vital. The Government have already said that they want to keep the mandate levels under review; you are right that although we are more ambitious to begin with and the EU is less ambitious, the EU takes over. Our view is that heading more in the direction of the EU’s ambition over time will be important for Heathrow and for aviation generally, but we will keep that under review.

It is really important to get started and make a strong start in this decade, to show that as well as producing SAF globally for use in the UK, as we are already doing, we can produce it in the UK.

Tom Collins - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q You have mentioned that the UK is taking a strong leadership position on this stepping-stone technology with SAF. If the UK were to prepare itself now, early on, to be in a leadership position in sustainable aviation using hydrogen, what do you think that would look like?

Matt Gorman: I think it would look broadly like what the UK is doing. We think about it in three buckets: the plane, the airport infrastructure and the regulatory environment. It is worth remembering that UK aerospace is one of the jewels in the crown of our manufacturing sector. We have a very long history in aerospace, and the Aerospace Technology Institute funds some of that technology development alongside the private sector. That is important.

With airport infrastructure, we have always said, certainly for Heathrow, that we do not want to be a blocker. We do not want a hydrogen plane to be designed but not able to fill up at our airport. We keep an active watching brief on technology developments. We have taken a stand at Heathrow to trial hydrogen technology so that we can understand and build understanding. That is partly to influence the regulatory environment so that we are supporting the roll-out of hydrogen.

The latest views from manufacturers are that we will probably start small with hydrogen—small plane sizes and small ranges—and build confidence there before getting bigger. However, that could play a real role in domestic connectivity. I think we are doing the right things, but it is a both/and with SAF and hydrogen, not an either/or. I would also say that SAF is the solution that we know exists today and that we can deploy today, so we need to get it moving.

Mr Kohler - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q First, given the obvious international aspect of aviation, does it make sense for the UK mandate and the EU mandate to diverge, or would it make more sense if they were the same? Secondly, we heard from one witness that the levy would encourage tankering, with air operators filling up in other locations. Does that happen now, and is it an issue that you can see being made worse by the levy?

Matt Gorman: On the first question, I touched earlier on the fact that the EU and the UK have taken different trajectories, certainly into the longer term. I will be a little bit careful in what I say, because we are just finalising our thinking on what we submit to the Government, but increasing ambition with SAF will be important in the UK as we build confidence in production and scale-up of the technology. We can see a case in future to be more ambitious with the UK mandate. I think the Government said that they want to keep that actively under review, which we support.

On the question of tankering, it happens to a limited extent today. We do not fly the aircraft, but our understanding, from when we last looked at it several years ago, is that on short-haul aircraft in particular, where there is a very rapid turnaround and you do not necessarily want to take time to fill up the aircraft at the other end of the route, the CO2 penalty was not huge in terms of the industry overall. I am not close enough to comment on whether the levy poses a particular challenge there, but when the Government get to the stage of consultation on the detailed design of the mechanism and are working with the industry, it will be important to design it in a way that avoids that wherever possible.

Amanda Hack - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q We talk an awful lot about the customers and what they might see on the price of their ticket, whether that is for freight or for going on holiday to Spain or wherever, but are your customers demanding that you be more environmentally friendly? As an airport, how far do you need your customers to support the transition to SAF?

Matt Gorman: It is a great question. All the evidence from our polling of customers, as well as what we read in regular polls and consumer surveys, shows that people are broadly concerned about climate change and environmental issues generally. In terms of aviation, they see that there is a role for customers, but they are clear that the industry needs to set out a plan and take action. They understand that airports do not necessarily fly planes, but that we clearly have a responsibility. They expect us to set out the plan, communicate it and take action at the airport where we can. In that sense, all the evidence shows that consumers support us taking action.

As the answer to an earlier question alluded to, the net zero transition will have some costs to consumers. The challenge is how we keep those costs as low as possible while reaching the goal of net zero. I think the balance of the mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism is well designed to achieve that. We think that domestic production in the long term so we are not reliant on imports—we have discussed the energy security angle—is a good way of helping to manage price certainty in future. Consumers are supportive, engaged and willing to pay a bit more to support the transition to net zero, but the industry and Government need to take action to manage it cost-effectively.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Green finance is something of a minefield across various technologies. A straightforward first question is whether the Bill is the most effective way to get finance into UK SAF production via the price mechanism. If the answer is no, what would be a better way of ensuring UK SAF production and the protection of UK intellectual property in that production? Where do you sit in the debate about what the ultimate cost to the end user will be?

Josh Garton: I think that the revenue certainty mechanism that is being proposed is a really good start to getting finance into the sector. Undoubtedly it will not be the only thing that is required: there are other risks that need to be addressed. The revenue certainty mechanism addresses price risk, as it is designed to, but other challenges remain for the second and third-generation fuels, and they may need to be addressed as well. I think that it is the best solution for addressing price risk. As other witnesses have described, when we speak to our colleagues in Europe and elsewhere, they see the package of regulation that the UK is proposing as some of the most promising in the world. The UK will become a very promising place to invest in SAF.

On your question about the price for the end consumer, it is very hard to forecast what that will be. There are a lot of forecasts out there. It obviously depends on the cost of production, the blending of the fuel and many other factors, but the most important thing is that the mechanism for transferring the cost to the consumer be done in a very equitable way, so that you remove any competitive advantages or disadvantages resulting from airlines and other players in the industry potentially gaming the system. I would say that that is a more critical element to consider.

Amanda Hack - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Obviously, when you are looking at green investment, there is a huge element of risk in new technologies. Are there other levers of Government that would de-risk them from an infrastructure point of view, or are there other things that we could do on top of the Bill to de-risk it?

Josh Garton: Yes, I think there are. As I said, the revenue certainty mechanism seeks to address price risk primarily. The mandate deals with volume, and it provides that volume certainty in the market. When we think of the second and third-generation fuels that we need to develop to meet the aviation decarbonisation targets, these are somewhat novel technologies—in fact, they are novel technologies—and there is no market for the fuel at the moment. That means the technologies themselves are not commercially mature yet, so even with a revenue certainty mechanism in place, there is still a level of technology risk that some investors are not willing to tolerate at this point in time.

We need further support to help the first-of-a-kind projects get through FID, even with the revenue certainty mechanism in place. That can include deploying things like first-loss guarantees, or other forms of Government involvement, such as being the first lender through something like the NWF taking a slightly more risk-on approach to the financing of these first-of-a-kind projects. That way we can prove that the technologies are commercially viable, and then help scale the sector.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I want to be very careful with this question. We have had questions about investors and appetites to put money into these technologies—into refineries, production and particular projects. There was previously a fairly strong consensus on the need to address climate change, and this is one of the projects that we are doing to mitigate those impacts. There is a fair amount of rhetoric at the moment about stopping investment in net zero projects in particular regions, some of which have a heavy dependency on or a high frequency of these sorts of projects—north Lincolnshire, Humberside and such areas. Is there a risk that that sort of rhetoric damages investor confidence and that, with that sort of language and those sorts of pronouncements being made, we see challenges in delivering the jobs and the plants and seeing the capacity that we need come online?

Josh Garton: Yes, absolutely there is. It feeds into the overall narrative in the UK on the direction of SAF. It is more than just at the regional level; there are murmurings around the strength of the mandate itself and its being upheld. All those murmurings impact the narrative and the appetite for investors. The more we can do to support those first-generation plants to get through to a final investment decision and through to production, the better we prove out the sector as a viable one in the second and third-generation fuels. That narrative then falls away, because we have proof that it is a commercially viable product.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Good afternoon, Mr New. Fast-forwarding from your review to where we are today, is there anything that you wanted to see, that you recommended or that you found in that review, that is lacking in the Bill that this Committee is considering? If that is the case, how would you improve it—or is this the mechanism that you think will pump-prime the UK SAF industry?

Philip New: The main conclusions from the report that I did were, first, that the SAF mandate as laid out—it was at a slightly more formative stage then than it is now—was a really smart way of trying to define the market mechanisms, the targets and the obligations framing a new market. The question then was what other mechanisms would need to be in place, having got the demand side largely mapped by the mandate, to enable supply to occur.

My first thought when I saw the RCM was that there was very little that was needed: if you believe that the market will be short of SAF, as many people do, with a buy-out price and a target, you would expect the product to price close to the buy-out price—that which is available. That sends a very strong price signal to investors. I was unfortunately thinking of that from my historical perspective as a strategic investor and had underestimated the conservatism of the banking community. It was clear to me that they were pushing very hard—perhaps because they had grown very comfortable with the idea of a CFD in other parts of the green transition—and they were really enthused and insistent on the idea of a revenue certainty mechanism. The way that the RCM has emerged so far is very highly aligned with the proposals that emerged in that original report. From that point of view I would say, “So far, so good.” The mandate is evolving well and the RCM feels pretty much where it needs to be.

The questions that are still out there, as I think Josh Garton was referring to, are specific to very first-of-a-kind technologies. Part of the issue with the second-generation products is that, while the feedstocks are already wastes, they are often already being used in other sectors. There needs to be, I think, some greater degree of comfort to enable some of those wastes to be bid away without wrecking the project economics of the SAF developer. A good example is black bin waste. The prospect is that by having more competition for black bin waste, we reduce costs for local authorities. It is really nice if we can get there, but for now, while these technologies are so uncertain and regarded as such a risk, it is difficult for local authorities to commit to them with enthusiasm, because they are afraid that they will end up paying landfill fees if they do not manage to do it.

That is one example suggesting that there should be some more comfort around feedstocks. The rest of the answer are the mechanisms that could be put in place to smooth some of the risk around the very first projects. The risks there are around integrating new technologies for the first time and then getting through some of the operating teething problems, because everyone involved will be coming across those issues for the first time. It took me about four years to get a much simpler plant up and running to a point of satisfactory operation. We should not underestimate the challenges of getting those initial assets over that first set of hurdles, but the RCM is an absolutely necessary part of the mix that needs to be put in place.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q That is very helpful. As you raised, for example, the black bin waste stream, it strikes me that looking across the differing technologies to produce SAF, the waste-derived ones could end up being the most costly, not least because the bulk of waste goes through local authorities. Many of those—including my own in Buckinghamshire—are tied up in very long-term finance arrangements on incinerators, so they cannot simply take their waste somewhere else because they are locked in a contract. Buckinghamshire is by no means unique in that. Do you see waste-derived SAF hitting an even bigger buffer when the practicalities come, and it either requiring some significant state subsidy to buy out those incinerator contracts or simply not having the waste in the first place?

Philip New: When I first engaged with this, I had exactly the same thought. However, a few things are starting to emerge that sit on the more optimistic side of the balance of risk here.

First of all, over time there will be more and more pressure for the energy from waste manufacturers to access carbon capture and storage. It is not at all the cleanest way of generating an electron in this day and age. It would be reasonable to expect that over the next 15 years, we will see a number of those assets get to a point where the contracts are expiring. They will then need to contemplate refinancing, and if they do, whether or not they have access to carbon capture and storage will become important. Not all of them will be able to either afford or justify it, because they are too distant from where the carbon sinks are. There is a probability that enough capacity will start to come off stream for it to be picked up.

On top of that, the imposition of the emissions trading tax will start to free up some of the very difficult to recycle plastics, which could be used to make SAF. There is also an interesting stream of waste wood that will become available, particularly as some of the rocks start to fall away, which will start to happen in a couple of years’ time—and assets that at the moment are making renewable electricity out of waste wood will lose their rocks. We also need to remember that it is the local authority that is paying the energy from waste company to move it away.

I have recently been involved with some economic analysis. We assumed that for the first wave of sites there would be a 100% discount. In other words, rather than the local authority paying, it would get rid of the waste for free. The developer would not pay for it themselves, but the local authority would still save the money. We thought that would be necessary to give local authorities the comfort to take on the exposure. Later on, there might be scope for it to become a little more competitive, because people will get more comfortable and there will be more confidence in the technology.

I do not think that we simply have to bail them out. I think there might be something around a guarantee of some description that simply says to a local authority, “Look, if you give a contract to one of these companies and it fails—if it can’t live up to that contract—and you have to put it into landfill and pay the landfill tax, there could be some kind of keep-whole mechanism,” just to encourage them over the line.

The other thing that you could consider is looking at the waste hierarchy. Simply moving this from being recovery to recovery-plus would send a very strong signal to local authorities that putting it into SAF is a better use of their waste than simply incinerating it and turning it into electrons.

Ms Minns - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Building on that, we heard from a couple of witnesses earlier today about the waste hierarchy, but in your view, is there a point at which local authorities should be looking at their local plans for waste and minerals? My local authority is already receiving applications for gasification plants, and it is not alone in this. If they come on stream, they could deprive the SAF producers of the materials that they would want to acquire. At what point do local authorities need to be thinking ahead when looking at their waste and mineral plans?

Philip New: This is quite a challenging conundrum. Right now, the safe place to put your waste is into an incinerator to make electrons. Is that the best place for the journey to net zero or for the local authority’s long-term economics? That is less obvious. It is difficult to put all the obligation on the local authorities to make the right, wise, long-term choice, when they are dealing with some very short-term pressures. This is where I think some extra signals—whether through some kind of mechanism that gives them comfort that they will be kept whole if things do not work out as planned, or some adjustment to the waste hierarchy—could play a helpful role.

David Reed - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q You did your independent report in 2023. Obviously, the world has changed rapidly in the past couple of years. We are seeing global economic change, with tariffs, international supply chains becoming more contested, and increased conflicts and volatility. How have the conclusions that you drew in 2023 changed, and where would you say that delta is?

Philip New: I think the key change has been in the United States. When I wrote that report, it was in the context of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. The concern was that we might be out-competed by investment in America, and we would end up being a net importer of stuff from America, not just in first-generation SAFs but in second-generation SAFs. They have lower energy costs, which are very important in these sorts of industries, and their build costs are about 20% less than ours. That was a real worry then.

Especially coming out of the big, beautiful Bill, America is out of the game. That is kind of a good thing at one level, because it means that, particularly with the way the mandate is designed around second-generation SAFs, we now have a globally unique position. We could therefore become an incubator for a series of technologies that will have to play a significant role in aviation decarbonisation over the next couple of decades. The bad news is that if we fail to get this new industry kick-started, I do not think we can hope to rely on imports from somewhere else to get us out of trouble. It will mean that we will not meet our mandate targets.

David Reed - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Just a small follow-up, if I can. You are saying that the biggest change is the US pulling back from innovation and production of SAF. Is that in direct response to what the Chinese are doing?

Philip New: No. For most global markets that have started to look at SAF, the preferred mechanism has been to impose some form of mandate—even China has put in place the beginnings of a mandate mechanism. None of them are as ambitious as those in Europe and the UK, but that is the normal mechanism. The reason for that is simply that SAF costs more than aviation fuel. Left to its own devices, an airline in a very competitive industry is unlikely to voluntarily buy more SAF than it needs to buy. If it has big corporate clients that want to offset some of their scope 3 emissions and are willing to pay a premium to have their flights decarbonised, that is fine, but there is a real limit to how big, dependable and investable that market will be.

That is where America is right now, and it is because of the structure of the other incentives in the American mechanism. A critical part of that was a change in the big, beautiful Bill, in which the premium given to SAF producers was removed completely. They now get no more money than those making diesel for ground transport use, but it costs more money to make SAF. The airlines do not have an incentive to buy SAF because there is no mandate, and the producers do not have an incentive to make SAF because it costs more to make and they get less credit from the American mechanisms in place to support renewable fuels.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q As a good Liberal Democrat, I want to talk about bins again. Incineration and energy recovery facilities are broadly seen as the least worst options. If there is now an alternative, lots of us will be very interested in the opportunities for local authorities and for making conditions better for our residents. If that means cheaper bin collection, we will all be in favour.

I have questions about the big picture. It has the potential to disincentivise recycling. Does the increasing value of SAF feedstock undermine the efforts to recycle? Another, more technical question is: could plastics recycling be better diverted into this process to solve a lot of the problems we have with exporting plastics for recycling and the energy used to do that?

Many of our energy from waste facilities are now linked to heat networks. Is that bigger picture being considered—not just producing electrons, as you say, but using waste heat for district heating networks? There is a bit of additional complexity.

That leads into the bigger question of the holistic view across different Departments and the incentives that the Bill creates, which I am sure are all positive. It promotes better, more sustainable options in different Departments. Is enough work being done elsewhere for this to work within the bigger system? You have 15 minutes.

Philip New: My roots are as a fuels and energy guy, so I will not be able to respond with much expertise to the more specific questions about the waste sector. However, I will do my best by starting with the general statement that I think you are quite right that the second that waste becomes more valuable than an alternative use of that waste, you have to start questioning whether it is really waste. Funnily enough, that is more of an issue in some of the first-generation products that we are using, where the waste is becoming more valuable than virgin vegetable oils. That is a different issue, but it is very important.

In this case, as long as people either do not get anything for waste or have to pay to get rid of it, the risk of it distorting other parts of the hierarchy is manageable, particularly with a sensible degree of oversight and monitoring. I would not lose too much sleep about that. You will have to help me with the other part of the question.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q It is the broader question of how this sits within the system. The implications of this Bill are really broad in the way the incentives will come into a whole different set of markets, including agriculture, waste and local government.

Philip New: First, I challenge the suggestion that this is an incentive. I think of it more as an insurance policy. If you are a recipient of the insurance policy, if it turns out that the market price is higher than you contracted for—your strike price—you will end up paying. The counterparty will be in receipt of money from the participants in the scheme. It is not a one-way incentive.

One of the charms of the RCM is that it is nicely balanced. If you are worried that the market will go long and there will be lots and lots of lower-priced product that undermines your economics, the RCM is a great way of giving you insurance that your investors will stay whole and happy.

On the other hand, by taking it on, you are sacrificing your exposure to the upside. That is the premium you are paying. I think the balance that has been designed into the RCM is a really attractive way of keeping everyone honest while still enabling investment to flow into the sector. I do not think it should distort the underlying drivers or mechanisms.

That having been said, I worry about the range of sectors that a successful SAF industry will touch. It has the potential to touch them in a very positive way, but it is also exposed to some inadvertent—I would not call it negligent—inattention in somewhere that does not feel a very strong ownership of the space, which could really mess things up. A degree of conscious, whole-system understanding of what it takes to enable a brand-new sector to emerge, and providing some co-ordination of that, would be welcome. Whether that looks a little like mission control in the electricity transition or something else, I do not know, but something to provide more comfort would be important. It touches many parts of the economy and many Departments.

Lewis Atkinson (Sunderland Central) (Lab) - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Mr New, in your report you say that one of the key asks for industry is around confidence. We have talked a lot about revenue confidence today, but I want to go over that a little bit. You ask how the UK Government can demonstrate that they will stay the course, and I guess the core of that is political confidence.

Since your report, of course, we have had a change in Government, and who knows if there might be another one over the investment cycles we are talking about here? Could you say a little about your assessment of how a Bill—putting something in primary legislation, as this does—helps to provide the political confidence that you believe investors are looking for, and also, frankly, helps to mitigate the actions of the varying parties in Parliament as we approach this issue?

Philip New: There were two big pushes from the investment community when I was writing the original report connected with the RCM. The first was that it would just be nice to have that revenue certainty in the first place, and that is what we see in other parts of the green transition.

The other speaks directly to this point. They were very nervous that there might be a change to the mandate design, the mandate targets or something at some stage in the future, and that that would so change the market dynamics and the pricing dynamics that all their assumptions would go out of the window. They were not going to be satisfied with any number of assurances from the Government, because Governments change their minds, so they wanted a bilateral contractual arrangement, which is another feature of the RCM. A big driver of its original definition was precisely to respond to that very concern.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q It is always good to get an academic perspective on these matters. We can get locked into all sorts of technical discussions and lose the bigger picture. From your work in the UCL centre, is there an academic view—a big picture view—on which of the technologies that the Bill could support through the price mechanism to scale up production in this country has the best chance of breaking through and being a long-term solution, on a scale that will give us domestic fuel security and at a cost that will not drive commercial passengers and holidaymakers away from the airlines?

Professor Maslin: We take the very large view that the only way to make the international aviation industry net zero is by SAFs. Electric short haul—possible in the next 20 to 30 years. Hydrogen—forget it; it is never going to work and any pilot will tell you, “Not a chance.” That is just so we have that laid out there.

We need SAFs both UK-wide and globally, and we are talking, as an academic institution, with very large airlines that want to produce SAFs in their own country. As academics, my colleagues and I would not pick one technology. What you need to do is what you are doing, which is having a levy that says, “If you produce SAFs, you will then have this benefit.” Then, you will work out which technology comes to the fore, whether that happens to be alcohol production or waste. You should stay agnostic to the successful SAFs output.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q That is very helpful. You may have heard me ask previous witnesses about the cost to the end user. The Government’s analysis is that it would end up being plus or minus £1.50 on the airfare, but a succession of witnesses have not been willing to put their name to that, or even to go as far as saying that they think that that is a conservative estimate. Where does your analysis sit on that?

Professor Maslin: Our analysis is slightly different because it is looking at the industry as a whole. On the airline side, there is a worry that these costs will literally be shoved on to the airlines. Many of us do not realise that the difference between this industry and others is that it is a very narrow margin industry. If there is any change in geopolitics, companies can go bust—for example, Finnair. Airlines are worried about this levy system, not necessarily because of the extra cost, but because they are not reassured that when there is a surplus, which goes back to the actual producers, it will be then be passed back to the airline. Again, they are happy with the up and down mechanism, but there seems to be no way of shunting that back to airlines to say, “Okay, you have done well, so you can get some money back.” That is more the concern.

Adding £1 or £2 to the price of a flight does not concern the airlines from the passenger point of view—it will not put passengers off. What will put them off is when the airlines suddenly realise that if you multiply that by 550, which is the number of people in an A380, you suddenly start to bankroll quite a lot of extra money that has to be found. I am hedging my bets, so I will not tell you that it will be higher or lower than £1.50. That is a very small amount per individual, but for the companies that are trying to make aviation work and are positive about trying to move to net zero, this is the perfect time to push, as they have suddenly woken up to the fact that they are laggards.

Tom Collins - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q As someone who works in research and innovation, you will be familiar with the UK pain point, where we are often excellent at planning the technologies at low technology readiness levels, and then we lose them to that mid-level valley of death. The UK is strong in sustainable fuels at the research level; this mechanism is intended to help us to navigate through the valley of death, and to reach scale and economic viability. Do you think it is a good mechanism for that and that it will help us to break that trend in the UK?

Professor Maslin: Other levy systems that have been used in the energy sector have been very successful, so I am personally very positive about this because it gives a guarantee. We have seen what I call the solar rollercoaster: suddenly everyone has solar panels, and then suddenly all the companies go bust. What you are doing, very sensibly, is trying to level those bumps in the road. That worked for offshore wind and it should work for this, but there also needs to be support through other mechanisms, such as R&D and mechanisms designed to support small and medium-sized enterprises, so they can get the research they need, to go from “Wow! That’s a brilliant idea!” to being world leading. This is a great mechanism, but the Government need to use the other mechanisms to fund those companies to develop as well.

David Reed - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Professor Maslin, thank you for being with us today. You talked powerfully about the international nature of this technology set. If a country or business is not going through a good time, that technology might not come through the supply chain. From a UK perspective, where are the main weaknesses with the international supply chain? As a follow-on, are any hostile states actively trying to weaponise elements of that supply chain?

Professor Maslin: The first thing is that we have to work out a way of being self-sufficient in SAFs. If you want the mandate and the Bill to work, we have to have that self-reliance. The problem that is the quality, quantity and supply of SAFs around the world are highly variable. They are not as good as you think they are. We therefore need to be able to protect our own regulations by having a homegrown community.

On weaponisation, no, I have not seen any evidence that hostile states are going after SAFs at the moment, because they are a very small percentage of the aviation mix. At the international level, it would be helpful if the Chicago accords could be renegotiated so that you could tax aviation fuel internationally, even if the tax was small—$1 per tonne, or something like that—to shift the balance away from aviation fuel and towards SAFs being more accountable. I doubt that will be possible in these interesting political times, but that is the problem we have. We are able to tax aviation fuel internally but not internationally. Therefore, at the moment, there is no aviation fuel tax on international flights, which would be a really nice mechanism. Of course, you can see that as weaponising against the fossil fuel industry.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q May I start by heartily endorsing your encouragement of engineering as a career or an education? As an aeronautical engineer before I came to this place, I am available for motivational speeches whenever necessary.

From my discussions with industry on the Bill up until now, I am not quite sure that I am convinced about being agnostic to SAF production, source and mechanism. My worry is that it does not give enough ability to shape the environmental benefit of that SAF stream and to incentivise the most beneficial SAF production, such as PTL compared with the earlier gen SAFs, even 2g SAFs. Does the Bill as presented give enough of the right mechanisms to incentivise the right sort of SAFs that will be most beneficial and provide us with the greatest environmental benefit?

Professor Maslin: The Bill provides financial security for industries producing SAFs, which I think is essential. I do not think it has real tweaks to favour particular SAFs—whether you want to do that or not is another matter. The problem is that some SAFs have a better environmental signature, and they are better, but we are going to run out of those.

Ultimately, the real SAFs that we are going to be looking at globally are massive algal productions and artificial kerosene, whereby you produce huge amounts of energy, and you use water and CO2 from the atmosphere to actually create kerosene. That is extortionately expensive at this moment in time. However, as I said, if there are 14,000 planes, going up 4% per year, by 2050 you will have a very large number of planes in the air at any one moment in time. There will not be enough waste, cropland or algal stuff to produce the SAFs we need. Generations 4 or 5 will be the ones that ultimately look after the aviation industry. I would still say to be agnostic; I cannot believe I am saying this, but let the economics work its way through at the moment to see who comes out on top in the UK, and then take through the next generation.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Minister, no doubt we will be able to go through much of this on Thursday and next Tuesday, but a central feature of the debate on Second Reading was the ultimate impact on airfare payers of the price mechanism in the Bill, on top of the mandate. You were very clear at the Dispatch Box that it was plus or minus £1.50. I have no reason to doubt that, but some of the witnesses today have. Is there some more work to be done by the Department as the Bill progresses to kick the tyres on those assumptions? How confident are you that it will stand the test of time, given that multiple witnesses today have challenged that number?

Mike Kane: As the Minister, may I start by thanking all Committee members and witnesses for their time today? I think it is a great question. We have a world-class aviation sector and, if we want to stay world class, it is absolutely essential that we pass this Bill. It is part of our manifesto commitment. We introduced the mandate on 1 January for 2% on the demand side, and this now begins to give investment to the supply side.

You are absolutely right; we have to remain competitive in the aviation market if we are going to remain the third largest on the planet, and one of the most advanced. The figure we have from the departmental analysis teams is that it is plus or minus £1.50 of the price of a ticket over a year. That is less than my Bee Network bus fare, where Andy Burnham keeps the cost below £2. That is what we are looking at.

You ask how we are going to look at this. To answer in all seriousness, we are going to continue to monitor and control by managing the scale of the number of contracts we let. This gives the Secretary of State—whoever it is, from whichever party it is in the future—the power to look at what is happening and scale up or down if the market is badly distorted. We feel that there is no big impact on consumers taking their annual holiday to the south of Spain once a year. They will continue to do that unaffected.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Thank you. That is helpful. Can I also ask for your views on a couple of other areas of evidence we heard today? The first is about a point that also came up on Second Reading: the protection of UK intellectual property as contracts are let and participants come forward to take part in the price mechanism. Has the Department done any more thinking on UK IP, so that we are not just producing SAF, of whichever technology, within the United Kingdom for our own fuel security, but doing so with genuinely UK technology driving it?

Mike Kane: As we said, we are agnostic to the technology. As we let the contracts, that is where the innovation will come.

There is a wider question across Government and UK security about intellectual property, and of course we will keep in contact with our colleagues at the Department for Business and Trade who look at that. The world is looking to us at the moment, as Lahiru from EasyJet said this morning, because we are the first doing this. We want to maintain the intellectual property by being first in the world to do this and then, as the companies come forward with the innovative technology, we want to properly IP that and maintain the competitive advantage in the UK.

Greg Smith - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q This is my final question before we get to go through the Bill in detail on Thursday and next Tuesday. Accepting the agnostic position, has anything you have heard today from the various companies who have given evidence, be that global giants such as Shell, UK-based innovators such as Zero Petroleum or the companies developing SAFs from waste, changed your thinking on whether there might be emerging winners and losers, given some of the challenges that we have heard about—not least the municipal waste challenges?

Mike Kane: As the Minister leading on the Bill, I would say, “My kingdom for a chemistry degree.” Actually, Mark said something that I thought was very pertinent towards the end: we just have to allow the technology to emerge. That way, as we get to the power-to-liquids and the harder piece to do, in five, 10 or 15 years, there will be a market for it. The beauty of the Bill is that we can let contracts over five or 10 years.

Personally, even though Exxon has reservations about this measure, the only emotion I would convey to Exxon is thanks for producing this fuel now, in this country. Exxon is happy about the SAF mandate; its issue is with the revenue certainty mechanism. That is an area where, once the market is established, the Government have an exit strategy; once the market begins to work, the then Secretary of State will have ways out of it, because Government will not need to be in it once we have established it.

Tom Collins - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q We heard some of the evidence about how effective the RCM could be in light of the difference that CfDs have made. You have already explained how to manage the levers and the number of contracts allocated to get the economics right, but can you explain how that sits alongside the SAF mandate to help us to steer UK innovation and maximise the opportunities for the UK to lead in this sector?

Mike Kane: When we came into Government in July, we had two key aviation policies. The first was airspace modernisation, and we set up the UK Airspace Design Service and passed it into legislation just the other week. In addition to improving resilience in our skies, we hope that that measure will stop planes circling and allow those that currently do not fly in a straight line to fly in a straight line, which reduces the cost of fuel—to go back to the shadow Minister’s point. Lahiru from easyJet said in his evidence that the best energy is the energy we do not use, and airspace modernisation helps us with that piece.

The second part of our manifesto commitment was SAF. After we were elected, we laid the mandate for 2% of all aviation fuel in the UK to be SAF. That came into force on 1 January. Airlines are sourcing SAF and getting supplies of it, but too much of it comes from abroad. While we have a good industry in the UK, companies need the confidence to scale it up.

I will make no party political points, but four or five years ago we were promised that by 2025 five plants would be up and running. If I were going there, I would not be starting from here, but we are getting on with doing this now. I think everyone on this Committee can be extraordinarily proud that this will be the moment that we stepped up and began to decarbonise the aviation industry.

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I have one straightforward question, and one that is a little more spiky. First, we have heard a lot about the need to work across Government to ensure that we get the most effective outcome from the Bill. From all the evidence we have heard, it seems to be the right thing and structured well, but how do we ensure that municipal waste streams match up with incentives for heat networks, waste hierarchies and that sort of stuff? We hear a lot about mission-based Government—is that what will give the advantage to being able to co-ordinate across Departments? Will you give us an account of what you are doing so far to pull those Departments and different groups together to make sure it works?

Mike Kane: To get any Bill this far, as any Member will know, it has to have consent right around Government. The Government know exactly what we are doing in a joined-up way. To answer your mission question, we have said that we want to be a clean energy superpower, and this Bill helps us to do exactly that. It gives us sovereign capability here on UK shores to do that; not only is that the right thing to do, but, in the increasingly uncertain geopolitical situation we face, it is becoming almost essential.

The other mission that we have is growth. Today, I heard some very big figures on what that could mean. Our Department figures show at least £5 billion GVA added if we do this, and about 15,000 jobs—[Interruption.]

Luke Taylor - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q Thank you, Mr Pritchard. Minister, your first answer was very helpful. My second question is on a theme that I have brought up a couple of times, and which echoes the evidence around ETS funding from a couple of the witnesses. I am going to be a bit pointed, but if you had had the choice and the permission from the Treasury to get the funding from the ETS, rather than passing it on to firms and then passengers, would you have seen that as an optimal solution, in these constrained times?

Mike Kane: As the departmental Minister, I want to avoid the pitfall of commenting on Treasury policy, but I did hear some earlier evidence that £500 million came in from the ETS. What did they get back for it? Well, £2.3 billion of investment in the ATI, which is looking at engine capacity, hydrogen and reduced noise technologies. We are investing more than we ever have in that area. We are also now aligning, or are in negotiations to align, our ETS with the European Union. That would give us a bigger market, and therefore help aviation in this space.

In addition to the £2.3 billion, the Chancellor recently announced £63 million for the advanced fuels fund. The Government are putting their money where their mouth is. As part of the work that I have done this year to restart our confidence in aviation, I set up the jet zero taskforce, which is jointly chaired by me and the Minister for Industry, my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon West (Sarah Jones), at DBT. There is an awful lot of joined-up thinking in this area.

Amanda Hack - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q In terms of SAF’s growth potential, I would be interested to hear more about how smaller organisations can get involved and how we can ensure that lots of businesses benefit from this huge step forward for our economy. A lot of SAF production will be in coastal areas, but my constituency, which has an airport, is inland. How can that growth potential reach all parts of the UK?

Mike Kane: Indeed, and Amanda, you are a great champion of East Midlands airport in your constituency—I have Manchester airport in mine, and I see from day to day the benefits that growth brings in terms of jobs, skills and inward investment. You make exactly the right point. Good strategy is turning what you have into what you need to get what you want.

We have industrial heartlands dotted right across our nation, including in our coastal communities. They are almost oven-ready to host the technology, inward development and jobs. Our analysis, which was a minimum compared with those of everybody else in the room, is that this would create 15,000 jobs in the next few years and £5 billion in GVA. Those jobs are in many of our run-down coastal communities and industrial heartlands, so this is a win-win on many levels—in terms of decarbonisation, carbon capture, production and the regeneration of parts of our nation that have been left behind for far too long.

Mr Kohler - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I do not know whether you have seen it, but Valero makes the point in its written submission that if the way that you calculate the levy is too complex, and if you base it on historical market data rather than current data, then with just a standard levy, that will produce problems, whereby new entrants will not be subject to the levy. We have to be sensible about how we calculate the levy. That is all I am suggesting. Do you recognise that as an issue?

Mike Kane: The first thing I would say in response to your question, Paul, is that this is a very technical, short Bill, but there are huge challenges ahead. I want to compliment my officials, who have worked extraordinarily hard to get to this point, and also industry who have worked with us to get to this point. As we go to the strike price and the levy, we will continue to work with industry to make sure we get that right.

Somebody described it earlier—I think it was Mark again—as being like a seesaw. It will go up, it will go down; but by letting the contracts or drawing them in, we can keep that balance in equilibrium, as far as humanly possible. That is the quality of this. While that is not the answer you might want to hear about the end piece, there will be scrutiny of the Secretary of State and of this, and of the legislation, and that will be covered by the Competition and Markets Authority. There will be many levels of scrutiny of how well Government are delivering this.

Graeme Downie - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q This question has come up in some of the other discussions today, but do you think there is enough in the Bill to properly incentivise the move beyond first and second generation SAFs, into what I think some of the witnesses described as the ultimate place we want to end up in—and where there is probably the most opportunity for UK IP, UK innovation and subsequently UK jobs and growth—such that the UK is where SAF happens and is created, as well as where it is developed in future? Do you think there is enough in the Bill for that? How do you see the Bill, and the next steps after that, as making sure that we can really achieve that and ensure that proper added value for the economy, while meeting climate targets?

Mike Kane: First, you are a great champion for Edinburgh airport in your constituency. You know the value of aviation to local communities in particular and you have championed that since you have been here.

Does the Bill give you innovation? I am not sure it does. I think it gives you a platform for what you want to do, in terms of the contracts that we will let going forward, which are about going from HEFA and first generation, to second and third generation. This gives you the substructure to build that capacity for intellectual property, inviting bids for various ways of doing things, and then protecting and supporting that, and bringing new entrants into the market. I think that is what the Bill does.

Lewis Atkinson - Hansard - - - Excerpts

Q I am neither a chemist nor an aviation policy expert, so I will ask my questions from the perspective of my constituents in Sunderland. Looking at this policy area, they would be interested in the potential impacts on jobs and airfares. On jobs, could you say a little more about what you think the potential upside is in areas like mine? On airfares, can you confirm that clause 10, which deals with the payment of potential surpluses back to levy payers, creates the potential for downward pressure on airfares, depending on where the strike price ends up?

Mike Kane: First, you have been a big supporter of sustainable aviation fuel in your constituency, because you have the Wastefront tyre-to-fuel plant, so your constituency is already benefitting from jobs that have been created by that company. The Bill also allows us to scale up the technologies that we want to use, which could be of particular benefit to the north-east. I am also the maritime Minister, and we have announced £1 billion investment at the Port of Tyne for LS Cables, and Teesport is about to announce big investments in sustainability as part of our clean energy mission. The mayor, Kim McGuinness, is absolutely tied into this agenda, and using the whole north-east coast to support our green energy mission is vital.

You are absolutely right that the pressure on ticket prices could be downward. Very recently, there was an article in The Sunday Times by the International Airlines Group, which hedged its SAF supplies a long time ago in advance of this. It says that it will now, as an airline, have a competitive advantage in the price of ticketing over the next few years, because it got SAF at the right price at the right time.",https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/static/UK_Parliament/img/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-16 05:01:05.200257

While SIA’s decarbonisation ambitions get a formidable lift from the Temasek ecosystem, the airline needs to keep up its ambitions and improve transparency to reduce its exposure to climate risk.
That is also far short of the pace required to hit SIA’s target on sustainable aviation fuel adoption.
A World Economic Forum report on aviation sustainability argued that alignment of sustainable aviation fuel policies across regions and sustained subsidies is “crucial for encouraging investment and ensuring consistent sustainable aviation fuel adoption across regions”.
A long-term investor with deep pockets like Temasek can be extremely helpful for SIA’s decarbonisation ambitions, because of the possibility of an ecosystem approach to decarbonisation.","[SINGAPORE] A small tweak in Temasek’s latest sustainability report reveals just how much a single airline can weigh on a portfolio’s emissions.

The Singapore investment company’s sustainability report for fiscal 2025 showed total portfolio emissions flat at about 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e). But this year, Temasek broke down that total to show how much is attributable to a single company: Singapore Airlines (SIA), in which Temasek holds a 53 per cent stake.

Singapore Airlines makes up only about 2.5 per cent of Temasek’s S$434 billion net portfolio value, yet accounts for about 43 per cent of its total portfolio emissions. The 9 MtCO2e of emissions attributable to the SIA stake in FY2025 is more than the 8 MtCO2e attributed the year before.

Without SIA, Temasek’s portfolio emissions would have been reduced to 12 MtCO2e in FY2025 from 13 MtCO2e previously. Temasek said it is providing the with-and-without-SIA breakdown to recognise that the airline “follows a different decarbonisation trajectory from the rest of the portfolio”.

The aviation sector is especially burdensome on investors’ portfolio emissions, since systemic problems mean that individual airlines have only so much control over their pace of decarbonisation. While SIA’s decarbonisation ambitions get a formidable lift from the Temasek ecosystem, the airline needs to keep up its ambitions and improve transparency to reduce its exposure to climate risk.

Green headwinds

Two targets are key to SIA’s greenhouse gas emissions ambitions. The first is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions from operations by 2050, and the second is to use sustainable aviation fuel for 5 per cent of total fuel requirements by 2030.

A quick glance at SIA’s reporting of those decarbonisation targets might leave an investor with the impression that the airline’s progress is just fine. SIA said it is “on track” for those targets. A company spokesperson explained that the on-track determination is “based on the implementation of key initiatives within our decarbonisation and sustainability road map, as well as regular assessment of our progress”.

But being “on track” on initiatives hasn’t translated to significant progress on actual emissions and sustainable aviation fuel adoption outcomes.

In the six years from FY2019 – SIA’s last full pre-Covid reporting period – to FY2025, SIA’s total Scope 1 and 2 emissions have risen 4 per cent, which is not in the same direction as net zero. SIA did reduce emissions intensity as measured by kilogramme of carbon dioxide equivalent per tonne-kilometre of carried load (kgCO2e/LTK) by just over 1 per cent during that period, but that’s still short of what’s required to get to net zero by 2050.

In terms of sustainable aviation fuel adoption, SIA bought 2,104 tonnes of neat sustainable aviation fuel in FY2025, which represented about 0.04 per cent of total fuel used for flight operations that year. That is also far short of the pace required to hit SIA’s target on sustainable aviation fuel adoption.

If the current pace of decarbonisation is in fact aligned with SIA’s planned emissions reduction strategy, the airline will have to significantly accelerate its pace of decarbonisation in the coming years to meet its targets.

There are a few reasons that decarbonisation is so challenging for SIA.

Hard fuellings

One of the biggest hurdles to decarbonisation for airlines is sustainable aviation fuel, on which the bulk of the industry’s emissions ambitions lie. At the moment, this fuel is significantly undersupplied and expensive.

Ramping up production is complicated by the need for biowaste feedstock – it’s the use of biowaste to produce the fuel that reduces the fuel’s life-cycle carbon footprint. The potentially overwhelming demand for that feedstock raises questions about unintended negative impact on land use, as farmers might clear more land or switch away from certain food crops.

By some estimates, sustainable aviation fuel could remain two to three times more expensive than normal jet fuel all the way to 2030.

Insufficient credit

The slow development of the sustainable aviation fuel market could, in theory, be mitigated by an industry-wide market-based carbon credit framework to help airlines offset new emissions above a 2019 baseline. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) is currently implemented only for flights between voluntarily participating countries – which includes Singapore – but will become mandatory for all International Civil Aviation Organization member states from 2027.

That mandatory phase is expected to drive a surge in demand for Corsia-certified carbon credits. Various estimations suggest that demand could grow from between 100 million and 182 million credits in the voluntary phase to between 502 million and 1.6 billion units in the mandatory phase, said a Norton Rose Fulbright analysis. Supply will have to “significantly increase”, the law firm added.

All systems slow

Another major problem for airlines is that the pace of decarbonisation is not entirely within the control of each individual carrier.

For example, the high cost of sustainable aviation fuel places any early-bird airlines at peril if they can’t keep prices competitive. That makes it difficult for individual airlines to commit to long-term offtake agreements for this fuel, even though achieving economies of scale for it requires critical mass.

Systemic change at the industry and – perhaps more importantly – policy levels is essential to bring about change. A World Economic Forum report on aviation sustainability argued that alignment of sustainable aviation fuel policies across regions and sustained subsidies is “crucial for encouraging investment and ensuring consistent sustainable aviation fuel adoption across regions”.

Bottom line

All of these challenges exist because SIA operates in a hard-to-abate sector.

In the short term, falling short on decarbonisation isn’t going to have a material impact on the airline’s bottom line, especially if the rest of the industry’s in the same boat. The value of SIA’s stock isn’t going to fall because the airline isn’t adopting sustainable aviation fuel as quickly as intended. In fact, it might even increase if slow adoption means that costs and prices remain competitive.

But investors with longer horizons will have concerns about the airline’s exposure to climate risks. Disruptive transition risks could manifest if desperate policymakers raise carbon prices or clamp down on aviation emissions faster than the aviation industry and its customers manage. Climate change could increase the risk of flight disruptions. The negative impact of climate change on economic growth could be a drag on air transport.

But for long-term capital, divesting from airlines such as SIA won’t help an important player in an important sector – air travel creates and enables substantial social and economic benefits – to decarbonise. It is much better to continue engaging and assisting the airlines.

Of course, Temasek’s stake in SIA also represents a strategic national interest in the iconic national airline, which means that Temasek isn’t going to drop SIA just to hit a portfolio emissions target.

A long-term investor with deep pockets like Temasek can be extremely helpful for SIA’s decarbonisation ambitions, because of the possibility of an ecosystem approach to decarbonisation.

For instance, Temasek’s fully owned GenZero, an investment platform dedicated to accelerating decarbonisation, has been working to develop sustainable aviation fuel solutions, with an investment in US sustainable aviation fuel production specialist CleanJoule and with its founding of the Green Fuel Forward initiative with WEF to help scale up production of this fuel. GenZero has also invested in carbon market solutions such as BeZero Carbon, a carbon ratings agency.

SIA is fortunate to enjoy that support from its major shareholder. Of course, long-term shareholders have a role to play in using their votes to ensure that the company remains committed to ambitious decarbonisation goals.

It’s also important for the company to continue improving transparency about its progress. Measuring performance against targets based on the “implementation of key initiatives” without considering actual emissions and sustainable aviation fuel adoption outcomes makes it more difficult for investors to correctly understand the challenges faced by the company.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/c3050f3794c066e97890cdd835f32cdb954c3eee925a81309082eac3142efd0a?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-07-15 23:05:29.794085

Airlines, financial institutions and other associated businesses should stop using the term “sustainable aviation fuel” to describe fuels being touted as greener alternatives to fossil kerosene to power aircraft, argues a report by UK non-profit Opportunity Green.

SAF is used as a catch-all phrase to refer to various fuels with differing climate impacts. These include biofuels derived from waste or virgin feedstocks and synthetic kerosene produced using green hydrogen, which is also called e-SAF.

Instead, companies should label them as “alternative fuels” and include information on their full lifecycle environmental impacts, the report argues.

The use of the collective term SAF implies that all the fuels have a similar environmental impact, which could result in consumers being misled and leave businesses open to legal risks associated with greenwashing, Opportunity Green says.

Despite it looking increasingly unlikely that an EU Green Claims Directive will ever see the light of day, the bloc’s Unfair Commercial Practices Directive already prevents companies from providing false or incomplete information about a product to consumers and includes articles on green claims.

Similarly, the EU directive on “empowering consumers for the green transition” prohibits “sustainable” from being used as a generic claim to demonstrate environmental performance without the inclusion of a product’s social performance.

In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority has the power to fine companies misleading consumers, including through greenwashing, under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, which came into force in April.

Both the UK and the EU have adopted mandates that require airlines to increase the proportion of SAF they use in their fuel mix up to 2040 and 2050 respectively, until it makes up a majority of the fuel used.

These mandates “do not negate the legal obligations under consumer protection law”, the report insists.

Both the UK and the EU mandates exclude biofuels produced using virgin crops. These fuels can cause significant environmental damage as they have a high risk of leading to deforestation or land degradation, and in some cases produce 10 per cent more greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel, Opportunity Green says.

However, many countries such as the US and China continue to include virgin biofuels in their SAF mandates, with Norway being the only other nation to adopt a mandate restricting it, the report finds.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/2b8fd404-488e-4525-b5d2-4f5ec21fc735.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 21:01:14.704981

For this purpose, the ""PtX-Wind"" project was launched under the H2Mare lead project. A corresponding modular plant was installed on a barge and lies operational at anchor in Bremerhaven. Later this year, it will start producing synthetic fuel directly on the sea just off Helgoland Island.

The first floating test platform demonstrating a complete power-to-X process chain for synthetic fuels was opened on July 08, 2025 under the H2Mare hydrogen lead project. ""We wanted to test the entire planning process including approval, construction, and real-world operation of the plant to learn how to draw up concepts for building larger production platforms,"" said Professor Roland Dittmeyer, Head of KIT's Institute for Micro Process Engineering and coordinator of the ""PtX-Wind"" H2Mare project during the opening ceremony in Bremerhaven.

Fuels from wind, water, and air

For the production of synthetic fuels, the novel modular plant will use wind energy, seawater, and ambient air. Accordingly, the H2Mare test platform is equipped with a direct air capture plant (DAC) for recovering CO2 from the ambient air, a facility for the desalination of seawater, and a high-temperature electrolysis unit that generates hydrogenous synthesis gas. The latter will be used as source material for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis that converts green hydrogen and CO2 into fuels.

Thanks to the modular structure of the system, the entire process chain can be operated off-grid in a dynamic way, adapted to the availability of renewable electricity from offshore wind energy.

Offshore operation starting in July 2025

The researchers will start test operations of the platform in July 2025, at first in the port of Bremerhaven and then continuing on the open sea off Helgoland. Besides testing the flexible operation of the entire process chain, they also intend to investigate the maritime impacts and material properties as well as the regulatory conditions in actual operation without connection to the power grid. The insights gained here will be incorporated into the development of larger production platforms that can be coupled with wind turbines.

Apart from the offshore production of e-fuels, the ""PtX-Wind"" researchers in the H2Mare project will also explore alternative Power-to-X synthesis methods. This includes the production of liquid methane, methanol, and ammonia, which is being investigated at KIT.

Addressing the Impact of Contrails

While the reduction of carbon emissions is a significant milestone, the aviation industry also faces challenges related to contrails—those streaks of cloud that aircraft leave in their wake. According to research cited by Virgin Atlantic, contrails contribute to 57% of aviation’s impact on global warming. This far exceeds the 2.4% attributed to CO2 emissions from fuel combustion.

The flight from London to New York also served as a platform for the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Contrail Impact Task Force (CITF) to conduct practical tests aimed at understanding and mitigating the climate impact of contrails. By sharing data from these studies with aviation companies worldwide, the group hopes to develop strategies that will further minimize aviation’s environmental footprint. The potential to address contrails represents a significant opportunity to advance climate goals and enhance the sustainability of long-haul flights.

A critical solution in this ambitious endeavour is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). While Europe and North America have been leading the charge with supportive policy frameworks, the Asia Pacific region is increasingly recognising SAF’s vital role and beginning to implement its own strategies.

Global Momentum and APAC’s Emerging Policy Landscape

Global policy frameworks are now translating this recognition into clear mandates and incentives that drive demand and attract investment.

With nearly 40% global aviation located in APAC, the region is uniquely positioned to benefit from the use of SAF in aviation decarbonisation. More importantly, this region holds the potential to contribute approximately 40% of future global SAF production by 2050, presenting a significant economic opportunity for new producers.

These policy developments are already spurring concrete action. Japan’s 10% SAF target already spurred plans for SAF production facilities by three companies, and Korea’s SAF Expansion Strategy led to four refiners announcing joint plans for SAF plants. Additionally, many APAC countries are now providing funding through production incentives or research grants, such as Japan’s production tax credit of ¥30 per litre of SAF produced and sold, and Australia’s A$250 million under the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.

In addition to the above targets, Japan’s Green Transformation (GX) strategy is targeted to raise significant investment for domestic SAF manufacturing.

While encouraging, more ambitious and clearer future plans are needed if the aviation sector is to meet its net-zero goal by 2050.

“Supporting policies are crucial,” Steven Bartholomeusz, Head of Public and Regulatory Affairs, Asia Pacific, Neste explains, “As they create the demand certainty needed to attract investment in new production, reduce aviation’s climate impact, and ensure a level playing field for airlines in a highly competitive environment.” He stresses that governments must provide clear direction and emphasize the urgency of this transition to further support the private sector.

Navigating Challenges in Unlocking APAC’s Untapped Potential

Despite its immense potential, the region currently lacks widespread mandated demand or incentives for SAF uptake, making any current use purely voluntary. Consequently, SAF availability is limited, and its cost remains high, posing significant hurdles for airlines operating in a highly competitive market with a fragmented regulatory landscape.

Hélène Burger, Head of International Cooperation & Sustainability APAC, Airbus Singapore emphasises the critical need for governments in the region to establish clear policies and ambitions, both on the supply and the demand side. This clarity will provide the necessary visibility for both potential SAF investors and airlines, fostering the development of SAF production and enabling economies of scale. This is particularly crucial given that unlike the more unified regulatory blocs of Europe or the USA, APAC’s fragmented landscape necessitates a progressive harmonisation of regulations to ensure a fair competitive environment for all stakeholders across the SAF supply chain.

Industry Leadership: From Production to Aircraft Compatibility

Driving SAF adoption requires a unified approach across the entire industry.

Neste, driven by its purpose to create a healthier planet, has been a frontrunner in investing in renewable fuels since the 2000s, becoming the world’s leading producer of SAF. Recognising APAC’s strategic importance and growing demand for greener fuels, Neste invested €1.6 billion in expanding its Singapore refinery in 2023, making it the world’s largest renewable diesel and SAF refinery by capacity. Furthermore, it became a shareholder in the Changi Airport Fuel Hydrant Installation company (CAFHI) and established an integrated SAF supply chain into Singapore Changi Airport in May 2023, enabling SAF availability to airlines operating in the region.

For Airbus, SAF is a crucial enabler for achieving the industry’s 2050 net-zero goal. Currently, all Airbus aircraft can operate with up to a 50% SAF blend, and Airbus is working towards 100% SAF capability by 2030. Beyond technical validation, Airbus also has launched several initiatives to support the development of a SAF ecosystem, such as SAFFA (SAF Financing Alliance), Airbus Book & Claim Demonstrator (ABCD), active engagement with industry players on supply chain challenges, and feedstock certification efforts for CORSIA to promote collaborative SAF expansion.

Conclusion: Unlocking APAC’s Full Potential

As the APAC region increasingly embraces SAF as a crucial tool for aviation decarbonisation, the development and implementation of robust and ambitious government policies is paramount in unlocking its full potential. The combined efforts of leading producers, and manufacturers are essential to ensure supply stability and technological compatibility. By attracting the necessary investments and harmonising regulations, APAC stands poised to achieve a sustainable future for air travel, transforming a critical challenge into a significant economic and environmental opportunity.",https://www.asiandownstreamsummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Insights-from-Airbus-and-Neste-1.png,N,,2025-07-15 21:01:25.304563

Founded in 2021, Unblock deploys modular data centers at remote energy sites and captures any gas that would otherwise be flared or curtailed renewable energy. The company has said its operations eliminate 142,000 tons of CO₂ annually while generating economic value for energy producers.

Tomas Ocampo, CEO and Founder of Unblock, said:

“We are building at the crossroads of AI’s explosive energy demand and Latin America’s vast bottlenecked energy resources. Latin America’s infrastructure constraints create the perfect breeding ground for flexible computing. We envision an elastic computing network that flexibilizes midstream infrastructure while also smoothing volatility in the power grid.”

Driven by Argentina’s escalating flaring issues, Unblock has rapidly scaled and now operates the world’s second-largest computing fleet at oil field facilities. Two major upcoming projects are set to double the company’s capacity by September.

The funding will support Unblock’s continued expansion across the region, with aggressive hiring underway and local vertical integration of its data center production. The company is positioned at the intersection of rising compute demand and Latin America’s underutilized energy resources.

The round was led by venture capital fund Goldcrest Capital and Collaborative Fund, and also included participation from Pampa Energia, Grupo Sielecki, FJ Labs, NYDIG, Luxor Technology, Sunna Ventures, and a selection of Latin American entrepreneurs.

Dan Friedland, Managing Partner at Goldcrest Capital, said:

“The combination of already de-risked technology with strong local execution makes [Unblock] uniquely positioned to capture Latin America’s massive stranded energy opportunity. Their growth from 0 to 15MW in just over a year speaks volumes about their ability to execute.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Unblock.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 19:10:25.466938

by Kelly Barraza

The way to a Mainer’s heart is through their stomach — appropriate for this New England state abundant in food and agricultural resources.

Slated to open in spring of 2026, the plant will source locally grown russet potatoes for the production of their chips, which will be well supplied by the $1.3 billion Maine potato industry that in 2022 supported over 6,000 jobs and $237 million in labor income, according to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service.

Plans for the plant were first announced in early 2024 by local businessman Bruce Sargent and Jim Pelkey of Falcon Transportation in Presque Isle, Maine. Sargent spoke to Site Selection about the project and this area of Maine, indicating how bullish the city of Limestone and the Loring Development Authority have been in revitalizing business at the 3,800-acre base. The growing business roster there now includes established and prospective projects such as a sustainable aviation fuel facility from DG Fuels, an AI startup and investment group Green 4 Maine.

Big Plans for Limestone

Sargent’s early exposure to the local Maine potato and agriculture business before his 40-year-long career in refrigerated freight transportation clearly left roots that will help boost the ambitious project through its development phase.

“I’m up for the challenge,” he says. “There’s always room for the little manufacturer. I don’t worry about the competition.”

Initially operating independently, Sargent plans to scale the plant’s production with eyes on a potential partnership with larger food and beverage entities in order to deliver his product across the United States.

“I want to put out a good product, and I want to put it out fast at a high volume,” Sargent says of Taste of Maine Potato Chips’ future distribution plans. “Private label and co-pack is my object — selling to franchises like Publix, Food Lion.”

The Loring Development Authority and City of Limestone were noted for their collaboration with industry to build out Loring Commerce Centre, with Limestone open to offering 20- and 30-year tax increment financing (TIF) and other duty-free options to new businesses looking to grow in the area.

The facility’s location in Maine, where the potato is one of many crops farmed on a large scale, is strategic in avoiding the need to import potato crop from other states like Idaho and Washington. This is vital for reducing freight cost and managing shrinkage rate in the food manufacturing process. It also allows Taste of Maine to work directly with local Maine farmers.

The Taste of Maine factory will fry potato slices in batches with each industrial fryer having a capacity of 500 pounds of finished product per hour. A total of eight fryers are planned at full build-out.

Repurposing an Air Force Base

The potato chip plant is just one of many in-progress and recently completed projects at Loring Commerce Centre.

In November 2024, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) company DG Fuels announced a $4 billion, 1,200-acre SAF facility at Loring Commerce Centre expected to break ground in 2026. This location is planned to have a yearly output of 190 million gallons of jet fuel derived from 1.7 million tons of wood biomass. There is discussion on whether inactive rail in northern Maine will be repurposed for this operation, as DG Fuels has worked with the Maine Department of Transportation to identify existing rail that may be used to transport biomass from Limestone to Loring across Aroostook County. DG Fuels has also indicated interest in using an existing pipeline to carry SAF from Loring to coastal Maine for distribution at airports on the Eastern Seaboard.

“This project, when completed, would represent a big part of the vision that the state has always had for Loring,” stated then-Loring Development Authority of Maine Board Chair Jeremy Fischer in 2022, noting that the potential impact cannot be overstated in terms of jobs and increased economic activity in the area. “Thanks to all who have brought their efforts to bear to make this a reality and thanks in advance to those whose contributions have yet to be made.”

Green 4 Maine, based in Portland, Maine, is also working with DG Fuels to build workforce housing in Loring to support the project construction. DG Fuels is also planning several sustainable fuel facility projects across the U.S., including in Nebraska and Minnesota (see the January 2025 issue of Site Selection).

This collaboration, which covers the provision of 7,400 metric tons (approximately 9.5 million liters) of SAF over the next year, positions DHL towards reducing its carbon footprint in air transportation. Such advancements reflect the growing need for greener aviation solutions amid global sustainability efforts.

Historically, DHL has actively pursued sustainability goals, exemplified by its continuous investment in alternative fuel sources and commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. Proactive steps like this SAF procurement signify progress within the air cargo sector towards cleaner practices. Neste’s ongoing efforts to provide green fuel solutions, demonstrated through its substantial annual SAF production, further underscore DHL’s role as an industry front-runner in adopting sustainable initiatives.

How does the Agreement Impact DHL’s Sustainability Goals?

The new agreement with Neste plays a pivotal role in DHL’s comprehensive Sustainability Roadmap, which involves a ten-year, €7 billion investment in emissions-reducing initiatives. Part of this plan is expanding its zero-emissions fleet and amplifying the use of sustainable fuels across all transportation modes to over 30% by 2030. Christopher Ong, Managing Director for DHL Express Singapore, emphasized their leadership in sustainable logistics, stating,

“We are not just meeting industry standards but setting them.”

What Role Does Singapore Play in Advancing SAF Use?

Singapore’s aviation sector is aligning with global sustainability efforts, aiming to slash carbon emissions. By integrating SAF in logistics, it supports the nation’s agenda to make SAF usage mandatory for departing flights from 2026. DHL’s latest endeavor with Neste represents a significant step towards these national goals, presenting Singapore as a forward-thinking aviation hub.

Neste’s SAF, prepared at their expansive Singapore production facility, is a result of intricate renewable processing, utilizing resources such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. With the capability to slash greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, it showcases the potential for substantial environmental benefits compared to traditional jet fuels.

The Boeing 777 freighters stationed at Singapore Changi Airport will be among the primary beneficiaries, utilizing around 35-40% SAF in their fuel mix under the agreement. Carl Nyberg from Neste highlighted this development as a strategic enhancement of their partnership and a leap toward broader decarbonization goals for DHL.

In a push for climate accountability, Air France-KLM has become the first airline group to adopt the European Union’s new Flight Emissions Label (FEL), developed in partnership with the European Commission and EASA.

The label, aimed at standardising emissions data for passengers, marks a significant step toward transparent, climate-conscious air travel across the EU.

Under a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) signed with EASA, Air France and KLM will now begin testing and implementing the fully digital FEL platform.

The tool aims to offer passengers clear, consistent information on the carbon emissions associated with each flight. This will not only empower consumers to make more sustainable travel choices but also encourage airlines to adopt more environmentally responsible practices.

The partnership is seen as the first concrete manifestation of Regulation (EU) 2024/3170, adopted in December 2024, which formally established the voluntary environmental labelling scheme.

The FEL is part of a broader EU strategy that includes the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, both of which are designed to accelerate decarbonisation within the aviation sector.

New levels of transparency in airline carbon reporting

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, describes the agreement as a critical milestone in the group’s climate strategy.

“Our early and active participation is designed to help shape a fair, transparent, and effective framework for all airlines.” he says. “This initiative is a critical component of our broader strategy to lead the decarbonisation of our industry.”

Air France-KLM will now work closely with EASA’s digital experts to test the FEL platform’s end-to-end workflow-from submitting flight-level data to receiving emissions label outputs.

This includes reporting real-time metrics such as fuel consumption, sustainable fuel (SAF) use, passenger load, cargo carried, and time spent airborne.

In return, the airline group will gain early access to the FEL’s reporting methodology and its underlying calculation framework, giving it a competitive edge and positioning it as a frontrunner in sustainable aviation.

What the Flight Emissions Label hopes to achieve

The introduction of the FEL arrives at a moment of increasing climate pressure.

Aviation accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, and that figure is expected to grow without intervention. For decades, carbon offset schemes and voluntary emissions calculators have existed, but these have often lacked uniformity and credibility.

The new labelling framework will change that. By standardising emissions data and display formats, the FEL gives consumers trustworthy, comparable information. Only airlines enrolled in the scheme will be permitted to publicly display emissions labels to EU passengers.

Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, welcoming the partnership, says: “This decisive step turns Air France and KLM’s commitment to decarbonisation into concrete action.

“It reinforces fair competition, transparency, and trust. I encourage other airlines to join this initiative, driving a more sustainable and transparent future for European aviation.”

What can passengers expect from the Flight Emissions Label?

Once fully operational, the FEL will allow passengers booking with participating airlines to see a breakdown of their flight’s emissions performance.

Likened to food nutrition labels or appliance energy ratings, the scheme will generate a standardised, easily understood visual guide to the climate impact of a flight.

Air France-KLM is expected to begin displaying this data publicly in the coming months, subject to the completion of the trial phase.

The scheme is open to both EU and non-EU carriers operating flights in the region, provided they fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation).

While the programme is voluntary for now, there is a potential that the FEL could become mandatory in future.

With mounting regulatory and consumer demand for greener operations, FEL may emerge as a global benchmark, especially as regions like Asia and North America evaluate similar frameworks to drive aviation decarbonisation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/A-KLM-Airbus-A321neo.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 14:22:49.771734

Improved efficiency at the heart of a clean-sheet design Optimising aerodynamic efficiency is at the core of the A220’s airframe design.
To achieve this, the A220 boasts advanced features, such as the newly designed nose and tailcone, both of which reduce the drag on the aircraft.
The latest improvements for enhanced safety & performance Despite the integration of the latest technologies from the get-go, a clean-sheet design still requires continuous improvement to keep it at the forefront of innovation.
And the long-awaited capability to operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel is expected to be possible for all Airbus aircraft before 2030.","Today, many of the planes flying our skies are test-proven aircraft – built on +40-year-old designs – that have been enhanced with the latest engine and avionics technologies.

However, every few decades, an aircraft comes along that boldly makes a fresh start. Most recently, that aircraft is the A220.

“With the A220, we really started from a blank slate,” explains Jean-François Parent, Airbus A220 Chief Engineer. “Our objective was to build the most efficient small single-aisle aircraft on the market, and we engineered – in a thoughtful way – the features that would deliver on this objective.”

Indeed, the A220 Family – comprising two variants: A220-100 and A220-300 – are “clean-sheet” aircraft built on an entirely new design that rethinks aerodynamic efficiency, allows for the use of the most advanced materials, and integrates the latest systems and avionics.

Because developing new aircraft is significantly more costly than simply improving an existing design, this approach is generally used when there is a need to serve new or different markets that existing designs can’t address. For the A220, that segment is the 100- to 160-seat market.

Improved efficiency at the heart of a clean-sheet design

Optimising aerodynamic efficiency is at the core of the A220’s airframe design. To achieve this, the A220 boasts advanced features, such as the newly designed nose and tailcone, both of which reduce the drag on the aircraft. The fuselage wetted area – which is the entire surface area that is in direct contact with the air – is the smallest for aircraft of its class, keeping drag at a minimum.

Among the A220’s most noteworthy innovations is its 40% use of advanced materials. The majority of aircraft are built from a combination of titanium, steel and aluminium. The A220 is no exception in this respect, but it also incorporates advanced composites – such as polymers and carbon fibre – in the wing, centre wingbox, empennage, rear fuselage and horizontal stabiliser. These composite materials are less prone to corrosion and fatigue compared to metal, and offer an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. Case in point: the A220’s wing is 10% lighter than a conventional all-aluminium wing, which reduces fuel burn and emissions.

Inside the aircraft, the A220’s cockpit – designed by pilots for pilots – is widely appreciated for its modern and state-of-the-art flight deck powered by Airbus’ fly-by-wire technology. The simplified yet robust layout was designed to be as intuitive as possible with large screens, fewer manual controls and user-friendly on-board equipment – such as two-mode fly-by-wire flight controls and sidestick controllers. This cockpit layout enables pilots to fly the A220 Family’s two variants with the same type rating.

The A220’s engine and cabin have also been given the clean-sheet treatment with incredible results – improvements that will be explored more closely in future installments of the A220 web series.

The latest improvements for enhanced safety & performance

Despite the integration of the latest technologies from the get-go, a clean-sheet design still requires continuous improvement to keep it at the forefront of innovation. And the A220 has continued to integrate new features and functionalities since its launch.

For example, the A220-100 and A220-300 have consistently benefited from maximum take-off weight (MTOW) increases – approved by international regulatory authorities – throughout the years with the first increases starting in 2020. Since then, the A220’s MTOW has increased by 3 tonnes, which has expanded the aircraft’s maximum range. The latest payload increase is expected later this year.

Avionics upgrades are also a top priority for the A220. In 2026, the A220 will fully integrate the latest Runway Overrun Awareness and Alerting System (ROAAS), an onboard system that alerts pilots if more deceleration force is needed to avert a runway overrun. Because runway overruns are considered one of the major contributors to aircraft accidents worldwide, this improvement will further optimise safety by providing the flight crew with timely alerts when the aircraft is at risk of not being able to stop before the end of the runway. This upgrade will align with EASA’s mandate to have ROAAS integrated in all new commercial aircraft.

Further ahead, Airbus’ HBCPlus connectivity solution, which will significantly improve onboard broadband access, is expected to arrive after 2028. And the long-awaited capability to operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel is expected to be possible for all Airbus aircraft before 2030.

Thanks to these innovations and Airbus’ continued investment in the programme, the A220 is solidifying its reputation as one of the most innovative aircraft with a clean-sheet design that delivers.

It takes requests from aircraft and those with SAF who can offer a supply.

Once a match has been made, the airline and the supplier can then open discussions to reach specific terms including items such as price terms for payment, according to IATA.

This new platform offers support for items such as spot purchases and offtake agreements – it is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only.

However, the industry trade body has said that other participants, for example, non-aviation corporations, can take part in due course.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's SVP Sustainability and Chief Economist, says: ""To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.""

Addressing critical market challenges

IATA says the SAF Matchmaker platform will address what it describes as three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

This central platform will help to simplify the operation of SAF procurement by making it easier and quicker for parties to open discussions without any additional fees – which will help to further develop the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Helping to carry detailed information regarding available SAF – such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and the technology of production – as well as the emissions reductions plus the compliance with the ICAO CORSIA carbon scheme or the EU's Renewable Energy Directive.

Producers of SAF and suppliers will be given the opportunity to post available and planned SAF volumes, while airlines are able to register their interest in either purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes, with subsequent trades taking place outside the platform.

The platform is hosted on IATA's Aviation Energy Hub, a centralised digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management.

Major partnership demonstrates SAF's growing importance

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is increasingly seen as crucial in reducing emissions within the aviation sector, potentially contributing to 65% of the required reductions to achieve net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association.

As part of this effort, FedEx, the world's largest express cargo airline, and Neste, a global leader in SAF production, have partnered to achieve a major milestone in sustainable transportation.

Each of these new arrivals in the coming nine years will further reduce average fuel consumption.
However, delivery delays, the BDL explains, are preventing German airlines from boosting their fleet renewal and fuel consumption reduction.","In recent years, airlines, airports, and other major aviation stakeholders have all been keeping a close eye on their fuel consumption. With the rollout of sustainable aviation fuel ( SAF) having been relatively slow thus far, and alternative means of propulsion such as hydrogen and electricity still in their embryonic phases, the best that most carriers can do now is look to reduce their use of conventional jet fuel.

This is an initiative that, in Germany, seems to be being carried out with a considerable degree of success, putting the country's airlines and airports in a good position as far as their progress towards meeting the industry's shared goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 is concerned. Indeed, one of the nation's leading interest groups recently revealed that German airlines are using less fuel than ever before.

Jet Fuel Use Is At An All-Time Low In Germany

Last week, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Luftverkehrswirtschaft ('German Aviation Association') proudly announced that jet fuel consumption at German airlines had reached a record low, averaging just 3.38 liters per passenger per 100 km (62 miles) in 2024. According to the BDL, a Berlin-based aviation interest group, this represents a 46% reduction compared to 1990's figure of 6.3 liters.

With carbon emissions per passenger having correspondingly been cut almost in half in the last 34 years, German carriers are certainly doing their bit when it comes to making the commercial aviation sector a more sustainable industry. According to the BDL, only 12% of respondents to a survey correctly guessed that the figure would be this low, with Dr Joachim Lang, its Managing Director, explaining that:

""Many people are surprised by how low the actual kerosene consumption of a flight actually is, and German airlines are improving their carbon footprint year after year. (...) Thanks to quieter engines, noise pollution is also significantly reduced, especially during takeoff and landing. This also benefits residents living near airports.""

Over 30% Of Germans Expected Consumption Levels To Be Nine Times As High

Diving into further detail regarding its survey concerning the average jet fuel consumption per passenger per 100 km in Germany, the BDL explains that ""31% estimated the average consumption at 30 liters,"" almost nine times as high as the actual figure of 3.38 liters. A similar proportion (around a third) were unable to provide an answer, with a further 23% putting 15 liters as their educated guess.

The BDL cites fleet renewal programs at German airlines as being a driving force behind the nation's impressive overall reduction in average fuel consumption. Indeed, Lang goes on to explains that ""replacing an older aircraft with a new model immediately reduces kerosene consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 30%.""

According to the BDL, Germany's airlines currently have a collective fleet of 830 aircraft. However, they are also investing in their future on a considerable scale, with the group explaining that they have also ""placed or reserved orders for 482 new aircraft with a list price of €82 billion ($96 billion) through 2034."" Each of these new arrivals in the coming nine years will further reduce average fuel consumption.

Long-Haul Aircraft Are Particularly Fuel-Efficient

While Germany's airlines averaged 3.38 liters of jet fuel consumption per passenger per 100 km in 2024, there are certain aircraft where this figure drops even lower. Most notably, widebody long-haul aircraft, where there are more passengers between whom to divide the fuel consumption, are the shining stars on this front.

According to the BDL, widebodies can sometimes be more than a liter better than the overall national average when it comes to jet fuel consumption per passenger per 100 km, with the group explaining that the most modern examples average between 2.1 and 2.5 liters. However, delivery delays, the BDL explains, are preventing German airlines from boosting their fleet renewal and fuel consumption reduction.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_1118464442-copy.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:00.192977

Yet across the country on the East Coast, Georgia has quietly emerged as a formidable competitor, rapidly consolidating its position as one of the premier aerospace hubs in the United States.

It’s hard to understate the importance of the aerospace industry, which contributes $57 billion and more than 200,000 jobs, to Georgia’s economy.

When thinking about aviation in Georgia, a couple of well-known names inevitably come to mind, such as Delta Air Lines, by some measures one of the world’s three largest airlines, and Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport (ATL), the world’s busiest airport.

But, when it comes to aerospace, Georgia is also home to a strong industrial base, including household names such as executive jet manufacturer Gulfstream Aerospace and defense conglomerate Lockheed Martin, as well as another 800 companies.

Perhaps even more interesting is that as well as these well-established giants, a number of young companies active in the new emerging segments of aerospace have also set up shop in the state. We are talking about companies like Archer, which has built its first mass industrial plant in Convington, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) producer LanzaJet, which has set up a 10-million-gallon-a-year plant in Soperton, and hypersonic aircraft developer Hermeus, which is based in Atlanta.

How Georgia is trying to attract more investment in aerospace

In the lead up to the Paris Air Show, which took place in June 2025, AeroTime spoke to Elizabeth Mclean, Assistant Director at Georgia’s Department of Economic Development, to learn more about the state’s strategy to continue growing its aerospace sector.

The nascent advanced air mobility industry is one of the segments targeted by this organization, which is tasked with attracting fresh investment to Georgia’s aerospace ecosystem.

Mclean explained how, on the back of Archer’s investment, Georgia’s Department of Economic Development recently published an advanced air mobility blueprint, a 20-page document that outlines concrete steps to help establish the state as a leader in the sector.

However, Mclean also highlighted that this interest in emerging segments of the industry does not mean neglecting investments in more traditional fields such as maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO). In fact, Georgia hosts the largest MRO operation in the US, run by Delta Tech Ops, and has also seen recent investments from the likes of Pratt & Whitney, which invested over $200 million at its Columbus facility in 2023, and Embraer Aircraft Maintenance Services (EAMS), which is building up its activities in Macon, Georgia.

The state relies on its educational ecosystem to keep all these ventures supplied with a pipeline of fresh talent. Mclean underlined the role that engineering powerhouses like Georgia Tech play in all this. For example, in May 2025, Georgia Tech signed a partnership with Altair, a Michigan-based technology firm which develops AI-driven simulation software for cutting edge aerospace design applications. This technology is being used, for example, to design JetZero’s revolutionary blended wing body airliner.

“It is a very diverse ecosystem,” Mclean said. “What actually sets us apart from other states with strong aerospace industries is that we have the whole spectrum of activities, from the HQs to manufacturing, MRO, you name it.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/shutterstock_2418961933-1-e1752578448911.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:11.627074

With a capacity to produce 1 million tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) annually—the largest such facility globally—Neste is uniquely positioned to capitalize on Asia-Pacific's regulatory mandates and airline commitments to slash emissions. This strategic asset, paired with partnerships like its landmark deal with DHL Express, underscores why investors should view Neste as a critical beneficiary of the SAF boom.

The Singapore Refinery: A Moat in Motion

Neste's Singapore refinery, completed in 2023 after a $1.5 billion expansion, is not just a production hub but a showcase of industrial-scale sustainability. Its 1 million tons/year SAF capacity (part of a total renewable fuels output of 2.6 million tons) relies on advanced feedstock processing, including waste cooking oil and residues. Over 90% of its raw materials are sustainably sourced, a compliance advantage as regulators tighten standards.

The refinery's role is further cemented by its proximity to key Asian aviation markets. A striking example is its $60 million SAF supply deal with DHL Express, delivering 9.5 million liters of neat SAF to power international cargo flights from Singapore Changi Airport through 2026. This partnership, one of Asia's largest SAF agreements to date, highlights Neste's ability to secure long-term contracts with major carriers.

Policy Tailwinds: Asia-Pacific's Regulatory Push

Regulatory momentum is the engine behind SAF demand. Singapore's mandate to blend 1% SAF into aviation fuel by 2026, with a target of 5% by 2030, directly aligns with Neste's Singapore operations. Regionally, the EU's ReFuelEU regulation—requiring a 2% SAF blend by 2025—is a catalyst for cross-border collaboration. Airlines like Singapore Airlines and Scoot are already using locally produced Neste SAF at Changi Airport, reducing reliance on imported fuel and meeting compliance targets.

Japan, Hong Kong, and India are also advancing SAF policies. By 2030, Asia-Pacific airlines aim to achieve 5% SAF adoption as part of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines' climate goals. Neste's early partnerships—such as with Japan's ITOCHU Corporation—position it to dominate these emerging markets.

The Investment Case: Scale, Partnerships, and ESG Appeal

Neste's moat lies in its first-mover advantage and operational scale. By 2027, its global SAF capacity will reach 2.2 million tons annually, with the Singapore refinery accounting for nearly half of this growth. This expansion is underpinned by $2.2 billion allocated for SAF projects through 2027, including hydrogen production upgrades to boost efficiency.

While Neste's EBITDA fell to €1.25 billion in 2024 from €3.46 billion in 2023—due to pricing pressures and competition—the fourth-quarter rebound in SAF sales signals stabilizing demand. Airlines' long-term commitments (e.g., DHL's multiyear deal) and the cost certainty of fixed-price contracts mitigate near-term risks.

Moreover, Neste's ESG profile is a magnet for impact investors. Its goal to reduce 20 million tons of CO₂ annually by 2030 aligns with global net-zero targets, while its carbon-neutral production aim by 2035 adds credibility.

Risks and Considerations

Feedstock supply remains a critical challenge. Current waste/residue feedstocks can meet near-term demand but will require innovation—like algae-based or power-to-liquid fuels—to scale further. Neste's R&D investments (e.g., partnerships with Finland's VTT Technical Research Centre) are addressing this, but execution risks persist.

Competitors like Shell, TotalEnergies, and regional players in China and India could intensify price wars. However, Neste's end-to-end supply chain expertise—from feedstock sourcing to airport distribution—creates a barrier to entry.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Asia's Green Skies

Neste's Singapore refinery is more than a production site; it's a linchpin in the Asia-Pacific's shift to sustainable aviation. With mandates tightening and partnerships solidifying, the company's ability to scale SAF production at a time when demand is surging makes it a compelling investment. While short-term volatility exists, the long-term trajectory—driven by regulation and airline commitments—is unambiguously upward. For investors focused on ESG-aligned growth, Neste's dominance in the region's SAF supply chain offers a rare blend of scalability, profitability, and purpose.

Investors should monitor Neste's feedstock diversification progress and SAF pricing trends, but the strategic foundation is clear: this is a company building castles in the sky—and they're green.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:20.363087

By harnessing seawater, captured CO2, and renewable electricity, they aim to create a sustainable aviation fuel. Their innovative approach eschews traditional biomass and fossil resources, providing a promising alternative for reducing carbon emissions associated with air travel. This initiative is poised to challenge conventional aviation fuel production methods, reflecting a growing interest in sustainable energy solutions.

SeaO2’s current work follows previous announcements regarding similar initiatives in sustainable technology. Past discussions in related sectors have focused on the potential of alternative energy projects, though not always with a specific focus on aviation. Historically, fuel industry leaders have explored varying methods of CO2 capture and conversion, seeking scalable solutions. However, SeaO2’s integration of seawater as a primary resource is a distinct departure from past proposals, offering a unique angle on CO2 utilization and renewable energy. This strategic orientation could reshape conversations around future energy models.

How will this project produce aviation fuel?

The collaboration aims to capture CO2 from seawater and convert it into essential building blocks for aviation fuel. This initiative encompasses four focal areas, starting with establishing system requirements and exploring potential use cases. Subsequent steps involve refining SeaO2’s electrochemical technology to convert seawater into hydrogen and CO2 using advanced reactor designs. A final techno-economic analysis will gauge the project’s cost-effectiveness against traditional kerosene production methods, marking a significant step in transitioning toward a more sustainable aviation sector.

What is SeaO2’s approach to ocean-based CO2 removal?

SeaO2 has been pioneering an electrochemical process known as Direct Ocean Capture (DOC), intended to lower atmospheric CO2 levels by removing carbon dioxide from the ocean. Established in 2021, the company envisions removing 1 gigaton of CO2 by the year 2045. Unlike other methods, this process doesn’t rely on chemicals or external inputs, instead using electricity to facilitate CO2 extraction. The technology derives from Delft University of Technology research and aligns with emerging sustainable industrial practices.

“We envision a compact, modular approach to large-scale carbon removal,” SeaO2’s co-founder Ruben Brands stated.

This system’s adaptability allows integration with existing infrastructure, which may reduce costs and enhance scalability. Looking towards 2030 and beyond, SeaO2 plans to transform outdated oil and gas platforms into offshore carbon capture hubs, utilizing renewable energy sources such as wind power for their operations.

Moreover, SeaO2 frames captured CO2 not as waste but as a viable resource. It foresees applications across multiple sectors, converting carbon into various chemicals and fuels. These applications not only provide potential new revenue streams but also facilitate emissions reductions where limited alternatives exist. The utilitarian view of CO2 sets a transformative precedent for other industries looking to achieve emission reduction targets.

The trajectory for SeaO2 showcases a merging of technological innovation with practical resource management, holding the potential to shape the future environmental footprint of aviation and other sectors. Projects of this nature illustrate the viable intersection of economic pragmatism with ecological responsibility, reflecting a nuanced understanding of contemporary energy challenges.",https://finance.coin-turk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/business-017-4.png,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:53.479907

The funding will support the development of a decentralised process to produce aviation fuel using seawater, renewable electricity, and captured CO2.

The project combines work in CO2 capture, electrochemical conversion, and catalysis to establish a method of fuel production that operates without biomass or fossil sources.

Producing aviation fuel from seawater and captured CO2

The project focuses on developing a process to produce aviation fuel from seawater and captured CO2, structured around four main areas. It begins with defining system requirements, use cases, and technical criteria for a viable water-to-e-SAF pathway.

The next phase advances SeaO2’s electrochemical technology to extract CO2 from seawater and generate hydrogen from ultrapure water. Captured CO2 is then converted into alcohols and olefins, core components of aviation fuel, using specialised reactor designs and catalysts.

Finally, a techno-economic analysis will assess the cost and scalability of the integrated process and benchmark it against conventional kerosene.

Ocean-based CO2 removal technology

Founded in 2021 by Ruben Brands and David Vermaas, SeaO2 is working to reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in the ocean, which in turn helps lower levels in the atmosphere.

Its goal is to remove 1 gigaton of CO2 by 2045 through a process called Direct Ocean Capture. This method passes seawater through an electrochemical system that removes CO2 before returning the treated water to the ocean, where it can absorb more CO2 from the air.

SeaO2 builds on technology developed at Delft University of Technology and Wetsus. The system operates without chemicals or external feedstock and relies fully on electricity, aligning with net-zero targets and electrified industry needs. It aims to offer a compact, modular approach to large-scale carbon removal using ocean-based systems.

Scaling vision

SeaO2 is expanding its Direct Ocean Capture (DOC) technology through a modular system designed for scale and integration. The units can be deployed across a range of water-pumping industries, including thermal power, desalination, and aquaculture, allowing for shared infrastructure and lower operational costs.

Looking ahead to the 2030s, SeaO2 plans to repurpose oil and gas platforms as offshore DOC hubs, combining them with offshore wind and geological storage. The captured CO2 can either be stored permanently as part of carbon removal strategies or used as feedstock for producing chemicals and fuels.

A valuable resource

SeaO2 also promotes the use of captured CO2 as a resource rather than a waste product. The carbon can be applied directly in sectors such as food, beverages, packaging, and agriculture, or converted into fuels and chemicals, including methanol, ethylene, alcohols, formic acid, formate, syngas, and urea. These uses support emission reduction in sectors with limited alternatives.",https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ruben-Brands-founder-of-SeaO2-Image-credit-SeaO2.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:11:04.029951

Cautions against overly burdensome controls that could disrupt supply, especially for limited supply products like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

Advocating for practical, transparent and recognised verification processes with stakeholder input and balanced roles for certification bodies and member states

Reforms to improve the EU Biofuels Database (UDB) for better traceability

Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres – which recently signed a multi-year SAF agreement with British Airways – argued that a credible verification system was fundamental to realising the EU’s ambitious climate and sustainability goals.

“As a producer committed to authentic waste-to-fuel pathways, we view rigorous certification not as a hurdle but as essential infrastructure for the renewable fuels market,” he said.

“Our position paper reflects our dedication to fostering a transparent, equitable, and fraud-resistant ecosystem for biofuels that benefits all stakeholders – from producers and policy makers to consumers and the environment.”

The main challenges to SAF certification and widespread adoption include high production costs, limited feedstock availability and sustainability concerns, complex and evolving regulatory frameworks and certification processes, and the need for significant infrastructure development and investment.

The UK Department of Transport issued SAF Mandate: Compliance Guidance in January.

Data on the sustainability of fuel supplied must be verified by an approved third-party verifier before certificates will be issued.

Raman Ojha, president, Shell Aviation said, “This moment marks a significant milestone not only for Avelia but for the aviation sector.
Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF.","Shell Aviation, Accenture and Amex GBT have announced expansion of their sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solution, Avelia.

First unveiled three years ago, Avelia saw Shell Aviation supplying SAF into the aviation fuel network with a novel ‘book-and-claim’ mechanism enabling travellers to buy the SAF and, if it was not available at the departure airport, the SAF would instead be fed into another aircraft in an airport where it was available.

The new expansion sees Avelia “evolving to an industry solution with independent data hosting and a multi-supplier model”. In practice, this will mean that multiple suppliers will be accepted.

The partners are also investigating a BYOS (Bring Your Own SAF) model, enabling airlines to manage more of their SAF portfolio in Avelia, including SAF originally purchased outside of the Shell supply network as well as SAF that otherwise would have been tracked offline and not on a digital registry.

The intention is to increase the volume of SAF bought through the Avelia platform, “helping build credibility for book and claim at an industry level and accelerating SAF adoption”.

It will also provide companies with a clear, scalable pathway to credible business travel life cycle GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reductions from aviation.

Although SAF is seen as essential for aviation to meet its net zero targets, according to IATA, in 2025, production is expected to reach only 2.1 million tonnes or 0.7% of total jet fuel production.

Avelia has established itself as the leading blockchain-powered ‘book and claim’ solution, helping companies to access the GHG benefits of SAF without being constrained by its physical availability at specific locations.

Shell Aviation, Accenture and Amex GBT announced that, as of 31 March 2025, more than 57 corporations and airlines had joined Avelia and over 900 retirements had been executed (use of SAF).

This contributed to the injection of over 33 million gallons of SAF into the existing global fuel network at 17 airports, equivalent to over 300,000 tonnes of CO2e abated, or the equivalent of 530,000 passengers flying from London to New York.

The recycling facility proposed by Klean would extract three products from tyres: recovered carbon black (rCB), steel, and biogenic pyrolysis oil. Under the agreement, Viva Energy would take the biogenic pyrolysis oil for processing at Geelong Refinery, allowing it to create lower-carbon intensity fuels.

Viva Energy’s successful processing of tyre pyrolysis oil not only signals progress for Australia’s own sustainable fuel industry, but also brings the country in line with global efforts to advance circular economies.

Tyre pyrolysis oil is already recognised in the EU as a low-carbon alternative to traditional fuels and feedstocks. Australia currently does not recognise lower-carbon fuels made via co-processing, meaning the associated carbon reduction benefits cannot be claimed by Viva Energy’s customers.

That is something that could change with the right policy settings, according to Viva Energy Chief Strategy Officer Lachlan Pfeiffer.

“The refinery’s ability to process pyrolysis oil from both tyres and waste plastic demonstrates the versatility of our facility and our commitment to supporting a lower-carbon future,” Mr Pfeiffer said. “Viva Energy is proud to play a role in the production of lower-carbon fuels and products and reduce the number of tyres that go into landfill. The project can only proceed if the regulatory landscape encourages businesses to progress these important initiatives.”

It is a sentiment supported by Lina Goodman, CEO of Tyre Stewardship Australia, who said the processing of tyre pyrolysis oil at Geelong Refinery is a significant step forward in demonstrating the potential of end-of-life tyres as a valuable resource.

“Tyre pyrolysis oil is increasingly recognised internationally, particularly in the EU, as a low-carbon alternative,” she said. “We welcome initiatives that showcase the viability of these solutions at scale that extract value from end-of-life tyres and support the transition to a more sustainable, low-emissions future for Australia.”

Viva Energy’s successful refinement of tyre pyrolysis oil, produced using Klean Industries’ advanced thermal conversion technology, marks a significant milestone for the circular economy in Australia, according to Jesse Klinkhamer, Klean Industries Inc.

“This achievement not only confirms the quality and compatibility of our recovered oils with existing refining infrastructure but also demonstrates the commercial viability of converting end-of-life tyres into high-value, low-carbon fuels and chemicals. It's a crucial step forward in fulfilling Klean Industries’ vision of establishing a fully integrated resource recovery and low-carbon fuel production facility in Melbourne, Australia,” he said.

By volume, the contract is one of the largest of its kind for the air cargo sector in Asia, and will last from July 2025 to June 2026.

DHL Express did not comment on the cost of the deal.

Neste will supply the fuel from its refinery in Singapore to five Boeing 777 freighters that operate from DHL Express’ South Asia Hub at Changi Airport. The fuel provided will account for around 35 to 40 per cent of the total used by the fleet.

The use of sustainable aviation fuel is expected to reduce carbon emissions from the fleet by around 24,000 tonnes over the duration of the contract.

Reliance on this type of fuel is expected to increase in the region in the coming years as countries introduce usage targets for sustainable aviation fuel to reduce emissions in their aviation sectors.

For example, Singapore aims for a 1 per cent target beginning in 2026, raising it to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030. Both India and South Korea aim for departing international flights to use 1 per cent of sustainable aviation fuel from 2027.

Additionally, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, which will require airlines to offset their carbon emissions from flights, comes into force in 2027.

In January, DHL Express signed its first sustainable aviation fuel deal in Asia with Cosmo Oil Marketing for the supply of 7.2 million litres of the fuel to its air freighters in Japan, beginning in April.

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA), which makes permanent or modifies key provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) and scales back numerous energy tax incentives enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This alert is a summary of certain general business tax, clean energy tax credit and international tax provisions of the OBBBA. All section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

General Business Tax

Bonus Depreciation (Section 168(k) and (n))

Permanence. The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100 percent bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) for qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025.

Qualified Production Property. New Section 168(n) allows an immediate deduction for 100 percent of the cost of “qualified production property.” Generally, qualified production property is any domestic manufacturing, refining, agricultural production or chemical production facility the construction of which begins after January 19, 2025 and before January 1, 2029 and that is placed in service after July 4, 2025 and before January 1, 2031.

Domestic Research and Experimental (R&E) Expenditures (Section 174A)

Domestic R&E. The OBBBA restores immediate expensing of domestic R&E expenditures under new Section 174A for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. This reverses the five-year amortization requirement that took effect in 2022 under the TCJA. Section 174A does not allow expensing of amounts paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (including oil and gas).

Capitalization. Capitalization and amortization of domestic R&E expenditures remains available upon election.

Business Interest Limitation (Section 163(j))

EBITDA Calculation Reinstated. The OBBBA permanently returns the limitation on business interest deductibility to an EBITDA-based formula, reversing the more restrictive EBIT-based test in effect since 2022. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Ordering. The OBBBA provides that the Section 163(j) limitation is calculated prior to applying any interest capitalization provisions (subject to certain exceptions) and requires taxpayers to first apply their allowed business interest deduction against business interest that would otherwise be capitalized. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Expansion of Qualifying Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Clean Energy Expansion. The OBBBA expands the definition of “qualifying income” under Section 7704 to include income from the transportation or storage of certain clean fuels, production of electricity from certain clean sources and other energy-transition infrastructure.

Partnership Transactions (Section 707(a)(2))

Self-execution. The OBBBA confirms that Section 707(a)(2), which addresses disguised sales between partners and partnerships, is self-executing. This eliminates any ambiguity about the enforceability of the disguised sales rules with respect to disguised sales of partnership interests in the absence of final regulations.

Deduction for Qualified Business Income (Section 199A)

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the 20 percent deduction for qualified business income.

Excess Business Loss Limitation (Section 461(l))

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the limitation on excess business losses for noncorporate taxpayers, which was set to expire after 2028. Excess losses will continue to be converted into net operating losses carried forward to future years.

Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs) and Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs) (Subchapter Z)

QOZ Renewal. The OBBBA renews the QOZ program with new QOZ designations to be made on July 1, 2026 and each July 1st every 10 years thereafter. New QOZ designations will go into effect on January 1st of the year following the designation.

QOF Renewal. Similarly, new QOFs will be established with respect to newly designated QOZs. Investors in QOFs will be able to defer capital gains for up to five years. In addition, taxpayers will receive a partial basis step-up in their investment if their holding period is at least five years and recognize no gain if their holding period is between 10 and 30 years.

Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Gain Exclusion (Section 1202)

Holding Period. Non-corporate taxpayers can exclude from taxable income gain on the disposition of QSBS if such stock was held for five years and certain other requirements are satisfied. The OBBBA changes the holding-period requirement for QSBS issued after July 4, 2025 to allow a 50 percent exclusion for QSBS held for three years, a 75 percent exclusion after four years and full exclusion after five years.

Cap Increases. For QSBS issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the maximum gain that can be excluded from the disposition of QSBS of a single issuer from $10 million to $15 million. In addition, the maximum gross asset threshold for a C corporation to be a qualified small business increased from $50 million to $75 million. The increased amounts are indexed for inflation for subsequent years. These changes apply to QSBS issued after July 4, 2025.

Clean Energy Tax Credits

Clean Electricity Production and Investment Credits (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Wind and Solar. The OBBBA phases out the Section 45Y and 48E credits for wind and solar projects. Wind and solar projects that begin construction on or after July 5, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit. Wind and solar projects that begin construction prior to July 5, 2026 are eligible for the Section 45Y or 48E credit under the rules that existed prior to the passage of the OBBBA.

Fuel Cells. The OBBBA adds qualified fuel cell property to the property eligible for the Section 48E credit at a 30 percent rate. Fuel cell projects are not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or the zero greenhouse gas emissions rate requirement. Fuel cell projects are not eligible for any credit adders.

Other Technologies. The OBBBA modifies the phase-out rules under Sections 45Y and 48E for non-wind and non-solar projects. For any such projects that begin construction in 2034 and 2035, the Section 45Y and 48E credits are subject to a 25 percent and 50 percent reduction, respectively. Any such projects that begin construction in 2036 or later will not qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit.

Domestic Content Adder. The OBBBA makes the domestic content percentage requirements under Section 48E consistent with those under Section 45Y for projects that begin construction on or after June 16, 2025. Prior to the passage of the OBBBA, the domestic content percentage requirement under Section 48E was 40 percent but under Section 45Y ranged from 40 percent to 55 percent depending on when construction began.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

Extension. The Section 45Z credit is extended by two years to include transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2029.

Feedstock. After December 31, 2025, transportation fuel must be exclusively derived from feedstock that is produced or grown in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

Emissions Rate. The emissions rate for a transportation fuel may not be less than zero; however, an exception allows negative emissions rates for fuels derived from animal manure. Further, the emissions rate shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use changes. Such amendments apply to emissions rates published for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The value of the Section 45Z credit for sustainable aviation fuel is reduced from $1.75 to $1.00 for each gallon produced after December 31, 2025.

No Double Counting. To qualify for the credit, the transportation fuel must not be produced from a fuel for which the Section 45Z credit was allowable.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

Rate Parity. The base credit rate for carbon oxides captured from an industrial source and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $12 to $17 per metric ton so that it is equal to the base credit rate for permanent sequestration. Similarly, in the case of direct air capture facilities, the base credit rate for carbon oxides captured and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $26 to $36 per metric ton. Such increases apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Wind Components. The Section 45X credit is terminated for wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Metallurgical Coal. Metallurgical coal that is suitable for the production of steel (regardless of whether production occurs inside or outside of the United States) was added as an applicable critical mineral. This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Phase-out. The phase-out of the Section 45X credit was modified so that the credit (other than with respect to metallurgical coal) is subject to a 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent reduction in 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Section 45X credit terminates for metallurgical coal after 2029 and for other applicable critical minerals after 2033.

Battery Modules. The definition of “battery module” was changed to require each module to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.” This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Integrated Components. The OBBBA allows manufacturers to claim the Section 45X credit on multiple primary components that are integrated, incorporated or assembled into secondary components if (a) the primary components are produced in the same facility as the secondary components, (b) the secondary components are sold to unrelated persons and (c) at least 65 percent of the direct material costs to produce the secondary components are attributable to primary components that are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

Termination. The Section 45V credit is terminated for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2027.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules

The OBBBA restricts taxpayers with connections to certain countries or foreign entities from claiming credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E. The FEOC rules largely relate to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea (as well as certain listed foreign persons and entities, which are not discussed below). In general, a taxpayer is prohibited from claiming credits under any one of the following circumstances:

The taxpayer is a “specified foreign entity.”

A specified foreign entity includes, among others, (a) the government of China, Russia, Iran or North Korea; (b) a citizen or national of one of those countries (provided that such person is not a U.S. citizen, national or resident); (c) an entity organized in, or having its principal place of business in, one of those countries; and (d) an entity owned more than 50 percent by persons described in clauses (a) through (c).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the Section 45Z credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer is a “foreign-influenced entity.”

A foreign-influenced entity includes an entity with respect to which (a) a specified foreign entity has authority to appoint board members or officers, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent of such entity, (c) multiple specified foreign entities own at least 40 percent of such entity or (d) at least 15 percent of the debt of such entity is held by specified foreign entities.

Except in the case of Sections 45Q and 45Z, a foreign-influenced entity also includes an entity that made payments to a specified foreign entity in the prior taxable year pursuant to a contract, agreement or arrangement (e.g., a license) that allows the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise effective control over a project or the production of any components (Specified Foreign Entity Payments).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the Section 45Z credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer receives “material assistance” on a project from specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities.

A project is deemed to receive material assistance if the material assistance cost ratio for the project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The threshold percentages increase over time and range from 40 percent to 90 percent depending on the year, credit and technology. The material assistance cost ratio is computed as a fraction, with the numerator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components not manufactured by specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities, and the denominator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components.

The Secretary of the Treasury is required to issue safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026 identifying total direct cost percentages attributable to manufactured products and components. Until the safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on the percentages in the domestic content safe harbor tables in IRS Notice 2025-08, certifications from suppliers regarding direct costs and certifications from suppliers stating that manufactured products and components were not manufactured or produced by a specified foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

This restriction applies to the credits under Section 45Y and 48E for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 (on a project-by-project basis) and to the Section 45X credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

In addition, if a taxpayer makes Specified Foreign Entity Payments within 10 years after a project claiming the Section 48E credit is placed in service, the full amount of the credit claimed is subject to recapture. This restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

International Tax

Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) (Now “Net CFC Tested Income” (NCTI)) (Section 904)

Rate. The OBBBA modifies the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion rules such that a corporation’s effective GILTI rate will increase from 10.5 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the GILTI rate to 13.125 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Currently, a taxpayer can effectively exclude 10 percent of a controlled foreign corporation’s qualified business asset investment (QBAI) from the taxpayer’s GILTI inclusion calculation. The OBBBA eliminates this QBAI exclusion for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) (Now “Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income” (FDDEI)) (Section 250)

Rate. Similar to those modifications made to the GILTI regime, the OBBBA modifies the FDII rules such that a corporation’s effective FDII rate will increase from 13.125 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the FDII rate to 16.4 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Similar to QBAI with respect to GILTI, the OBBBA eliminates the QBAI exclusion for FDII for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) (Section 59A)

Rate. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the BEAT rate will increase from 10 percent to 10.5 percent. This change preempts the increase in the BEAT rate to 12.5 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

Tax Credit Transfers (Section 6418) Background The IRA made certain tax credits (including the section 45Y PTC and 48E ITC) transferable for cash on a one-time basis, subject to certain limitations.
Please see our prior client alert on the IRA tax credit transfer regime here.
[19] The bonus is not available for the section 48E ITC.","Client Alert | July 14, 2025

This update details changes made by the Act to the tax benefits for clean energy projects, including the new limitations on certain energy-related tax credits enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA).

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA or the Act),[1] which enacts significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax benefits available to clean energy projects. The text of the Act can be found here. Our prior alert on the tax highlights of the Act can be found here.

This alert provides further details regarding the changes made by the OBBBA to the tax benefits for clean energy projects, including the new limitations on certain energy-related tax credits enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA).[2]

Wind and Solar Energy (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Background

Before the OBBBA, qualifying wind and solar projects were eligible for a production tax credit (PTC) under section 45Y or an investment tax credit (ITC) under section 48E. Under the IRA, the section 45Y PTC and section 48E ITC were subject to phase-out following the later of 2032 or the year the Treasury Secretary determined that the annual greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) from the production of electricity in the United States was equal to or less than 25 percent of a 2022 baseline. Our prior alert on the section 45Y and 48E credits can be found here.

Under pre-OBBBA IRS guidance (first issued in 2014), a wind or solar project that began construction would qualify for ITCs or PTCs if it was placed in service by the end of the fourth calendar year after the year in which construction began (assuming other applicable requirements are met).[3] Construction of a project was deemed to “begin” by the performance of physical work of a significant nature or by satisfying a safe harbor through payment or incurrence of at least five percent of certain project costs.[4] That pre-OBBBA IRS guidance contains rules governing the type of “physical work” that qualifies but specifically provides that “there is no fixed minimum amount of work or monetary or percentage threshold required to satisfy” the physical work standard.[5]

Projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026

Under the Act, qualifying wind and solar projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to be eligible for ITCs and PTCs.

Projects that begin construction on or before July 4, 2026[6]

As of the date of this alert (July 14, 2025), the section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC placement-in-service deadline is uncertain for qualifying wind and solar projects that began construction before July 4, 2026 and thus are exempt from the December 31, 2027 placement-in-service deadline.

This uncertainty stems from President Trump’s July 7, 2025 Executive Order that directed the Treasury Secretary, by August 18, 2025, to “strictly enforce the termination of the [section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC] for wind and solar facilities,” which includes

issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

Both the scope of the Executive Order and the manner in which it will be interpreted are unclear, and we will publish another alert once this guidance is issued.

Certain Leasing Arrangements

For taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA prohibits the section 48E ITC for qualified investments in certain small wind facilities (used in connection with a residential dwelling unit by the lessee) if the taxpayer rents or leases the facilities to a third party, and disallows the section 45Y PTC with respect to electricity produced by such facilities during those taxable years.

Application of the prohibition is uncertain with respect to facilities generating electricity from solar energy. The heading of the provision states that it applies to “solar leasing arrangements,” but the prohibition by its terms (and a potentially errant cross-reference) applies to solar water heating property, which is not eligible for either the section 48E ITC or section 45Y PTC in the first instance.

Foreign Entity of Concern Rules (FEOC)

The OBBBA also introduces new section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC eligibility requirements that target certain foreign (e.g., China) ownership or influence with respect to benefited projects and participation in supply chains (collectively, “Foreign Restrictions”).[7] As discussed below, some or all of the restrictions also apply to various other credits.

More specifically, the section 45Y PTC and section 48E ITC are not allowed to a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (FIE), nor are they allowed with respect to a facility the construction of which receives “material assistance” from an SFE or an FIE. These three concepts are discussed in more detail below.

SFE: An SFE is defined to include the governments (including agencies and instrumentalities) of China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea; citizens or nationals of any of those countries;[8] entities or branches formed in or having their principal place of business in any of those countries; and controlled entities and subsidiaries of any of the above (determined on a more-than-50 percent equity ownership basis and regardless of jurisdiction of organization).[9] SFE status is generally determined as of the last day of the taxable year.[10]

FIE: An FIE is defined as an entity that meets any of the following tests: (i) an SFE has direct authority to appoint certain officers, (ii) an SFE has at least 25 percent equity ownership or, taken together with other SFEs, at least 40 percent equity ownership, (iii) one or more SFEs has issued at least 15 percent of the entity’s debt, or (iv) the entity made an “effective control” payment to an SFE during the previous year (discussed below). FIE status is determined as of the last day of the taxable year.

Effective Control: An entity makes an “effective control” payment if, during the previous taxable year, the entity made a payment to an SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement that entitles the SFE (or a related party) to exercise “specific authority over key aspects” of the energy generation of the entity’s (or a related person’s) facility that are “not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt” that otherwise would determine FIE status. The OBBBA goes on to provide a broad list of contractual provisions (relating to amount and timing of electricity production, offtake arrangements, access to data, and facility maintenance and repair) that convey impermissible authority to a counterparty. The OBBBA is especially scrutinous of intellectual property licenses (other than qualifying bona fide sales)—for example, any such arrangement (relating to a facility) that is entered into after July 4, 2025 is deemed to convey effective control to the SFE.[11]

Material Assistance: A facility receives “material assistance” from an SFE or FIE if an impermissible amount of the total direct costs of the manufactured products (including components) incorporated into the facility upon completion of construction are mined, produced, or manufactured by an SFE or an FIE. Pending receipt of Treasury guidance contemplated by the Act, taxpayers may rely on certifications from suppliers of manufactured products to determine if those products (or components) were manufactured by an SFE or FIE; new penalties apply to false or inaccurate supplier certifications.[12] Stricter penalties (and an extended statute of limitations) apply to assessments in respect of credits disallowed for “material assistance” violations.

Special rules allow publicly traded entities to rely on publicly reported information to determine their SFE and FIE status.[13]

The SFE ownership, FIE, and “effective control” rules apply to credits claimed for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the “material assistance” rules apply to projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

The “effective control” payment rules are also backed up by a new section 48E ITC recapture rule, effective for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Under this rule, for the 10 years after a qualifying facility is placed in service, a section 48E ITC is subject to 100-percent recapture (i.e., no vesting) if the taxpayer (i) is allowed a section 48E ITC for any taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 and (ii) makes a payment to an SFE (“with respect to a taxable year”) pursuant to a contract that entitles the SFE (or a related person) to “effective control” over any facility of the taxpayer or a related person.[14] The recapture tax is due in the year the “effective control” payment is made.

The OBBBA did not include a controversial proposed excise tax included in prior versions of the legislation that would have applied to wind and solar facilities (regardless of whether ITCs or PTCs were claimed) that incorporated certain components sourced from prohibited foreign sources.

Domestic Content Clarification

The Act aligns the thresholds for the domestic content bonus credit under the section 48E ITC with the domestic content thresholds under the section 45Y PTC by increasing the section 48E thresholds to match the section 45Y requirements. In an apparent drafting glitch made by Congress in the IRA, the domestic content thresholds were lower under section 48E as compared to the domestic content thresholds under section 45Y.[15] This change is effective for facilities the construction of which begins on or after June 16, 2025.

Depreciation

The Act does not affect the eligibility of solar or wind projects to claim preferential five-year accelerated depreciation.

Battery Storage (Section 48E)

Background

Before the OBBBA, qualifying energy storage projects were eligible for the section 48E ITC, subject to phase-out on the same timeline as wind and solar projects (discussed above).

OBBBA Changes

The OBBBA did not change the section 48E ITC eligibility timeline for battery storage projects.

The OBBBA subjects storage projects seeking the section 48E ITC to the Foreign Restrictions applicable to wind and solar projects (discussed above), albeit with stricter “material assistance” provisions.

Fuel Cells (Section 45V and 48E)

Background

Under prior law, fuel cells were eligible for credits under Section 48E only if those cells met the emissions requirements of that section. Because feedstocks for fuel cell projects typically produce GGEs, this often made eligibility for the section 48E ITC challenging.

OBBBA Changes

Qualifying fuel cell projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 are now eligible for a new 30-percent ITC that exempts the projects from the IRA’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements and GGE requirements. The new ITC is not eligible for the domestic content and energy community bonuses made available under the IRA.[16]

The Act also moves up the commencement-of-construction deadline for the IRA’s 10-year credit under section 45V for the production of clean hydrogen (a fuel cell feedstock) from January 1, 2033 to January 1, 2028. The Foreign Restrictions do not apply to the clean hydrogen PTC. Our prior alert on the section 45V credit can be found here.

Clean Fuels (Section 45Z)

Background

Before the OBBBA, section 45Z provided a PTC for clean transportation fuel, including a higher credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel. This credit was not available for fuel sold after December 31, 2027

OBBBA Changes

The Act extends the clean fuel production credit by two years, with the result that eligible fuel sold until December 31, 2029 is eligible for this credit.

The Act also relaxes the lifecycle GGE rules for credit-eligible fuel produced after 2025 by excluding the effects of indirect land use changes from the lifecycle GGE calculation.

In an apparent negative reaction to Treasury and IRS guidance released earlier this year, the OBBBA also authorizes the Treasury Secretary to confirm that sales by a taxpayer to an intermediary are permitted if the taxpayer has reason to believe that the fuel ultimately will be sold to an unrelated person.[17]

The Act effectively introduces a new cap on the credit. As background, the credit’s rate is the product of a formula that reduces the credit by reference to a specific fuel’s GGE rate; before the Act, however, fuels with a negative GGE rate could have seen their credit rate increase over the headline statutory rate under the Code’s formula.[18] The Act prospectively limits the fuels for which negative GGE rates that can be taken into account to fuels from specific animal manure feedstocks (e.g., dairy, swine, poultry).

The Act also provides that, for fuel produced after 2025, the credit is available only for fuel derived exclusively from feedstocks produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. The Act also eliminates the enhanced credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Certain of the Foreign Restrictions also apply to clean fuel PTCs. The SFE ownership prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Nuclear (Section 45Y and 48E)

Background

Under current law, qualifying nuclear projects are eligible for PTCs under section 45Y or ITCs under section 48E.

OBBBA Changes

Under the Act, a bonus amount was added to the section 45Y PTC for certain nuclear facilities placed in service in metropolitan statistical areas that have (or, at any time after December 31, 2009, has had) at least 0.17 percent direct employment in nuclear-related sectors.[19] The bonus amount is available for qualifying projects that begin construction in taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The Foreign Restrictions apply to ITCs or PTCs for new nuclear projects on the same timeline as wind and solar projects. For nuclear facilities placed in service before the IRA and claiming the section 45U PTC, the SFE prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration (CCUS) (Section 45Q)

Background

Prior to the OBBBA, section 45Q provided a tax credit of $60 per metric ton for qualified CCUS facilities that captured qualified carbon oxides (QCOs) and either “utilized” (e.g., used in a commercial process) the QCOs or used the QCOs for enhanced oil and gas recovery. Qualified CCUS facilities that stored QCOs in secure geological formations were eligible for a higher credit of $85 per metric ton.[20]

OBBBA Changes

The OBBBA increases the section 45Q credit for QCOs that are “utilized” or used in enhanced oil or natural gas recovery to equal the credit rate for QCOs that are stored in secure geological formations. The credit rate increase applies to equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025

The SFE ownership prohibition and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) apply to CCUS projects for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Background

The IRA made available a tax credit for the production and sale of certain eligible solar, wind, and energy storage components manufactured in the United States, as well as the production of certain critical minerals. The credits (other than the credits for critical minerals) were subject to a phaseout beginning in 2030.

OBBBA Changes

The Act introduces a new category of credit-eligible critical minerals—metallurgical coal suitable for use in the production of steel, regardless of where produced. The metallurgical coal credit is 2.5 percent of qualifying production costs (as compared to the 10 percent credit for other critical minerals).

The credit for wind components is terminated for components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The Act phases out the credit for critical minerals (other than metallurgical coal) starting in 2031 and terminates the new credit for metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029.

The Act also revises the definition of credit-eligible battery module production to require inclusion of all essential equipment necessary for battery functionality.

The Foreign Restrictions are made applicable to section 45X but are generally applied to the production of components (rather the construction of the facility) and are subject to separate “material assistance” thresholds.

These changes are effective for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The OBBA did not adopt an earlier Senate proposal to prohibit claiming multiple credits (or “stacking”) for the production of components that are integrated into and sold as a single product but did add new requirements to qualify for such stacking. To be eligible for stacking, the components must be produced at the same facility, the end product must be sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65 percent of the direct material costs of the underlying components must be attributable to United States mining, production, or manufacturing. This change is effective for components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Tax Credit Transfers (Section 6418)

Background

The IRA made certain tax credits (including the section 45Y PTC and 48E ITC) transferable for cash on a one-time basis, subject to certain limitations. Please see our prior client alert on the IRA tax credit transfer regime here.

OBBBA Changes

The Act largely leaves intact the tax credit transfer regime introduced by the IRA; for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, however, an SFE cannot buy section 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E credits.[21]

New Classes of Qualified Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Background

Publicly traded partnerships are generally taxed as corporations unless they derive at least 90 percent of their income from certain qualifying sources. Prior to the OBBBA, qualifying sources were limited to passive income and income from certain fossil fuel-related energy or transportation activities.

OBBBA Changes

The Act expands the definition of “qualifying income” to include income derived from qualifying hydrogen storage and transportation; electricity production from qualifying nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal facilities; carbon capture facilities, including electricity production from qualifying facilities with sufficient carbon capture; and thermal energy from hydropower and geothermal facilities.

The amendment is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Why Does the Navy Need a Heavy Lift UAV?

The Navy is inquiring about an unmanned heavy lift aircraft to sustain combat effectiveness in future wars by ensuring logistics can reach small, dispersed and vulnerable forces in denied or degraded environments without putting humans or high-value assets at risk. Other priorities include better supporting distributed maritime operations, operating in contested environments, reducing the logistics footprint and bridging capability gaps.

The Navy is wasting no time preparing contract awards for this effort. Naval Air Systems Command, or NAVAIR, is considering awarding an other transaction agreement for ULS-A in FY 2026.

Let’s dive into the potential offerors for this highly-anticipated program.

Phenix Solutions Ultra 2XL

Phenix Solutions of Oregon has developed a heavy-lift dual coaxial rotor UAV that is capable of carrying more than 1,300 lbs, a company official told ExecutiveGov. The platform can use an enclosed payload container or a sling to carry its payload beneath the aircraft.

The Ultra 2XL can carry varying payload amounts depending on fuel levels and total payload. The Ultra 2XL can perform ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-shore logistics missions.

The company is promoting the Ultra 2XL as providing an existing and proven Technology Readiness Level-8 vehicle designed for use as a tactical unmanned resupply aircraft. The platform can perform multiple military and civilian missions beyond visual line of sight and its mission modules can be quickly reconfigured in the field if mission requirements change.

Phenix Solutions was awarded the Next Generation Logistics Unmanned Aircraft System Phase I contract specifically focusing on heavy lift aircraft, vertical replenishment logistics and ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore cargo delivery. Phenix was also selected as an original equipment UAS manufacturer for an important U.S. Marine Corps program—Medium Air Resupply Vehicle-Expeditionary Logistics, or MARV-EL, Phase I, which has similar requirements to ULS-A.

The company is in the process of submitting for the next phase of MARV-EL and expects a contract decision to be made by the end of the year.

Near Earth Autonomy RUC-60

Near Earth Autonomy is developing an optionally-piloted aircraft based on the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter that has been in service with the DOD for generations. The platform is being promoted as performing logistics missions in contested environments and can carry 2,500 lbs 125 n miles, a company official told ExecutiveGov.

Near Earth Autonomy believes retrofit kits are the most efficient way to rapidly address the need by upgrading existing aircraft into uncrewed logistics solutions. The company is also developing retrokit solutions for the AgustaWestland AW139, the Kaman KARGO UAV and the TRV-150 quadcopter.

The Army in April awarded Near Earth Autonomy a $15 million contract to retrofit UH-60Ls with its advanced autonomy kits to make the helicopters uncrewed and high-tempo logistics aircraft. The initiative creates a repeatable and scalable process and allows the Army to avoid long acquisition timelines and unlock new capabilities from legacy aircraft.

Near Earth Autonomy highlights its Captain deterministic autonomy architecture as central to this program. Designed for performance in complex and degraded environments, Captain enables safe flight and hazard avoidance without needing onboard crew, a remote pilot or a continuous data link. Near Earth Autonomy is leveraging a modular open systems approach, or MOSA, for this UH-60L retrofit contract.

The Army will work with Near Earth Autonomy to develop new operational procedures for autonomous logistics by performing a series of autonomous flights. This should lead to a mature, mission-ready product. Near Earth Autonomy began working toward an unmanned Black Hawk in 2021.

Sabrewing Aircraft Rhaegal

Sabrewing Aircraft is developing a regional cargo unmanned aircraft capable of carrying up to 5,400 lbs of payload over 1,000 n miles in vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, mode. If a customer prioritizes larger payload capacity for the Rhaegal, the horizontal runway takeoff and landing permits up to 10,000 lbs of payload, according to Sabrewing’s website.

The Rhaegal achieved its first hover flight in 2022 while lifting 829 lbs. The company touts the Rhaegal’s ability to use sustainable aviation fuel to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 percent.

Sabrewing has landed a number of contracts, including one from Ameriflight, who intends on purchasing 35 Rhaegals. Ameriflight intends to use the platform to enter new business opportunities in distribution center logistics as part of a diversified aviation services business model.

Piasecki Kaman KARGO

Piasecki Aircraft made a huge splash earlier this year when it acquired the KARGO heavy lift quadcopter UAV from Kaman Air Vehicles, developer of the K-Max TITAN heavy lift helicopter. The KARGO is a medium-lift, autonomous UAV that has been demonstrated to both the U.S. Marine Corps and Army for its VTOL cargo capabilities. The platform has a payload capacity of 1,000 lbs with a range of up to 500 n miles, according to Defense News.

The KARGO is designed to fit in a standard shipping container and can be unloaded and operated by as few as two people. Kaman, while owning the KARGO UAV program, received an initial $12 million contract from the USMC for MARV-EL and has two existing full-scale prototypes, according to a company statement.",https://media.executivegov.com/2025/07/heavy-lift-uav-navy-logistics-ulsa.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 18:08:29.463359

This initiative aims to boost the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by welcoming more fuel suppliers into its blockchain-powered system. The partners believe this evolution will make SAF accessible to a wider audience, potentially stimulating more environmentally conscious choices in air travel, even if availability remains limited at certain airports.

Before this development, Avelia had launched in 2022 offering 1 million gallons of SAF, initially sourcing only from Shell Aviation. Now, with over 57 companies and airlines on board, Avelia has injected over 33 million gallons of SAF across 17 global locations, cutting down more than 300,000 tonnes of CO2e when compared to traditional jet fuel. Previous estimations on SAF production indicated that by 2025, it would comprise a mere 0.7% of all aviation fuel consumption. This underlines the pressing need for platforms like Avelia to amplify SAF’s presence in the aviation sector.

Can Avelia’s Growth Transform SAF Accessibility?

The initiative’s expansion to a multi-supplier model is central to its strategy. This change allows participants to source SAF from various suppliers and consolidate their activities within Avelia. Shell, Accenture, and Amex GBT believe introducing more fuel suppliers will strengthen the platform’s credibility and impact. Furthermore, the “Bring Your Own SAF” feature aims to offer airlines more control over their SAF portfolios, even for fuel acquired outside the current supply network.

How Is Technology Enhancing Avelia’s Objectives?

Blockchain technology is pivotal in Avelia’s enhancements. Accenture now manages the platform’s data, ensuring a secure, transparent, and externally verified system. By doing so, Avelia seeks to foster trust among participants and encourage broader adoption within the industry.

Industry experts have expressed optimism about these updates. Evan Konwiser of Amex GBT highlighted the platform’s capacity to mitigate Scope 3 emissions for companies, underscoring its role in advancing the first and most established book-and-claim SAF system. Shell’s Raman Ojha noted this moment as significant not only for Avelia but also for the wider aviation sector.

Meanwhile, Accenture’s Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg emphasized the importance of strategic partnership in elevating the platform’s capabilities and maintaining data transparency. By leveraging blockchain and fostering a collaborative environment, Avelia aligns itself with the aviation industry’s sustainability goals.

Avelia’s recent advances highlight the strategic marriage of technology and sustainability. As aviation continues grappling with its environmental footprint, platforms like Avelia represent proactive efforts to confront these challenges. Despite its potential, ongoing collaboration and technological refinement will be crucial to overcoming existing barriers and facilitating broader SAF usage across the sector.",https://finance.coin-turk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/business-003-3.png,N,,2025-07-14 17:07:07.264377

The discussion also included a new partnership as an example of how Phillips 66 is unlocking that value.
The airline has received 5 million gallons of neat SAF from Phillips 66 through June at Los Angeles International Airport.
“We’re historically a traditional energy company, but our view is that we need all forms of energy.”","Phillips 66’s integrated model uniquely positions the company for success in the energy transition, Phillips 66 EVP of Commercial and Marketing Brian Mandell said recently. Mandell participated in a keynote fireside chat at the Reuters Global Energy Transition Conference in New York City last month, discussing integration across the Phillips 66 value chain and how it helps the company pursue lower-carbon opportunities. The discussion also included a new partnership as an example of how Phillips 66 is unlocking that value.

“What’s interesting about our integrated system is you can take assets and leverage them for new opportunities,” Mandell said. “We’re focused on both traditional energies and also emerging energies, particularly renewable fuels.”

Mandell mentioned Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as an example, announcing a new deal with British Airways. The airline has received 5 million gallons of neat SAF from Phillips 66 through June at Los Angeles International Airport. The deal joins a growing list of other agreements the company has recently made.

“We were the first refinery in the UK to produce SAF at scale, and in 2022, we did a deal with British Airways to sell them that product,” Mandell said. “Last year we announced a deal with United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport.”

Setting Phillips 66 apart

Mandell also highlighted the transformation of the company’s San Francisco refinery, which now runs 50,000 barrels a day of feedstock.

“We saw an opportunity to convert that refinery into a renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel refiner,” said Mandell, referring to the renamed Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex. “Rodeo is part of our newest segment, our renewables segment, and is a great example of how we are evaluating opportunities for lower-carbon solutions.” Part of Phillips 66’s integrated model also includes a commercial organization that focuses on “finding the right feedstock, the right price, at the right time to make sure what the plant needs, we have,” Mandell said.

Mandell explained that optimizing plants by running the best suited feedstock is how Phillips 66 unlocked other opportunities. This allows for the most efficient slate for a refinery while staying customer-centric.

Mandell provided an example of California’s desire for renewable diesel, where Phillips 66 supplies over 600 76® branded stores. “Our integrated model can take renewable diesel to the end consumer. We’re constantly trying to get the product all the way through that last mile.”

Collaboration is necessary

Effort by various stakeholders is needed to continue the development and implementation of renewable fuels, said Mandell. Using SAF as an example, he noted it is difficult to invest and innovate with changing policies, thus calling for more collaboration.

“We’re going to need airlines, shippers, airports, producers and the government to all work together to develop [the SAF] market,” said Mandell. “We’re historically a traditional energy company, but our view is that we need all forms of energy.”",https://www.phillips66.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/BAYWAYSTILLS0060.png,N,,2025-07-14 16:09:53.545970

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago.
Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.
It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.
But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.","Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

And Washington state's support for sustainable aviation fuel goes beyond tax incentives.

Washington State University is globally the top contributing organization to scientific literature in the sustainable aviation fuel field, based on an analysis of articles, papers, editorials and news items published between 2001 to 2023. Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Laboratory (BSEL) at WSU Tri-Cities and co-director of the WSU-PNNL Bioproducts Institute, was the most cited author.

At the end of 2024, SkyNRG Americas Inc. announced its proposal to build on property purchased from the Port of Walla Walla near the Columbia River for a sustainable aviation fuel production facility. The project has also received a $1.5 million grant from the state Department of Commerce, as part of the Governor’s Economic Development Strategic Reserve Fund.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/2025/07/14/Airplane.jpg?height=635&t=1752513003&width=1200,N,,2025-07-14 15:10:08.055200

Although these changes may not have yet directly affected pricing, they announce structural shifts that can impact the Jet kerosene market in the years ahead.
Even with the declining trend throughout June, jet kerosene prices saw a sudden 7.5% swing in early July.
At the same time, international forces are also impacting the wider jet kerosene market.
As per ChemAnalyst, the price of Jet Kerosene is expected to remain volatile, in the forthcoming days.","According to the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC), India witnessed a 4.7% month-to-month decline in total fuel demand in June. This comprised a quantifiable decline in jet fuel and petrol consumption, mainly due to decreased air and road traffic due to seasonal weather disruptions. Consequently, the jet kerosene demand continued to be subdued irrespective of continuous year-on-year revival in the aviation business.

On the supply side, local refiners remained steady at operations levels, holding substantial inventories of jet kerosene through the month. Leading players such as Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL) kept ATF supplied continuously, augmented by strong infrastructure, including sophisticated hydrant fueling systems in prominent airports and strategic storage sites. In addition, consistent import volumes—particularly U.S., Brazilian, and Russian crude oil quantities—served to augment the well-stocked supply environment, positioning inventories comfortably in front of demand.

The India Refining Summit in June also underscored the changing strategy of the industry, centering around more valuable petrochemicals and cleaner technologies to drive long-term efficiency and sustainability. Although these changes may not have yet directly affected pricing, they announce structural shifts that can impact the Jet kerosene market in the years ahead.

Even with the declining trend throughout June, jet kerosene prices saw a sudden 7.5% swing in early July. Industry analysts attribute this dramatic turn, they say, to diminishing inventory positions, speculative positions, or pre-policy adjustment changes in the aviation fuel mix.

India will put a mandate on domestic carriers to mix at least 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in their ATF consumption from sometime later in 2025. Subject to the availability of biofuels, the mandate could be increased to 4–5%, which could fundamentally alter the demand profile for conventional jet kerosene in the near term.

At the same time, international forces are also impacting the wider jet kerosene market. International demand has been weakening, and the International Energy Agency reduced its projection of 2025 jet fuel consumption in light of diminished cross-border travel by Chinese tourists and regulatory uncertainty in the United States.

As per ChemAnalyst, the price of Jet Kerosene is expected to remain volatile, in the forthcoming days. Ongoing global trade uncertainties may disrupt the oil supply in the region leading to increased production cost of Jet Kerosene in the market.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-14 14:13:49.264030

Billionaire Elon Musk's company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that the meeting would be held Nov. 6, but that may prove troublesome because it comes nearly three months after it is required to do so under state law in Texas, where the company is incorporated.

The annual meeting, given Tesla's fortunes this year, has the potential to be a raucous event and it is unclear how investors will react to the delay, which is rare for any major U.S. corporation.

Tesla shares have plunged 27% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump, as well as rising competition.

The announcement of the meeting comes a day after a group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders sent a letter to the company's board pressing for an annual meeting after receiving no word of one with the deadline just days away.

Many shareholders have been miffed by Musk's participation in the Trump administration this year, saying he needs to focus on his EV company which is facing extraordinary pressures.

“An annual meeting provides shareholders with the opportunity to hear directly from the board about these concerns, and to vote for or against directors, the board’s approach to executive compensation, and other matters of material importance,” the group said in the letter.

The group cited Texas law, which requires companies to schedule annual shareholders meetings within 13 months of the prior annual meeting.

“We've been operating CO2 pipelines in this country for 40 years, and they've been operating even longer in other countries,” Shaw said.
The federal Department of Transportation, through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), is ultimately responsible for issuing and enforcing safety regulations.
Inspections are performed by the pipeline company and pipeline regulators, according to the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit public watchdog organization.","As the ethanol industry seeks to decarbonize, so as to meet tax credit requirements, pipeline companies are planning to establish routes across the Midwest. Those pipelines will transport and sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during ethanol production, allowing ethanol plants to take advantage of tax credits.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 expanded the 45Q tax credit.

According to documentation from the Iowa Corn Growers Association, this credit incentivizes carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), with the federal government providing funding as follows:

$85 per metric ton (17¢ cents per gallon of ethanol) for CO2 permanently sequestered underground, and

$60 per metric ton (12¢ cents per gallon of ethanol) for CO2 used for enhanced oil recovery or other industrial uses.

The 45Z tax credit specifically incentivizes fuel producers to lower their carbon intensity (CI) scores to 50 or lower. For on-road vehicles, 45Z offers 2¢ per gallon, up to $1 per gallon for every CI point reduction below 50. For sustainable aviation fuel, 45Z offers 3½¢ per gallon, up to $1.75 per gallon for every CI point reduction below 50.

Growing a Pipeline

The first large-scale CO2 pipeline in the U.S. was the Canyon Reef pipeline, established in the 1970s for use during the enhanced oil recovery process in the Permian Basin in Texas. Pipeline infrastructure grew to around 3,000 miles during the early 2000s. Now there are over 5,300 miles of carbon pipelines in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).

The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the country will need an increase of up to 20 times the existing carbon pipeline mileage by 2050. Several studies have attempted to optimize the required pipelines. based on varying estimates of CO2 that will need to be transported, with an estimated 30,000 to 96,000 miles of additional carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) pipelines required by 2050, according to the Department of Energy. In addition to the expansion in pipeline capacity, other modes of CO2 transportation will also be required for facilitating offshore storage, shorter routes, and collection from facilities, including barge, ship, train, and truck.

Safety Responsibilities

While carbon pipelines haven’t noted a fatality since reporting began in 1988, like any project of this magnitude, landowners and advocacy groups have voiced concerns about safety.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, a trade association for ethanol producers, said confusion and political agendas have clouded the discussion around carbon pipeline safety.

“We've been operating CO2 pipelines in this country for 40 years, and they've been operating even longer in other countries,” Shaw said. “There's never been a loss of life — you can't say that for almost anything else — so the track record is pretty good. I have to differentiate between the people who have safety questions, and the people who use questions as a political instrument to oppose CO2 pipelines because they don't like them.”

Congress has the ultimate responsibility to set pipeline safety regulations. The federal Department of Transportation, through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), is ultimately responsible for issuing and enforcing safety regulations. States are allowed to accept the responsibility for regulations within their borders with an annual certification from PHMSA. State and local governments can regulate development near pipelines with their land use authority.

Inspections are performed by the pipeline company and pipeline regulators, according to the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit public watchdog organization. Requirements for pipeline inspections vary on factors such as contents, location, and width. Some techniques include aerial flyovers, truck drive-bys, or on-foot inspections. Internal inspections are performed by a device called a “smart pig,” which travels through the pipeline, using sensors to detect corrosion, dents, scratches, and other weaknesses.

PHMSA requires pipeline companies to produce dispersion models, as well as risk analyses to identify potential impacts to high-consequence areas. Factors include topography, weather, leaked CO2 volume, and pipe diameter — while modeled at maximum, higher-than-normal operating volume. A pipeline operator must have a written integrity management program that addresses the risk on each pipeline segment, identify preventive and mitigative measures to protect each area, and continually evaluate the plan throughout the pipeline’s lifespan.

When a Burst Happens

Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless, heavier-than-air gas that can cause asphyxiation after prolonged exposure and is potentially lethal over wide distances. At normal temperatures, CO2 is a gas; CCS pipelines carry CO2 in highly pressurized liquid form. Natural gas pipelines are not suited for CO2 transportation. They have a maximum pressure rating of 1,480 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) — a Class 600 pipeline, according to the American National Standards Institute. A pipeline built for CO2 service is designed for 2,200 psig — a Class 900 pipeline.

When exposed to water, CO2 turns into carbonic acid, which can eat through a steel pipeline, potentially leading to a volatile rupture. When a pressurized pipeline bursts, the dramatic change of pressure at the release point can cause the CO2 to rapidly expand, causing it to drop sharply to sub-freezing temperatures, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

The cold CO2 presents a dermal hazard, causing frostbite like dry ice, to those coming into contact with the released gas or the nearby piping and equipment. It can produce a thick water vapor cloud, which may be dispersed by the wind. Due to the density of CO2, during cool and humid conditions with little to no wind, the CO2 could accumulate in lowlying areas, such as valleys and ditches. This cloud can also reduce visibility — especially at night — making driving or walking through the CO2 release hazardous. As the gas adjusts to ambient air temperatures, the opaque vapor cloud dissipates, but it may still be present.

Recent Pipeline Leaks

In February 2020, a pipeline operated by Denbury Inc. in Satartia, Mississippi, burst, spewing CO2 for about four hours before the rupture was repaired. Over 200 residents in the surrounding area were evacuated, and 45 were hospitalized, according to PHMSA's failure investigation report, which it released May 26, 2022. Many residents experienced seizure-like symptoms, felling those affected and causing tremors and difficulty breathing. Motor vehicles stopped working, impeding emergency response. In the subsequent years, some residents have reported ongoing respiratory issues, as well as headaches, difficulty concentrating, and muscle tremors, according to a report by NPR.

In response, PHMSA in 2022 announced steps to implement new safety measures in its oversight, created the failure investigation report, and began soliciting research to strengthen CO2 pipeline safety.

In its investigation, PHMSA attributed the pipeline burst to soil saturation from recent rainfall. Vertical erosion of the sloped hillside, exacerbated by the rainfall, produced enough load to compress the pipeline and cause the welding to fail. PHMSA found that Denbury’s operations and maintenance procedures didn’t address the potential for pipeline damage caused by soil instability, and that the company's aerial inspection patrols failed to identify the potential geohazard before the incident.

According to the PHMSA's report, Denbury failed to notify local responders, hindering the ability of emergency services to respond in a timely manner; local responders contacted Denbury about 40 minutes after the burst. The report also found that Denbury’s CO2 dispersion model underestimated the potential affected area that could be impacted by a release, and that the modeling did not identify Satartia.

In 2022, PHMSA issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty, and Proposed Compliance Order to Denbury Gulf Coast Pipeline, LLC for multiple violations of Federal pipeline safety regulations, with proposed civil penalties amounting to $3,866,734. In 2025, another $2,366,900 of penalties was proposed. The final penalty assessed was $2,868,100.

In April 2024, Denbury, since acquired by ExxonMobil, was responsible for another pipeline burst in Sulphur, Louisiana. A 2-foot-diameter pipeline at a pump station ruptured and released around 107,000 gallons of CO2 over the course of nearly two and a half hours, according to the Ward Six Fire Protection District in Calcasieu Parish. Residents within a quarter mile of the pump were told to shelter in place, close doors and windows, and turn off air-conditioners. No injuries or serious illnesses were reported at the time.

Looking Forward

In the final days of President Biden’s administration, PHMSA proposed new, comprehensive requirements for CO2 and other hazardous liquid pipelines.

“I have learned first-hand from affected communities in [Sartartia,] Mississippi and across America why we need stronger CO2 pipeline safety standards,” said Tristan Brown, PHMSA deputy administrator at the time of the announcement. “These new requirements will be the strongest, most comprehensive standards for carbon dioxide transportation in the world and will set our nation on a safer path as we continue to address climate challenges.”

It was withdrawn days later when President Trump took office, and issued a sweeping order freezing all pending regulations by executive departments and agencies.

PHMSA’s proposal would have strengthened standards for CO2 pipelines — including CO2 transported in a supercritical fluid state — and establish new standards for transporting CO2 in a gaseous state via pipeline.

Pipeline regulations are in further doubt following Trump’s executive order in February that targeted regulations deemed “unconstitutional” or that would “impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits.”

Despite changes to regulations, Shaw, of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said he expects the Trump administration to continue supporting carbon pipeline projects moving forward.

“Trump is the godfather of the carbon pipelines — he's the one that signed 45Q in the law in such a way that it was actually economically viable to do these projects,” Shaw said. “Biden further enhanced 45Q in the [Inflation Reduction Act].”

In March, South Dakota banned the use of eminent domain for CCS projects. This significantly threatens the future of Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed pipeline, which has its storage location in North Dakota. In April, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission denied, for a second time, the permit for Summit’s pipeline route.The company said it is planning to reapply with a reduced scope.

Shaw said the ban on eminent domain is a de facto ban on the pipeline in the state and that it will hurt ethanol producers who can’t take advantage of the 45Q and 45Z tax credits for sequestering carbon.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/MDRM4QImtv9geujSEFIHv3BN-Go=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ConstructiononDakotaAccessPipeline-128983ee0e3b417f8d133d12fbbf395f.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:13:52.718635

This weekend, the quiet Gloucestershire village of Fairford transforms once more into the global heart of aviation, as the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT 2025) takes flight, blending aerial artistry with military might.

With over 250 aircraft expected from more than 25 nations, RIAT 2025 promises to be as spectacular as ever. But this year, there’s more than just engine roars and formation loops in the spotlight.

The RAF Red Arrows will fly their full display using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a bold and symbolic nod toward a greener aviation future.

Whether you’re attending or following along from home, here’s a look at the stars of RIAT 2025 taking part in the flying displays.

RIAT 2025: Fast jet and tactical demonstrations

The highlight of any airshow, RIAT 2025 will see plenty of fast jet action.

F‑16C Tiger Demo: Poland’s precision and prowess

The Polish F‑16 Tiger Demo Team showcases the Lockheed Martin F‑16C Fighting Falcon Block 52+, known locally as the Jastrząb (“Hawk”).

In service since deliveries under the “Peace Sky” programme between 2006–2008, this advanced F‑16 variant features Pratt & Whitney F100‑PW‑229 engines, APG‑68(V)9 terrain‑mapping radar, and the ALQ‑211(V)4 electronic warfare suite, marking it among the most capable F‑16s in NATO service.

Since its formation in the early 2000s and official establishment as the Tiger Demo Team in 2015, the display team has built a reputation for high‑energy solo performances, tight manoeuvres, and crowd‑pleasing visuals, all inspired by Poland’s strength in NATO exercises such as the Tiger Meet.

The demo pilot for the 2025 season is Major Maciej “SLAB” Krakowian.

Saab Gripen E: Sweden’s agile next-gen multirole fighter

The Saab JAS 39 Gripen E is a light, single-engine multirole fighter developed by Sweden’s Saab. Introduced in 1996, the E variant represents its most advanced iteration.

Equipped with a General Electric F414-G engine and an ES-05 Raven AESA radar, the Gripen E delivers situational awareness and sensor fusion from its updated digital cockpit and multifunction displays. These attributes helped Saab’s test pilot André Brännström win the Paul Bowen Trophy for Best Solo Jet Demonstration at RIAT in 2023.

The Paul Bowen Trophy for the Best Solo Jet Demonstration is named in memory of one of the co-founders of RIAT. In 2022, Captain David Szentendrei from the Hungarian Air Force won the same award flying a Gripen C, marking two years in a row a Gripen fighter jet was awarded.

F‑35A Lightning II: Stealth power from the 495th Fighter Squadron

The F-35A Lightning II, flown by the 495th Fighter Squadron – the Valkyries – based at RAF Lakenheath, is the USAF’s cutting-edge fifth-generation stealth fighter.

With its internal weapons bays, sensor fusion, and unparalleled low-observability characteristics, the F-35A brings a new level of battlefield awareness and survivability.

The 495th FS is the first USAF squadron in Europe to operate the F-35A, having received its first jets in 2021.

At the show, the 495th’s aircraft are expected to demonstrate vertical climb, precision handling, and stealthy presence, showcasing fusion-based combat performance.

MC-130J Commando II: USAF’s special ops workhorse

The Lockheed Martin MC-130J Commando II, operated by the 67th Special Operations Squadron from RAF Mildenhall, is a tactical airlifter modified for special operations missions.

With enhanced avionics, aerial refuelling capability, and terrain-following radar, the MC-130J can insert or extract special forces in challenging environments. The MC-130J primarily flies missions at night to reduce probability of visual acquisition and intercept by airborne threats.

Its presence in the flying display at RIAT 2025 is rare and offers spectators a glimpse of precision, low-level flying that underscores the quiet power of USAF’s unconventional mission fleet.

The first MC-130J aircraft was delivered in September 2011 to Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, with final delivery expected in fiscal year 2025.

C-21A Learjet 35A: Compact, classic and nimble

The Learjet (now Bombardier Aerospace) C-21A twin turbofan-engine aircraft is the military version of the Learjet 35A business jet. It provides airlift for eight passengers and 3,153 pounds of cargo. During aeromedical evacuations, it can transport one litter patient or five ambulatory patients.

Though not a fast jet in the traditional sense, its appearance in the flying display showcases the agility and versatility of one of the USAF’s lesser-known but vital assets.

Its compact profile and swift manoeuvres provide a refreshing change of pace between heavier and more aggressive aircraft types.

RIAT 2025: Helicopter flying demonstrations

Whether you’re here for the thump of the Chinook or the blistering manoeuvres of the Black Cats demo team, RIAT 2025 is a treat for rotorcraft lovers.

RAF Chinook Role Demo: Power and precision from a battlefield legend

The RAF Chinook Display Team, based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, exists to demonstrate the Chinook Force’s capability.

The Boeing CH-47 Chinook, an icon of British air mobility, takes centre stage in a role demonstration that combines brute strength with tactical agility. Operated by 18 and 27 Squadrons from RAF Odiham, the tandem-rotor helicopter demonstrates troop insertion, underslung load carrying, and rapid extraction.

Its distinctive rotor “thump” and tight turns belie its size and payload capability, making the Chinook a perennial highlight at RIAT.

The Mark 6A are used for the display, and make up the bulk of the RAF’s fleet. The Chinook is forecast to remain in Britain’s inventory until at least 2060.

Royal Navy Black Cats: Wildcat HMA.2 pair’s aerial ballet

The Black Cats Helicopter Display Team fly two AgustaWestland Wildcat

HMA.2 helicopters from 825 Naval Air Squadron, based at RNAS Yeovilton.

Once seen as a nimble utility platform, the true character of the Wildcat helicopter is now coming into sharper focus, that of a fearsome maritime attack aircraft, fully equipped and combat-ready.

In its early years, the Wildcat often flew light, rarely armed with the kind of munitions that could threaten hostile ships or submarines. But that phase is firmly in the past.

Today, the Royal Navy’s Wildcat has grown its “claws and fangs.” Its stub wings now bristle with Martlet missiles designed to neutralise fast attack craft and boat swarms, Sting Ray torpedoes for submarine threats, and soon, the Sea Venom missile, a potent tool capable of disabling corvettes or even larger surface warships.

No longer a mere scout or spotter, the Wildcat has become a frontline force multiplier.

At RIAT, the Black Cats are expected to perform with sharp coordination and theatrical flair.

RIAT 2025: Aerobatic display teams

Everyone’s eyes turn skywards when the Red Arrows arrive, but RIAT 2025 brings more than just the UK’s own display team, with aerobatics from all over the world.

RAF Red Arrows: Flying history in greener skies

The Royal Air Force Red Arrows, Britain’s iconic nine-aircraft aerobatic display team, will make history at RIAT 2025 by performing their entire display powered by 100% SAF. It’s first such use of SAF for any national military aerobatic team during a public display.

The team’s signature coloured smoke trails are also now generated with Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) biofuel, making every plume a display of environmental commitment as well as performance.

This landmark initiative aligns with the RAF’s Defence Aviation Net Zero Strategy and highlights military aviation’s potential to reduce carbon emissions without compromising mission capability.

Patrouille Suisse: Swiss precision in F-5E Tiger IIs

The Patrouille Suisse serves as the official aerobatic display team of the Swiss Air Force, representing both the Swiss military and the nation itself.

For over six decades, this elite team has wowed spectators across Switzerland and beyond with their tightly choreographed aerial displays.

Flying the Northrop F-5E Tiger II, the six-ship Patrouille Suisse team, formed in 1964, represents the very definition of precision.

The Tiger II’s compact agility, delta-shaped canopy, and clean design make it ideal for tight, fast-moving formations.

Their red-and-white paint scheme complements the Swiss flag and their flying style: calm, measured and meticulously executed.

Saudi Hawks: Bold manoeuvres with a desert flair

Formed on January 24, 1999, the Saudi Hawks or the Green Hawks Team are the Royal Saudi Air Force’s official aerobatic team, flying seven green-and-white BAE Hawk Mk.65A aircraft.

Based at King Faisal Air Base, Tabuk, the team brings Middle Eastern precision and flair to European skies. Their routine combines loops, bomb bursts, and formation passes, projecting the Kingdom’s growing aviation professionalism and regional engagement.

Fursan Al Emarat: UAE’s golden knights of the sky

Flying seven Italian-built Aermacchi MB-339 NAT jet trainers, Fursan Al Emarat (“The Knights of the Emirates”) are the national aerobatic team of the United Arab Emirates.

Formed in 2010, they are known for elegant, choreographed routines punctuated by gold, red and black smoke trails. With a blend of showmanship and discipline, they reflect the UAE’s ambition and growing aerospace investment.

Reports have it that the Al Fursan aerobatic team has moved closer than ever to getting a new fleet of jets from China to replace their Aermacchi MB-339s, as the UAE reportedly signed a firm order for the Hongdu L-15 Falcon.

According to AVIC, the aircraft’s manufacturer, the UAE has signed a contract in 2023 for the purchase of 12 L-15 trainer jets, with an option for 36 additional aircraft.

Given that the UAE had been exploring replacements for Al Fursan’s fleet of 10 MB-339s by mid-decade, it is likely that the national aerobatic team will be the primary beneficiary of this initial order.

Royal Jordanian Falcons: Propeller-powered precision from the Hashemite Kingdom

Adding vibrant flair to RIAT’s jet-dominated skies, the Royal Jordanian Falcons soar in with their fleet of five Extra 330LX aircraft, one of the world’s most agile, high-performance aerobatic aeroplanes.

With razor-sharp loops, graceful barrel rolls, and seamless formation transitions, their performance showcases not only the aircraft’s astonishing roll rate and climb capabilities but also the elite flying skills honed by this celebrated team.

Founded in 1976 under the patronage of His Majesty King Hussein, the Falcons are more than an air display team – they are Jordan’s roving ambassadors. With each routine, they carry a message of pride, tradition, and modernity from the Hashemite Kingdom to audiences around the world.

Their presence at RIAT brings a distinctive regional flavour and a legacy of precision flying that spans nearly five decades.

As they carve arcs of smoke across the Cotswold sky, the Falcons offer a thrilling contrast to the thunder of fast jets, reminding crowds of the artistry and discipline embedded in propeller-driven aerobatics.

Their display is not only a visual spectacle but also a celebration of national identity, making them a perennial favourite among RIAT visitors.

What time is the flying display at RIAT 2025?

The 2025 edition of the Royal International Air Tattoo opens on Friday, 18 July, and runs through to Sunday, 20 July. Each day, the showground will open at 07:30 and close at 18:00.

The bill extended the availability of the 45Z tax credit through 2029.
“That is really going to hinder the ability to take your ethanol and turn it into SAF,” Hora said.
In a press release following the passage of the reconciliation bill, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the bill “will not boost the ethanol-to-SAF market the way we hoped.
The closer a CI score is to zero, the better it is for the 45Z credit and for the potential financial share to the farmer.","In a virtual press conference, Mitchell Hora, CEO of Iowa-based soil health data intelligence company Continuum Ag, spoke to farmers for over an hour about the impact of the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill on 45Z for farmers, biofuel producers, and ag companies. The bill extended the availability of the 45Z tax credit through 2029.

Walking through some of the most important changes and unknowns still to be finalized after the bill’s passage, Hora thanked the Iowa Congressional delegation for “fighting for us” throughout the reconciliation process and focused his remarks on what farmers and producers can do in the coming years to make the most of these tax credits.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Loses Out

Hora called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a “major loser” of the reconciliation bill’s passage, as a previous tax credit of $1.75 per gallon of SAF under the 45Z rule was cut to $1 per gallon, in line with ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel.

“That is really going to hinder the ability to take your ethanol and turn it into SAF,” Hora said. “Under the current version of 45Z, the alcohol-to-jet pathway [is] not going to happen. Not at any type of real pace.”

Hora said that while ethanol is not being locked out as a feedstock, “the way that the rules are written doesn't provide the financial incentive to produce SAF using ethanol.”

He added that this could change in the future if the failed amendment introduced by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) is added to future legislation and adopted in some format. Ernst has introduced legislation seeking to protect SAF multiple times.

In a press release following the passage of the reconciliation bill, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the bill “will not boost the ethanol-to-SAF market the way we hoped. We will continue to look for ways to restore that.”

The release called the move “unexpected” and claims that SAF has the potential to be a “100-billion-gallon-a-year market” by 2050.

Renewable energy law firm Frost, Brown, and Todd detailed the decision made by Congress on SAF here.

“The enhanced rates for sustainable aviation fuel are eliminated for fuel sold after December 31, 2025. In a move to standardize emissions accounting, the proposal bars the use of negative lifecycle emissions rates for most fuels starting in 2026, except in the case of animal-manure-based fuels,” the article reads.

Unknowns Remain, But Be Flexible

While there were important answers given by the reconciliation bill for 45Z, Hora said there are still questions that need answers for producers and companies alike.

One of the big questions remaining is whether the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will decide to have credits tracked with the book and claim, or mass balance methods.

The book and claim method allows farmers to sell their crop where they wish, and sell their low-carbon credit certificates as a new environmental asset to any buyer, regardless of location.

Mass balance, on the other hand, is a method in which low-carbon crops must be delivered to a biofuel producer. This means the bushels and low-carbon credit certificates stay linked.

Hora said that book and claim could be better for producers, but urged them to “prepare for mass balance” moving forward and to be adaptable into the future.

Knowing CI Scores is Key

One of the key elements of getting the most out of 45Z for farmers will be gathering and using data from their fields, Hora said. He said farmer data will be key to unlocking value and will be “what’s going to ensure that there’s an equitable share of the financial value.”

One of the crucial data pieces ethanol producers will need to know is the Carbon Intensity (CI) score of their farmers’ fields, Hora said. The closer a CI score is to zero, the better it is for the 45Z credit and for the potential financial share to the farmer.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/ZY6QxLKtoJFUEfoVkQdYryc8hwI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/54163679242_59f748f514_oSAFethanolplant-Iowa-d55130af73f44d9cb58b780fbdef60f2.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:21:04.761628

Special to The Digest

While the electrification of many industrial sectors is accelerating the energy transition, it is not a silver bullet that will get us to net-zero economies. From aviation to cement, industries reliant on fossil based-carbon need a sustainable substitute—not just to meet climate targets but to remain competitive. In these industries, decarbonization should not be the goal, but recarbonization with a sustainable substitute. That substitute is green syngas: a flexible, biomass-derived mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This article explores how syngas can power a new era of industrial recarbonization. We examine its feedstocks, conversion technologies, technical barriers, and real-world use cases—along with what it will take to scale this solution. For stakeholders across the bioeconomy, green syngas offers more than a molecule—it offers a market.

The Decarbonization Dilemma in Industry

Hard-to-electrify industries need green carbon. While electrification using renewables is driving the energy transition, it is not suitable for all use cases. High temperature industries, such as steel and cement, rely on direct fuel combustion and electrification solutions are immature or impractical. Further, in energy dense applications like aviation and maritime fuels the use of batteries fails due to weight and volumetric limitations. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, electrification will not be an option for many sectors that contribute significantly to carbon emissions. To meet decarbonization goals, replacing fossil-based carbons with green carbon is a lot more practical.

The Role of Syngas

Green syngas is a highly flexible, globally available resource that can drive the replacement of fossil carbon in multiple industries. Syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, is produced from biomass sources typically via gasification or pyrolysis technologies. Once produced, green syngas can be upgraded by one of four major processes (Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, Water-Gas Shift, Synthesis, and Methanation) to produce a variety of products, including: aviation and marine fuels, hydrogen, renewable natural gas, and green chemicals. The versatility of syngas is a tremendous commercial advantage as it provides many potential end-product markets. Syngas should be regarded as a single commodity, but rather a platform technology that allows for customization depending on market demand and regulatory incentives.

Sources of Biomass

Syngas is valuable because it unlocks value from waste biomass. Broadly speaking, biomass is organic matter than can be used as a fuel. Popular sources of biomass include forestry and agricultural waste, animal waste, sewage, and municipal solid waste. Biomass is present world-wide in both rural and urban environments, making it a highly available feedstock. Traditionally biomass has been a viewed as a problem, as it needed to be collected and disposed in many cases. Syngas flips this paradigm on its head by providing a valuable use for these sources of waste. Further, this upgrading of biomass can support public policy goals such as landfill diversion, and creation of jobs in rural communities.

Sources of Biomass, Biomass as an Alternative for Gas Production (Canepa and Gonzalez, 2017)

Conversion Technology Overview

Biomass gasification is the technical pathway to producing valuable syngas from waste biomass. First, the biomass is pretreated, which includes drying the biomass and sizing it to achieve greater uniformity of the biomass. The dried biomass is then gasified in a reactor with oxygen and steam, typically in the 600 to 1200oC range to produce syngas. Depending on the completeness of the gasification, other products like bio-oil and biochar may be produced. If the gasification is incomplete, upgrading will occur to remove things like tars, particles, and inorganics. The purified syngas can then be upgraded into many valuable products, such as hydrogen, methanol, and Fischer-Tropsch fuels.

Source, Brandin, et al., 2015

Addressing Technical Challenges

There are several types of gasification technologies including fluidized-bed, entrained flow, and fixed bed with different temperature and pressure conditions. Several gasification technologies have already been proven at commercial scale and have been deployed in small to medium combined heat and power (CHP) systems. The use of biomass to produce the upgraded chemicals has largely been done at pilot and demonstration scale, though initial commercial plants for these products are underway.

Like many technologies, there are challenges associated with biomass gasification. First the biomass must be pre-processed prior to gasification. There are naturally occurring variations in things like particle size and moisture content that must be homogenized to achieve maximum yields. Processes to standardize biomass, like sizing and drying can be energy intensive. Further, the syngas must be cleaned up before use to remove impurities like tars and metals. Impure syngas can poison catalysts in further processing steps, hurting economics. Additionally, tars can accumulate over time, necessitating frequent cleaning of reactors that can result in frequent downtime for equipment. High temperature gasification methods, like plasma-arc, can offer complete conversion, reducing the impact of these issues. However, such technologies are still under development. Technical advancements and learning by doing will be needed to reduce conversion costs over time.

From Molecule to Market: Syngas Use Cases

Recently, moves to decarbonize economies has catalyzed many use cases where syngas derivatives can be used effectively. The demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is growing. The EU’s “Fit for 55” requires 2% SAF usage in 2025, growing to 50% by 2050. With limited availability of waste oils, biomass to jet pathways should grow in importance in coming years. The maritime industry too, is making strides in decarbonization. The international maritime organization (IMO) has set a goal of a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. The international shipping giant, Maersk, launched its first methanol powered ship in 2023 and seeks to be at net-zero emissions by 2040. Finally, green hydrogen demand is growing globally. 58 countries globally have produced hydrogen strategies/roadmaps with a mix of goals, requirements and incentives to increase the amount of clean hydrogen available. While many of these programs are electrolysis-focused, biomass-based hydrogen also meets most goals for carbon reduction in these programs.

Investment & Commercialization Outlook

As with any other emerging technology, the development of syngas presents challenges, but also opportunities. Companies entering the space will need to deal with the normal tests of scaling up to commercial scale, and the CAPEX associated with first of its kind technologies. Yet, there is also reason to believe that the pull from markets looking for low carbon products will create the basis for the industry moving forward.

There are multiple developing projects involving syngas production that are developing globally. For example, Haffner Energy has announced a biomass to hydrogen plant in Marolles, France expected to be commissioned by July, 2026. While Elyse Energy has announced its BioTJet project to produce 110,000 tonnes of e-fuels from end-of-life waste wood by 2029. Overall, the overall growth of the global syngas market is expected to reach USD $731B by 2031 with a CAGR of 11.3%, providing significant opportunities for companies working in the space.

Why Syngas Matters Now

As the global push to decarbonization intensifies, syngas is ready to play a significant role. Electrification can address several issues, but key industries will continue to rely on carbon-based fuels. Fortunately, syngas allows for recarbonization, replacing fossil-carbons with renewable sources of biomass. Biomass is globally available in large quantities and can be unlocked by conversion to syngas. Syngas enables the production of key chemicals like methanol, hydrogen, and Fischer-Tropsch fuels, which can address hard to abate sectors like aviation, maritime shipping, and steel manufacturing. The importance of syngas in reaching net-zero has begun and will only increase in the coming years.

Congress and several U.S. states are working together to grow the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry through tax incentives and legislative support.

This movement is seen as a step toward reducing airline emissions and opening new markets for agriculture.

The clean fuel tax credit, originally passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was set to end in 2027. However, a new Republican-led budget law, signed by President on July 4, 2025, extended it through 2029.

Although the law reduced some credits for SAF and reclaimed unused federal grants, the extension still offers vital long-term support.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” said Paul Greenough of Capstone DC, an energy policy advisor group.

Sustainable aviation fuel is critical to helping the airline industry achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The International Air Transport Association says SAF could help reduce 65% of emissions.

Corn ethanol, often used in car fuels, is a key feedstock in making SAF, giving corn-producing states a new economic opportunity.

States like Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Washington have already passed SAF tax credit laws. New proposals in New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin are under consideration.

Wisconsin Rep. David Steffen introduced a bill requiring that SAF be made using only U.S.-sourced materials. He said, “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Despite federal credit reductions, analysts expect the SAF industry will still benefit. U.S. production grew from 5,000 to over 30,000 barrels per day in early 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Airlines continue to push for broader SAF access, and states may now create stronger local incentives to make up for federal policy changes. Together, these efforts could help scale up commercial production and support rural economies.

Initially a one-supplier-fits-all system, Avelia now enables businesses and airlines to purchase SAF from a variety of suppliers, bringing about more efficient and transparent fuel management throughout the sector.

This move is happening at a time when aviation companies are coming under pressure to lower their greenhouse gas emissions and meet a series of ambitious sustainability targets. Through the wider network, Avelia would look to increase the intake of SAF, giving companies the ability to demonstrably reduce their environmental footprints—forever changing how we think about the future of aviation.

Evolution to a Multi-Supplier Platform

The multi-supplier nature of Avelia supports the increasing need for SAF and accommodates wider industry involvement. This extends the reach of the benefits of greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. Customers can access GHG benefits from multiple SAF producers, making it easier for corporations, airlines, and freight forwarders to manage their SAF portfolios.

Key enhancements include

Independent Data Hosting: Accenture manages data processing and host environment activities for SAF-based transactions, creating a secure, auditable, and independently verified record of SAF’s environmental performance.

Bring Your Own SAF (BYOS) Model: This capability allows airlines to track SAF they’ve acquired outside of the Shell supply network within Avelia, giving them a complete picture of their SAF consumption.

Multilateral governance: Avelia is setting up a governance to bring about transparency and collaboration across multiple entities in the SAF space.

The improvements will simplify the administration of SAF and make the process of procuring SAF even easier and more attractive for companies that are already engaged in reducing their aviation-related emissions.

Impact on Aviation Decarbonization

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is pivotal, as it can reduce lifecycle GHG emissions from aviation by up to 80% when neat. Although it is environmentally friendly, the production of SAF is small, comprising only 0.7% of jet fuel worldwide production in 2025. Avelia’s expansion is in response to the gap it sees between corporate demand and a limited supply of SAF and will seek to aggregate demand from corporate customers to drive SAF production and use.

To date, 17 airport injection points globally have used Avelia to inject more than 33 million gallons of SAF into the world’s fuel supply since its introduction. This project has helped to remove more than 300,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, highlighting the platform’s capacity to fuel aviation decarbonisation.

Strategic Partnerships and Future Outlook

This joint effort from Shell, Accenture, and Amex GBT represents our shared ambition to drive sustainability in aviation. As a strategic advisor and technology partner, Accenture has helped guide the evolution of Avelia support, managing data processing and hosting to enable confidentiality and control for the customers of the platform. Through its broad base of clients worldwide, Amex GBT is significantly leveraged to aggregate SAF demand, a key factor in sustaining the scale and impact of the platform.

In the future, Avelia continues to scale the platform, adding new SAF suppliers and new functionalities to enable the aviation industry transition to net zero emissions. Through collaboration and technology, Avelia is designed to expedite the use of SAF and help air travel become part of a more sustainable future.

Conclusion

The development of Avelia rocks the post for the aviation industry to decarbonise. Developed to offer greater access to SAF across a range of suppliers and improve transparency, Avelia is expected to enable airlines and corporate customers to accelerate their sustainability initiatives.

Having built strong industry participation and a strong pipeline of innovations to come, Avelia is well placed to be at the cape of what promises to be a revolution in the reduction of aviation emissions and the integration of sustainable fuels in the aviation sector. As the industry nods towards sustainability as the main driver of growth, Avelia’s platform will undoubtedly play a major role in accelerating the transformation into greener and more efficient aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/green-fuel-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 11:11:13.207325

Launched in 2022 with 1 million gallons of SAF, the Avelia program utilizes a book-and-claim model, enabling business travelers to pay for SAF and claim the environmental benefits, even if the SAF is not available at their departure airport. The solution was developed by Shell and Accenture, with the support of the Energy Web Foundation (EWF), and includes Amex GBT’s travel management services to aggregate global demand for SAF from its 19,000 global customers. To date, Shell is the sole SAF supplier for the platform.

In an update provided by the companies, Shell, Accenture and Amex GBT revealed to as of March 2025, more than 57 companies and airlines have joined the platform, contributing to the injection of more than 33 million gallons of SAF at 17 airport injection points globally, resulting in the abatement of more than 300,000 tonnes of CO2e on a lifecycle emissions basis, relative to conventional jet fuel.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

According to the companies, the evolution of the platform comes as SAF represents the most viable current solutions to reduce aviation emissions, yet SAF is still only produced in relatively small quantities, with the IATA recently estimating that SAF production in 2025 will account for just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption. Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.

Evan Konwiser, Chief Product and Strategy Officer, Amex GBT said:

“For the majority of companies, Scope 3 emissions represent the largest share of their total carbon footprint and reducing them can be challenging… As a partner in Avelia, we continue to grow and evolve the world’s first and now most established book and claim platform for SAF. Together we can accelerate its scale and increase customer access to its environmental benefits.”

Among the key changes announced to the Avelia platform is the evolution to a multi-supplier model, allowing users to access the GHG benefits of SAF from multiple suppliers, and to manage SAF from different suppliers within Avelia. The companies said that the platform is also looking to introduce a “Bring Your Own SAF” (BYOS) model, which would allow airlines to manage more of their SAF portfolio in Avelia, including fuel originally purchased outside of the Shell supply network as well as SAF that otherwise would have been tracked offline and not on a digital registry, with the move aimed at supporting the use of book and claim solutions for tracking SAF to help build credibility for the model at an industry level and accelerate SAF adoption.

Raman Ojha, President, Shell Aviation said:

“This moment marks a significant milestone not only for Avelia but for the aviation sector. Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF.”

The companies also announced that Avelia is in the process of setting-up a multilateral governance structure to enable multi-party involvement and more transparency information around its operating procedures, and that the platform data is now hosted and handled by Accenture, providing a blockchain-powered transparent, secure, reliable and externally verified platform for accessing and allocating the information for the applicable SAF offering.

Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg, Global Travel and Aviation Sustainability Lead, Accenture, said:

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.
It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.
But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.","Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.

“This purported attempt to incentivize ‘clean fuels’ is little more than a giveaway to the conventional biofuels industry,” the organization said in a post on its website.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is gaining momentum in the U.S., with lawmakers at both federal and state levels supporting its growth through new tax policies and production incentives.

The federal government recently extended a key clean fuel tax credit through 2029, as part of a budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025.

The credit initially expired in 2027 but now offers extra years for producers to scale up SAF development. Though the law lowers the value of SAF-specific credits and removes some federal funding, it still provides a long-term signal to the industry.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects, so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy.

The aviation industry aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and SAF is expected to play a major role. The International Air Transport Association estimates SAF could contribute 65% toward the goal.

Currently, U.S. SAF production is growing, rising from 5,000 to over 30,000 barrels per day between early 2024 and February 2025.

States are also stepping in. Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Washington have already passed tax incentives. New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin lawmakers have proposed new bills to encourage SAF use.

In Wisconsin, Rep. David Steffen said he was inspired by a local company producing SAF and wants to support in-state jobs and farmers. His bill would require SAF materials to be domestically sourced.

ATJ fuel, produced from renewable alcohols like ethanol and isobutanol, presents a viable solution for the aviation sector to achieve these emission reduction targets.

In addition to environmental goals, significant investments are being made in bio-refineries and cutting-edge fuel processing technologies. Many nations are backing research and development (R&D) projects focused on next-generation biofuels, including ATJ, to enhance energy security and reduce reliance on traditional fossil fuels.

Revenue passenger kilometers rose by 10.4 percent compared with 2023 and by 3.8 percent compared with pre-pandemic 2019. Global airline revenues look set to surpass USD 1 trillion in 2025; not bad for an industry some predicted would not survive Covid-19.

“Looking to 2025, there is every indication that demand for travel will continue to grow, albeit at a moderated pace of 8 percent that is more aligned with historical averages,” said IATA Director General Willie Walsh in Business Travel News.

John Schmidt, Global Aerospace Lead at consultancy firm Accenture, shares the upbeat view: “We’re definitely beyond 2019, even if the rate of growth differs among regions. Growth and revenues are up for aircraft makers too and while fewer aircraft have been delivered, MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) drove year-over-year growth for 2024.”

Some observers have predicted that air travel will ultimately prove untenable given its current climate footprint. Schmidt, however, points out that “the sector only accounts for 2.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is a fraction of what the combined truck fleet emits.”

The industry has been striving to reduce CO₂ emissions since long before the climate change issue first surfaced, mainly because fuel consumption has always been the number one cost driver for airlines.

The global aviation industry has pledged to try to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, a goal to which Schmidt comments: “It’s a bit unlikely that we’ll get there, but the push is certainly there. The challenge is to continue to leverage the technology to be able to drive value in the industry while reducing costs and lowering carbon emissions to attain more sustainable operations.”

Advances in materials

Lower aircraft weight, improved fuel efficiency and a switch to non-fossil fuels or electric propulsion are contributing to more sustainable air travel. Advances in the aerospace industry are often linked to advances in materials – specifically the strength-to-weight ratio and the temperature resistance of new materials. The materials of choice these days for aerospace engines are heat-resistant super alloys, (HRSA) an advanced mix of specialty metals, nickel, cobalt, iron and some TiAl (titanium aluminide)-based alloys.

Digital manufacturing is a cornerstone in transforming the industry and reducing its sustainability footprint. Many non-structural aircraft body parts and engine components have complex forms and lend themselves to 3D printing.

Additive manufacturing underway

New materials and new manufacturing methods are key, according to Jeff Wheless, Growth & Strategy Research Leader at Accenture, who offers an example: “GE’s landmark 3D-printed fuel nozzle tips are 25 percent lighter and five times more durable than their conventionally manufactured counterparts. It’s not just a way of getting rid of weight but of designing things that can be manufactured more efficiently.”

Boeing has produced over 70,000 3D-printed parts across aerospace applications; a mix of thermoplastics and metallic parts. “The tolerance and quality demands of these new AM (additive manufacturing) materials are very high, often tighter than for conventional parts, which requires more precise machining tools for post-processing. That in turn creates new manufacturing opportunities and challenges for machine tool manufacturers such as Sandvik,” Wheless adds.

More efficient tools

Ramping up production is another key issue for an industry plagued by a massive backlog of orders. Besides more efficient tools, this calls for workforce reskilling to handle more automation, digitalization and new manufacturing methods. Continuous education and training will be essential to equip the workforce with the skills needed to navigate the future of aerospace manufacturing.

Britain is accelerating its transition to electric vehicles with a new £63 million investment from the UK Government. This funding aims to enhance the country’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure, supporting off-street home charge points, NHS fleet electrification, and expanded charging facilities for businesses. This strategic move not only reinforces the government’s commitment to building a cleaner, more sustainable transport network across the UK but also promises a future of lower emissions, reduced costs, and cleaner transport for all.

Improving the UK’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure

The investment package aims to drive down charging costs and improve electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

A £25m scheme will allow local authorities to expand access to cheaper at-home electric vehicle charging, providing households with lower rates, which could save up to £1,500 a year compared to running a petrol or diesel car. The cross pavement technology will allow cables to run safely beneath pavements, connecting homes directly to parked vehicles, enabling more families to tap into cheaper domestic electricity rates for as little as 2p per mile, offering significant cost savings and financial security, even if they don’t have a driveway.

The funding will extensively expand the UK’s electric vehicle charging network, which has currently reached 82,000 public charge points, with a further 100,000 expected to be installed as a result of the government’s local EV infrastructure fund and private investment.

Additionally, the UK Government is launching a significant new grant scheme to help businesses install charging points at depots nationwide, supporting the nation’s heavy goods vehicles, vans, and coach drivers in the transition to zero emissions.

Delvin Lane, CEO, InstaVolt, said: “We are pleased that the government has taken the crucial step of delivering official EV charging signage on the strategic road network – a move we believe will improve consumer confidence and bolster EV adoption. This marks a significant milestone for the EV industry and drivers across the UK.

At InstaVolt, we have been relentless in our campaigning and have built a strong, collaborative relationship with the government to push this initiative forward. Our opinion research suggests that the rollout of clear, official signage will make a significant difference, helping EV drivers easily locate public charging points while on the move, and reassuring those considering making the switch to electric vehicles.

For years, we have emphasised that the UK’s public EV infrastructure, so critical to mass adoption, is already primarily in place, and now this signage will finally showcase it to drivers in a visible, accessible way.

As the UK’s largest ultra-rapid public charging network with over 2,000 chargers nationwide, InstaVolt is proud to be at the forefront of this transformation and excited to see how these signs will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.”

Driving sustainability in the NHS

The NHS in England will also receive a major sustainability upgrade with an £8m fund for an electric fleet of ambulances and medical vehicles, which will be available across over 200 NHS sites. This significant investment, driven by the UK Government, is a testament to its commitment to public health and sustainability.

Health Minister Karin Smyth said: “This is a win-win: cheaper travel for the NHS and cleaner air for our communities.

As part of our Plan for Change, we’re investing in green energy to build an NHS fit for the future — cutting pollution and saving millions in fuel costs.”

NHS Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Gormley said: “The NHS has already implemented hundreds of projects that reduce emissions and drive significant cost savings, all while improving patient care.

This new £8 million investment, across 62 NHS Trusts and around 224 sites, supports the renewed commitment in the government’s 10 Year Health Plan to deliver a more sustainable NHS while also helping hospitals to save millions on fuel and maintenance costs and reducing air pollution. These savings can be reinvested directly into frontline care, ensuring the NHS continues to deliver for our patients and communities.”",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-1502846788-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:28.190708

The 2 million litres of unblended SAF were Australia’s largest ever commercial import of sustainable aviation fuel.
Demand for such low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF), from airlines and mining companies, is on the rise.
“Low carbon liquid fuels are a present-day necessity for sectors that can’t electrify”, says Ian Learmonth CEFC’s chief executive.
Scaling up Australia’s LCLF industry would require cautiously optimistic navigation of waters that are simultaneously risky and rewarding.","In May this year, when Qantas, Australia’s largest airline, along with Ampol, a fuel supplier, and Sydney Airport announced a large fuel import it was hardly atypical. Some 80% of Australian liquid fuel demand is serviced from overseas. Yet, this was no ordinary import. The 2 million litres of unblended SAF were Australia’s largest ever commercial import of sustainable aviation fuel.

Demand for such low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF), from airlines and mining companies, is on the rise. A new report from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a government-backed investor, and Deloitte has found that Australia has a comparative advantage in capturing that demand. An advantage that, by 2050, could be worth $36bn.

First movers

32% of Australia’s national emissions are attributable to liquid fuel use. Over a third of that demand comes from road transport – where electrification is underway. Mining and aviation account for nearly a third of remaining demand and are harder to electrify.

For these industries, LCLFs are the next best hope. “Low carbon liquid fuels are a present-day necessity for sectors that can’t electrify”, says Ian Learmonth CEFC’s chief executive. “If we get the settings right, Australia can lead in clean fuels innovation and production - not just supply the feedstocks”, he adds.

In person: NZI Annual Conference | 21 October | London | Register here

Getting the settings right, the report says, could yield significant rewards that investors should take note of. “Policy accelerators, including mandates, certification schemes and offsets, are key components to assist the industry reach scale. The first movers will reap the rewards of this global market”, notes Learmonth.

Home advantage

The production of LCLFs relies on feedstock - things like waste, agricultural residue, biomass, sorghum and used cooking oils. This plays into Australia’s large agro-industrial footprint, the report claims. These industries provide feedstock such as tallow and canola – which are currently being exported for LCLF production.

“We export the raw materials but miss the opportunity to build the industry here at home. This is about regional development, national resilience, and emissions reduction, all at once”, says Rupert Maloney, CEFC’s executive director.

The report includes a production cost analysis as well as estimation of Australia’s LCLF cost curve. The findings highlight the importance of cost reductions in the years ahead – where LCLF innovation and lower feedstock costs could play a key role.

Demand, meanwhile, is expected to rise significantly as offtake mandates replace carbon offsets in industries such as aviation. Over 50% of LCLF demand under all modelled scenarios between 2030 and 2050 will come from aviation.

“Clean fuel plants could revitalise manufacturing hubs and create skilled careers in some areas hit hardest by the decline of fossil fuels. But we need investment commitments this decade to avoid missing the window”, said Maloney.

Investment risk

For investors this remains risky business. As the report highlights, LCLF market is still relatively immature. To be viable, projects require complicated supply chains and a steady roster of feedstock suppliers and offtake partners. In addition, the market itself is fragmented and the cost gap between LCLFs and traditional alternatives needs trimming.

These uncertainties add to the LCLF risk premiums, making capital more expensive.

Here, the report identifies seven ‘market accelerators’ that could pave the way for a LCLF boom down under. The use of concessional finance to de-risk private investments is one of the report’s key recommendations. The implication being that other forms of capital might need to take a seat at the table before institutional capital considers one.

As Australia decarbonises, its legacy industries -notoriously emissions-intensive - will come under stress. Somewhat unsurprisingly then, the country’s financiers might look for the next big thing. The report makes a convincing case for LCLF to be amongst the candidates, courtesy of a first mover advantage up for grabs. Its caveats, however, are noteworthy. Scaling up Australia’s LCLF industry would require cautiously optimistic navigation of waters that are simultaneously risky and rewarding.

ICAO’s Salazar said that even as the aviation sector develops its own measures to cut carbon emissions, it is closely observing the IMO’s decarbonisation framework, which he described as “innovative”. As the aviation sector works towards a plan to address carbon emissions, it hopes to learn from the maritime sector’s experience after it rolls out its net-zero framework later this year, he added.

Safer skies and seas

Beyond emissions, aviation and maritime can work together in many other areas, noted Salazar. He named examples such as managing air and sea traffic in conflict zones, coordinating search and rescue operations, and improving crisis responses.

“Many of the challenges we face today are common: political instability, threats to security and safety of both maritime and aviation systems,” he said. “These present opportunities to exchange and learn from each other.”

His maritime counterpart Dominguez pointed out that safety challenges such as search and rescue, route disruptions, and safety equipment interference are shared across both sectors.

ICAO’s Salazar also said that international civil aviation has long drawn from the maritime sector, particularly in legal frameworks. “In that regard, I believe the cross-pollination… of experiences and best practices… is very important.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/bb77dce579a09e081de174d0c2e382611790506a8368555547b671b31cdfa0b5?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:37.515982

On July 7, 2025, the President issued a related Executive Order (the ""BOC Order"") regarding the rapid termination of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar. This client update will focus on the effect of the BBBA and the BOC Order on clean energy tax incentives. For our coverage of the general business tax provisions of the BBBA, click here.

1. Revision to the ITC and PTC

A. Rapid Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Wind and Solar

The eligibility of wind and solar projects for the ITC and PTC is being phased out rapidly. To be eligible for either credit, the wind or solar facility must either

begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA), or

be placed in service prior to January 1, 2028.

B. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Existing IRS guidance provides liberal rules for determining when construction begins for purposes of ITC and PTC phaseouts. Under the existing IRS guidance, a taxpayer can begin construction (""BOC"") by commencing physical work on the project (including certain off-site work on a component of the project) or incurring 5% of the cost of equipment for the project. Under a safe harbor in the existing IRS guidance, a project that begins construction in 2026 can be placed in service as late as December 31, 2030, or in some circumstances even later. However, unlike the beginning of construction principles applicable under the FEOC rules (discussed below), the applicable IRS guidance is not statutorily frozen as of January 1, 2025.

The BOC Order directs that ""[w]ithin 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the 'beginning of construction' are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

It seems likely that the new IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order will be more restrictive than existing IRS guidance. The scope and effective date of the new guidance is unknown.

C. Accelerated Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Other Technologies

For technologies other than wind and solar, the BBBA accelerates the phaseout of the ITC and PTC by eliminating the prong of the phaseout that was based upon the year that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production fall to 25% of 2022 levels. As a result, such projects that begin construction before 2034 will generally be entitled to the full ITC or PTC rate, but those rates will drop to 75% for construction begun in 2034, 50% for construction begun in 2035, and 0% thereafter. The scope of the BOC Order is limited to the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar, so it is not clear to what extent any IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order might apply to other technologies or for other purposes of the ITC or PTC (including, for example, the domestic content or energy community adders).

D. Increased Domestic Content Requirement to Qualify for ITC Adder

Under prior law, the level of domestic content required to qualify for the domestic content adder for the ITC was permanently set at 40% (or 20% for offshore wind), while the percentage required to qualify for the PTC version of the adder increased over time. Under the BBBA, property that began construction before June 16, 2025 will continue to require 40% domestic content; however, projects beginning construction in 2025 after June 16, in 2026, or in a later year must consist of 45%, 50%, or 55% U.S. components, respectively, to qualify for the domestic content adder. These required percentages are lower (20%, 27.5%, and 35%) for offshore wind facilities beginning construction before 2027, then 55% thereafter.

E. PTC Adder for Nuclear Energy Communities

The BBBA expands the energy community credit adder to apply to certain advanced nuclear facilities that claim the PTC, but not to any such facilities that claim the ITC. An ""advanced nuclear facility"" is defined as any nuclear facility for which either the reactor design was approved after December 31, 1993, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and such a design or a substantially similar one was not approved before such date, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has authorized construction and issued a site-specific construction permit or combined license. To qualify for the energy community bonus credit on this basis, the advanced nuclear facility must be located in a metropolitan statistical area which has (or at any time after December 31, 2009, had) 0.17% or greater direct employment related to the advancement of nuclear power.

F. Leased Systems Formerly Eligible for Section 25D Credit for Solar Water Heating or Wind

The BBBA disallows the ITC and PTC for solar heating property and wind property that qualifies for the homeowner's credit under section 25D, as in effect prior to its repeal by the BBBA. This disallowance is limited to property that is leased to the homeowner. An earlier version of the BBBA would have extended this disallowance to leased rooftop solar systems, but that provision was not included in the bill as enacted.

G. ITC for Fuel Cells

The BBBA creates a 30% ITC specifically for qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after 2025. This credit is not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, but it also does not benefit from other ITC adders. Fuel cells had previously struggled to qualify for the ITC after revisions in the IRA required property for which the credit is claimed to have an anticipated greenhouse gas emissions rate of no greater than zero. Under the BBBA, fuel cells qualify for the full 30% ITC regardless of technology, fuel type, or greenhouse gas emission profile.

2. Transferability (Sale) of Credits

Section 6418, allowing transfers (sales) of tax credits, has been revised to disallow the transfer of most clean energy tax credits to any entity that is a specified foreign entity (see the discussion of the FEOC rules below). This is an improvement over earlier versions of the bill that would have more broadly phased out the ability to transfer credits.

3. Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

A. Phaseout of Credit for Applicable Critical Minerals

Under prior law, the section 45X manufacturing credit for applicable critical minerals had no expiration date. The BBBA adds a phaseout that starts one year later than the pre-existing phaseout for other section 45X eligible components. The full credit rate is available for applicable critical minerals sold before 2031. Applicable critical minerals sold in 2031, 2032, or 2033 will be eligible for 75%, 50%, or 25% respectively of the currently allowable credit. Applicable critical minerals sold after 2033 will not qualify for a credit.

B. New Applicable Critical Mineral Category: Metallurgical Coal

The BBBA creates a separate category of applicable critical minerals for metallurgical coal, defined as coal suitable for use in the production of steel within the meaning of guidance published by the Department of Energy. Metallurgical coal produced before January 1, 2030, will qualify for a credit of 2.5% of the relevant production costs.

C. Changes to Rules Regarding Other Eligible Components

The credit for production of wind energy components will not apply to components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The phase-out for other eligible components is unchanged.

An additional requirement was added for a component to qualify for the $10 credit for battery modules. The module must be ""comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and battery harnesses, or other essential energy collection equipment.""

D. Reduced Scope of Integrated Component Rule

The BBBA modifies the rule that deems one or more eligible components to be sold to an unrelated person (as required to qualify for the credit) if such eligible components are integrated, incorporated, or assembled into another eligible component that is produced and sold to an unrelated person. Under the BBBA, the integration, incorporation, or assembly into the second eligible component must occur in the same manufacturing facility, at least 65% of the direct materials costs for the second eligible component must be for components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and the credit is unavailable if the second component is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a third component. This rule applies to components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

4. Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

The credit for carbon capture and sequestration was largely untouched by the BBBA and, in one respect, was significantly enhanced: the credit amount per ton of captured carbon oxide that is used in enhanced oil or gas recovery or for other commercial purposes, such as food and beverage, was increased from the current rate of $60 per ton to $85 per ton, the rate that was previously available only for carbon oxide disposed of by sequestration. This increase in the credit amount is equally available to carbon oxide captured from industrial emissions or direct air capture. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025; carbon capture projects already placed in service would not be able to claim the higher credit amounts for these uses. The requirement that construction of carbon capture projects begin before January 1, 2033, is unchanged. The FEOC rules also apply to the Section 45Q credit as covered below.

5. Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The BBBA extends the availability of the Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z to fuel sold through December 31, 2029. However, qualifying fuels produced after December 31, 2025, must be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Under prior law, there had been a question as to whether certain production processes could be considered to have a negative emissions rate for most fuels by resulting in an enhanced credit amount. The BBBA explicitly rules out application of a negative emissions rate by providing that, for purposes of determining the emissions factor, qualifying fuels may not be treated as having an emissions rate of less than zero. However, the BBBA offers a significant exception to this prohibition in allowing biofuels derived from animal manure (which is the fuel category most commonly assigned a negative emissions rate) to have a negative emissions rate. In a blow to the sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF"") industry, the BBBA reduces the per gallon credit for SAF from $1.75 to the amount available to other transportation fuels of $1.00, effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025. As with other credits, these changes are in addition to the limitations under the FEOC rules covered below.

6. Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

The BBBA accelerates the date by which clean hydrogen production projects must begin construction to December 31, 2027. This is considered a win for the sector after earlier versions of the BBBA would have required a 2025 beginning of construction date. The sector also benefits from the continued availability of the investment tax credit for hydrogen storage, compression and liquefaction equipment under section 48E and, as discussed above, the investment tax credit for hydrogen fuel cell property.

7. Termination of Other Clean Energy Credits

The BBBA significantly accelerates the end date for various tax credits relating to the acquisition of clean energy-related property. These credits, and the new applicable end dates, are as follows:

Section 25E Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 45W Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit—property must be placed in service by December 31, 2025;

Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit—expenditures must be incurred by December 31, 2025;

Section 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit—property must be placed in service by June 30, 2026;

Section 45L New Energy Efficient Home Credit—home must be purchased by June 30, 2026; and

Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction—property must begin construction by June 30, 2026.

8. Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC)

With the exception of the Section 45V credit for hydrogen production, all IRA tax credits that survive beyond 2026 are subject to disallowance under new FEOC rules if the taxpayer, facility, or product has impermissible connections to China or other disfavored countries or entities. The FEOC rules may disallow the relevant tax credit to a ""specified foreign entity,"" a ""foreign-influenced entity,"" or an entity that receives ""material assistance"" from a ""prohibited foreign entity."" Each of those terms has a complex definition, as described below. The particular rules that apply, and the effective date of those rules, varies from credit to credit, as set forth in the table below.

A. Prohibited Foreign Entities, Specified Foreign Entities, and Foreign-Influenced Entities

1. Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE)

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" (""PFE"") is defined as either a ""specified foreign entity"" (""SFE"") or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (""FIE"").

2. Specified Foreign Entities (SFE)

An SFE is defined as a ""foreign-controlled entity"" (""FCE"") or an entity designated as a bad actor under certain existing statutes, including designation as a ""foreign entity of concern,"" a ""designated foreign terrorist organization,"" or a ""Chinese military company operating in the United States."" An FCE is defined as any of (i) the government of a covered nation (including any level of government below the national level and any agency or instrumentality thereof), (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs. A ""covered nation"" is any of China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

3. Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIE)

An entity is an FIE if it satisfies either

a direct control test for the current tax year, or

with respect to the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit, an ""effective control"" test for the preceding tax year.

Under the direct control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if (i) a single SFE has the direct authority to appoint a board member, executive level officer, or person with similar powers or responsibilities, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the debt of the entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs. Special rules apply for determining whether a publicly traded entity is an FIE.

Under the effective control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if it makes a payment to an SFE pursuant to an agreement that entitles the SFE or a related party to exercise effective control over (i) a facility with respect to which the ITC or PTC may be available or (ii) the production of an ""eligible component"" under the section 45X manufacturing credit. The statute sets forth thirteen different powers, any one of which alone will constitute ""effective control."" These powers generally relate to power over operations or output of a facility, including exclusive control over a critical system within the facility. Six of those specified powers are operative immediately; seven of those specified powers are only relevant to the extent provided in regulations to be issued in the future. The BOC Order directs that ""within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

B. Material Assistance Rules for ITC, PTC, and Section 45X Manufacturing Credit

1. General Rules

A taxpayer is not entitled to claim the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit with respect to property with respect to which it receives ""material assistance"" from a PFE. Whether ""material assistance"" has been received is determined by comparing the ""material assistance cost ratio"" for such property to a ""threshold percentage.""

The material assistance cost ratio (""Cost Ratio"") of a qualified facility (under the ITC or PTC) or energy storage technology (under the ITC) is the ratio of (i) the total costs attributable to manufactured products (as defined for purposes of the domestic content adder) incorporated upon completion of construction excluding costs of products that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total costs attributable to manufactured products incorporated upon completion of construction. The Cost Ratio for a facility that produces eligible components under the section 45X manufacturing credit is the ratio of (i) the total direct costs that are paid or incurred for the production of an eligible component excluding costs paid or incurred for production of such eligible component that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total direct costs paid or incurred for the production of the eligible component.

Threshold percentages are established by statute and vary by the type of property with respect to which a credit is being claimed and the year in which such property begins construction or is sold. Generally, the threshold percentages range from 40% to 95% and increase over time.

The BBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables no later than December 31, 2026, which will identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or total direct material costs of any eligible component which are attributable to a PFE and provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer's material assistance from a PFE. As noted above, the BOC Order directs Treasury to provide guidance regarding FEOC matters within 45 days of the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA. Until such safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on tables issued in guidance on the domestic content adder (Notice 2025-08) and certifications provided by suppliers under penalty of perjury stating that property or direct material costs were not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

For purposes of the ITC and PTC, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, for use in a facility that begins construction before August 1, 2025 and is placed in service before January 1, 2030 (or January 1, 2028 for wind and solar facilities), will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

For purposes of the section 45X manufacturing credit, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025 and used in a product sold before January 1, 2027 will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

2. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Within the definitions of a PFE and ""material assistance,"" the BBBA directly incorporates IRS Notice 2013-29 and subsequent related guidance addressing the beginning of construction of a project or facility for tax purposes, as in effect on January 1, 2025. The narrow context (PFE and material assistance) in which the BBBA adopts the BOC principles in effect on January 1, 2025, suggests that this ""freeze"" of BOC guidance as of January 1, 2025, does not apply in any other context. That appears to be the theory underlying the President's direction to Treasury in the BOC Order to provide ""new and revised"" guidance regarding the meaning of ""beginning of construction"" for purposes of the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar.

3. Penalties and Statute of Limitations

The FEOC rules impose new or harsher penalties relating to the material assistance rule and a longer statute of limitations for IRS examination of material assistance issues.

A taxpayer that claims a credit which is later disallowed due to an IRS adjustment to the Cost Ratio of the underlying property may be liable for a substantial understatement penalty on understatements of tax greater than 1% of the true tax liability, as opposed to the normal 10%.

A supplier who makes a certification under the material assistance rules that it knows or reasonably should have known is false will generally be required to pay a penalty of 10% of the resulting underpayment of tax by its customer.

The period during which the IRS may assess additional tax for an error relating to material assistance from a PFE is extended to six years.

4. ITC Recapture Rule for FEOC Effective Control Payments

A taxpayer will be subject to recapture of 100% of the ITC claimed with respect to a property if within 10 years after the property is placed in service it makes a payment that would be deemed to provide an SFE with ""effective control"" over the taxpayer as described above. This rule applies to property placed in service in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

5. Summary of Application of FEOC Rules to Surviving Tax Credits

The table below summarizes the applicability of the FEOC rules disallowing tax credits to specified foreign entities, foreign-influenced entities and taxpayers who receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

Credit Restrictions on SFEs Restrictions on FIEs Restrictions on Property with Material Assistance from a PFE Section 45Q—Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but ""effective control"" test does not apply). None Section 45U—Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but ""effective control"" test does not apply). None Section 45V—Clean Hydrogen Production Credit None None None Section 45X—Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. ""Eligible components"" do not include any property which includes material assistance from a PFE for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Section 45Y—Clean Electricity Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities do not include any facility the construction of which includes material assistance from a PFE, and which begins construction after December 31, 2025. Section 45Z—Clean Fuel Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (but ""effective control"" test does not apply). None Section 48E—Clean Electricity Investment Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology do not include property the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025, if such construction includes material assistance from a PFE.

In addition to the time pressure to implement begun construction strategies and understand the implications of the FEOC rules, the BBBA creates a number of significant changes to existing tax credits, as well as adding new uncertainties for credit qualification, which may affect tax equity and transferability strategies. We at Baker Botts would be pleased to assist you in these and other clean energy tax incentive matters.

Footnote

1 ""ITC"" refers to the clean electricity investment credit under section 48E. ""PTC"" refers to the clean electricity production credit under section 45Y. Apart from some changes affecting geothermal heat pump property, the BBBA did not impose new restrictions or limitations on the energy credit under section 48 or the renewable electricity production credit under section 45, both of which are generally available only if construction of the relevant property began before 2025.

FedEx (NYSE: FDX) has announced an agreement with Neste, the world’s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, securing more than three million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for delivery at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to the world’s largest express cargo airline. Through this agreement, FedEx has purchased blended fuel from Neste, to include a minimum of 30% neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel. As used in its blended form, the fuel will account for roughly a fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX* and is the largest SAF purchase executed by a U.S. cargo airline at LAX to-date. Delivery of the fuel began earlier this month and will continue over the next year.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions. As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial U.S. deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” said Richard Smith, chief operating officer, International, and chief executive officer, Airline, FedEx. “While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed—alongside other innovations—we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

“Neste is excited to work with FedEx and support their ambitious goal of reaching carbon-neutral operations by 2040 with our SAF. Recognizing the important role of air cargo in the global economy, FedEx is demonstrating how this industry can leverage available lower-emission solutions like SAF to reduce its environmental impact. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation,” says Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

This fuel purchase by FedEx builds upon years of the company’s efforts to co-create innovative sustainable aviation technologies with other industry leaders, including the ecoDemonstrator flight-test program with Boeing—the world’s first commercial airplane flight using 100% SAF in both engines that was conducted in 2018. In addition to the procurement of SAF, FedEx is pursuing multiple avenues to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption in its aviation operations overall, including aircraft fleet modernization, fuel conservation initiatives, and flight planning optimization. Collectively, fleet modernization and fuel saving efforts enabled FedEx in fiscal year 2024 to successfully achieve its goal of a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. FedEx set its first aviation emissions intensity reduction goals back in 2008.

Sustainable aviation fuel, explained

Sustainable aviation fuel is a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel, largely driven by lower emissions from the feedstocks used in the fuel production process. Neat SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel before use and is considered a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works within existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure without any equipment updates.

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%** over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste.

While SAF production continues to grow in the U.S. and internationally, SAF accounted for less than 1% of all global jet fuel production in 2024.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg announced that methane gas released from cow waste can be processed using clean technology to extract hydrogen, which can then be used as a renewable energy source. He said this approach aligns with Sarawak’s ongoing efforts to reduce waste and convert agricultural and livestock by-products into useful resources.

“If we have a lot of cattle, we also have a lot of waste. That waste emits methane, which contains hydrogen. From methane, we can extract hydrogen and turn it into energy,” he explained during the International Day of Forests 2025 celebration, themed ‘Forests and Foods’, held today.

He described the initiative as a clear example of the circular economy in action, where organic waste is not discarded but transformed into high-value products, supporting both environmental protection and economic development.

In addition to cow waste, the Sarawak government is investing RM30 million through the Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (SALCRA) for a pilot project in Lubok Antu. The project aims to convert oil palm waste into biomass and biofuel.

“For years, we’ve focused on palm oil but neglected the by-products. Now, we’re using that waste to produce biomass and biofuel,” Abang Johari said. He added that early trials of converting the biomass into animal feed have yielded promising results, with livestock showing improved health and weight gain.

He further noted that the biofuel derived from palm waste could eventually be refined into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), offering another green energy solution for the future.

Recalling his speech at the ASEAN Economic Leaders’ Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Abang Johari shared a simple but impactful message that has since become a cornerstone of Sarawak’s environmental policy: “Don’t waste the waste – monetise the waste.”

This philosophy, he said, captures the spirit of Sarawak’s green growth strategy, which is gaining attention beyond Malaysia as a model for sustainable and economically viable environmental practices.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Climate-image-Bioenergy-Times.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:54.593582

Gross-Wen Technologies' Revolving Algal Biofilm (RAB) system uses algae to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater, creating fertilizer.

The RAB technology is being used in several Iowa cities and in a large-scale project in Pasco, Washington.

Algae is the star behind a Slater-based business that is using the green goo to clean municipal and industrial wastewater.

The sustainable process was developed by Martin Gross, founder and CEO of Gross-Wen Technologies. His advancements in water treatment recently earned Gross an Entrepreneur Of The Year 2025 Heartland Award, an honor Ernst & Young has bestowed on entrepreneurs for the past 40 years.

The awards “celebrate ambitious entrepreneurs who are transforming industries, impacting communities, and creating long-term value,” a news release stated.

Gross said he was “incredibly honored” to receive the award and said it “reflects the dedication of our team and the innovative spirit that drives our mission to build sustainable wastewater treatment solutions.”

Using algae to transform an environmental challenge like wastewater cleanup can help strengthen communities and create a more resilient future, he said.

How does algae help clean wastewater?

Gross-Wen provides sustainable wastewater treatment solutions using the company’s Revolving Algal Biofilm (RAB) technology. The low-energy, cost-effective approach to nutrient removal contributed to cleaner waterways and stronger circular economies.

The company’s system uses vertical conveyor belts, about 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide, that move in a continual loop, cycling through the wastewater and air as multiple layers of algae grow on them.

As the algae grows, it consumes nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater. The nutrient-rich algae is then harvested and pelletized. The algae pellets are used for a variety of different applications, such as fertilizer.

Where is Gross-Wen’s technology being used?

Gross-Wen installed a “commercial demonstration” site about seven years ago in the city of Slater.

“Then about three years ago, Slater turned on the commercial system that’s designed to treat their water,” Gross told the Ames Tribune. “It’s a 20-year project, so it will be treating Slater’s water for the next 20 years.”

A similar project is currently under construction for the city of Creston.

“Story Construction is the general contractor on that project, so it has a nice local connection,” Gross said. “Creston is using our technology to meet their nutrient reduction strategy there for nitrogen and phosphorus removal.”

Another Iowa project is in Iowa City at its wastewater plant and is a collaboration between Gross-Wen, the University of Iowa and the city.

Gross-Wen’s largest project is in Pasco, Washington, where the Resource Recovery Center will use RAB to clean wastewater from seven food processors within the city. The project supports the growth of Pasco’s growing agribusiness sector while turning wastewater into clean energy and providing clean water and nutrients to irrigate and fertilize city-owned farmlands.

""We just installed the project in Pasco last year, and it's the largest algae-based wastewater treatment facility in the world,"" Gross said.

That project is enabling the reuse of about 1.5 billion gallons of wastewater per year and is estimated to produce enough renewable natural gas to supply more than 4,500 Washington residents with natural gas each year.

What is next for the Entrepreneur Of The Year contest?

As a Heartland Award winner, Gross is now eligible for consideration for the Entrepreneur Of The Year 2025 National Awards. The national award winners will be announced in November. The Entrepreneur Of The Year National Overall Award winner will then move on to compete for the EY World Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in June 2026.

NASA has tested a scale X-59 experimental aircraft at speeds of Mach 1.4 to validate its quiet supersonic technology.

In partnership with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), NASA tested the model in a wind tunnel, measuring the shockwaves generated when breaking the sound barrier.

The tests allowed NASA to validate how closely real-world airflow matched predictions from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models.

The X-59 is part of NASA’s Quesst mission (Quiet SuperSonic Technology), which aims to make overland supersonic passenger flights possible.

The hand-sized NASA X-59 test model

The full size NASA X-59 will be over 99 feet long (30 metres), with a wingspan of almost 30 feet (9 metres). However, the test model used in the Japanese wind tunnel is just 1.6% of the size at around 19 inches from nose to tail.

The aircraft was exposed to airflow matching the jet’s planned cruising speed of Mach 1.4 (around 925 mph).

The series of tests performed at JAXA allowed NASA researchers to gather critical experimental data to compare to their predictions derived through Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling, which include how air will flow around the aircraft.

This is the third round of wind tunnel testing for the X-59 following another test at JAXA and one at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Ohio.

NASA hailed the test as “an important milestone for NASA’s one-of-a-kind X-59, which is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound without causing a loud sonic boom.”

Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works has developed the X-59 for NASA’s Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator project. Work on the project has been ongoing since 2016. The first flight of the full size model is expected later this year.

Quesst: Lowering the noise of supersonic travel

When built, the X-59 is expected to cruise at Mach 1.42 at an altitude of 55,000 feet, and is designed to break the sound barrier without the hallmark ‘thump’ supersonic aircraft usually create.

The NASA X-59 does this by disrupting shockwaves to prevent them merging together, reducing the potential for a loud boom.

It could provide a breakthrough to open up supersonic travel around the world. Previous supersonic commercial aircraft like Concorde were banned from flying supersonic over land, limiting routes to over water.

Lockheed Martin writes that the experimental X-59 will help NASA provide regulators with the information needed to establish an “acceptable commercial supersonic noise standard to lift the ban on commercial supersonic travel over land.”

But regulators are moving ahead anyway, at least in the US. In June, President Trump signed an executive order encouraging regulators to fast-track the return of overland supersonic travel, potentially paving the way for lifting existing restrictions.

Supersonic passenger travel makes a comeback… quietly

With the X-59 paving the way for quiet supersonic flight, attention is also turning to commercial players. Chief among them is Boom Supersonic, a US company working towards bringing a supersonic passenger aircraft to market.

Earlier this year, Boom flew its XB-1 demonstrator at Mach speeds with zero audible noise on the ground. In what the company calls ‘boomless cruise,’ the aircraft uses altitude to ensure the sonic boom does not reach the ground.

This technology will be fundamental to its full size passenger aircraft, the Overture. The Overture is planned to have a range of 4,250 nautical miles and a cruise speed of Mach 1.7. It will have a seating capacity of 60-80 passengers.

United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines have all placed orders and pre-orders for the Overture.

For now, it seems unlikely that supersonic travel will be viable on a large scale. The aviation industry is overwhelmingly focused on increased efficiency and reduced fuel consumption. The most economical speed for commercial aircraft is in the Mach 0.78-0.85 range.

Next-generation commercial aircraft are increasingly focussed on fuel savings rather than speed. JetZero’s revolutionary new Z4 Blended Wing Body aircraft is also subsonic and seeks to reduce fuel consumption by up to 50%.

While Boom says the Overture will be compatible with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, critics argue that high fuel burn rates may still make supersonic travel environmentally burdensome, even with SAF.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NASA-X-59.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 10:07:02.865747

Despite near-term challenges such as fluctuating refining margins and regulatory risks, the company's progress on critical initiatives—from the Wyoming refinery restart to its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ambitions—positions it for sustained outperformance. Let's dissect the catalysts, risks, and valuation dynamics to determine whether PARR deserves a buy rating.

Operational Catalysts: Turnarounds and Strategic Projects

1. Wyoming Refinery Restart: A Success Story

The company's flagship Wyoming refinery, which idled in February 2025 due to an equipment malfunction, returned to full operations by late April—a month ahead of schedule. This restart is a major win:

- Throughput Recovery: While Q1 2025 throughput dropped to 6Mbpd (vs. 17Mbpd in Q1 2024), the refinery's Adjusted Gross Margin (AGM) surged to $19.83/bbl, up from $14.84/bbl in 2024, driven by higher Wyoming Index prices ($20.31 vs. $17.23).

- Cost Management: Though production costs spiked to $34.35/bbl (vs. $7.86/bbl in 2024) due to incident-related expenses, the refinery's faster-than-expected ramp-up reduces long-term cash flow drag.

2. Montana Turnaround: Margin Improvements Ahead

The Montana refinery's ongoing turnaround is nearing completion. This project aims to:

- Reduce maintenance costs and downtime.

- Optimize utilization of the refinery's 52Mbpd capacity.

- Capitalize on the region's abundant Bakken crude supply.

In Q1 2025, Montana's AGM fell to $5.04/bbl (vs. $13.82/bbl in 2024) due to lower index prices, but post-turnaround efficiency gains should reverse this trend.

3. Hawaii SAF Project: A Climate-Resilient Growth Engine

Par Pacific's $300 million Hawaii SAF project—a first-of-its-kind in the Pacific—is on track to produce 12 million gallons/year of low-carbon fuel by 2026. This aligns with global demand for sustainable aviation fuels, which is projected to grow at 15% annually through 2030. The project:

- Leverages Hawaii's renewable energy infrastructure.

- Secures long-term contracts with airlines and the U.S. military.

- Enhances margins via premium pricing for SAF.

Financial Strength: Buybacks and Balance Sheet Flexibility

Share Repurchases: PARR repurchased $51 million of stock in Q1 2025, reducing shares outstanding by 5%. With a $525 million liquidity buffer (including $133.7 million cash), the company can continue buybacks to boost EPS.

Debt Management: Net debt/EBITDA improved to 2.5x at the end of Q1, down from 3.0x in late 2024, signaling financial discipline.

Valuation Dynamics: Undervalued Relative to Peers

PE Multiple: PARR trades at 6.2x 2024E EBITDA, below peers like Valero (8.5x) and Marathon Petroleum (9.0x).

Margin Recovery Potential: As refining margins normalize and turnarounds yield results, EBITDA could rebound to $400 million in 2025 (vs. $94.7M in Q1).

Risks to Consider

Overbought Technicals: PARR's stock has risen 25% YTD, raising short-term overvaluation concerns. Investors should monitor resistance at $22/share.

The preliminary investigation suggests both engines shut down because the fuel flow stopped.
We don’t know what the pilots did Flight data recorders don’t capture pilot actions.
But the preliminary report is not the full story.","Over the weekend, the Indian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau released a preliminary report on last month’s crash of Air India flight 171, which killed 260 people, 19 of them on the ground.

The aim of a preliminary report is to present factual information gathered so far and to inform further lines of inquiry. However, the 15-page document has also led to unfounded speculation and theories that are currently not supported by the evidence.

Here’s what the report actually says, why we don’t yet know what caused the crash, and why it’s important not to speculate.

What the preliminary report does say

What we know for certain is that the aircraft lost power in both engines just after takeoff.

According to the report, this is supported by video footage showing the deployment of the ram air turbine (RAT), and the examination of the air inlet door of the auxiliary power unit (APU).

The RAT is deployed when both engines fail, all hydraulic systems are lost, or there is a total electrical power loss. The APU air inlet door opens when the system attempts to start automatically due to dual engine failure.

The preliminary investigation suggests both engines shut down because the fuel flow stopped. Attention has now shifted to the fuel control switches, located on the throttle lever panel between the pilots.

Data from the enhanced airborne flight recorder suggests these switches may have been moved from “run” to “cutoff” three seconds after liftoff. Ten seconds later, the switches were moved back to “run”.

The report also suggests the pilots were aware the engines had shut down and attempted to restart them. Despite their effort, the engines couldn’t restart in time.

We don’t know what the pilots did

Flight data recorders don’t capture pilot actions. They record system responses and sensor data, which can sometimes lead to the belief they’re an accurate representation of the pilot’s actions in the cockpit.

While this is true most of the time, this is not always the case.

In my own work investigating safety incidents, I’ve seen cases in which automated systems misinterpreted inputs. In one case, a system recorded a pilot pressing the same button six times in two seconds, something humanly impossible. On further investigation, it turned out to be a faulty system, not a real action.

We cannot yet rule out the possibility that system damage or sensor error led to false data being recorded. We also don’t know whether the pilots unintentionally flicked the switches to “cutoff”. And we may never know.

As we also don’t have a camera in the cockpit, any interpretation of pilots’ actions will be made indirectly, usually through the data sensed by the aircraft and the conversation, sound and noise captured by the environmental microphone available in the cockpit.

We don’t have the full conversation between the pilots

Perhaps the most confusing clue in the report was an excerpt of a conversation between the pilots. It says:

This short exchange is entirely without context. First, we don’t know who says what. Second, we don’t know when the question was asked – after takeoff, or after the engine started to lose power? Third, we don’t know the exact words used, because the excerpt in the report is paraphrased.

Finally, we don’t know whether the exchange referred to the engine status or the switch position. Again, we may never know.

What’s crucial here is that the current available evidence doesn’t support any theory about intentional fuel cutoff by either of the pilots. To say otherwise is unfounded speculation.

We don’t know if there was a mechanical failure

The preliminary report indicates that, for now, there are no actions required by Boeing, General Electric or any company that operates the Boeing 787-8 and/or GEnx-1B engine.

This has led some to speculate that a mechanical failure has been ruled out. Again, it is far too early to conclude that.

What the preliminary report shows is that the investigation team has not found any evidence to suggest the aircraft suffered a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention or suspension of operations around the world.

This could be because there was no catastrophic failure. It could also be because the physical evidence has been so badly damaged that investigators will need more time and other sources of evidence to learn what happened.

Why we must resist premature conclusions

In the aftermath of an accident, there is much at stake for many people: the manufacturer of the aircraft, the airline, the airport, civil aviation authority and others. The families of the victims understandably demand answers.

It’s also tempting to latch onto a convenient explanation. But the preliminary report is not the full story. It’s based on very limited data, analysed under immense pressure, and without access to every subsystem or mechanical trace.

The final report is still to come. Until then, the responsible position for regulators, experts and the public is to withhold judgement.

This tragedy reminds us that aviation safety depends on patient and thorough investigation – not media soundbites or unqualified expert commentary. We owe it to the victims and their families to get the facts right, not just fast.

It will harmonise emissions calculation methodology, data reporting, and emissions display for all airlines in the EU. And when booking flights, passengers will be able to see standardised emissions information derived from data from actual flight performance.

To prepare for the FEL’s wider implementation, EASA has inked a new memorandum of cooperation with Air France-KLM that will see the airline group provide “valuable insights to help us shape, refine, and optimize the scheme,” EASA executive director Florian Guillermet explains. Air France and KLM will each assess and test EASA’s new FEL portal, provide emissions-related data and participate in an EASA-guided onboarding process, among other tasks, before formally participating in the FEL.

“Air France-KLM is committed to ensuring a true global level playing field,” says Air France-KLM CEO Benjamin Smith. “We are proactively collaborating with the European Commission and EASA, bringing our expertise to the forefront of initiatives like the EU Flight Emissions Label.

“Our early and active participation is designed to help shape a fair, transparent, and effective framework for all airlines. This initiative is a critical component of our broader strategy to lead the decarbonisation of our industry. We will continue to leverage every available tool to reduce our environmental footprint, and we believe that common, transparent standards are essential to support our collective journey towards sustainable aviation.”

By voluntarily participating early in the process, Air France-KLM will benefit from early access to the label’s results and methodologies, as well as reporting and validation processes, adds EASA.

Whilst airlines from both EU and non-EU countries are welcome to voluntarily join the FEL, only those airlines that have joined are allowed to display emissions to their passengers in the EU, under the law. As such, airlines are being encouraged to join the FEL if they want to display flight emissions and use these estimates when offering SAF or other emissions offsets to passengers.

A dedicated logo, displayed alongside flight emissions data, will guarantee that the information is reliable, helping to protect passengers from greenwashing claims, according to the EC. And since the estimations are based on actual consumption data, it will also encourage airlines to operate more efficiently and sustainably, it says.

This week, Geelong Refinery successfully processed 10 tonnes of tyre pyrolysis oil alongside crude oil toproduce a full range of fuels and products. This follows the refinery processing a similar quantity of pyrolysis oil derived from waste plastic in May, demonstrating its capability to process at scale oils made from waste and the critical role the facility will play in Australia's sustainable future.

The development is a significant step in plans to establish tyre-recycling in Melbourne. For this demonstration, the tyre pyrolysis oil was imported from Poland with appropriate approvals from the Australian Government - it is currently not available domestically.

Earlier this year, Viva Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with Klean Industries, a Canadian resource recovery and advanced recycling provider, to study the potential to create a tyre-recycling facility in Melbourne capable of processing up to 80,000 tonnes of used tyres per year.

The recycling facility proposed by Klean would extract three products from tyres: recovered carbon black (rCB), steel, and biogenic pyrolysis oil. Under the agreement, Viva Energy would take the biogenic pyrolysis oil for processing at Geelong Refinery, allowing it to create lower-carbon intensity fuels.

Viva Energy's successful processing of tyre pyrolysis oil not only signals progress for Australia's own sustainable fuel industry, but also brings the country in line with global efforts to advance circular economies.

Tyre pyrolysis oil is already recognised in the EU as a low-carbon alternative to traditional fuels and feedstocks. Australia currently does not recognise lower-carbon fuels made via co-processing, meaning the associated carbon reduction benefits cannot be claimed by Viva Energy's customers.

That is something that could change with the right policy settings, according to Viva Energy Chief Strategy Officer Lachlan Pfeiffer.

""The refinery's ability to process pyrolysis oil from both tyres and waste plastic demonstrates the versatility of our facility and our commitment to supporting a lower-carbon future,"" Mr Pfeiffer said. ""Viva Energy is proud to play a role in the production of lower-carbon fuels and products and reduce the number of tyres that go into landfill. The project can only proceed if the regulatory landscape encourages businesses to progress these important initiatives.""

It is a sentiment supported by Lina Goodman, CEO of Tyre Stewardship Australia, who said the processing of tyre pyrolysis oil at Geelong Refinery is a significant step forward in demonstrating the potential of end-of-life tyres as a valuable resource.

""Tyre pyrolysis oil is increasingly recognised internationally, particularly in the EU, as a low-carbon alternative,"" she said. ""We welcome initiatives that showcase the viability of these solutions at scale that extract value from end-of-life tyres and support the transition to a more sustainable, low-emissions future for Australia.""

Viva Energy's successful refinement of tyre pyrolysis oil, produced using Klean Industries' advanced thermal conversion technology, marks a significant milestone for the circular economy in Australia, according to Jesse Klinkhamer, Klean Industries Inc.

""This achievement not only confirms the quality and compatibility of our recovered oils with existing refining infrastructure but also demonstrates the commercial viability of converting end-of-life tyres into high-value, low-carbon fuels and chemicals. It's a crucial step forward in fulfilling Klean Industries' vision of establishing a fully integrated resource recovery and low-carbon fuel production facility in Melbourne, Australia,"" he said.

Стратегія декарбонізації авіації та відповідність вимогам ЄС

Запровадження SAF у портфелі ORLEN стало важливим етапом для досягнення цілей вуглецевої нейтральності в авіаційній галузі. Розширення асортименту продукції відображає зростаючий попит на декарбонізацію з боку авіаперевізників та відповідає сучасним викликам щодо зниження впливу на довкілля. Окрім цього, ORLEN дотримується положень Регламенту ЄС ReFuel, який передбачає, що вже у 2025 році частка біопалива в авіаційному секторі має бути не меншою за 2% від загального обсягу реактивного палива.

Масштаби впровадження SAF та міжнародна підтримка

Регламент ReFuel охоплює ті аеропорти Європейського союзу, які упродовж минулого року обслужили понад 800 тисяч пасажирів та опрацювали 100 тисяч тонн вантажу. Використання SAF у таких масштабах сприяє зменшенню вуглецевого сліду від авіаперевезень та відповідає сучасним екологічним стандартам.

“Як стало відомо раніше, не менше 43 авіакомпаній вже взяли на себе зобов’язання використати близько 13 млн тонн SAF у 2030 році, при цьому регулярно оголошується і про нові угоди щодо постачання”.

Основною сировиною для виробництва SAF залишається використана кулінарна олія, що підкреслює екологічність нового виду пального. Зростання кількості підписаних контрактів між постачальниками та авіакомпаніями свідчить про поступове впровадження сталих практик у сфері авіаційного транспорту.

This can be largely attributed to significant volatility in Brent crude prices due to substantial geopolitical tensions.

At the beginning of June, Ukraine conducted a surprise drone attack on several Russian airbases. Additionally, nuclear talks between the United States and Iran stalled, and Israel launched airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear sites. Iran retaliated with drone strikes, and Iranian parliamentarians started preparing a bill to withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, causing oil prices to rise.

Towards the end of the month, the US conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. But investors saw no immediate impact on physical oil flows, and the intensity of Iran’s response appeared to subside. On the 24 June, President Trump announced that a ceasefire had been agreed, and oil prices marked their sharpest two-day decline since 2022, at 13%.

GBP appreciated from US$1.355 to US$1.370 in June, reaching its highest level since October 2021. The US dollar continued to weaken after President Trump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%.

Furthermore, he insisted that the US Federal Reserve must lower interest rates, but the central bank held them between 4.25% and 4.5%. Consequently, there has been speculation that Trump will announce a successor to Chair Jerome Powell by September.

Meanwhile, Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey suggested that Trump has “blown up” the multilateral trade system that underpins the global economy, stating that the path of interest rates remains uncertain. BoE opted to maintain rates at 4.25%, amid persistent inflation.

Recent economic data showed that the UK’s private sector is still expanding, albeit marginally, and the International Monetary Fund upgraded the UK’s 2025 growth outlook. Finally, the government released a new Industrial Strategy, including a decade-long plan to increase investment and support UK industries, causing the pound to strengthen further.

GBP closed over 1% higher than the beginning of the month, leading to a c.0.47ppl reduction in UK wholesale diesel.

Wholesale UK renewable diesel (HVO) prices increased from 109.5ppl towards 130ppl before closing the month at 121ppl (excluding duty and RTFC benefit), due to tightening supply and increased demand.

The US Energy Information Administration lowered its forecast for HVO production in 2025 from 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 210,000bpd. Additionally, US renewable diesel production declined, despite stronger exports to Canada earlier in June.

On the demand side, UK imports of used cooking oil (UCO) reached their highest level since December 2024, following increased inflows from the Netherlands. In China, UCO prices reached multi-year highs on sustained demand from domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers.

However, EU imports of UCO hit a five-month low as intake from China slowed, despite expectations that the US-China tariff announcements would increase flows to Europe.

In other news, the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification system has published 18 proposals for improving biofuel certification under the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, after facing criticisms and widespread industry concern over the alleged fraud in the biofuel and feedstock supply chain.

Those previous complaints include the mislabelling of biofuels, including fake biofuels and biofuels made from virgin vegetable oil feedstocks but labelled as waste-based fuels. The EU has since launched the Union Database for Biofuels to track the supply chain from feedstock generation to end-use.

Finally, the cost of blending biodiesel to the UK B7 specification remained unchanged at just below 7.5ppl throughout the month, and thus the cost of Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation stayed the same.

Meanwhile, the price of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) declined fractionally from 25.7 pence per certificate to around 25p, slightly reducing the benefit that HVO consumers received (assuming 100% of the RTFC benefit is passed on the end-user).",https://www.route-one.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/07/Portland-column-July-2025-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:01:55.270543

As India emerges as a global logistics hub, forward-thinking leadership becomes critical in shaping resilient and digitally empowered air cargo ecosystems.","The Air Cargo Forum India (ACFI) concluded its annual conclave at the Taj Palace, New Delhi. The mega gathering consisted of delegates from leading corporations in Air logistics, policymakers, and prominent think tanks from India and abroad. The conclave was themed “Air Cargo Leadership in a Changing World.” It focused on four key themes: resilience through innovation, sustainable and green cargo infrastructure, express logistics and e-commerce acceleration, cargo security, regulations, and risk management.

Sanjiv Edward, President, ACFI and CEO – Cargo and Logistics, GMR Group, chaired the inaugural session. The other participants were Arun Kumar, Honorary Secretary ACFI and Managing Director, Infinity Supply Chain Solutions Pvt Ltd, Avinash Razdan, Honorary Treasurer, Group CEO – CSC Group (Delhi Cargo Service Center), Karanjit Singh Wadhwa, Chairman, ACFI Event Management and Director, Grace Group, Satish Lakkaraju, Board Member, ACFI and CEO, Nexgen Logistics Pvt Ltd, Glyn Hughes, Director General, TIACA, Piyush Srivastava, Senior Economic Adviser, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Dheeraj Rastogi, Principal Commissioner of Customs, Delhi Customs and Ramesh Mamidala, Head Cargo Commercial, Air India Ltd.

In his presidential address, Edward said the cargo stood at a pivotal historical moment. He said that India was no longer a silent facilitator of global trade. The air cargo industry has emerged as a strategic enabler of economic growth. India was at the forefront of this global transformation. India’s ambition in logistics has shifted from incremental change to leapfrogging for the future, where the Indian air cargo sector becomes an international benchmark. In concluding remarks, he said, “Together let us rise to this moment, when air cargo soars, India roars. And when India awakens, the world looks at us.”

The Chief Guest of Honour, Rastogi, emphasised the need to ensure compliance with a host of laws governing goods entering or exiting India, both speedily and efficiently. At the same time, measures should be taken to protect the country from unlawful intrusions of cargo. The strategy in the past decade had been to automate most of the tasks in the chain. The process started with digitalisation and graduated into the integration of stakeholders. Subsequently, there was the emergence of SWIFT, followed by eSANCHIT and the development of the risk management system. This ensured that we focused on noncompliance and, at the same time, facilitated the compliant trade.

The second Chief Guest of Honour, Srivastava, said that the global geopolitical situation would not improve for quite some time. India needed to be ready for this disruption through innovation and technology. He conceded that this change was difficult. The demand could be instant and unpredictable, but ramping up the supply took time. He felt it was necessary to concentrate on disruptive changes. They were inevitable and part of the system. The aviation sector is undergoing many changes and may not be the same 20 years down the line.

Glyn Hughes, Director General of TIACA, said that in 2025, the industry faced one of the biggest challenges as trade policy was dictated by the world’s largest economy, which sought to unravel the success of the last three decades. We could not afford to rewind the success, which was why the event’s theme was crucial and apt.

On this occasion, ACFI signed an MoU with TIACA to strengthen global collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Further, ACFI and ASCELA Insights released the knowledge paper ‘India’s Air Cargo Horizon—Seizing Global Reroutes, Regional Dominance and Resilience’, unveiling a transformative vision to position India as a global air cargo hub.

The first Business Session was themed, From Turbulence to Triumph – India’s Air Cargo Rise in a New World Order. Ramesh Mamidala moderated the session. The participants included Mark Sutch, Chief Commercial Officer – CarGo International, IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd), Suvendu Choudhury, Vice President, Operations Planning & Engineering, India, FedEx, and Rajkumar S, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Sequel Logistics Private Limited. Himanshu Pant, Managing Director & CEO, MGH Group, and Vineet Malhotra, Director, Kale Logistics.

Dwelling on the session’s theme, Sutch said that the next twelve months would be highly uncertain due to the regional geopolitical situation. But he felt that the air cargo industry was very resilient. The industry was able to tide over the Red Sea crisis, even though the crisis has not abated.

The second Business Session was on the Tech-Driven Cargo: Accelerating Express, E-Commerce & Data-Led Operations. The Moderator was Lakkaraju. The panellists were Joyce Tai, Executive Vice President, Freightos; Cyrus Katgara, Partner, Jeena & Company; Rajesh Menon, Regional Head of Cargo for South Asia, Middle East, and Africa, Cathay Cargo; Ravinder Kumar Pathri, Managing Director, Sales, FedEx, Alok Kumar Singh, Lead Logistics, Tata Electronics and Parvinder Singh, Managing Director, Hans Informatics.

Pathri discusses the progression of technology in his company. He explains that the device they had created measures the real-time visibility of sensitive cargo. It would give real-time information about the package to the minute. The device could monitor temperature, provide stock information, humidity, light exposure, and track compliance. FedEx was planning to be carbon neutral by 2040.

The third Business Session dwelt on Business Session Green Corridors & Sustainable Trade Lane – Air Cargo’s ESG Imperative. The session was moderated by Keku Bomi Gazder, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Aviapro Logistics Services Pvt Ltd. The engaging panellists were Anupama Kachhap, Head of Commercial, WFS Bengaluru Private Limited, Glyn Hughes, Director General, TIACA, and Kadhir Kadhiravan, Dy. Chief Executive Officer, GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd, Dinkar Singh, Director, Public Affairs, Indian Subcontinent, UPS, and Devi James Melchoir, Senior Vice President – Logistics, Indev Infra Private Limited.

Hughes, dwelling on the theme, said that five years ago, sustainability was a subject that was not talked about in conferences. This has now changed. There are now discussions on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The aviation industry is expected to be net zero by 2050. Globally, SAF production would account for about 1% of the fuel needs this year, costing more than 3 times the regular fuel. It was estimated that the world would need about 8000 refineries to produce the fuel required, which would require significant investments from the Government. It would also call for a firm commitment from the aviation sector.

The fourth and concluding Business Session was themed on Securing India’s Cargo Future: Compliance, Risk and Resilience by Design. The session was conducted by Yashpal Sharma, Chairman and Managing Director, Skyways Group. The participants in the discussion were Keku Bomi Gazder, Managing Director & CEO, Aviapro Logistics Services Pvt. Ltd, P Balasubramanium, Founder & CEO, Air Cargo Consultancy International Services (ACCIS), Rajesh Menon is the Regional Head of Cargo for South Asia, Middle East, and Africa (SAMEA), Dr Ravi Prakash Mathur, Head – Global Freight and Projects, Apollo Tyres Ltd, Kiran Jain, COO, Noida International Airport, Giridharan Srinivasan, Area General Manager – Indian Subcontinent, Commercial, Etihad Cargo and Faizabad Ahmed, Vice President, ICICI Lombard

Yash asked Giridharan about the risks involved in the logistics industry. He responded that new-age risks are constantly evolving. Today, cyber risk is one of the most significant risks encountered by the industry. Yet, people do not have answers to resolve this huge liability.
