The overhaul is part of the stalled revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, first adopted in 2003 to set EU-wide minimum excise rates.

The move would postpone taxation until 2035 and extend the long-standing tax breaks enjoyed by these sectors.

The draft, prepared under Denmark’s rotating EU presidency, would only impose minimum taxation before 2035 on small aircraft with up to 19 seats and on private pleasure boats. Larger airlines and shipping companies would remain exempt during the decade-long transition. Negotiators are scheduled to debate the text in Brussels on Friday, with the presidency aiming for a deal by November.

The overhaul is part of the stalled revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, first adopted in 2003 to set EU-wide minimum excise rates. The European Commission’s Green Deal proposal in 2021 sought to phase in fuel taxation across transport sectors, but repeated pushback from governments has delayed progress.

Industry groups have mounted intensive lobbying campaigns. Airlines argue that without tax relief, uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will remain minimal because it currently costs two to five times more than conventional kerosene. Shipping operators make a similar case for renewable marine fuels, citing both high production costs and supply bottlenecks, according to Euractiv.

The Commission’s own assessments note that ending exemptions could generate billions in revenue while providing incentives for cleaner fuels. Still, countries heavily dependent on tourism and maritime trade remain cautious, warning that higher transport costs could weaken growth.

Because EU tax policy requires unanimous approval, any one member state could block the draft. Diplomats involved in the talks told Reuters that northern states are more inclined to support taxation, while southern tourism economies remain strongly resistant.

Delta Air Lines DAL also featured in the news, courtesy of its decision to add two routes to European destinations from Boston as it aims to bolster its European network. Meanwhile, Frontier Airlines ULCC plans to add 20 new routes to its schedule from late fall, aiming to strengthen its position in the ultra-low-cost segment.

Alaska Air Group ALK, the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, meanwhile, signed an environment-friendly deal with Cosmo Oil Marketing. An expansion-related update was also available from Southwest Airlines LUV over the past week.

Recap of the Most Recent Important Stories

1. At Allegiant Travel, the July scheduled traffic (measured in revenue passenger miles) rose 10.3% from the July 2024 levels. Capacity (measured in available seat miles) for scheduled service rose 11.5% year over year. Although traffic improved on a year-over-year basis, it failed to outpace capacity expansion. As a result, the load factor (percentage of seats filled by passengers) in July 2025 declined to 86.6% from 87.5% a year ago.

For the total system (including scheduled service and fixed-fee contracts), Allegiant carried 10.1% more passengers in July 2025 than in the same period of the previous year. System-wide capacity improved 10.8% in July 2025 on a year-over-year basis.

2. Expanding Boston’s gateway to Europe, Delta announced that it will start new nonstop service from Boston to Madrid and Nice. While flights on the Boston-Madrid route will start operating from May 16, 2026, those connecting Boston and Nice will take to the skies from May 17. While the Boston-Madrid flights will operate daily, the ones on the Boston-Nice route will operate three times a week.

DAL will utilize its Airbus A330-900neo jets to operate on both routes. Following the addition of the new routes, Delta will serve 12 European destinations from Boston. DAL has been constantly looking to expand its presence in Boston, having nearly tripled its service in Boston in a span of two decades. Apart from the introduction of the new routes, DAL, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has also decided to expand its service on the Barcelona-Boston and Milan-Boston routes next year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

3. Following the sales agreement between Alaska Air and Cosmo Oil Marketing, Hawaiian Airlines intends to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel on flights between Osaka, Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii. Fuel deliveries at Kansai International Airport will mark the first time Hawaiian Airlines has introduced SAF. The use of SAF has the potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. Apart from highlighting ALK’s environment-friendly approach, the move is also aimed at strengthening tourism between Japan and Hawaii. Additional traffic on this tourist-friendly route is likely to buoy ALK’s top line.

4. Southwest Airlines has extended its flight schedule through June 3, 2026. The extended schedule includes more routes to new places. As part of the expansion, Southwest Airlines will operate flights to the island of St. Maarten, beginning April 7, 2026. The addition of St. Maarten marks LUV’s first new international destination since 2021. St. Maarten comprises two parts: the Netherlands' constituent country of Sint Maarten, alongside the French overseas collectivity of Saint-Martin. Southwest Airlines also announced an interline partnership with EVA Air, a subsidiary of the Evergreen Group, to expand seamless travel between Asia and North America. EVA Air is the third airline partner to be announced by the Dallas-based LUV.

5. Frontier Airlines has decided to bring its service to the top 20 metro areas in the United States. As part of the expansion exercise, ULCC has decided to add 20 new routes from Detroit, Houston, Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte and Dallas. Further growth is expected at ULCC next year. With many of the new routes overlapping with Spirit Airlines’ key markets, ULCC is likely to be a major gainer if Spirit Airlines collapses, according to a CNBC report. Spirit Airlines filed for bankruptcy last year. Despite an initial restructuring, the situation did not improve with Spirit warning last month that it may not survive another year without further cash infusions.

Airline Stocks’ Performance

The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last six months.

The proposal involves the creation of a multinational company with countries from Central America and the Caribbean, a measure that would not only address a shared environmental issue but also provide an alternative to the international obligation to reduce emissions from commercial flights.

The International Civil Aviation Organization established that airlines must progressively decarbonize their operations starting in 2027. In this context, the utilization of sargassum as a raw material emerges as a strategic opportunity. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) is driving the plan as part of the transition to a circular and low-carbon economy.

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel costs more than three times the price of conventional jet fuel. To narrow this gap, the state-owned company Airports and Auxiliary Services (ASA) has announced a multimillion-dollar investment to expand its plant in Cancun, where biofuel will be produced from waste oil and, in the future, from sargassum.

The project would allow for an energy use of one of the most problematic macroalgae in the Caribbean, which covers thousands of kilometers of beaches each year, generating significant environmental, economic, and social impacts. However, experts warn that fuel production alone does not solve the risks associated with its massive accumulation on the coasts.

**[Innovative solution to sargassum: seeking to turn it into sustainable fuel](https://noticiasambientales.com/medio-ambiente/mexico-convierte-el-sargazo-de-sus-playas-en-recurso-pesquero-para-mitigar-su-impacto-ambiental-y-turistico/)**

## An ecological alternative to harness this macroalgae

The utilization of sargassum as sustainable fuel is proposed as a promising alternative to convert an environmental liability into an energy opportunity. However, experts insist that the key lies in designing comprehensive policies: from safer collection systems to investments in research to better understand the cycle of this macroalgae.

In a scenario of global climate crisis, the challenge is not only to transform waste into energy but also to ensure that the solutions consider both environmental protection and the well-being of the communities that depend on the sea.

**[Sargassum environmental challenge in the Caribbean](https://noticiasambientales.com/innovacion/reinventando-el-sargazo-como-el-caribe-esta-convirtiendo-su-mayor-problema-ambiental-en-una-solucion-innovadora/)**

The uncontrolled arrival of sargassum in Mexico and other Caribbean countries has altered the dynamics of coastal ecosystems. The accumulation of tons of algae on beaches causes the death of fish, turtles, and corals by hindering water oxygenation and releasing toxic substances during decomposition. These processes deteriorate essential habitats for marine biodiversity.

The impact also affects human communities. In Quintana Roo, beach cleaning is largely done manually and under unsafe conditions for workers. The decomposition of sargassum produces gases that can cause respiratory and skin problems, turning collection into a health risk.

Furthermore, the presence of large volumes of algae directly affects tourism, the region’s main economic driver. Hotels and municipalities invest millions of pesos each season in removing sargassum, but the phenomenon continues to intensify due to climate change and pollution that fuels its proliferation in open sea.

The declaration of a national emergency, repeatedly requested, aims to ensure resources and federal-level coordination to tackle the problem. Without structural measures, the pressure on ecosystems and coastal communities will continue to increase.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/09/sargazo-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-09-01 16:56:09.653501

This article was curated together with Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) — India’s only durable carbon removal (CDR)-focused industry coalition.

India’s climate policy landscape is undergoing a pivotal transformation. Recent developments signal a shift from ambition to action, with foundational frameworks now taking shape across emissions management, carbon markets, international cooperation, and climate finance.

1. Mandatory Emission Intensity Targets For High-Emission Industries

The Government of India has issued draft rules under the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS), 2023, introducing mandatory Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity (GEI) targets for five hard-to-abate sectors: Aluminum, Iron & Steel, Petroleum Refineries, Petrochemicals, and Textiles. Entities that outperform their targets can earn tradable carbon credits, while those that underperform must purchase credits or face penalties.

This is a critical step toward operationalizing India’s carbon market and providing clarity to industry. The draft notification is open for public comments for 60 days from its publication.

2. India–Japan Joint Credit Mechanism (JCM): A Bilateral Boost For Decarbonization

India and Japan are reportedly finalizing a Joint Credit Mechanism (JCM) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, enabling Japanese firms to invest in and deploy carbon-reduction technologies in India to receive emission reduction credits. Target sectors include solar energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This partnership offers India a strategic opportunity to channel international finance into underdeveloped clean energy sectors (potentially including CDR) and leverage Japanese technical expertise. Read more on the India–Japan JCM here.

3. Climate Finance Taxonomy: A New Framework For Capital Allocation

India’s Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance has released a Draft Climate Finance Taxonomy, a landmark step toward aligning financial flows with climate goals. The taxonomy aims to guide investments into mitigation, adaptation, and transition activities.

4. The State of Punjab Begins Journey Towards Using Biochar Carbon Removal To Abate Air Pollution

The Carbon Removal India Alliance (CRIA) and GDi Partners, with support from the Punjab Development Commission, Open Philanthropy, and the Nand & Jeet Khemka Foundation, co-organized a pivotal convening in April on “Biochar for Crop Residue Management & Climate Resilience” in Punjab. The event featured a Biochar Developers Showcase and panel discussions on policy, scaling, and finance, fostering connections and collaborative pathways for large scale biochar adoption in Punjab. Please find the key takeaways from the discussion here.

Looking Ahead

These policy shifts mark a directional progress for India’s climate strategy. By embedding emissions intensity targets, enabling international credit mechanisms, laying the groundwork for climate-aligned finance, and climate resilient agricultural supply chains, India is creating the enabling environment needed for CDR to scale responsibly and equitably.

Since 2005, this modified aircraft – capable of flying with five engines – has played a vital role in developing cutting-edge engines such as the Trent 1000 and Pearl 10X.

It made history in 2021 by flying a Trent 1000 powered entirely by 100% sustainable aviation fuel and played a key role in the subsequent certification of its durability enhancement package, which will more than double time on wing.

Its final mission, completed in July 2025, supported the company’s Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) engine demonstrator, marking a significant step towards delivering more efficient and sustainable engines.

John Knight, director of test and experimental engineering within Rolls-Royce’s Engineering, Technology & Safety (ET&S) division, explained: “With more than 2,000 hours of testing under its belt, the Flying Test Bed has been a workhorse for us over the last 20 years, helping us push the boundaries on engine development.

“Whilst we say a fond farewell to our Queen of the Skies, we continue to innovate in testing with a combination of flying test beds, ground testing, and advanced digital modelling.”

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One FTB test with a difference took place in 2021, when it was used to test a Trent 1000 engine running on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, while its other three RB211 engines ran on “standard” jet fuel. The three-hour 54-minute flight from Tucson Airport, Arizona over Texas and New Mexico confirmed there were no engineering issues and was part of our wider, and now-completed, programme to confirm our in-production engines are compatible with 100% SAF.

Notably, this test was a key enabler to Virgin Atlantic’s world’s first transatlantic flight in 2023 using 100% SAF with a Trent 1000-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

This made Rolls-Royce the first jet engine manufacturer to publicly confirm all our in-production engines for long-haul aircraft and business jets are compatible with 100% SAF and was an important milestone for both Rolls-Royce and the wider aviation industry. It also provided further evidence of our commitment to becoming a net zero company by 2050 and supporting our customers to do the same.

At the time, Simon Burr, group director of ET&S, said: This is an important milestone, not just for Rolls-Royce, but also for the wider civil aerospace industry. We hope the success of these tests provides a level of technical validation that supports those who seek to invest in the production of 100% SAF going forward.”

UltraFan

From carbon/titanium fan blades to low-emission combustion systems, the FTB has been instrumental in validating UltraFan technologies under real-world conditions.

In 2014, a set of composite carbon/titanium (CTi) fan blades – designed for Advance and UltraFan engine designs – successfully took to the skies for the first time incorporated into the FTB, marking another major milestone for the programme.

More recently, the FTB has enabled Rolls-Royce to complete the latest phase of flight testing for its Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys). The insights gathered directly support UltraFan development by reducing risk and enhancing maturity of future combustion systems.

By testing these critical technologies in flight, the FTB ensures systems are ready for the next-generation of engines.

Pearl 10X

The FTB’s most noticeable test configuration came with the testing of the Pearl 10X. This engine is the third and most powerful member of the market-leading Pearl engine family for the business aviation market and has been optimised to exclusively power Dassault’s new flagship aircraft, the Falcon 10X. In order to complete its rigorous flight test programme, our teams had to design a bespoke pylon to enable it to sit on the FTB’s starboard wing, alongside two RB211s. On the port wing was a third RB211 and a Trent 1000, giving the FTB its unique and eye-catching five engine setup. While the cockpit contained engine controls for all five engines, the pilots focused on the RB211s and Trent 1000, while a Pearl 10X engine operator sat on the engineering deck next to the flight test engineer and controlled that engine, all the time maintaining continuous headset communication with the cockpit.

This testing programme showed the incredible flexibility of the aircraft, as well as the ingenuity of our people and partners to make the configuration work.",https://www.aero-mag.com/image-assets/273280ab777bccf9a0a3fa5a23fc7072.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 12:56:15.062101

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a critical tool in this transition, but its viability as a long-term investment hinges on balancing regulatory pressures, production scalability, and strategic corporate partnerships.

The Cost Conundrum of Green Mandates

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has been a vocal critic of policies that prioritize speed over feasibility. The EU’s mandate to import SAF from outside Europe, for instance, has been labeled “a great green scam” by IATA Director General Willie Walsh, who argues that the policy ignores the carbon footprint of transporting SAF across continents [1]. In 2025, SAF costs in Europe are 4.2 times higher than conventional jet fuel—a jump from 3.1 times in 2024—largely due to compliance fees imposed by suppliers under EU and UK regulations [2]. These fees, which IATA calls “profiteering,” have added $1.7 billion in costs to airlines this year alone [3].

The association warns that such mandates risk stifling innovation by diverting capital from research and development to compliance. IATA estimates that achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will require $4.7 trillion in investment, a figure that should not be inflated by policies that prioritize political expediency over economic realism [1].

Strategic Partnerships as a Path Forward

British Airways, however, offers a counterpoint to IATA’s skepticism. The airline has signed multi-year SAF supply agreements with companies like EcoCeres and Twelve, aiming to use at least 10% SAF by 2030 under the UK government’s mandate [4]. These partnerships leverage waste-based feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, to produce SAF with up to 80% lower lifecycle emissions than traditional jet fuel [4].

But British Airways’ strategy goes beyond procurement. The airline and its parent company, IAG, are co-investing in SAF production facilities to reduce costs and secure supply chains. This approach mirrors IATA’s call for government incentives over mandates, as private-sector investment can drive economies of scale. For example, British Airways’ parent company has committed to funding SAF plants that convert non-competitive feedstocks into fuel, a move that could lower production costs and increase availability [5].

Scalability Challenges and Market Realities

Despite these efforts, scalability remains a major hurdle. SAF currently accounts for just 0.7% of global airline fuel consumption in 2025, and production must increase exponentially to meet regulatory targets [3]. The industry faces three key constraints:

1. Feedstock Limitations: Waste-based biomass, the primary feedstock for SAF, is finite and often diverted from other renewable energy sectors [4].

2. Supply Chain Complexity: Producing SAF requires integrating disparate logistics networks for feedstock collection, refining, and distribution—a process that is both capital-intensive and geographically fragmented [2].

3. Cost Barriers: Even with co-investment, SAF remains 4.2 times more expensive than conventional fuel, deterring widespread adoption without subsidies [2].

Regulatory Dynamics: A Double-Edged Sword

The tension between mandates and incentives underscores a broader debate: Should regulators enforce strict SAF quotas, or should they prioritize market-driven solutions? IATA advocates for the latter, urging governments to harmonize global SAF policies to avoid a patchwork of conflicting regulations [3]. For instance, the EU’s focus on importing SAF has created a “carbon leakage” risk, where airlines shift operations to regions with laxer environmental rules [1].

British Airways’ experience suggests that a hybrid approach—combining targeted mandates with financial incentives—could work. The airline’s partnerships are supported by UK government grants for SAF infrastructure, illustrating how policy can align with private-sector goals [5].

Conclusion: Weighing Risks and Opportunities

For investors, SAF presents a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The sector’s growth is contingent on resolving three key questions:

1. Can production costs be slashed through technological innovation and scale?

2. Will governments shift from punitive mandates to incentive-based policies?

3. Can airlines like British Airways replicate their partnership models across the industry?

The answers will determine whether SAF becomes a cornerstone of aviation’s green transition or a cautionary tale of overambitious regulation. For now, the path forward requires a delicate balance—leveraging corporate innovation while pushing for regulatory frameworks that prioritize practicality over political theater.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 12:56:18.346636

– AU$100 million+ committed to SAF from the AU$400 million Climate Fund.","(SYDNEY) Qantas has stepped up its clean-fuel push with a run of 2025 moves that put sustainable aviation front and center on trans‑Tasman and long‑haul routes, while pressing Canberra for policy support to build a homegrown supply chain.

In May, working with Sydney Airport and Ampol, the carrier completed Australia’s largest-ever commercial importation of SAF, landing nearly 2 million litres of unblended SAF from Malaysia for blending and use in Sydney’s fuel system. The batch is being blended at about 18% with conventional jet fuel and is set to power roughly 900 Qantas and Jetstar flights between Sydney and Auckland. Qantas estimates those operations will cut about 3,400 tonnes of carbon dioxide—roughly the same as taking 800 cars off the road for a year—showing how targeted use of sustainable aviation fuel can deliver real, near-term cuts even as wider industry change takes time.

Recent commitments and operational context

Qantas says this is not a one-off. In August, the airline announced it will use more than 100 million litres of SAF per year from Los Angeles International Airport for the next three years, a major boost to its international uptake.

Over the past financial year (July 2024–June 2025), Qantas reported:

– Lower fuel costs overall but higher total fuel consumption.

– Average SAF use of 181 barrels per day (about 0.2% of total fuel burned), up 5% from 172 barrels per day the prior year.

This is a small share but represents a steady lift in a system that depends on strict testing, supply chain adjustments, and airport infrastructure.

Funding, partnerships and strategic goals

Qantas frames these steps as part of a broader climate plan anchored by its AU$400 million Climate Fund. More than AU$100 million from that pool is now directed at SAF and other decarbonisation work.

Key strategic elements:

– Scale up supply quickly where possible.

– Prove demand through real-world use on scheduled flights.

– Help build first local plants able to produce large volumes at competitive prices.

Notable investments and partnerships:

– In April 2025, Qantas and Airbus invested AU$15 million in Climate Tech Partners, a venture fund focused on early-stage SAF technologies.

– Sydney Airport signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Qantas targeting 50% of all fuel uplift at the airport coming from SAF by 2050.

Coalition building and demand signaling

Qantas leads a SAF coalition with 15 major Australian and global companies, including Australia Post, Accenture, ANZ, BCG, Commonwealth Bank, Deloitte, Fortescue, IMC, ING Australia, PwC Australia, Raytheon Australia, Sydney Airport, Woodside Energy, and Xero.

Many coalition members use a book‑and‑claim model—an accounting approach that lets them pay to support SAF used on certain flights even if their employees’ flights do not physically use that exact fuel. The aim is to speed demand signals while the physical supply chain catches up.

Targets and regulatory context

Public targets:

– 10% SAF in Qantas’s total fuel mix by 2030

– 60% by 2050

– Net Zero by 2050

These align with global aviation regulator direction and international mandates such as Europe’s ReFuelEU policy and the UK’s planned SAF mandate, which are raising blend levels and driving production targets.

Economic and national benefits of onshore production

Qantas argues onshore production could deliver broad national benefits:

– Potentially add about AU$13 billion to GDP per year by 2040

– Support around 13,000 jobs in feedstock supply

– Create about 5,000 roles at new facilities

Benefits include fuel security, turning local waste streams and sustainable crops into jet fuel to buffer against global oil shocks and supply bottlenecks. Fiona Messent, Qantas’s Chief Sustainability Officer, called SAF the airline’s most workable near-term decarbonisation tool, stressing jobs, resilience, and long-term cost control from building capacity onshore.

Airbus partnership and government asks

Airbus has become a close partner. Julie Kitcher, Airbus’s Chief Sustainability Officer, has said scaling SAF requires new ways of working across the sector and that Australia is well placed to lead.

Joint asks to government:

– Direct incentives and research grants for the first two to three domestic producers.

– Ongoing support for 10–15 years to lower investment risk and accelerate industry build-out.

Existing SAF contracts and passenger impact

SAF history and supply:

– Qantas began buying SAF in 2022 (London Heathrow and California).

– Current contracts supply around 10 million litres/year from Heathrow and 20 million litres/year from California.

– New Los Angeles commitment: >100 million litres/year for three years (starting 2025).

Passenger experience:

– The shift is largely invisible to passengers: blended fuel meets strict standards, burns cleanly in existing engines, and requires no changes to aircraft hardware.

How SAF is processed and delivered at Sydney

The process at Sydney follows a clear chain:

1. Importation: Unblended SAF arrives at a local terminal such as Ampol’s Kurnell facility.

2. Blending: SAF is mixed with conventional jet fuel at about 18%.

3. Testing and Certification: Strict lab testing and certification to meet aviation standards.

4. Distribution: Certified blend enters the airport’s supply network and is loaded onto aircraft.

5. Usage and Reporting: Airlines use the blend on scheduled flights and track emissions savings.

This May shipment will power about 900 Sydney–Auckland flights, providing a pilot large enough to deliver measurable emissions cuts and to prove operational readiness.

Scale-up: from imports to industry build‑out

Qantas’s Climate Fund (AU$400 million) plus AU$100 million+ directed to SAF aims to bridge early pilots and steady supply.

The airline’s pitch to government:

– Focus support on a limited number of first producers to reach commercial output sooner.

– Align Australia with the US and Europe, where public policy already drives early SAF plants.

Analysis from VisaVerge.com notes that markets with long-term support attract the first commercial refineries, while late movers face higher catch-up costs or continued import reliance.

Regional economic and workforce impacts

Qantas forecasts:

– AU$13 billion annual GDP boost by 2040

– Roughly 18,000 combined jobs across feedstock and facilities

Skills needed range from chemical engineering and quality control to logistics and project finance, requiring training programs and regional planning to match plant build-outs.

Policy stakes and recommendations

Industry position:

– Targeted production incentives

– Support for research and early engineering

– Clear, bankable rules lasting 10–15 years

Environmental groups welcome momentum but urge:

– Faster action

– Robust feedstock rules to ensure sustainability and prevent competition with food production

For a plain-language primer on SAF from international sources, see the U.S. Department of Energy: Sustainable Aviation Fuel: https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/sustainable-aviation-fuel

Market dynamics and corporate demand

Corporate travel buyers are monitoring SAF closely; many have emissions goals and can use book‑and‑claim to support SAF now.

As volumes grow, corporations will expect broader physical access to blended fuel and routes covered by SAF, including across Asia.

Qantas’s coalition provides a forum to coordinate demand and share costs to keep the early market viable.

Technical, logistical and safety considerations

The May import shows the detailed nuts-and-bolts required:

– Import paperwork, blending, lab testing, certification, and on‑airport distribution must align.

– Each step includes safety checks to ensure blended fuel meets global standards.

– Operational data from the Sydney–Auckland flights will help engineers and teams refine processes before larger volumes arrive.

Airports and energy companies will need hardware upgrades as blends rise:

– Storage tanks, pipelines, and blending equipment must meet safety and quality rules.

– Sydney’s early moves, supported by Ampol, indicate upgrades are manageable with planning.

Timeline and next milestones

Planned and expected developments:

– Planned biofuel facilities in Queensland and New Zealand, with output expected around 2028.

– To reach 10% SAF by 2030, local plants must feed major Australian airports within a few years, complementing imports.

– Australian government may announce production incentives and R&D backing within 12–18 months—policy certainty would help final investment decisions.

Summary — headline numbers and outlook

Key figures:

– Nearly 2 million litres of unblended SAF imported into Sydney (May 2025).

– Blended at about 18%, supporting roughly 900 flights and trimming ~3,400 tonnes of CO2.

– Qantas SAF average: 181 barrels per day in 2024–25 (up 5% year on year).

– >100 million litres/year locked in from Los Angeles for three years.

– AU$100 million+ committed to SAF from the AU$400 million Climate Fund.

– AU$15 million invested with Airbus into a venture fund for early-stage tech.

– MoU with Sydney Airport aimed at 50% SAF uplift by 2050.

These moves will not deliver net zero overnight but show a practical path to cutting aviation emissions while protecting long‑haul connectivity. If government policy supports the first local plants with incentives and R&D backing, Australia could transition from buyer of imported blends to regional producer—supporting jobs, fuel security, and more affordable SAF over time.

For travelers: aircraft, pilots and safety standards remain the same — the change is in the tanks.

IATA says that replacing jet kerosene with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can reduce these emissions by up to 80%.

For the first time, An Air France Airbus A220 has completed a delivery flight to Paris using SAF and Airbus issued official sustainability credentials for SAF to a customer.

The companies are both working to support the growth of SAF in their own operations and its wider development.

Airbus says this ferry flight represented more than 25 tonnes of reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels.

Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM, says: “Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonisation of aviation.

“Combining the two is only logical and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s.

“Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game-changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress.”

How Airbus aircraft use SAF

The A220, and all Airbus aircraft, are capable of operating with 50% SAF.

By 2030, all Airbus aircraft and helicopters will be capable of flying with up to 100% SAF.

The A220 delivered to Air France came from Airbus’ Mirabel site in Canada where SAF management is done using mass balance.

""In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO₂ emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,"" said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada.

""And we're pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year.

“On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.""

Air France’s first A220-300s are part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft and began flying in its network in October 2021.

Alongside the capability to use SAF, these aircraft can deliver up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO₂ emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft.

Airbus has been using SAF in its operations for nearly a decade and has committed to increasing the share of SAF used to power its internal operations to at least 30% by 2030.

As of 2025, all five Airbus delivery centres around the world can offer aircraft deliveries with SAF to its customers.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/29e5fa783c256b37cb6559bcf5880c36:4801f78b701f14595a2ee321f56981fe/1756129192370.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 11:56:22.515436

Platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM bring all that information together, helping operators shift from reactive fixes to proactive decisions that save time and money.
Hackers have started targeting building systems because they can be entry points to larger networks.
The rise of platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM reflects that change.","Commercial real estate is changing fast. What used to be a world of static systems and manual oversight is now shifting toward data-driven, automated environments. In 2025, that shift is only going to accelerate. Technology like edge computing and machine learning isn’t just for tech-forward developers anymore — it’s becoming the baseline for efficient, resilient buildings.

1. Edge computing: Decisions made on the spot

Think of edge computing as putting the “brain” of a building closer to where things happen. Instead of sending every piece of data to a remote server, the system processes much of it on-site.

Why does that matter? Because it lets buildings react in real time. Air conditioning adjusts when a meeting room fills up. Lighting dims as natural sunlight floods in. And if a sensor notices a mechanical issue, the system can trigger maintenance alerts immediately instead of waiting for overnight data syncing.

The bonus? It also cuts bandwidth use and keeps more sensitive building data in-house, which is increasingly important as cybersecurity standards tighten.

2. Machine learning: From numbers to action

Every modern building generates more data than most teams know what to do with. Machine learning changes that by spotting patterns humans can’t.

Over time, these systems learn what “normal” looks like for a specific building. They can flag subtle signs of equipment wear or tweak schedules for elevators and HVAC to better match actual use. Platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM bring all that information together, helping operators shift from reactive fixes to proactive decisions that save time and money.

It’s interesting to see how these tools change throughout time. The algorithms alter when tenant behavior changes or occupancy changes, so the building maintains working smoothly without anyone having to manually update every setting.

3. Regulations pushing smarter systems

New energy and emissions rules are showing up everywhere, from major cities to smaller municipalities. For CRE operators, that means keeping closer tabs on how buildings perform and proving compliance with hard data.

Smart systems simplify that. Real-time energy dashboards and automated reports turn what used to be weeks of manual checks into a streamlined process. For operators, it’s less about chasing compliance and more about using that same data to cut costs and improve sustainability scores — a win on both sides.

4. Making buildings feel better

Tenants don’t care about “edge nodes” or “ML models” — they just want spaces that work. Smart buildings are starting to deliver on that.

Imagine walking into your office and finding your preferred temperature already set. Or an app that tells you where the nearest meeting room is. These aren’t simply neat new items; they’re small, useful things that make buildings nicer and easier to get about.

And operators don’t have to step in all the time because the systems handle a lot of the fine-tuning in the background.

5. Cybersecurity: The quiet backbone

With more connected devices comes more risk. Hackers have started targeting building systems because they can be entry points to larger networks.

That’s why CRE operators are putting money into rigorous access controls, encryption, and networks that don’t trust anyone. These changes aren’t very spectacular, but they are incredibly necessary. Tenants want to know that their safety and information aren’t at risk because of systems that aren’t effectively safeguarded.

6. Breaking down system silos

Older buildings often run HVAC, lighting, and security on completely separate platforms. Integrating those systems used to be expensive and clunky. Now, open APIs and standardized protocols make it possible to connect them without replacing everything.

That means operators can get a full view of building performance — and make changes faster — while avoiding the cost of ripping out legacy systems.

7. Maintenance before breakdowns

One of the most practical benefits of smarter buildings is predictive maintenance. Instead of waiting for equipment to fail, sensors flag small changes that suggest trouble ahead — a slight vibration in a pump, or unusual motor temperatures.

Addressing these issues early avoids costly breakdowns and keeps tenants happier because downtime is rare. Over time, it also extends the lifespan of expensive systems, saving operators money.

8. Preparing for the unexpected

Resilience is becoming more and more important because of things like bad weather and power disruptions. Smart systems are also making things better here.

In an emergency, automated systems can adjust the flow of electricity, turn off systems that aren’t needed, or help people get to safety. Microgrids and on-site energy storage can keep vital services running even if the main grid goes down. It’s the kind of planning that helps when things don’t go as planned.

9. People first, tech second

A move toward human-centered design is what connects all of these themes. Technology is finally becoming invisible, operating in the background to make buildings safer, more efficient, and more comfortable.

The rise of platforms like Smart Building Platform – CIM reflects that change. These technologies do more than just crunch figures; they help teams administer their buildings in a way that seems natural and responsive, not overbearing or too complicated.

Conclusion

The smartest buildings won’t have the most sensors or the most impressive dashboards by 2025. They’ll be the ones that make things go more smoothly, cut down on energy waste, and develop places that people really like.

Edge computing will keep decisions local and fast. Machine learning will help us make sense of all the data we have. Regulations can be a pain, but they will make the sector use better, more environmentally friendly methods. If operators are willing to accept this change, they will get facilities that are efficient, flexible, and ready for whatever comes next.",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/skyline.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 11:56:32.811824

Strategic Investment in Clean Aviation Technology

Qantas has said that sustainability remains a ‘key priority’ for the airline group, adding that it has committed more than AU$100 million to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other decarbonisation projects. The investment represents a substantial commitment from the carrier as it works toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, aligning with the broader aviation industry’s ambitious climate targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The Australian carrier recently expanded its SAF uptake from Los Angeles, with a commitment to use more than 100 million litres of SAF over the next three years. This commitment forms part of a broader strategy that includes sourcing SAF from multiple international locations, including London’s Heathrow Airport and California-based suppliers.

In addition to direct fuel procurement, Qantas said that it also recently invested AU$15 million in ClimateTech Partners, a venture capital fund that supports climate-focused businesses and projects. This strategic investment demonstrates the airline’s commitment to fostering innovation across the broader sustainable aviation ecosystem.

Building Australia’s Domestic SAF Industry

One of the most significant aspects of Qantas’s sustainability strategy involves developing a local sustainable aviation fuel supply chain. On the domestic front, a partnership with Sydney Airport and a number of large corporate customers enabled the ‘largest ever importation of SAF into the country’, Qantas said, a move that served as a test of Sydney’s fuel infrastructure and demonstrated industry commitment in developing a local SAF supply chain, as well as supportive policy to enable greater SAF production in Australia.

The Qantas Group and Airbus will invest up to US$200 million to accelerate the establishment of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Australia in a landmark agreement. Due to the lack of a local commercial-scale SAF industry, Australia is currently exporting millions of tonnes of feedstock every year, such as canola and animal tallow to be made into SAF in other countries.

The airline has also made strategic investments in domestic production facilities. Agricultural by-products including sugarcane will be turned into jet fuel through investment from the Qantas Group, Airbus and the Queensland Government, at a Queensland biofuel production facility being developed by Jet Zero Australia in partnership with leading sustainable aviation fuel technology company LanzaJet. This facility is expected to produce up to 100 million litres of SAF annually once operational.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel Technology

Sustainable feedstocks include wastes for which the carbon has already been accounted in the use of the primary product or has been absorbed from the atmosphere in its production. Sustainable feedstocks are broken down through chemical processing before being built back up into a long chain hydro-carbon – making a sustainable jet fuel.

Sustainable fuels cut greenhouse gas emissions by around 80 per cent compared to traditional kerosene and are the most significant tool airlines currently have to reduce their impact on the environment – particularly given they can be used in today’s engines with no modifications. This compatibility with existing aircraft technology makes SAF a crucial bridge solution as the aviation industry develops longer-term zero-emission technologies.

Comprehensive Carbon Reduction Strategy

Beyond SAF investments, Qantas has restructured its approach to carbon offsetting. Qantas has also made adjustments to its Voluntary Carbon Program, with some 70% of its carbon portfolio now comprised of nature-based products, and half of that linked to an Australia-based project. This shift reflects growing industry recognition of the importance of high-quality carbon credits and local environmental benefits.

The airline has also expanded its community engagement initiatives. Elsewhere, Qantas has also expanded its community partnerships, signing a new four-year agreement with Surf Life Saving Australia and a three-year partnership with the Australian Red Cross, as well as donating some AU$2 million in grants to regional community groups.

Strong Financial Performance Underpins Sustainability Investment

The group reported a 15% increase in underlying profit before tax for the full year, to AU$2.39 billion, and said that it expects ‘ongoing strong travel demand’ into at least the first half of its current financial year. This robust financial performance provides Qantas with the resources necessary to invest heavily in sustainability initiatives during a critical period for aviation decarbonisation.

“For everyone across the Qantas Group, this year has been all about delivery,” commented CEO Vanessa Hudson. “While we are pleased with the progress we are making, we remain focused on further improving our performance and continuing to deliver for our customers, people and shareholders.”

Explosive Growth in Global SAF Market

Qantas’s investments come at a time of extraordinary growth in the global sustainable aviation fuel market. The sustainable aviation fuel market is estimated at USD 2.06 billion in 2025. It is projected to reach USD 25.62 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 65.5%. This represents one of the fastest-growing segments in the energy sector, driven by increasing regulatory pressure and airline commitments to net-zero emissions.

The global sustainable aviation fuel market was valued at USD 1.7 billion in 2024 and is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 46.2% from 2025 to 2034. The aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, with growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions.

Regulatory Drivers and Industry Collaboration

The rapid expansion of SAF adoption is being driven by increasingly stringent environmental regulations worldwide. The European Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market is experiencing significant growth, driven by stringent environmental regulations and ambitious decarbonization targets set by the European Union. The ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates a progressive increase in SAF blending, starting at 2% in 2025 and aiming for 70% by 2050.

Qantas has joined an alliance of airlines, an aircraft manufacturer, and energy and financing companies to help accelerate global production of aviation biofuel. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance (SAFFA) fund has been formed with anchor-investor Airbus as well as Air France-KLM, Mitsubishi HC Capital Inc., BNP Paribas, Associated Energy Group, and Burnham Sterling Asset Management.

Industry Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite the promising growth trajectory, the SAF industry faces significant challenges. Their greatest concerns centre on the availability and cost of sustainable aviation fuel, along with geopolitical tensions and the tariffs associated with growing protectionism. Currently, SAF can cost several times more than conventional jet fuel, making industry collaboration and government support crucial for scaling production.

The actions that industry and governments across the world take this year will be vital to ensure the aviation sector remains on the right flight path to meet internationally agreed targets, including reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5% by 2030 and attaining net-zero international aviation by 2050.

Strategic Positioning for the Future

The Qantas Group, which has committed to using 10 per cent SAF in its overall fuel mix by 2030, is sourcing SAF overseas, including 15 percent of its fuel use out of London currently and 20 million litres each year for flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Australia from 2025. This diversified sourcing strategy positions Qantas to meet its sustainability targets while supporting the development of global SAF supply chains.

We’ve established Australia’s first coalition program to support the efforts to reduce the environmental impact of aviation through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Climate action is more effective together, and the Qantas Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition program offers our corporate partners the opportunity to help contribute to the development and future use of SAF.

As the aviation industry navigates the complex challenge of decarbonisation, Qantas’s substantial investment in sustainable aviation fuel represents both a strategic business decision and a commitment to environmental leadership. With the global SAF market projected to grow exponentially over the next decade, early investments in production capacity and supply chain development could provide significant competitive advantages while supporting the industry’s broader sustainability goals.

The success of these initiatives will be crucial not only for Qantas’s own net-zero ambitions but also for establishing Australia as a key player in the global sustainable aviation fuel market, potentially creating thousands of jobs and billions in economic value over the coming decades.

Green Energy Revolution Takes Center Stage

The largest project is Green Energy Mozambique, a US$3 billion industrial park in Sofala province that represents the centerpiece of the country’s ambitious energy transition strategy. The complex is expected to generate 10,000 direct jobs and boost production of key materials including aluminum, steel, cement, batteries, and solar panels, positioning Mozambique at the forefront of Africa’s renewable energy manufacturing sector.

This massive industrial development aligns with Mozambique’s broader $80 billion energy transition strategy announced by President Filipe Nyusi at COP28, which aims to leverage the country’s vast renewable resources to position it as a sustainable investment destination and regional energy hub by 2050.

The Green Energy Mozambique project reflects growing international confidence in the country’s renewable energy potential. With 23,000 GW of solar potential and global horizontal irradiation varying between 1,785 and 2,206 kWh/m²/year, Mozambique offers some of the most attractive conditions for solar development in Africa.

Foreign Investment Surge Demonstrates Confidence

More than 88% of total investment was directed to Sofala province, far ahead of the capital Maputo, reflecting a strategic shift toward developing the country’s industrial corridors and leveraging its extensive coastline and deep-water port infrastructure.

Foreign capital accounted for US$3.2 billion of the total investment, with contributions from investors spanning 25 countries. The funds mainly target industry, transport, communications, and services sectors, demonstrating international confidence in Mozambique’s economic prospects despite ongoing challenges.

According to UNCTAD data, Mozambique ranked fourth in Africa for foreign direct investment inflows in 2024, reaching US$3.55 billion, up from US$2.5 billion in 2023 when it placed sixth. This significant improvement positions the country among Africa’s most attractive investment destinations.

The investment surge comes as Mozambique’s national electrification program has achieved remarkable progress, with electricity access rates rising from 31% in 2018 to 60% in 2024, according to Electricidade de Moçambique (EDM). This improvement in basic infrastructure has enhanced the country’s appeal to industrial investors.

Economic Recovery After Multiple Challenges

Prime Minister Levi said the results show the Mozambican economy is rebounding after climate shocks and post-election tensions, with the private sector driving growth. The investment approval figures represent a significant achievement considering the challenges Mozambique has faced, including the aftermath of the $2 billion hidden debt scandal that rocked the country in 2016, devastating cyclones, and ongoing insurgency in the gas-rich northern Cabo Delgado province.

The country’s GDP growth is projected at 3% for 2025, recovering from 1.8% in 2024 and building on the 5.4% growth achieved in 2023. While modest, this trajectory represents steady progress for an economy that has weathered significant storms.

Strategic Policy Reforms Drive Investment Climate Improvement

The investment boom reflects the success of comprehensive reforms implemented by the Mozambican government. In recent years, Mozambique has pursued systematic reforms to attract capital, including the creation of the Investment and Export Promotion Agency (APIEX) and the adoption of a new investment law in 2023.

The revised investment law (nr. 8/2023) establishes new tax incentives for businesses, includes provisions to facilitate the transfer of land use rights (DUATs), and implements reforms specifically designed to encourage foreign direct investment. The country now offers comprehensive tax and customs incentives, along with special economic zones focused on agriculture, aquaculture, and less-developed regions.

These reforms have streamlined the investment process significantly. Foreign direct investment up to USD 250,000 no longer requires prior authorization from the Bank of Mozambique and only needs registration with commercial banks handling the transactions, reducing bureaucratic barriers that previously deterred smaller investors.

Massive Infrastructure Development Program

The investment approvals are supported by major international funding commitments that will provide the infrastructure foundation necessary for sustained economic growth. The World Bank recently approved the $100 million ASCENT Mozambique project, supplemented by an additional $31 million from the Mozambique Energy for All Multi-Donor Trust Fund, aimed at accelerating sustainable energy access across the country.

This project will provide new electricity access to nearly one million people, offer improved cooking solutions to 90,000 individuals, and connect 68 schools, clinics, and other public facilities over six years. Such infrastructure development is crucial for supporting the industrial expansion envisioned in the approved investment projects.

Additionally, the African Development Bank provided $2.5 million through its Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) to develop renewable energy resources, including feasibility studies for solar floating power plants and energy battery storage systems across 10 sites.

Energy Sector Transformation Drives Growth

The energy sector represents the cornerstone of Mozambique’s economic transformation strategy. The country has already commissioned 125 MW of solar power plants under public-private partnerships, with 60 MW already connected to the national grid through projects like Mocuba and Metoro.

Major international energy companies are making substantial commitments to Mozambique’s energy future. The consortium of EDF, TotalEnergies, and Sumitomo Corporation was selected to develop the massive 1,500 MW Mphanda Nkuwa hydropower project on the Zambezi River, representing one of the largest renewable energy investments in Southern Africa.

This project will contribute significantly to regional energy security while establishing Mozambique as a green energy hub for southern African countries. The development reflects the growing international recognition of Mozambique’s strategic importance in the regional energy landscape.

Natural Gas Resources Complement Renewable Strategy

While renewable energy dominates the current investment focus, Mozambique’s vast natural gas reserves continue to attract significant international attention. The country possesses 180 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, representing the third-largest reserves in Africa.

The Mozambique LNG project, despite facing security challenges in Cabo Delgado province, remains a cornerstone of the country’s long-term economic strategy. The project, which received a Final Investment Decision of US$20 billion in 2019, involves plans for approximately 65 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas through a two-unit liquefaction project with expansion capacity of up to 43 million tonnes per annum.

The European Union’s consideration of natural gas as a transitional green energy source has further enhanced the investment attractiveness of Mozambique’s gas sector, potentially opening new avenues for sustainable financing of gas-to-power projects.

Financial Support Mechanisms Strengthen Investment Appeal

Prime Minister Levi highlighted the launch of a US$250 million mutual guarantee fund during the FACIM fair to support economic recovery and expand private sector participation. This fund represents a crucial financial mechanism to de-risk investments and encourage broader private sector engagement in the country’s development priorities.

The guarantee fund complements other international financial support mechanisms, including the IMF’s $456 million program approved in May 2022, which aims to reinforce Mozambique’s economic recovery while addressing challenges related to debt sustainability and encouraging good governance.

The country is also working with the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) on a second compact valued at approximately $500 million over five years, demonstrating sustained international confidence in Mozambique’s reform trajectory.

Regional Integration and Strategic Location

Mozambique’s geostrategic location as the gateway to landlocked countries in Southern Africa continues to attract logistics and transport investments. The country’s extensive coastline with deep-water ports, including the strategic ports of Maputo, Beira, and Nacala, positions it as a critical hub for regional trade flows.

The development of industrial corridors, particularly the Nacala corridor mentioned in the government’s energy strategy, represents a key component of the country’s approach to integrated development that combines infrastructure, energy, and industrial development in coordinated packages.

Domestic investment, while smaller at US$144 million, reflects growing confidence among local entrepreneurs and businesses in the country’s economic trajectory. This domestic participation is crucial for ensuring that economic growth benefits are broadly distributed across Mozambican society.

Challenges and Risk Mitigation Strategies

Despite the positive investment momentum, Mozambique continues to face significant challenges that require careful management. The ongoing insurgency in Cabo Delgado province, while primarily affecting the northern regions, continues to create security concerns that impact investor confidence, particularly in the extractive industries.

The country remains classified as being in debt distress, although its debt is assessed as sustainable on a forward-looking basis according to the African Development Bank. Poverty remains high at an estimated 74.5% in 2023, with about 24 million people living in poverty, highlighting the critical importance of ensuring that new investments translate into broad-based economic benefits.

Climate vulnerability represents another ongoing challenge, with Mozambique ranking among the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world. However, the focus on renewable energy and climate-resilient infrastructure development in the current investment wave demonstrates the government’s commitment to building resilience while pursuing growth.

Future Outlook and Investment Prospects

The achievements announced during FACIM 2025 align with Mozambique’s strategy to strengthen its appeal to international investors while building local capacity and ensuring inclusive economic growth. The combination of policy reforms, international financial support, and major infrastructure investments creates a foundation for sustained economic expansion.

The success of the Green Energy Mozambique project and other major investments approved in the first half of 2025 could serve as catalysts for additional investment flows, particularly if the projects demonstrate successful implementation and positive returns for investors.

Looking ahead, Mozambique’s commitment to achieving universal energy access by 2030, combined with its vast renewable energy potential and strategic location, positions the country to play an increasingly important role in Africa’s economic development and energy transition.

The government’s ability to maintain political stability, continue implementing reforms, and effectively manage the security challenges in the north will be crucial factors determining the success of this ambitious investment program and the country’s broader economic transformation goals.

The investment approvals announced in H1 2025 represent more than just economic statistics – they signal Mozambique’s emergence as a serious contender in Africa’s race for sustainable development and energy leadership, offering hope for millions of citizens seeking prosperity after years of adversity.

India’s gearing up to turbocharge hydrogen production and rewrite the playbook on sustainable energy. Under the fresh leadership of Anant Ambani, the aim is to fire up a battery gigafactory by 2026 and ramp green hydrogen output to three million tonnes a year by 2032. And they’re doing it all at Jamnagar in Gujarat, the same campus already famous for housing one of the world’s biggest refineries.

From Refineries to Renewables

It’s wild to think that the sprawling site where Dhirubhai Ambani kick-started Reliance back in 1966—dominating oil refining and petrochemicals—is now morphing into the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex. With seamless road and marine links to Kandla port, Jamnagar is perfectly poised to feed both homegrown demand and export markets. The burning question? How fast can this pivot propel India toward its National Green Hydrogen Mission of five million tonnes by 2030, all while accelerating industrial decarbonization?

Battery Gigafactory by 2026

First up on the clean-energy hit list is a state-of-the-art battery gigafactory. Reliance plans to crank it up within two years, churning out advanced lithium-ion cells at gigawatt-hour scale. These batteries will do more than store power—they’ll smooth out the ups and downs of solar and wind, shore up industrial storage, and juice up transport applications. Thanks to the massive scale at Jamnagar, the idea is to slash costs, secure domestic supply chains, and make a real dent in industrial decarbonization.

Scaling Green Hydrogen

The real headline, though, is the gargantuan push into green hydrogen. By 2032, they’re targeting three million tonnes a year, all made via water electrolysis powered by solar and wind. On-site electrolysers will split water into hydrogen and oxygen with zero carbon emissions. That hydrogen can feed steel mills and fertilizer plants or turn into derivatives like green ammonia and methanol, making it a linchpin for deeper decarbonization and building out robust hydrogen infrastructure.

An Integrated Clean Fuel Ecosystem

What really makes Reliance’s strategy stand out is full value-chain integration. Beyond batteries and electrolysers, they’ve mapped out:

Solar module production to generate clean electricity

Electrolyser factories churning out gear for massive hydrogen production

Conversion plants for green ammonia and methanol

Units dedicated to sustainable aviation fuel, targeting one of the toughest sectors to decarbonize

By weaving all these pieces together, Reliance aims to capture value at every step, cut inefficiencies, shorten supply chains, and pump out export-ready fuel derivatives.

Strategic Ripples

This isn’t just about hitting lofty numbers. We’re talking new jobs and high-tech manufacturing skills pouring into Gujarat, sparking fresh industrial clusters around Jamnagar. On the home front, reliable battery storage and a steady hydrogen supply will boost grid stability and trim fossil-fuel dependence. On the global stage, exporting green ammonia and methanol could swing trade balances in India’s favor, cementing its status as a go-to clean-energy supplier.

Of course, there are hurdles: keeping these new fuels cost-competitive against traditional options, scaling electrolysis technology, and building out comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure. But Reliance’s big move dovetails with a worldwide rush—governments and companies alike are racing to lock in green-hydrogen ground before the market standards snap into place.

The Road Ahead

Come 2026, we should see the first batteries rolling off the line. By 2032, millions of tonnes of green hydrogen—and its derivatives—could be flowing from Jamnagar. The true test will be whether this end-to-end approach can drive down costs, spark exports, and help India—and Reliance—lead the global clean-energy transition. One thing’s for sure: this pivot is worth watching.",https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/resized-1756490719682.jpeg,N,,2025-09-01 10:56:36.492519

As the country moves closer to commercializing its long-anticipated oil reserves, the opportunities for foreign investors are expanding, but so are the complexities of navigating a rapidly evolving market.

A Regulatory Framework Designed for Investment

The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) has been central to Kenya’s efforts to create a transparent and investor-friendly environment. By the end of 2025, EPRA aims to finalize seven key upstream regulations, including local content requirements, cost management, and environmental standards. These rules mandate foreign firms to partner with local companies, prioritize Kenyan goods and services, and invest in staff training and research collaborations with Kenyan institutions [1]. Such provisions not only align with global best practices but also ensure that foreign investment contributes to local economic development.

The emphasis on local content is particularly significant. For instance, Gulf Energy’s acquisition of Tullow Oil’s assets in the South Lokichar Basin—a project expected to produce 100,000 barrels per day by 2026—has already demonstrated the importance of local partnerships. Gulf Energy’s ability to secure regulatory approval for its Field Development Plan (FDP) hinges on its commitment to these local content requirements [2].

Privatization and Market Liberalization

Kenya’s privatization agenda is another critical entry point for international investors. The government’s decision to launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO) for the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) in September 2025, offering up to 65% of its shares to the public, signals a broader push to open the energy sector to private capital. This move is part of a sweeping privatisation plan aimed at raising funds for the 2025/2026 budget and deepening Kenya’s capital markets [3].

The KPC IPO is not just a financial milestone but a strategic one. By partnering with Capital FM to communicate its sustainability and energy efficiency initiatives, KPC is positioning itself as a modern, transparent entity—a model that could attract both institutional and retail investors [4]. For international firms, this privatization trend underscores the potential for long-term partnerships in infrastructure and logistics, particularly as Kenya seeks to expand its oil export capabilities.

Strategic Partnerships and Collaborative Models

Kenya’s energy sector is increasingly defined by strategic alliances between local and international players. The National Oil Corporation of Kenya (NOC) has recently partnered with RUBiS Energy Kenya, a non-equity strategic partner, to revitalize its operations. This collaboration includes financial support, technical expertise, and plans to rebrand and expand NOC’s retail network [5]. Such partnerships highlight the value of hybrid models that combine foreign capital with local market knowledge.

Similarly, Kenya’s renewed oil supply agreement with Gulf state-owned giants—Saudi Aramco, Emirates National Oil, and Abu Dhabi National Oil Corporation—extends a 180-day credit framework for fuel imports, ensuring energy security while providing fiscal flexibility [6]. These agreements, which build on Kenya’s historical ties with the Gulf, illustrate how international firms can leverage existing relationships to secure a foothold in the market.

The Road Ahead: Licensing Rounds and Renewable Synergies

Kenya’s upcoming oil and gas licensing round, scheduled for September 2025, will offer 10 exploration blocks to international firms, signaling the government’s intent to accelerate resource development [7]. This round, coupled with the anticipated commercialization of the Lokichar Basin by 2026, creates a window for firms to secure exploration rights before the market matures.

However, Kenya’s energy strategy is not solely focused on oil. The country is also a leader in renewable energy, with strong progress in geothermal, solar, and clean cooking solutions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has highlighted Kenya’s commitment to universal electricity access and its pioneering role in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) [8]. For international firms, this dual focus on traditional and renewable energy presents opportunities to diversify their portfolios, particularly as global demand for cleaner energy grows.

Conclusion: A Market at the Crossroads

Kenya’s oil sector is at a pivotal juncture. The regulatory reforms, privatization efforts, and strategic partnerships are creating a fertile ground for international investment. Yet, success will depend on firms’ ability to navigate a complex landscape that balances commercial interests with local development goals. For those willing to engage deeply—with a focus on collaboration, sustainability, and adaptability—Kenya offers not just a market, but a platform for shaping the future of energy in Africa.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 10:56:45.813302

By Farhiya Farah

The Africa Climate Summit I (ACS I), held in Nairobi from 4–6 September 2023, was positioned as Africa’s moment to reclaim its influence in global climate diplomacy.

Building on the outcomes of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Nairobi Summit centred on climate finance, locally led solutions, nature-based approaches, and green energy.

The resulting Nairobi Declaration mapped out policy and financing pathways for a unified African position, called for reforms to global financial systems, and tasked the African Union Commission (AUC) with developing an implementation framework.

While institutionalising ACS as a biennial AU process was a breakthrough, critics, including the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), argued that the Declaration fell short by failing to consolidate political will and adequately centre frontline communities.

Concerns included underfunding, overreliance on carbon markets, and limited inclusion of civil society and Indigenous peoples.

Gaps identified after Nairobi

Despite significant pledges (USD 26 billion), the Nairobi Summit revealed three key gaps:

Insufficient finance: Funding fell far short of the promised USD 100 billion annually. Adaptation remained underfunded, and access to finance was often slow, complex, and costly.

Division among African states: Some countries advocated for continued fossil fuel use and reliance on carbon markets, while others pushed for a cleaner, faster energy transition.

Weak inclusion: Civil society, Indigenous communities, and local actors felt sidelined, undermining legitimacy.

Progress Since Nairobi.

Despite the shortcomings, four areas of progress have emerged:

Loss and Damage Fund: Established at COP28, hosted by the World Bank, with initial pledges to support water, health, and early warning systems.

Mission 300: A World Bank Group and AfDB initiative to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030, with new financial backers. However, clean cooking remains underfunded.

Carbon Market Infrastructure: The AfDB launched an Africa Carbon Credit Support Facility to help countries establish MRV systems and ensure high-integrity credits.

AU Cadence: The ACS was institutionalised as a biennial AU event, and Kenya has advanced implementation through regulatory and policy frameworks — including the Climate Change (Carbon Markets) Regulations 2024, a National Cooking Transition Strategy (2024–2028), geothermal projects, and a Green Hydrogen Strategy.

ACS II in Addis Ababa (2025) – Expectations

The upcoming ACS II (September 8–10, 2025) in Addis Ababa is expected to consolidate Nairobi’s gains ahead of COP30 in Belém, Brazil. It faces heightened pressure to demonstrate delivery, especially in finance, nature protection, and fair transition planning before updated NDCs in 2025/26.

Key Proposals for Addis Ababa

AU Delivery Scoreboard: A quarterly, public “report card” showing progress on energy, cooking, finance disbursement, carbon market deals, and safeguards.

Finance Architecture Reform: Channel at least USD 100 billion in Special Drawing Rights through AfDB, set MDB lending stretch targets, add climate “debt-pause” clauses, and publish clear timelines.

Energy & Grids Roadmap: Reaffirm the 300 GW renewable energy by 2030 goal with detailed cross-border corridor and storage plans.

Article 6 Starter-Kit: Develop standard AU-wide templates and safeguards for carbon trading, ensuring integrity and benefit-sharing for communities.

Trade & Compliance Facility: Help African exporters adapt to the EU’s CBAM and EUDR rules and develop Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and green shipping corridors.

Broader Implications for African Climate Advocacy

The biennial ACS process gives Africa 18–24 months to design projects, adjust enabling frameworks (procurement, tariffs, safeguards), and then check progress. To ensure credibility and inclusivity, Addis Ababa must:

Put people at the centre: Fund youth-led initiatives, dedicate clean-cooking funds, and enshrine FPIC for Indigenous communities.

Back local solutions with real finance: Scale mini-grids, solar home systems, and clean cooking into full national programs; set up one-stop national “front doors” for climate finance; and budget for nature as infrastructure.

Ensure fairness and transparency: Adopt clear benefit-sharing rules, effective complaints mechanisms, and public disclosure of carbon/nature finance distribution.

Conclusion

The Nairobi Summit raised ambition but left gaps in finance, unity, and inclusivity. Addis Ababa must move from promises to delivery, with measurable outputs such as megawatts on the grid, households accessing clean cooking, finance disbursed on time, and community-benefiting carbon deals.

Nairobi promised; Addis must deliver.

The recent announcement by DHL Express and Cathay Pacific highlights a progressive step toward cleaner skies. Their agreement to use 2,400 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through Cathay’s subsidiary, Air Hong Kong, reflects an intent to lower greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the region’s journey toward sustainable aviation.

This collaboration is more than just a fuel deal. It signals a shift in how global logistics and air cargo leaders are embracing innovation to reduce environmental impact. By drawing attention to real-world solutions, such partnerships encourage both industry and society to rethink the future of transport.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

Aviation is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonize. Aircraft rely heavily on fossil-based jet fuel, and emissions from aviation account for a significant share of global greenhouse gases. Sustainable aviation fuel presents a near-term solution by reducing lifecycle emissions compared to conventional fuel.

Yet, despite its promise, SAF makes up less than one percent of the world’s jet fuel consumption. Scaling its production and adoption is critical if the industry wants to meet climate goals. Partnerships like the one between DHL and Cathay are important because they create real demand that encourages producers and suppliers to expand capacity.

The Scope of the Agreement

The SAF secured under this partnership will be used for Air Hong Kong flights departing from key Asian hubs:

Seoul Incheon International Airport

Tokyo Narita International Airport

Singapore Changi Airport

These airports are central to regional and global logistics. By incorporating SAF on routes leaving such strategic gateways, the impact becomes visible across multiple trade corridors. It demonstrates that sustainability can be woven into operations without compromising efficiency.

A Signal of Industry Leadership

DHL and Cathay Pacific are not new to sustainability discussions, but this agreement elevates their commitment into tangible action. Peter Bardens, Senior Vice President for Network Operations and Aviation in Asia Pacific at DHL Express, underscored the importance of scaling SAF. He noted that while SAF is still a small fraction of global jet fuel, increasing its use is vital to drive momentum for production and demand.

In practical terms, this sends a message to other cargo carriers, passenger airlines, and logistics companies: decarbonization is possible when businesses invest in alternatives and commit to scaling them.

Building Momentum in Asia

Asia is both a hub of economic activity and a region heavily affected by climate challenges. The decision to expand SAF usage here is symbolic as well as strategic. It aligns with broader efforts across the region to transition toward cleaner energy and supports governments aiming to reduce emissions without stifling economic growth.

This regional focus is also significant because Asia hosts some of the world’s busiest airports. Small steps taken here can amplify global results, given the volume of traffic and trade passing through. By embedding SAF into these supply chains, companies help normalize sustainable practices within international commerce.

The Broader Ripple Effect

Adopting SAF in aviation does more than reduce emissions from individual flights. It sends a signal across multiple sectors:

Fuel producers are encouraged to scale up SAF production and explore new feedstocks.

Airports are motivated to develop infrastructure to support SAF fueling.

Policy makers are shown that industry actors are serious about sustainability, which can shape regulatory support and incentives.

Customers gain confidence that logistics and transport partners are aligning with their own sustainability goals.

These ripple effects multiply the influence of a single agreement, showing how one partnership can inspire systemic change.

Making Sustainability Practical

For businesses, the question often is how to balance environmental responsibility with operational performance. The DHL and Cathay Pacific deal illustrates that sustainability is not abstract. It is about making practical decisions today that move industries closer to a low-carbon future.

Air cargo is indispensable for global supply chains, from e-commerce to critical medical shipments. Making this sector greener without slowing it down is essential. SAF provides a realistic pathway, and its adoption by leading players proves that environmental responsibility and commercial necessity can align.

Lessons for the Industry

Other companies within aviation and logistics can learn key lessons from this partnership:

Collaboration is essential – airlines, cargo carriers, and fuel producers must work together to make SAF viable at scale.

Regional strategies matter – targeting specific hubs can maximize impact and visibility.

Transparency builds trust – openly sharing commitments and actions builds credibility with customers and regulators.

Early adopters set the tone – those who act first influence the pace of adoption across the entire industry.

Looking Ahead

This deal between DHL and Cathay Pacific is unlikely to remain an isolated move. As climate pressures mount and stakeholders demand accountability, more aviation players will need to embrace SAF. The challenge lies in expanding supply, reducing costs, and ensuring that sustainability remains a central element of business strategy.

By proving that SAF can be integrated into major cargo operations across Asia, DHL and Cathay are paving the way for broader adoption. What begins as a single agreement today can become an industry-wide norm tomorrow.

Conclusion

The partnership between DHL Express and Cathay Pacific to use sustainable aviation fuel represents a forward-looking commitment to greener skies in Asia. While challenges remain in scaling SAF production, such initiatives highlight that progress is possible when leaders choose action over hesitation.

For the aviation sector, the road to net zero will require bold steps, creative partnerships, and consistent investment. By leading from the front, DHL and Cathay show that sustainability and efficiency can go hand in hand. The hope is that this momentum continues, inspiring others across the industry to join the journey toward cleaner air transport and a more sustainable global future.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-9.svg,N,,2025-09-01 13:56:37.426758

While it would reinforce Brazil’s role as a global biofuels leader, speakers highlighted the need for continued investment in refining capacity, logistics and quality assurance to ensure smooth adoption at scale.

Feedstock expansion positions Brazil as a global growth driver

Optimism extended beyond biodiesel and into the wider feedstock market. Brazil’s soybean crushing and production continue to expand at a pace above the global average, reinforcing its position as a critical supplier for both domestic consumption and international demand.

Some panelists noted that diversification of feedstocks (e.g., corn oil, animal fats and future-generation inputs such as used cooking oil) will be essential to secure supply for a growing biofuels sector. While soy remains dominant, the industry is actively seeking ways to mitigate risks tied to land use and environmental pressures by broadening its feedstock base.

Traceability and certification emerge as key challenges

As global markets tighten sustainability requirements, the region’s biofuels industry faces increasing pressure to implement robust traceability and certification systems. Some discussions assessed the role of technologies such as blockchain and satellite monitoring in guaranteeing transparency across the supply chain.

Participants warned that without consistent standards and enforcement, Brazilian exporters could face market access risks in regions such as Europe and North America, where regulators and consumers are increasingly demanding verified low-carbon products.

Infrastructure and financing remain bottlenecks

Despite strong growth prospects, speakers acknowledged that infrastructure limitations continue to weigh on the competitiveness of Brazil’s biofuels sector. Access to capital markets was also highlighted as a barrier, with financing costs and credit availability remaining uneven across different regions of the country.

Public-private partnerships and targeted government incentives were pointed out as potential solutions, with calls for greater collaboration to unlock investments in logistics and processing facilities.

Brazil seen as cornerstone of global decarbonization

The overarching theme of the conference was Brazil’s strategic importance in the global decarbonization agenda. With abundant agricultural resources, expanding production capacity and growing policy support, the country is well positioned to play a central role in meeting rising global demand for renewable fuels.

Speakers highlighted that Brazil’s scale and resource base give it a competitive advantage few regions can match, while also reflecting upon the fact that global expectations are rising quickly.

It became clear that the road ahead will not be one without obstacles. However, participants agreed that the resilience of South America’s agribusiness, combined with stronger collaboration across government, finance and industry, will be essential to sustaining growth.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2025/07/greenenergy-immingham-biofuel-plant.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 09:56:17.109263

The facility will later be modularly scaled up to 100 GWh per annum, announced Anant Ambani, executive Director of RIL, during the company’s annual general meeting recently.

The battery factory is located within the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which also houses gigafactories for solar modules and electrolyzers.

Ambani said RIL’s electrolyzer gigafactory is also scheduled to start production by the end of 2026. This facility will have the capacity to scale up to 3 GW per year, enabling cost-competitive production of green hydrogen at a global scale. The electrolyzer plant is backed by exclusive global technology partnerships and RIL’s in-house capabilities.

The solar PV manufacturing facility at the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex is already operational. It has successfully produced its first 200 MW of high-efficiency heterojunction technology (HJT) solar modules. “These modules are demonstrating industry-leading performance—delivering 10% higher energy yield, 20% better temperature tolerance, and 25% lower degradation,” said Ambani. RIL plans to scale this facility to 10 GW of annual solar PV manufacturing capacity in the coming quarters, with further expansion to 20 GW, making it the largest and most integrated single-site solar manufacturing complex in the world.

Together, these platforms will create a multi-pronged, gigawatt-scale clean energy ecosystem housing solar, battery storage, and green hydrogen production equipment all under one roof. “This integrated approach not only delivers scale but also builds a competitive edge in cost, technology, and supply chain resilience, positioning Reliance to capture significant value as the global energy transition accelerates,” said Ambani.

“Reliance will be the world’s only fully integrated, self-sufficient new energy company,” he added.

Ambani said that work on the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is progressing at a record pace. It will be unmatched globally in size, scale and integration. The Complex spans 44 million square feet of built-up area, equivalent to four times the size of the Tesla Gigafactory.

With this, Jamnagar becomes the cradle of both the world’s largest conventional energy complex and the world’s largest new energy complex.

RIL is also developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects in Kutch, Gujarat, spanning 550,000 acres of arid land, three times the size of Singapore. At peak construction, the site will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery storage containers daily. “This will be among the fastest installations globally. [Once operational] this single site could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity needs within the next decade,” said Ambani.

RIL’s marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla will connect seamlessly with solar and hydrogen production sites at Kutch, facilitating large-scale export of green hydrogen and its derivates as the company scales up to 3 million metric tons per annum of green hydrogen by 2032. “We will produce and export green ammonia, green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel. This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives. While our initial focus will be to meet Reliance’s own large captive demand, we plan to scale up to 3 million metric tons per annum of green hydrogen by 2032. This will unlock a powerful growth engine for global markets,” said Ambani.",https://www.pv-magazine-india.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/09/RIL-1200x603.png,N,,2025-09-01 11:57:14.155038

The stock’s valuation is stretched, but its strategic alignment with renewable fuels and circular economy trends offers asymmetric upside.","Darling Ingredients (DAR) trades at $33.96 as of August 30, 2025, with a trailing P/E ratio of 52.25 and a market cap of $5.37 billion [4]. This valuation reflects a stock priced for optimism, given the company’s mixed financial performance and its strategic pivot toward renewable fuels and circular economy solutions. While the stock’s elevated P/E ratio raises questions about affordability, its operational transformation and industry tailwinds suggest a compelling case for long-term investors willing to navigate near-term volatility.

Financial Performance: A Tale of Two Segments

Darling’s Q2 2025 results underscored the duality of its business model. The Feed segment delivered robust performance, generating $135.9 million in adjusted EBITDA, driven by favorable pricing and stable raw material volumes [2]. This resilience contrasts sharply with the struggles of the Fuel segment, where Diamond Green Diesel (DGD)—its 50/50 renewable fuels joint venture—saw adjusted EBITDA plummet by 44% year-over-year to $42.6 million [1]. The decline stemmed from regulatory uncertainty, including delays in Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing and the transition from the blenders tax credit to the producer’s tax credit [4].

Despite these challenges, Darling’s balance sheet remains a bright spot. The company reduced net debt and achieved a leverage ratio of 3.34X as of June 28, 2025 [1]. Institutional ownership of 94.44% further signals confidence in its strategic direction [4].

Operational Transformation: From Waste to Value

Darling’s operational overhaul in 2025 is anchored in two pillars: renewable fuels and value-added protein products. The company’s DGD joint venture, a leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), sold 467.8 million gallons in H1 2025 at an average EBITDA of $0.22 per gallon [1]. With SAF plants operating at or near capacity and regulatory tailwinds like the 45Z tax credit extension to 2031, DGD’s margins are poised to recover [3].

Equally significant is Darling’s foray into the health and wellness market. The recent non-binding term sheet to form Nextida—a collagen and gelatin joint venture with Tessenderlo Group—highlights its ambition to monetize waste streams from animal agriculture into premium ingredients [1]. This move aligns with growing demand for plant-based and sustainable proteins, offering a new revenue stream beyond traditional waste management.

Industry Tailwinds and Regulatory Catalysts

The renewable fuels sector is undergoing a structural shift. U.S. policy developments, including the proposed Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) of 5.25 billion gallons and Trump-era biofuel blending mandates, are expected to boost feedstock prices and demand for green diesel [1]. Darling’s CEO, Randall Stuewe, has emphasized that these changes position the company for stronger performance in H2 2025 and beyond [1].

However, risks persist. Small refinery exemptions (SREs) and overcapacity in the biofuel market could dampen demand, as evidenced by Darling’s revised 2025 EBITDA guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion [5]. Analysts remain divided, with a consensus price target of $47 (38% upside) but a wide range from $36 to $50 [2].

Valuation: High P/E, Low ROE, and a Debt-Neutral Balance Sheet

Darling’s P/E ratio of 51.76 [2] is well above the S&P 500 average, reflecting investor expectations for future growth. Yet its Return on Equity (ROE) of 2.45% [2] is underwhelming, suggesting limited shareholder returns. The Debt-to-Equity ratio of 0.90 [3] indicates moderate leverage, but refinancing risks could emerge if interest rates rise.

For the stock to justify its current valuation, Darling must deliver on its operational transformation. The success of DGD’s SAF business, the scalability of Nextida, and the company’s ability to navigate regulatory headwinds will be critical.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on the Future

Darling Ingredients at $33.96 is a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The stock’s valuation is stretched, but its strategic alignment with renewable fuels and circular economy trends offers asymmetric upside. Investors who can stomach near-term volatility—such as SRE-related demand fluctuations or RIN price swings—may find value in Darling’s long-term vision. As the company executes its transformation, the key question remains: Can it convert waste into wealth faster than its peers?",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-01 07:56:10.941664

The WRI examined more than 1,000 sustainability goals set by nearly 700 of the world’s largest companies and found that while most have put in place targets related to climate and nature, people are often left out of the story – just 3% have set commitments to improve working conditions or invest in skills development.

Fit for the future

“If you are building a supply chain for the future, you can’t just cut emissions — you have to factor in the billions of people doing the work,” commented Eliot Metzger, WRI’s director of sustainable business and innovation.

“Right now, most large companies are overlooking the needs of the people essential to transforming their supply chains. This not only undermines companies’ sustainability targets but also the stability of their supply chains and their reputation.”

‘Elephant in the Boardroom’

According to the WRI‘s study, entitled Elephant in the Boardroom: People Are Missing in Corporate Supply Chain Goals, people-centred supply chain goals could focus on areas such as improving workplace safety through training and equipment, providing upskilling programmes, and ensuring fair pay and predictable timetables.

‘These actions can directly improve worker well-being while strengthening the resilience of the supply chain,’ the WRI noted.

It also found that around 90% of supply chain goals set by corporates ‘force’ smaller suppliers to comply with sustainability objectives without offering the support needed to meet them. It advocates for a partnership-based approach to emphasise mutual value.

‘This would involve larger companies engaging with suppliers to understand concrete challenges — such as financing equipment upgrades or training and retaining skilled workers — and then designing goals that provide the necessary support for suppliers to transition toward more sustainable operations,’ the WRI added.

Speaking at RIL’s annual general meeting on August 29, Anant Ambani, the company’s executive director said the solar park being built in Gujarat’s Kutch could meet nearly 10% of India's electricity needs within the next decade.

He, however, did not specify the total installed capacity planned for the solar project. Industry experts told Moneycontrol that the project would easily be upwards of 10 gigawatt (GW). To make the availability of renewable energy from the solar park round-the-clock, RIL is also setting up battery energy storage systems (BESS) at the site.

Also read: Government to make battery storage a must for renewable projects.

“In Kutch, Gujarat, we are developing one of the world's largest single-site solar projects spanning 5,50,000 acres of arid land – three times the size of Singapore. At peak, we will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. This will be among the fastest installations globally,” Ambani said.

He stated that the renewable energy produced in this solar park will be used for RIL’s plans to produce green hydrogen, green ammonia, green methanol and SAF. All these products need pure renewable energy in their respective production processes.

In Kutch, RIL also plans to build facilities for production of green ammonia, green methanol, and SAF. “Our marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla will connect seamlessly with solar and hydrogen at Kutch,” Ambani said adding that the company will also export the three new energy products mentioned above.

“This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives. While our initial focus will be to meet Reliance's own large captive demand, we plan to scale up to 3 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green hydrogen equivalent production capacity by 2032, thereby unlocking a powerful growth engine for global markets,” he said.

Reliance Industries is among the few companies that has secured incentives under India's National Green Hydrogen Mission for both green hydrogen production and electrolyser manufacturing.

Besides, RIL has also won incentives for solar module manufacturing under India's Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in both the first and second tranches, securing allocations of over Rs 19 billion in the first round and Rs 30.98 billion in the second round to develop integrated poly-to-module manufacturing facilities.

Hawaiian Airlines is taking a major step toward greener skies by introducing sustainable aviation fuel on its Osaka–Honolulu flights, a move made possible through a partnership with Cosmo Oil Marketing. This initiative aims to cut carbon emissions by up to 80% per flight, demonstrating how airlines can reduce their environmental footprint while continuing to connect passengers across continents.

Hawaiian Airlines (HA) is pioneering eco-friendly air travel by deploying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on its routes between Honolulu, Hawai’i, and Osaka, Japan.This initiative comes through a strategic agreement between HA’s parent company, Alaska Air Group Inc., and Cosmo Oil Marketing Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings Co., Ltd. Deliveries of SAF at Kansai International Airport (KIX) are scheduled to start this month, marking a milestone for the airline as it deploys SAF for the first time. Hawaiian Airlines highlights that SAF can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional jet fuel, demonstrating the airline’s commitment to lowering its environmental footprint.

While the use of sustainable aviation fuel is still emerging in the United States, its growth trajectory in 2025 is notable. Policies at both federal and state levels, alongside ambitious airline targets, are driving adoption, yet SAF consumption remains a small fraction of total aviation fuel use. Experts point out that the expansion of SAF production is essential to achieving broader decarbonization goals in the aviation sector.

Rapid Expansion of SAF Production

SAF production in the U.S. has surged over recent years. From a modest 2,000 barrels per day in 2020, production climbed to approximately 19,000 barrels per day by 2023, equating to nearly 277 million gallons annually. Forecasts suggest production could reach 51,000 barrels per day by the end of 2025, which would exceed 770 million gallons annually. Despite this impressive growth, SAF currently represents less than 0.7% of total U.S. aviation fuel consumption, with overall jet fuel use surpassing 16 billion gallons per year.

The majority of new SAF output comes from co-processing renewable diesel in existing plants, a method that allows faster scale-up without building entirely new facilities. Industry analysts predict that if more facilities undergo conversion, annual SAF capacity in the U.S. could exceed 5 billion gallons within the next decade. Such an increase would provide the aviation sector with a meaningful path toward cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

Airlines Lead the Charge in SAF Adoption

Major U.S. carriers are staking significant claims in SAF procurement. United Airlines (UA) has locked in long-term contracts for 2.9 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, planning to deploy 10 million gallons in 2025, tripling the volume used in 2022. Delta Air Lines (DL) has inked offtake contracts for 910 million gallons, targeting a 5% SAF blend across its fleet by 2030. Meanwhile, American Airlines (AA) holds 620 million gallons in future SAF purchase agreements and initiated regular annual deliveries in 2024.

Other airlines, including JetBlue (B6) and Air Canada (AC), have smaller but steadily expanding SAF programs. Notably, Air Canada plans to deploy 20.5 million gallons of Neste SAF in 2025, which represents roughly 1% of its total fuel requirements. These initiatives underscore the aviation sector’s growing reliance on SAF as a viable climate solution.

Beyond Commercial Airlines

Sustainable aviation fuel is increasingly being adopted across cargo, business, and military aviation sectors.Cargo carriers, business aviation operators, U.S. military branches, and startups are increasingly investing in SAF production, storage, and fueling infrastructure. These developments signal a broader recognition of SAF’s potential to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and contribute to national climate targets.

Industry observers note that SAF deployment faces challenges, including high production costs, limited infrastructure, and the need for continuous policy support. However, partnerships like the one between Hawaiian Airlines and Cosmo Oil Marketing demonstrate how strategic collaborations can accelerate adoption. By integrating SAF into its Osaka-Honolulu flights, Hawaiian Airlines not only reduces its carbon emissions but also sets an example for other international carriers seeking sustainable fuel solutions.

Hawaiian Airlines will use sustainable aviation fuel on Osaka–Honolulu flights, cutting carbon emissions by up to 80% while keeping global travel seamless.

As airlines move toward achieving net-zero emissions, sustainable aviation fuel offers a practical, immediate solution to reduce greenhouse gases without disrupting international travel. Hawaiian Airlines’ SAF deployment is a step in the right direction, highlighting both the opportunities and challenges of building a more sustainable aviation ecosystem. With continued investment and innovation, SAF could transform the industry, paving the way for greener skies in the coming decade.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Rana_Singh_A_Hawaiian_Airlines_B-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 07:56:14.629631

Bei der Antwort auf diese Frage kommen früher oder später immer nachhaltige Treibstoffe ins Spiel, im Jargon Sustainable Aviation Fuels genannt, kurz SAF. Sie sind die schnellste Möglichkeit, Emissionen zu senken. Viele Airlines brüsten sich darum damit, möglichst viel davon zu tanken - während sie gleichzeitig darauf hinweisen, dass die Verfügbarkeit gering und die Preise zu hoch sind.

Aber wer nutzt wirklich viel SAF - und wer gar nicht? Die International Airlines Group IAG hat Nutzungsdaten für nachhaltige Kraftstoffe analysiert. Und hat sie öffentlich gemacht. Denn: Mit 162.000 Tonnen im Jahr 2024 nutzte der Konzern, zu dem unter anderem British Airways, Iberia, Vueling und Aer Lingus gehören, weltweit die größte Menge.

Lufthansa Group erst auf Rang sechs

Wie groß die getankte Menge von IAG ist, zeigt der Vergleich mit der Konkurrenz. Laut den Daten des Konzerns, die laut Robinson auf Angaben der einzelnen Airlines beruhen, landet Air France-KLM auf Platz zwei mit rund 110.000 Tonnen, gefolgt von DHL mit 100.000. Wichtig: Die einzelnen Werte für Airlines außer IAG basieren auf einer Annäherung anhand der Grafik des IAG-Mitarbeiters - es handelt sich nicht um die absolut exakten Zahlen. IAG möchte diese nicht herausgeben.

Dann folgen mit großem Abstand mit etwa 50.000 Tonnen United Airlines und mit 40.000 Tonnen Delta Air Lines. In den USA ist die Versorgung mit nachhaltigem Kerosin besser als anderswo. Allerdings dürfte sich die Situation aber in nächster Zeit nicht bessern. Denn die Trump-Regierung stoppte alle Anreize, mit denen zuvor die Förderung und Nutzung von SAF verbunden war.

Air France vor Lufthansa

Lufthansa Group brachte es laut der IAG-Analyse auf rund 35.000 Tonnen und landet gemessen am absoluten Verbrauch damit auf dem weltweit sechsten Rang. Am Golf fiel nur Qatar Airways mit einer zweistelligen Menge auf. Rund 10.000 Tonnen waren es 2024.

“Our city was honored to be chosen for this new Airbus A220, a new-generation aircraft.","On August 25, 2025, Air France received its 46th Airbus A220-300 in Paris, following the aircraft’s delivery flight from Airbus’ Mirabel final assembly plant in Canada. The ferry flight marked a first for both the type and the airline, as the aircraft was delivered with a blend containing 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), certified directly by Airbus.

A statement issued by the carrier said, “This milestone reflects the Air France-KLM Group’s commitment to accelerate the decarbonization of air transport. This landmark flight not only confirms Airbus’ capability to provide Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) directly to customers and operators but also supports the industry’s commitment to decarbonisation. With PoS credits for a 50% SAF blend applied through the mass balance process, this ferry flight conducted by Air France’s 46th A220-300 named “Vaison-La-Romaine” (and registered F-HPNU) represented more than 25 tonnes reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels.”

Alongside performing the groundbreaking SAF flight, another joint initiative between the Group and the manufacturer is enabling Airbus employees to reduce the carbon footprint of their business travel by supporting the production of SAF. This voluntary commitment is part of Air France-KLM’s “SAF Corporate” program, which facilitates the financing and purchase of SAF. Since joining the program in November 2023, Airbus has cut its emissions by more than 2,000 tons of CO₂ through the purchase of over 670 tons of SAF.

Both the addition of more A220s plus the increasing use of SAF are ways in which Air-France-KLM Group is aiming to modernize the airlines’ respective fleets and to use more environmentally friendly measures to make flying greener in the future. SAF “plays a central role in reducing the carbon footprint of air transport, allowing at least a 65% reduction in CO₂ emissions over the full life cycle compared to conventional jet fuel. Air France-KLM is among the world’s top three SAF users and applies a strict sourcing policy, where only fuel that does not compete with human food supply, does not contribute to deforestation, and is not produced from palm oil is selected,” added the airline statement.

Fleet renewal progress

The enlargement of the Airbus A220 fleet is part of a wider fleet renewal plan at Air France and is described as “a cornerstone of the Group’s transformation strategy. With fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions reduced by 20% per seat-kilometer compared with previous-generation aircraft, the Airbus A220 embodies this ambition.”

Air France-KLM has nearly 200 new-generation aircraft (A220, A320neo, A321neo, A350, and Boeing 787) on firm order, and in 2024 alone, the Group took delivery of 41 new-generation aircraft across all its airlines. These major investments, which total more than €2 billion ($2.1 billion) per year, are said by the airline to be contributing to a fleet that, by 2030, will be composed of up to 80% new-generation aircraft. Air France’s first A220-300s, part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft, have been flying on its medium-haul network since October 2021.

What the parties say

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability, Air France-KLM. “Combining the two is only logical, and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game-changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress.”

“Since the announcement of the first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) delivery at Airbus site in Canada, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights, this achievement solidifies Airbus’ commitment to using SAF for internal operations as well as customer ferry flights across all its commercial aircraft assembly sites and delivery centers worldwide.”

“In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,” said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada.”And we’re pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year. On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonisation.”

A town celebrates the A220 naming

The naming of the newest aircraft to join the Air France fleet has brought some joy to the people of the town of Vaison-La-Romaine, located north of the city of Avignon in the region of Vaucluse. Even the mayor of the town has embraced the naming of the aircraft after his town and has posted on the town’s social media page to celebrate the occasion.

“Our city was honored to be chosen for this new Airbus A220, a new-generation aircraft. ‘Vaison-la-Romaine’ is now part of the Air France fleet alongside other cities such as Arras, Rivesaltes, and Colmar, and will fly around the world at an altitude of 10,000 meters. A dizzying figure!” said the post (in French).

Additionally, to celebrate the christening of F-HPNU, in partnership with the Vaison Ventoux Provence tourist office, the town will be marking the naming of the aircraft by unveiling a 1/100th scale model of the Airbus A220 in a few weeks in front of the fresco of the municipal gymnasium of the Ulysse Fabre sports complex located in the town itself.

The airline made the investments through its AU$400 million Climate Fund, it noted.

SAF imports

On the domestic front, a partnership with Sydney Airport and a number of large corporate customers enabled the ‘largest ever importation of SAF into the country’, Qantas said, a move that served as a test of Sydney’s fuel infrastructure and demonstrated industry commitment in developing a local SAF supply chain, as well as supportive policy to enable greater SAF production in Australia.

Qantas has also made adjustments to its Voluntary Carbon Program, with some 70% of its carbon portfolio now comprised of nature-based products, and half of that linked to an Australia-based project.

Elsewhere, Qantas has also expanded its community partnerships, signing a new four-year agreement with Surf Life Saving Australia and a three-year partnership with the Australian Red Cross, as well as donating some AU$2 million in grants to regional community groups.

Group performance

The group reported a 15% increase in underlying profit before tax for the full year, to AU$2.39 billion, and said that it expects ‘ongoing strong travel demand’ into at least the first half of its current financial year.

“For everyone across the Qantas Group, this year has been all about delivery,” commented CEO Vanessa Hudson. “While we are pleased with the progress we are making, we remain focused on further improving our performance and continuing to deliver for our customers, people and shareholders.” Read more here.

From pioneering low-emission LNG infrastructure to delivering global megaprojects using modular construction and renewable-powered e-drive systems, Shaul explains how McDermott is addressing the energy trilemma: energy security, affordability, and sustainability.

How critical is the role of natural gas and LNG in supporting the energy transition and ensuring energy security?

Natural gas and LNG are absolutely essential to the global energy transition. While carbon-free energy production is the ultimate goal, natural gas plays a critical role in achieving interim decabonisation milestones, such as net-zero. That’s where LNG comes in. It is widely considered a bridge fuel that provides energy security and a reliable, lower-emission alternative to coal and oil, while bridging the gap as renewable and other carbon-free infrastructure continues to scale up.

At McDermott, we support this transition by delivering full project lifecycle services from concept to commissioning and fully integrated engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction (EPFC) solutions designed to reduce emissions and improve efficiency across the LNG value chain. For example:

Low-carbon LNG facilities: McDermott is pioneering the development of LNG plants with up to 95% reduction in operational emissions and 65% reduction in construction-related emissions.

Modular execution: Our modular fabrication approach optimises plot plan space, provides execution certainty and reduces the carbon footprint associated with traditional construction.

E-drive systems: By integrating electric drive systems powered by renewable energy, McDermott’s LNG solutions can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 95% compared to gas turbine-driven LNG facilities.

Global reach and scalability: With strategically located fabrication yards and execution offices, we optimise delivery based on regional priorities, ensuring efficiency and sustainability.

Could you give us an overview of your project pipeline and recent milestones?

One of our key projects is the Woodfibre LNG facility in British Columbia, Canada, which is set to be among the world’s lowest-emission LNG plants. Using imported hydroelectric power, a renewable source, the project significantly reduces emissions and exemplifies our commitment to low-carbon delivery through modularisation and integrated project execution.

We are also nearing completion of the first LNG train at the Golden Pass LNG Export Project in Sabine Pass, Texas, with Trains 2 and 3 to follow. The project represents over 15 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of LNG capacity. Once complete, it will bring McDermott’s total large-scale LNG trains delivered on the US Gulf Coast to nine —the second most of any contractor. It demonstrates our ability to execute some of the world’s largest and most complex projects.

Beyond Woodfibre and Golden Pass, McDermott has a strong global LNG portfolio. At Freeport LNG, our team and its joint venture partners delivered three pre-treatment trains, a liquefaction facility with three trains, a second loading berth, and a 165,000 m3 full-containment LNG tank. Each LNG train at the Freeport LNG facility produces around 5.1 Mtpa of LNG and incorporates cutting-edge e-drive systems, including the world’s largest electric motor-driven refrigeration compressors—three 75 MW electric motors per train, which significantly improves North America’s energy export capabilities.

These e-drive systems offer significant benefits: reduced emissions, faster restarts, increased operating flexibility, and improved year-round efficiency.

What are the ways in which your company is powering a sustainable future?

McDermott is leveraging its global scale and breadth of capabilities to support decarbonisation across the energy industry. In addition to e-drive systems powered by renewable energy in LNG facilities, we are also focusing on other critical low-carbon focus areas including HVDC substations for offshore wind; low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia; carbon capture and utilisation; and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Currently, McDermott is delivering Europe’s first green steel project for Stegra in Boden, Sweden, and executing FEEDs (front-end engineering design) for Clean Hydrogen Work’s Ascension Clean Energy blue ammonia project in Louisiana and the Exploits Valley Renewable Energy Complex (EVREC) in Newfoundland.

What key messages do you want to highlight at Gastech 2025, and what are you planning to showcase at the show?

At Gastech 2025, McDermott will highlight our leadership in delivering sustainable LNG, hydrogen and ammonia solutions through advanced technologies and integrated project execution.

We will showcase our expertise in low-carbon project delivery, including the e-drive systems, renewable energy integration, and modular construction. Visitors to booth M30 can learn how we are addressing the energy trilemma, and balancing energy security, affordability and sustainability through practical, scalable solutions.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/w0shxpcc/woodfibre-lng-module-02_2.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134008441934670000,N,,2025-09-01 04:56:33.256070

Outlook for Republic Services While Republic Services remains a market leader in the waste management industry, the current environment calls for careful monitoring.","Republic Services (NYSE: RSG) continues to capture investor attention as the waste management leader navigates uncertain market conditions. Recent stock analysis highlights a combination of strong fundamentals, high valuation concerns, and mixed technical indicators, leaving both institutional and retail investors divided on the company’s short-term prospects.

Investor Sentiment on Republic Services

According to the latest outlook, Republic Services finds itself in a technical neutral zone. While the company has reported steady earnings growth — including a 9.15% year-over-year rise in earnings per share and over 10% profit growth — analysts remain cautious. The stock’s price-to-earnings ratio, currently above 152, signals that the market is pricing in high expectations for future performance.

This high valuation raises concerns about whether Republic Services can sustain such momentum, especially in a volatile global economic landscape. Investors are increasingly adopting a “wait-and-see” strategy, monitoring whether the company can justify its premium valuation through consistent earnings and operational efficiency.

Fundamentals: Strengths and Weak Spots

From a fundamentals perspective, Republic Services shows mixed results. On the positive side, the company maintains a strong profit margin of over 31% and a quick ratio above 2.4, signaling healthy liquidity. Additionally, both institutional and retail investors have shown continued confidence, with inflows exceeding 50% across the board.

However, there are areas of concern. The company’s long-term debt-to-working-capital ratio stands at 7.06%, reflecting a higher level of financial risk. Its operating cycle of more than 40 days suggests challenges in efficiency when compared to leaner competitors. These factors, combined with the elevated valuation, add to the uncertainty around Republic Services’ immediate stock trajectory.

Technical Market Signals

Technical indicators for Republic Services present a similarly divided picture. Recent chart patterns, such as a Bearish Engulfing and a MACD Death Cross, point toward potential downside pressure. Yet, bullish signals like a Golden Cross and Marubozu White pattern suggest there may also be opportunities for upward reversals.

This tug-of-war between bearish and bullish signals reinforces the notion that Republic Services is in a transitional phase. Analysts caution investors to track upcoming earnings announcements and broader market developments before making aggressive moves.

Broader Market Factors

Beyond company-specific performance, global developments are also influencing sentiment around Republic Services. For instance, increased focus on sustainable aviation fuel and the renewable energy sector presents long-term opportunities for waste management leaders. At the same time, geopolitical instability and global economic slowdowns may weigh on demand for waste and recycling services in the short term.

The Asia-Pacific investment boom, highlighted by record-breaking ETF growth, underscores how global capital flows could indirectly benefit U.S. equities, including Republic Services. However, in the near term, volatility continues to dominate, requiring investors to carefully balance optimism with caution.

Outlook for Republic Services

While Republic Services remains a market leader in the waste management industry, the current environment calls for careful monitoring. Positive money flow from both retail and institutional investors shows trust in the company’s resilience. Yet, the combination of a high valuation and bearish technical signals suggests the stock may face challenges before breaking decisively in either direction.

For long-term investors, Republic Services remains an attractive option thanks to its solid earnings trajectory and industry stability. However, those seeking short-term gains may find the stock’s current volatility difficult to navigate.

However, many SAF feedstocks and biorefining technologies are still in the research and development stages, which complicates accurate predictions of their long-term environmental impacts through traditional life cycle assessments (LCAs). Prospective LCA (pLCA) methods, which use dynamic life cycle inventory models, offer a solution to static LCA by evaluating impacts within a future context. This study leverages pLCA to assess the decarbonization potential of three SAF pathways using corn, miscanthus, and algae biomass across three future scenarios. The miscanthus pathway consistently demonstrates the lowest carbon intensity, starting at approximately 14 g CO2e MJ–1 and maintaining this low level across all scenarios by 2050. This stability is attributed to its simpler and more mature conversion technology.

This initiative aims to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector and align with global climate goals set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

As part of a broad effort to promote eco-friendly aviation practices, the South Korean government has proposed a mixture of SAF in all international flights, starting at 1% SAF blend by 2027. This move is seen as a step toward meeting the global aviation industry’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050.

Government Support for SAF Development

The government of South Korea is backing the transition to sustainable aviation fuels with financial incentives and tax breaks. These measures are designed to encourage local fuel producers to ramp up their SAF production capabilities. Additionally, the government plans to assist the oil refining industry by easing the financial burden of producing SAF.

SAF production in South Korea is believed to be production in South Korea is believed to be potentially transformative in a global context, and projections within the industry illustrate the global demand for SAF is set to exponentially increase from a mere 240,000 tonnes in 2022 to 18.35 million tonnes by 2030. Such a growth is attributed to the rising demand for more sustainable aviation.

Airlines Taking Early Steps Toward SAF Use

Several South Korean airlines are already on the path to incorporating sustainable aviation fuel into their operations. Major carriers such as Korean Air have committed to using a blend of SAF for international flights. The plan includes using SAF for one international route per week starting this year. This gradual integration is an important first step toward the broader goal of using SAF in all international flights by 2027.

The percentage of SAF used in these flights is low, but remains fundamental in addressing SAF’s availability in the future. Producers of aviation fuel have begun to assurance that these fuels will be readily available within a reasonable time frame.

Why SAF Matters for the Environment

Sustainable aviation fuel is considered a vital component in the fight against climate change. Traditional jet fuels contribute heavily to global carbon emissions. By using SAF, airlines can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as SAF is made from renewable sources such as plant oils, waste oils, and even carbon capture technology.

Experts claim that advanced SAF is one of the most advanced solutions for achieving carbon neutrality in aviation. With regards to conventional jet fuel, advanced SAF, if developed, would be able to reduce the lifecycle carbon emission of aviation fuel by as much as 80%.

Challenges in SAF Production and Cost

Despite its potential, the production of SAF faces some significant hurdles. Currently, the cost of producing SAF is much higher than that of traditional jet fuel. The South Korean government plans to address this issue by providing financial incentives and encouraging local production.

The oil refining industry also faces challenges in scaling up SAF production to meet the increasing demand. However, government support is expected to ease some of these burdens, allowing the industry to adapt to the growing demand for greener aviation fuel.

The Global Aviation Industry’s Carbon Neutrality Goal

The push for Sustainable Aviation Fuel is part of a larger international effort to reduce aviation’s environmental impact. The ICAO has set ambitious goals for the aviation industry, with a target of carbon neutrality by 2050. This means the industry must significantly cut its greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades.

Having SAF included in South Korea’s international flights by 2027 is quite an advancement and aims towards the fulfillment of the international objectives. The adoption and patronage of the SAF assists in lowering the country’s emission from the aviation sector.

Collaboration Among Airlines and Fuel Producers

The collaboration between airlines and fuel producers will be crucial to the success of this initiative. South Korean airlines are working together to ensure a steady supply of SAF for international flights. The aviation industry, in partnership with government entities, aims to develop infrastructure for SAF production, storage, and distribution.

Actively engaging upon with relevant entities for a sustained period is believed to yield fruitful results in resolving challenges regarding the scaling up production of of SAF, thereby aiding the aviation industry in fulfilling its future sustainability objectives.

Impact on the Future of Aviation

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel by South Korea represents a turning point for the global aviation industry. It signals a shift towards greener energy sources and a more sustainable future for air travel. The broader global adoption of SAF will likely follow, helping to pave the way for a carbon-neutral aviation industry.

If the positive trend continues among global airlines and oil companies regarding South Korea’s lead, the aviation industry will, in the near future, standardize the use of alternative fuels, thus boosting emission reduction and improving the sustainability of air transport.

Bottom Line

South Korea’s move to incorporate Sustainable Aviation Fuel into all international flights by 2027 is a significant step in the right direction for the aviation industry. This initiative aligns with global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and meet climate goals. With government support, collaboration between airlines and fuel producers, and a growing demand for greener alternatives, the future of aviation looks brighter and more sustainable than ever.

The geopolitical ramifications of a radially altered global aviation industry, should sustainable aviation fuel technologies be successfully implemented, are massive. The example of South Korea could be instrumental for other countries attempting to decarbonize aviation, and provide them with insight fuel for a more sustainable model of aviation for the future.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/South-Korea-Introduces-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 06:56:31.350553

Tuy nhiên, giá nhiên liệu máy bay tại Mỹ vẫn chịu ảnh hưởng từ xu hướng giá toàn cầu.","Mùa cao điểm du lịch Hè 2025 đã chứng kiến một biến động quan trọng trên thị trường năng lượng.

Lượng nhiên liệu máy bay nhập khẩu từ châu Á vào châu Âu đạt mức kỷ lục, đồng thời tạo ra nhiều tác động đa chiều đối với giá nhiên liệu, nhu cầu đi lại và chiến lược năng lượng của Liên minh châu Âu (EU).

Theo Financial Times, dẫn nguồn từ công ty phân tích dữ liệu năng lượng Vortexa, chỉ riêng từ đầu tháng 8, gần 11,5 triệu thùng nhiên liệu máy bay đã được vận chuyển từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc sang châu Âu.

Đây là con số kỷ lục, mặc dù thấp hơn một chút so với các mức cao nhất trong tháng 6 và 7, nhưng vẫn duy trì ở mức áp đảo trong lịch sử nhập khẩu.

Nhìn vào bức tranh toàn cảnh, xu hướng này không chỉ phản ánh sự dồi dào nguồn cung từ Viễn Đông, mà còn cho thấy nhu cầu hồi phục mạnh mẽ của thị trường châu Âu sau đại dịch.

Một nhà giao dịch nhiên liệu máy bay cấp cao nhận định: “Khối lượng xuất khẩu từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc đang ở mức kỷ lục. Đây vừa là câu chuyện về nguồn cung, vừa là về nhu cầu.”

Bối cảnh thị trường nhiên liệu toàn cầu

Sau đại dịch COVID-19, ngành hàng không toàn cầu phục hồi nhanh chóng nhưng không đồng đều. Nhu cầu nhiên liệu máy bay tại châu Âu, Mỹ và châu Á đã quay trở lại mức trước đại dịch, nhưng các yếu tố địa chính trị, chiến tranh và lạm phát toàn cầu tạo ra những biến động đáng kể về giá nhiên liệu.

Mùa Hè 2022, giá nhiên liệu máy bay tăng lên gần 1.200 USD/tấn khi xung đột Nga - Ukraine làm gián đoạn chuỗi cung ứng năng lượng, đặc biệt là từ Nga, nhà cung cấp chính của dầu mỏ và nhiên liệu hàng không cho châu Âu.

Đến mùa Hè 2025, giá nhiên liệu bay tại châu Âu chỉ còn khoảng 700 USD/tấn, giảm gần 40% so với mức đỉnh, nhờ nguồn cung từ châu Á dồi dào và sự điều chỉnh sản lượng của OPEC+.

Theo Eurocontrol, số chuyến bay trong mùa Hè 2025 dự kiến tăng ít nhất 5% so với cùng kỳ năm 2024, phản ánh nhu cầu đi lại bằng hàng không trở lại mạnh mẽ.

Việc giá nhiên liệu giảm tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho các hãng hàng không châu Âu vận hành với chi phí thấp hơn, đồng thời khiến mục tiêu hạn chế bay nhằm giảm phát thải trở nên khó đạt hơn.

Lượng nhập khẩu kỷ lục từ châu Á

Dữ liệu của Vortexa cho thấy, chỉ riêng trong tháng 8, gần 11,5 triệu thùng nhiên liệu máy bay đã được chuyển từ châu Á sang châu Âu, chủ yếu từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc.

Đây là lần đầu tiên khối lượng nhập khẩu từ Viễn Đông đạt mức kỷ lục trong lịch sử, cho thấy sức mạnh sản xuất và xuất khẩu của các nhà máy lọc dầu hiện đại tại châu Á.

“Khối lượng nhập khẩu từ Viễn Đông đang ở mức kỷ lục, nếu xét đến khối lượng giao dịch từ Trung Quốc và Hàn Quốc. Đây vừa là câu chuyện về nguồn cung, vừa là về nhu cầu”, một nhà giao dịch cấp cao nhận định.

Chuyên gia Amaar Khan của hãng định giá Argus cũng cho biết: “Các nhà máy lọc dầu Trung Quốc coi nhiên liệu máy bay là sản phẩm chiến lược. Nguồn cung năm nay thực sự rất dồi dào, giúp châu Âu đáp ứng nhu cầu hồi phục mạnh mẽ.”

Điều đáng chú ý là, nhiên liệu máy bay khác với xăng hay diesel vốn chịu tác động từ các giải pháp thay thế như xe điện hay LNG. Nhu cầu đối với nhiên liệu máy bay hầu như không giảm, giúp dòng chảy từ Viễn Đông duy trì ổn định ngay cả khi giá nhiên liệu biến động.

Tác động đến ngành hàng không châu Âu

Làn sóng nhập khẩu mạnh đã kéo giá nhiên liệu máy bay tại châu Âu giảm sâu, trở lại mức thấp nhất kể từ sau đại dịch COVID-19. Mức giá hiện tại, khoảng 700 USD/tấn, tạo điều kiện thuận lợi cho các hãng hàng không vận hành và tăng số chuyến bay.

“

Nguồn cung toàn cầu hiện dư thừa. Đặc biệt, khi OPEC+ liên tục tăng sản lượng trong khi nhu cầu chưa phục hồi hoàn toàn ở Ấn Độ và Trung Quốc, giá nhiên liệu sẽ duy trì ổn định quanh mức hiện nay trong trung hạn.

Ông Michael O’Leary - Giám đốc điều hành Ryanair

Việc giá nhiên liệu giảm cũng có tác động tích cực đến chi phí vé máy bay, góp phần tăng khả năng tiếp cận đi lại bằng đường hàng không cho người dân châu Âu.

Tuy nhiên, điều này đồng thời làm dấy lên lo ngại về khó đạt các mục tiêu hạn chế phát thải trong ngành hàng không, đặc biệt trong bối cảnh Liên minh châu Âu thúc đẩy chính sách khí hậu xanh.

Một trong những hệ quả quan trọng của dòng nhiên liệu châu Á vào châu Âu là sự gia tăng phụ thuộc vào nguồn nhập khẩu. Nhiều nhà máy lọc dầu cũ tại châu Âu đang phải đóng cửa vì không thể cạnh tranh với các cơ sở hiện đại, chi phí thấp ở Viễn Đông.

Một nhà giao dịch bình luận: “Khi ngày càng nhiều nhà máy lọc dầu châu Âu đóng cửa hoặc bị loại khỏi thị trường bởi các cơ sở hiện đại hơn ở Viễn Đông, dòng dầu từ khu vực này vào châu Âu là điều tất yếu.”

Hiệp hội Vận tải Hàng không Quốc tế (IATA) cũng cảnh báo rằng, phụ thuộc quá mức vào nguồn nhập khẩu nhiên liệu sẽ làm EU đối mặt với rủi ro chiến lược nếu chuỗi cung ứng bị gián đoạn.

Ngoài ra, dòng chảy nhiên liệu kỷ lục còn phản ánh một nghịch lý rằng mặc dù EU nỗ lực giảm phát thải từ hàng không, giá nhiên liệu giảm lại khiến chi phí đi lại bằng máy bay dễ tiếp cận hơn, khó khăn trong việc hạn chế lượng bay thực tế. Đây là bài toán cân bằng giữa mục tiêu môi trường và phát triển kinh tế, du lịch.

So sánh với thị trường Mỹ và châu Á

So với châu Âu, thị trường Mỹ hiện có khả năng tự chủ về nhiên liệu cao hơn nhờ công suất lọc dầu lớn và cơ sở hạ tầng hiện đại. Tuy nhiên, giá nhiên liệu máy bay tại Mỹ vẫn chịu ảnh hưởng từ xu hướng giá toàn cầu.

Trong khi đó, các nước châu Á như Trung Quốc, Hàn Quốc và Singapore đang trở thành trung tâm sản xuất nhiên liệu hàng không xuất khẩu, nhờ các nhà máy lọc dầu thế hệ mới, chi phí thấp, và chiến lược tập trung vào sản phẩm chiến lược như Jet Fuel.

Trung Quốc đặc biệt nổi bật với tăng trưởng sản xuất nhiên liệu bền vững, tận dụng nhu cầu hồi phục của châu Âu và các chuyến bay nội địa. Hàn Quốc cũng duy trì dòng chảy ổn định sang châu Âu, củng cố vị thế trong chuỗi cung ứng toàn cầu.

Đây là minh chứng cho xu hướng dịch chuyển quyền lực năng lượng từ Tây sang Đông, khi châu Á trở thành điểm xuất khẩu chiến lược nhiên liệu hàng không.

Theo các chuyên gia, dòng chảy nhiên liệu kỷ lục từ châu Á sang châu Âu không chỉ là câu chuyện về cung cầu, mà còn phản ánh những thay đổi dài hạn trong cân bằng năng lượng toàn cầu.

Viễn Đông củng cố vai trò là nhà cung cấp nhiên liệu chiến lược toàn cầu, với nhà máy hiện đại, chi phí thấp và năng lực xuất khẩu lớn.

Châu Âu đối mặt với thách thức tự chủ năng lượng, phụ thuộc nhập khẩu ngày càng cao, đặc biệt khi các nhà máy lọc dầu cũ đóng cửa. Giá nhiên liệu giảm tạo thuận lợi cho ngành hàng không nhưng đồng thời làm khó khăn cho các mục tiêu giảm phát thải.

Các dự báo trung hạn cho thấy, nếu EU không nâng cấp cơ sở lọc dầu hoặc đa dạng hóa nguồn cung, nhập khẩu nhiên liệu từ Viễn Đông sẽ tiếp tục tăng, đặc biệt trong mùa cao điểm du lịch.

Ngược lại, các nhà sản xuất tại châu Á có thể tiếp tục củng cố vị thế chiến lược và mở rộng thị phần, nhờ dòng chảy nhập khẩu mạnh và nhu cầu toàn cầu ổn định.

Một nhà phân tích thị trường năng lượng nhận định: “Dòng chảy nhiên liệu này là minh chứng cho sự dịch chuyển quyền lực năng lượng toàn cầu. Châu Âu đang phụ thuộc vào Viễn Đông, trong khi Mỹ và châu Á duy trì lợi thế về sản xuất và xuất khẩu.”

Mùa Hè 2025 ghi nhận lượng nhiên liệu máy bay từ châu Á sang châu Âu lập kỷ lục, với gần 11,5 triệu thùng chỉ riêng trong tháng 8. Sự kiện này phản ánh nguồn cung dồi dào từ Viễn Đông, nhu cầu hồi phục tại châu Âu, đồng thời tạo ra những tác động đa chiều như giá nhiên liệu giảm, chi phí đi lại thấp hơn, nhưng thách thức về phụ thuộc nhập khẩu và khó đạt mục tiêu giảm phát thải vẫn hiện hữu.

Nhìn xa hơn, dòng chảy nhiên liệu kỷ lục là minh chứng cho xu hướng dịch chuyển quyền lực năng lượng toàn cầu.

Đó là việc Viễn Đông trở thành trung tâm cung cấp chiến lược, trong khi châu Âu phải cân nhắc các giải pháp nâng cấp lọc dầu và đa dạng hóa nguồn cung nếu muốn duy trì vị thế năng lượng bền vững.

With airlines eagerly waiting to welcome this next-generation widebody, the aircraft is now moving deeper into its certification journey.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has officially approved Boeing to begin Phase 2D of the Type Inspection Authorization (TIA), a milestone that focuses on community noise testing in Glasgow, Montana.

According to reports, this approval marks a significant moment for Boeing’s flagship program. So far, the 777X test fleet has already completed over 1,500 flights and nearly 4,200 flight hours, demonstrating steady progress in what has been one of the most closely monitored certification campaigns in modern aviation.

Phase 2D – Noise Testing in Focus

Phase 2D is dedicated to evaluating the aircraft’s noise levels, ensuring that the 777X meets strict global environmental standards while maintaining performance. This is a critical requirement before the aircraft can be cleared for widespread passenger service, as airlines and regulators alike are paying greater attention to community noise impact.

Phase 3 on the Horizon

Once Phase 2D concludes, the program will advance to TIA Phase 3, although no official start date has been announced yet. Phase 3 will be broader in scope, covering:

Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) performance and cooling under varied conditions

Aircraft stability and control, ensuring safe handling in all scenarios

Precipitation static (P-static) testing, verifying that systems remain protected from static build-up during adverse weather

Fifth Test Aircraft Joins the Fleet

To strengthen the program, Boeing has added a fifth test aircraft to its 777X fleet. Registered N2007L, the jet joined in early August and will primarily conduct High-Intensity Radiated Field (HIRF) trials, designed to measure system resilience against strong electromagnetic emissions.

Lufthansa to Be the First Operator

The first delivery of the Boeing 777X is planned for Lufthansa, which will become the launch customer once the aircraft is certified by both the FAA and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). With certification moving closer and testing phases gradually wrapping up, major airlines are looking forward to adding the 777X to their long-haul, high-capacity fleets.

A New Era for Long-Haul Aviation

For Boeing, the successful certification and entry into service of the 777X will not only mark a technological achievement but also reaffirm its dominance in the widebody market. The jet promises reduced emissions, quieter operations, and improved efficiency, setting new benchmarks for long-haul travel.",https://i0.wp.com/jetlinemarvel.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/B777x-outside.jpg?resize=960%2C600&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-01 02:56:43.906935

She now enjoys collecting the waste from her used cooking oil (UCO), knowing it can generate extra income instead of polluting the environment.

Many villagers in Tegalreja have adopted the same practice, selling their UCO to Beo Asri Waste Bank, which partners with Indonesia's state-owned oil company PT Pertamina to reprocess the waste into biofuel for aircraft.

Indonesia has for the first time successfully converted UCO into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a milestone in the country's waste management and alternative energy journey. Domestic carrier Pelita Air has already begun using the UCO-based biofuel on its Jakarta-Bali flights.

""Usually before, we would just throw it in the garbage or the nearby river, which polluted the environment. But now we can collect it and earn money from it,"" Sudarti told Xinhua in a recent phone interview. She said she can earn about 7,000 rupiahs (0.43 U.S. dollars) per kilogram of UCO, packed in bottles.

The collected UCO is absorbed by Pertamina Kilang Internasional (KPI) and processed at the RU IV Cilacap refinery. KPI Operations Director Didik Bahagia said on Friday that, for now, SAF production is limited to the Cilacap facility, but plants in Dumai, Riau province, and Balongan, West Java province, are targeted to join next year.

""We expect to process up to 38,566 kilolitres of UCO per year, with a production potential of 1,236,146 kilolitres. With that, we can meet domestic demand for SAF and even explore export opportunities,"" Bahagia said, adding that Indonesia is the first country in Southeast Asia to produce such fuel.

PT Pertamina's Vice President of Corporate Communication, Fadjar Djoko Santoso, said Tuesday that the company had established UCO collection points at 35 fuel stations in major cities, including Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya.

""People who want to sell their UCO can come to the nearest collection point. The price is on average 5,000 to 5,500 rupiahs (0.30 to 0.33 dollars) per litre. So, please feel free to sell your UCO,"" Santoso said.

Turning everyday kitchen waste into biofuel not only cuts carbon emissions in aviation, one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, but also stimulates a domestic circular economy. It is part of Indonesia's broader strategy to green transport fuels and reach its net-zero emissions target.

Chairman of the Indonesian UCO Collectors Association for Renewable Energy, Matias Tumanggor, noted that Indonesia has significant UCO potential, while a study by Traction Energy Asia estimates that Indonesia could produce 2 million kilolitres of UCO annually, sourced from households, street vendors, restaurants, and the food industry.

Dadan Kusdiana, secretary general of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, said SAF made from UCO could reduce carbon emissions by up to 84 percent compared with fossil-based jet fuel.

He stressed that SAF is a breakthrough opportunity for aviation to reduce its carbon footprint without compromising safety or performance.

""Today's momentum confirms that Indonesia's clean energy transition is not just talk, but a series of practical steps, starting with harnessing bioenergy potential, integrating refinery technology, and public participation in supply. However, there remains work to be done, particularly in bioethanol development and strengthening inter-agency collaboration,"" Kusdiana said. ■",,N,,2025-09-01 00:56:31.150076

Koshikawa added: “Waste cooking oil is discarded along with food scraps, but it can be used effectively when it is separated.","In a significant step toward aviation decarbonization, major Japanese carriers are now being refueled with domestically produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) using waste cooking oil.

A ceremony was held July 7 at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport to mark the official launch of the technology to achieve net zero emissions in aviation.

Shinichi Inoue, president of All Nippon Airways Co., told the gathering that SAF holds the key to achieving carbon neutrality, which means balancing emissions from human activities with those absorbed by forests and other sources.

Japan’s first SAF mass-production plant was completed at the site of Cosmo Oil Co.’s Sakai Refinery in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, last December.

The plant started production in April to supply SAF to Kansai, Chubu and Haneda airports.

While the central government has set 2050 as its target year to achieve carbon neutrality, the aviation industry envisages having SAF account for 10 percent of the fuel it uses in 2030. The industry came up with the goal in 2022 under its basic policy to promote decarbonization based on the Aviation Law.

Because cooking oils derive from plants that had absorbed carbon dioxide as they grew, SAF is said to reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 80 percent when compared with conventional jet fuel.

The key issue is producing enough of the stuff to achieve clean energy in the aviation sector.

The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy said 1.72 million kiloliters of SAF will be needed annually to achieve the 10 percent figure.

But only 500,000 tons, or around 550,000 kiloliters, of used cooking oil is generated in Japan each year, according to the Japan Federation of UC Oil Business Cooperative Associations (UCO Japan), which organizes the collection of waste cooking oil for recycling as biofuel.

The bulk, around 400,000 tons, is reclaimed from food industry sources, including food plants and restaurants, and is subsequently used for livestock feed or exported. Ninety-five percent of it is used that way.

Attention is now focused on how to collect 90 percent of the remaining 100,000 tons produced in homes that literally goes to waste.

Itami city authorities in Hyogo Prefecture formalized a SAF partnership during a ceremony held at the city hall in June.

Since fiscal 1999, the municipality has collected residential waste oil, converting it into biodiesel for its sanitation vehicles and other purposes.

But now, all the material is repurposed into sustainable aviation fuel.

The Higashi-Murayama city government in western Tokyo struck a similar agreement in February to collect used cooking oil from homes.

These agreements were spearheaded by construction giant JGC Holdings Corp. under its “Fry to Fly Project” to achieve the goal of emissions-free aviation.

About 250 entities, including more than 30 municipal governments, are supporting the initiative.

“The key is to secure waste cooking oil,” said project head Yuki Nishimura.

Oil company Eneos Corp. had also reached agreements with 26 municipalities as of June to collect waste cooking oil from households.

The company is working on a project with trading house Mitsubishi Corp. to produce SAF at its Wakayama refinery in or after the business year that begins in April 2028.

“It takes time for people to learn about SAF. We are forging ahead with the project as part of an awareness campaign before the plant starts operations,” a representative said.

The number of municipalities collecting waste cooking oil started to increase after the Conference of Parties (COP3) in 1997 in Kyoto.

The Kyoto city government began recovering used cooking oil that year to convert it into biodiesel fuel.

Currently, it collects about 120,000 liters at 1,645 locations across the city every year to power 185 garbage trucks and 115 city buses.

Kyoto-based Revo International Inc., which has been working with the city government on the project, also produces SAF.

Japan’s first SAF production plant in Sakai is run by a limited liability company whose shareholders include JGC Holdings, Cosmo Oil and Revo International.

Tetsuya Koshikawa, CEO of Revo International, has been at the forefront of collecting waste cooking oil and producing biodiesel fuels for the past 30 years.

“Many people said it would be difficult for biofuel to stay relevant, which makes it so heartening to see it being used as a recyclable resource to provide aviation fuel,” he said.

Koshikawa added: “Waste cooking oil is discarded along with food scraps, but it can be used effectively when it is separated. It is a necessary resource for Japan.”",https://p.potaufeu.asahi.com/b2b4-p/picture/29957764/635a7c0d6a15767649ad0d30d96c3f11.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 23:56:21.729544

Countries worldwide have recognised the immense potential of biofuels in enhancing energy security, mitigating climate change, and stimulating economic growth.
To fully harness the potential benefits of biofuels, Pakistan must focus on developing a comprehensive, multistep framework tailored to the country's unique challenges and opportunities.","MELBOURNE:

Pakistan's economy is strongly anchored in agriculture, which accounts for nearly a quarter of its gross domestic product (GDP) and employs almost half of the country's workforce.

However, the sector also generates significant waste, raising environmental and sustainability concerns. The innovative strategy of harnessing this agricultural waste for biofuel production not only mitigates waste management concerns but also transforms two major challenges — environmental sustainability and costly energy dependence — into a single, impactful solution.

Biofuel is any fuel derived from organic sources, such as plant biomass, agricultural residues, or animal by-products. The production of biofuels generally relies on three distinct technological approaches: chemical, biological, and physical processes.

Biogas and bioethanol stand out as two of the most widely recognised biofuels, both produced through biological fermentation methods. However, a range of innovative biofuels is also emerging, including dimethyl ether (DME), sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), diesel, and butanol, which hold significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions.

The evolution of biofuel technology is also notable, as it transitions from first generation, which primarily relied on food crops as feedstock, to second generation that utilises lignocellulosic feedstock, such as crop residues and other agricultural waste.

Even more advanced are third-generation biofuels, which leverage algae as a high-yield feedstock, marking a significant step forward in sustainable energy production.

Countries worldwide have recognised the immense potential of biofuels in enhancing energy security, mitigating climate change, and stimulating economic growth. Leading the way in integrating biofuels into their energy portfolios are Brazil and the United States.

For Pakistan, biofuel production offers a similar opportunity, serving as both a strategic step towards achieving energy independence and a crucial measure to address the environmental challenges associated with crop residue burning.

Pakistan has decades of experience in producing bioethanol and biogas, making them ideal starting points for expanding the country's biofuel capabilities. Initial efforts could focus on enhancing ethanol production by transitioning from first generation to second generation, and eventually to third generation.

Simultaneously, we could explore the development of valuable biofuels such as SAF, diesel, and gasoline through innovative pathways like the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and alcohol-to-gasoline (ATG) technologies.

DME is emerging as a highly promising and versatile fuel known for its clean-burning properties. It is widely utilised as a substitute for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in domestic, industrial, and transportation applications.

DME can either be blended with LPG or used as a complete replacement, making it a flexible and adaptable option. China has been a global leader in adopting DME, while Indonesia has also made significant strides by gradually replacing LPG with DME, benefiting from its compatibility with the existing LPG infrastructure.

In Europe and North America, several initiatives are underway to produce and promote DME as a cleaner, more sustainable alternative for transportation fuels.

Recent advancements in technology have enabled the production of second-generation DME through a fermentative process in Australia. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale production of this biofuel, positioning it as a sustainable option with potential on a par with second-generation bioethanol.

To fully harness the potential benefits of biofuels, Pakistan must focus on developing a comprehensive, multistep framework tailored to the country's unique challenges and opportunities. This approach begins with creating the initial roadmap, which lays the foundation for formulating a detailed policy plan.

The policy plan would then lead to the development of an actionable implementation strategy. The subsequent phase would involve establishing robust standards and regulations to ensure consistency, quality, and adherence to international practices.

Finally, the process culminates in the effective execution of these measures. This systematic and well-structured framework would position Pakistan to maximise the economic, environmental, and energy security benefits of biofuels.

The development of this framework would be guided by world-renowned experts and scientists specialising in both current and emerging biofuel technologies. By incorporating their insights, the strategy can emphasise a multipronged approach that addresses three essential priorities: support to attract foreign investment, fostering local industrial capacity, and a strong commitment to indigenous research and development (R&D).

To maximise the effectiveness of these three components, the government-led supporting initiatives need to be integrated into the framework right from the initial roadmap stage.

On the commercial front, these initiatives might include tax incentives, subsidies for biofuel production facilities, public-private partnerships, and the introduction of blending mandates across all fuel types. For instance, the government could enforce mandates requiring 10-20% biofuel blends in diesel, petrol, aviation fuel, and LPG, with a long-term vision of scaling these blends up to 50% and eventually transitioning to 100% renewable fuels.

Building robust indigenous R&D capabilities is essential for innovating cost-effective production methods tailored to the local feedstock. To achieve this, Pakistan could leverage its overseas diaspora of accomplished scientists by establishing connections with domestic universities and institutions to facilitate knowledge exchange and expertise development.

A key starting point would be the creation of one or more centres of excellence in biofuels. These centres could focus on identifying under-researched areas, where global competition remains limited, to accelerate the development of local expertise and intellectual property, positioning Pakistan ahead of international competitors.

The strategic integration of policy reform and advanced research initiatives is crucial for guiding Pakistan towards a sustainable and prosperous energy future. With a pragmatic, multipronged approach, the country has the potential not only to meet its domestic energy demand but also to emerge as a leading regional supplier of renewable fuels, thereby redefining its energy narrative for the decades to come.

By integrating RACQ and RAC’s customer bases, IAG is expanding its distribution network while reducing customer acquisition costs—a critical edge in a sector where margins are often razor-thin.

The strategic logic here is clear: regional players often possess localized expertise and customer trust, which national insurers struggle to replicate. By acquiring these regional assets, IAG is blending local knowledge with its own operational efficiency, a formula that mirrors broader industry trends. For instance, Marsh McLennan’s 2025 acquisition of Olympic Insurance Agency similarly aimed to leverage regional specialization in high-growth sectors like real estate and manufacturing [4]. IAG’s approach, however, is distinct in its emphasis on technology and data-driven underwriting, which we’ll explore next.

Technological Innovation: The AI-Driven Edge

IAG’s investment in artificial intelligence (AI) is a cornerstone of its strategy. AI-powered tools now resolve 70% of simple claims in real time, reducing costs by 30–50% and enhancing customer satisfaction [1]. This is not just about efficiency—it’s about redefining the customer experience in an industry historically plagued by slow claims processing and opaque pricing.

The company’s partnership with Canadian AI firm DAITY to develop risk analytics further underscores its commitment to innovation. By integrating AI into underwriting, IAG is able to refine pricing models, identify emerging risks (such as climate-related perils), and allocate capital more effectively [1]. This technological edge is particularly valuable in a consolidating sector where larger firms can outspend smaller competitors on data infrastructure.

Reinsurance and Risk Management: Stabilizing Earnings in a Volatile Environment

Natural perils—wildfires, floods, and cyclones—remain a wildcard for insurers. IAG has mitigated this risk through a $2.8 billion reinsurance deal with Berkshire Hathaway and an additional $650 million adverse cover from Enstar, capping annual natural peril costs at $1.283 billion [1]. This financial armor not only stabilizes earnings but also allows IAG to maintain aggressive underwriting margins, which rose to 17.5% in FY25 from 15.6% in FY24 [2].

The reinsurance strategy is a masterstroke in risk management. By transferring a portion of its exposure to reinsurers, IAG can focus on growth without sacrificing resilience. This is especially critical in a sector where climate change is driving up the frequency and severity of catastrophic events.

Consolidation and Competitive Positioning: A Sector in Flux

The insurance industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation, with large firms acquiring regional players to capture market share and expertise. For example, Arthur J. Gallagher’s $13.5 billion purchase of AssuredPartners and Marsh’s $7.75 billion acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services highlight the trend [4]. IAG’s own acquisitions of RACQ and RAC align with this pattern, but its emphasis on technology and ESG (e.g., investments in sustainable aviation fuel) differentiates it from peers [1].

This consolidation creates both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, it allows IAG to scale rapidly; on the other, it intensifies competition for talent, technology, and capital. However, IAG’s disciplined underwriting—prioritizing profitability over market share—and its ability to absorb costs through AI and reinsurance give it a structural advantage.

The Long-Term Outlook: A High-Conviction Play?

For IAG to succeed in the long term, it must continue to balance growth with prudence. Its FY25 results—$9.98 billion in net earned premiums and a projected $1.45–$1.65 billion in insurance profit for FY26 [3]—suggest it is on track. Yet, the company’s future will depend on its ability to adapt to macroeconomic shifts, such as rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions, which could strain underwriting models.

Investors should also monitor IAG’s ESG initiatives. As climate risks become more acute, insurers that integrate sustainability into their operations—whether through green investments or AI-driven risk modeling—will likely outperform peers. IAG’s dual focus on technology and ESG positions it well in this regard.

Conclusion

IAG’s strategic expansion in regional insurance markets is a compelling case study in long-term value creation. By combining partnerships, AI, and reinsurance, the company is building a moat that protects against both industry volatility and competitive pressures. In a consolidating sector, where the winners will be those who can scale efficiently while maintaining profitability, IAG’s playbook offers a blueprint for success.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-31 21:56:35.725730

Jaminan ini diberikan setelah dilakukan pemantauan langsung ke sejumlah titik distribusi energi vital, mulai dari terminal BBM, stasiun pengisian nelayan, hingga fasilitas aviasi.

Anggota Komite BPH Migas, Basuki Trikora Putra atau akrab disapa Tiko, menyampaikan bahwa kelancaran pasokan energi di Bali sangat penting, bukan hanya untuk mobilitas masyarakat, tetapi juga sebagai penopang pertumbuhan ekonomi daerah yang bergantung pada sektor pariwisata.

“Bali ini menjadi destinasi wisata internasional dan sudah mendunia. Karena itu, dukungan kebutuhan energi, baik BBM maupun aviasi, harus betul-betul tersedia dengan baik,” ujar Tiko usai meninjau Integrated Terminal (IT) Manggis, Karangasem, Kamis (28/8/2025).

Selain memastikan ketersediaan pasokan, BPH Migas juga menaruh perhatian besar pada sarana distribusi. Tiko menekankan pentingnya memastikan kondisi armada mobil tangki dan awaknya dalam keadaan prima.

“Kami mengecek operasional mobil tangki sebagai alat distribusi BBM kepada lembaga penyalur. Kondisi mobil dan awak mobil tangki harus dipastikan benar-benar baik agar distribusi tidak terganggu,” jelasnya.

Ia menambahkan, bagian penting dari rantai pasok adalah memastikan produk BBM sesuai dengan spesifikasi pemerintah. Hal ini menjadi tugas dan tanggung jawab BPH Migas untuk menjamin konsumen menerima BBM yang layak pakai.

Pemantauan juga dilakukan di SPBU Nelayan (SPBUN) Badung pada Jumat (29/8/2025). Fokusnya adalah penyaluran BBM subsidi dan kompensasi yang diberikan melalui mekanisme surat rekomendasi.

“Pihak penyalur harus lebih berhati-hati. Jangan sampai kuota BBM subsidi jatuh ke tangan konsumen yang tidak sesuai ketentuan. Bila ditemukan ketidaksesuaian surat rekomendasi, penyalur wajib melaporkannya ke dinas terkait,” tegas Tiko.

Selain sektor darat dan laut, BPH Migas turut memastikan pasokan BBM untuk sektor udara. Tinjauan dilakukan di Aviation Fuel Terminal (AFT) Ngurah Rai, Badung, yang memasok avtur bagi maskapai penerbangan di Bali.

“Kondisi pasokan dan penyaluran avtur di AFT Ngurah Rai sudah berjalan cukup baik. Yang penting, operasional di sini harus tetap kondusif agar penerbangan bagi masyarakat dan wisatawan tidak terganggu,” ungkap Tiko.

Dalam kunjungan itu, BPH Migas juga memonitor hasil uji coba Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), campuran avtur dengan 2,5 persen minyak jelantah (used cooking oil/UCO). Uji coba ini dilakukan oleh maskapai Pelita Air untuk penerbangan rute Jakarta–Bali.

“Kami mengapresiasi uji coba SAF ini. Ini pencapaian luar biasa yang dapat mendukung penggunaan energi berkelanjutan di bandara-bandara Indonesia,” tambahnya.

Pemantauan BPH Migas ini turut melibatkan sejumlah pihak, antara lain AFT Manager Ngurah Rai I Komang Susilo Gosa, Sales Area Manager Fuel Retail Bali Pertamina Patra Niaga Endo Eko Satryo, Sales Branch Manager Fuel I Bali Azam Akbar Hawariy, serta Sales Branch Manager Fuel III Bali Made Bilan.

The sky may still be the limit—but only if aviation fuel keeps pace with the world below.","IATA warns jet fuel supply at risk without urgent SAF scale-up

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has issued a stark warning in its May 2025 report, “Conventional Aviation Fuel and the Energy Transition: Refineries in Focus.” As the global energy sector moves decisively away from fossil fuels, traditional oil refineries are closing at a rapid pace—putting conventional aviation fuel (CAF) supply under mounting pressure.

While the energy transition is vital to climate goals, the IATA cautions that without coordinated action, the aviation sector may face a growing shortfall in jet fuel availability. The report argues that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is not only essential for decarbonisation, but also critical to mitigating fuel supply volatility caused by refinery closures and import dependencies.

A shifting demand landscape

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects oil demand for ground transport will peak by 2030, driven by electric vehicles (EVs) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Refineries, traditionally optimised for gasoline and diesel fuel, are economically unsustainable in a world of declining fossil fuel demand.

Unlike road transport, aviation lacks immediate alternatives. Jet fuel remains essential, as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft are still decades from widespread use. Yet jet fuel makes up only 6–7% of refinery output. As demand for gasoline and diesel fuel weakens, refineries are rationalising or repurposing facilities, threatening jet fuel supply security.

Refinery rationalization and regional impacts

Japan illustrates the risks: government-imposed regulations and demographic shifts led to refinery closures, which later triggered aviation fuel shortages during the post-Covid-19 air travel recovery. The U.S. West Coast faces similar vulnerabilities, relying on imports from Asia due to limited pipeline infrastructure and Jones Act restrictions, which require goods shipped between U.S. ports to be transported on U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, and U.S.-crewed vessels. Europe is also at risk, with closures planned for key refineries like Grangemouth, UK, and Wesseling, Germany, in 2025.

Supply chain stress and price volatility

Longer, more complex supply chains heighten exposure to geopolitical disruptions. The Red Sea crisis and Panama Canal droughts have already caused delays and shipping cost spikes. In the U.S., regional jet fuel prices have become increasingly volatile. Without structural incentives, refineries are unlikely to boost jet fuel production, since it remains a marginal product compared to gasoline or diesel fuel.

SAF: A strategic buffer, not just a climate tool

SAF is typically viewed as a decarbonisation solution. Produced from waste oils, biomass, or synthetics, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. But the IATA report argues that SAF also enhances supply resilience. With global SAF output under 0.2% of total jet fuel use in 2024, scaling production is urgent.

SAF pathways include bio-based (e.g., HEFA from used cooking oil) and power-to-liquid (PtL) synthetic fuels. Each faces barriers—feedstock limits, cost, and technology maturity. Yet SAF could be produced in retrofitted refineries or co-processed in existing facilities. IATA advocates policy support for these conversions and long-term investment in SAF infrastructure.

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates minimum SAF blending, while the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act offers production credits. But globally, SAF supply still lags far behind projected demand. To meet net-zero goals, production must scale to more than 400 billion litres by 2050.

Safeguarding aviation’s energy future

The report urges governments and industry stakeholders to treat SAF as essential to aviation’s energy security. Without SAF, the sector risks fuel shortages, supply bottlenecks, and cost spikes. Airports must upgrade infrastructure to support multiple fuel types, and airlines should diversify their sourcing strategies.

Increased SAF adoption can also cushion airlines from crude oil market swings. Long-term offtake agreements and regional SAF hubs could stabilise pricing, secure supply, and reduce carbon liabilities.

The IATA’s May 2025 report makes clear that the energy transition—if unmanaged—could destabilise global aviation fuel supply. SAF offers a path forward, addressing both emissions and resilience. Governments must incentivise SAF production, refineries must adapt, and airlines must invest in future-proofing their fuel strategy.

,,2025-08-31 21:27:50+00:00,The Business Times,Temasek's GenZero challenges idea that only carbon removal solutions matter,Janice Lim,,,,,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/esg/temaseks-genzero-challenges-idea-only-carbon-removal-solutions-matter,"[SINGAPORE] Temasek’s investment platform GenZero has pushed back against some segments of the sustainability community for their position that only carbon credits generated from carbon removal technologies are credible.
There have been calls by some that carbon removal projects – which involve actively taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it – is more permanent, and therefore, more credible.
Carbon removals projects include direct air capture, which is currently limited in supply and very costly.
One example is its partnership with Chinese tech company Tencent to offtake at least one million carbon credits from GenZero’s investment portfolio over 15 years.
This includes companies that support the scaling of the carbon markets, such as carbon exchange Climate Impact X.","[SINGAPORE] Temasek’s investment platform GenZero has pushed back against some segments of the sustainability community for their position that only carbon credits generated from carbon removal technologies are credible.

The state investor’s decarbonisation-focused investment vehicle said that such “debates over whether one particular type of carbon credits counts and others do not are not productive”, in its latest sustainability report released on Monday (Sep 1).

While GenZero subscribes to the principle that carbon credits should be a means to tackle residual emissions and serves as a complement to the bigger priority of governments and corporates reducing their own emissions as much as possible, it does not mean that credits generated from non-removal projects or solutions are not a valid avenue.

According to GenZero, there is evidence that there are high-quality credits being generated from a range of projects, from nature-based ones to technological solutions, as well as projects that focus on emission reductions and removals.

“So we cannot discount and we cannot go upfront to say that only removals, or 10-day removals or durable removals matter,” said Anshari Rahman, director of policy and analytics at GenZero’s strategy and development group.

Speaking during a media briefing, he added: “You need to tackle the issue on a principles basis. If the issue is reversals or permanence, we should look at how standards and methodologies can... use the best available science and technology to improve monitoring, and address some of these pain points.”

There has been continued debate over the credibility of carbon credits generated from the reductions of emissions. Such projects include nature-based ones such as avoided deforestation, or technology-based ones like the use of sustainable aviation fuel in aircraft.

While such criticisms have been around since the formation of carbon markets, the debate resurfaced recently as various scandals challenging the integrity of various carbon reductions projects emerged. Criticisms that credits that have been generated and used do not represent actual emissions reductions have sent the prices of carbon credits and the trading volume plummeting over the last few years.

There have been calls by some that carbon removal projects – which involve actively taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it – is more permanent, and therefore, more credible.

Carbon removals projects include direct air capture, which is currently limited in supply and very costly.

While work still needs to be done in improving regulatory framework – by national governments and international bodies – around this nascent industry, GenZero noted that there has been progress over the last few years in response to credit buyers pulling back on concerns over their integrity.

“We must not let the pursuit of perfection slow down climate action. Although carbon markets are still evolving, uncertainty should not justify paralysis,” said the report.

In light of the ongoing evolution of carbon markets, GenZero said that it has bolstered its risk management framework with enhanced due diligence measures including third-party audits and verifications conducted both pre and post- investment.

On the issue of integrity, GenZero chief executive officer Frederick Teo has confirmed that the investor no longer has a stake in the former C-Quest Capital – which has been rebranded to Bridge Carbon – after its former chief executive officer Kenneth Newcombe became embroiled in fraud charges over one of the cookstove programme it is running.

GenZero’s investment thesis

The carbon market downturn has led GenZero to adjust its investment process.

While it initially would invest in carbon projects in the belief that demand for credits will come once the supply is generated, the investor is now more proactive in securing buyers from the get-go, said Kimberly Tan, head of GenZero’s investment group. One example is its partnership with Chinese tech company Tencent to offtake at least one million carbon credits from GenZero’s investment portfolio over 15 years.

“The idea of some of those initiatives is... to understand what buyers want, to align upfront, and then to... invest in projects where we can be reasonably certain that there will be demand – in the form of a multi-year off-take that will give our project that base load of financial returns, or at least capital protection,” said Tan.

As for how the investor will continually make these adjustments in the current environment where climate action is potentially reduced due to policy actions by US President Donald Trump, Tan said that it will continue to look for investments that are “regulation-proof”.

“A lot of the climate tech innovation does happen in the US, and I think that will remain and probably will not change, regardless of the political environment. I think what we do have to take into account is then given the current existing exposure, how do we then very selectively add on,” she added.

GenZero said in its report that government and corporate pullbacks have contributed to a slowdown in climate investing.

It sees a real risk that governments managing tight fiscal budgets with multiple competing needs will choose to cut back on investments in climate.

With tariffs leading to cost increases and supply chain disruptions, companies will also be less willing to adopt fundamental decarbonisation technologies given the weaker appetite for capital expenditures.

They will also be less likely to embark on ambitious net-zero plans involving the use of carbon credits to address residual emissions, given the fear of greenwashing accusations.

Of the S$5 billion of startup capital that Temasek provided to GenZero since its inception in 2022, less than half has been deployed, although Teo declined to give an exact figure when asked by reporters.

Its capital is channelled into three main decarbonisation pillars: nature-based projects, technology-based ones, as well as carbon ecosystem enablers. This includes companies that support the scaling of the carbon markets, such as carbon exchange Climate Impact X.

While its funds are split relatively equally across all three pillars, Teo said, GenZero’s portfolio construction is a dynamic process.

The ability to scale and generate commercial returns, the potential for climate impact to be realised in the near term are some of the factors that the investor looks at when making its investment decisions. It does not have a set target on how much capital should go to each of the three pillars.

Climate impact

GenZero revealed in its inaugural sustainability report that it has set a target to achieve reductions or removals of at least seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) cumulatively by end-March 2028.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel comes from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops.
But it is not widely used because supplies are limited, and its cost is three to five times that of regular aviation fuel.
Sustainable aviation fuel costs more, partly because of the logistical challenge of sourcing raw materials, said Malinen.
India, Thailand and Malaysia have announced 1 per cent targets by 2027, but further goals have not been confirmed.","[SINGAPORE] Governments must be more ambitious in mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel to spur its producers to ramp up output, said Heikki Malinen, president and chief executive officer of green-fuel producer, Neste.

He said that Singapore’s targets, extending through 2030, set a good example – but global governments can go further, and shoot for higher, longer-term goals.

In 2026, Singapore will impose a levy on outbound flights, calculated based on a national target for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all the fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026.

By 2030, this will rise to between 3 and 5 per cent.

In an interview with The Business Times, Malinen said: “We need a transitory solution between conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel, and that’s why we believe the mandate should be raised to about 10 per cent over the next five to seven years.”

Neste is listed on Nasdaq Helsinki, and is the world’s biggest producer of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

But without concrete signals about future demand, producers of this greener jet fuel cannot afford to gamble by ramping up capacity, Malinen said, as setting up production facilities takes years and requires major capital expenditure.

Singapore’s unique approach – with centralised procurement and a national target for sustainable aviation fuel based on volume – could thus be a “guiding light” for the region, he said.

Still on the ground

Sustainable fuel is viewed as the most viable way to decarbonise aviation at the moment; other options such as hydrogen and electric power are expected to be adopted only in the 2040s.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel comes from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops. It can cut carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 90 per cent.

But it is not widely used because supplies are limited, and its cost is three to five times that of regular aviation fuel.

Growth in the supply of this greener fuel remains “disappointingly slow”, said the International Air Transport Association. A million tonnes of it was produced in 2024, just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production.

The high price is a barrier, and fuel accounts for as much as 30 per cent of an airline’s costs. Airlines already have thin profit margins – around 3 per cent in 2024 – and competition is fierce, with travellers being sensitive to ticket price increases.

Sustainable aviation fuel costs more, partly because of the logistical challenge of sourcing raw materials, said Malinen. Neste has around 600 vendors in 60 countries, and has set up networks to collect, for example, used cooking oil. It has long focused on using waste and residues, which others cannot easily use, to make this green fuel.

While supply is also affected by factors such as technology, mandates should increase production, he said. And as economies of scale grow, the price gap between conventional fuel and this greener fuel should narrow.

Mandates on the use of sustainable jet fuel are, however, gaining momentum: The European Union and the United Kingdom have led the way with binding targets of 6 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively, by 2030; at least another 17 nations have announced or are considering mandates or targets.

But most existing policies lack specifics and have a limited time-frame, said Malinen.

Australia has a non-binding goal of 10 per cent usage by 2030. India, Thailand and Malaysia have announced 1 per cent targets by 2027, but further goals have not been confirmed.

China, the world’s second-largest market for passenger aviation, announced the use of only 50,000 tonnes of this fuel by this year.

Malinen said: “What industrial companies like Neste would find very helpful is more visibility on the longer-term plans. If decisions are made on an annual basis, without a long-term perspective, how can a company take a massive bet for investing (in the production of this fuel)?”

He added: “If you want to have enough capacity for the early 2030s, you need to start making decisions now.”

This is because building the plants that produce this fuel is no small task. For instance, Neste began planning for its 2.5 billion euro (S$3.7 billion) Rotterdam facility in 2020. It will be completed only in 2027.

File a flight path

The lack of clarity is clouding investment decisions, said Malinen. “We’ve seen a number of companies now retract their investment plans, simply because no one really knows what happens next in the regulatory fight.”

The uncertainty also makes it harder to secure funding – a key reason for the failure of recent projects in sustainable aviation fuel.

In 2024, five such projects with a planned output of almost a million tonnes were cancelled. These included Oceania Biofuels’ project to build Australia’s first plant for this fuel; the project between Fulcrum Bioenergy and Solena in the US; and those by oil majors Shell and BP.

At least three projects in China have reportedly been postponed, and the lack of clear signals on the future of this greener fuel was cited as a reason.

But there are some bright spots, especially in the Asia-Pacific, said Malinen, citing Singapore, Thailand and Japan as the “frontrunners”.

Japan has the “most ambitious” long-term target in Asia – of 10 per cent sustainable aviation fuel by 2030; Thailand’s target is 1 per cent in 2026, gradually going up to 8 per cent by 2036.

Singapore’s target – 3 to 5 per cent by 2030 – is not as high, but Malinen noted that the country is seen as a “shining star”, adding: “My understanding is that what it does, others will follow eventually.

“So the decision Singapore takes on these mandates is extremely critical for the whole region,” he said, and expressed hope that the Republic would set higher targets.

Regardless, Singapore’s centralised approach is an efficient and transparent one that others should emulate, he said.

“If Singapore Airlines and Singapore take on the decision to use sustainable aviation fuel, then others will eventually have to follow, because they don’t want to be left behind.”

To date, the Singapore Airlines group has purchased 3,000 tonnes of this fuel from Neste’s Singapore refinery, in preparation for using it for 5 per cent of its total requirements by 2030.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/ccfc27461402233f42e10ce24fdba4db1f0e2dd45e7d2a43e91bf062b13f9015?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-08-31 17:56:22.696635

Setting a climate impact performance target puts GenZero among the first global investment entities to do so.
Mr Teo said GenZero’s climate impact target includes only emission reductions or removals that directly do so, such as nature restoration projects.
Cumulatively, the direct and indirect climate impact by GenZero amounts to 12.9 million tonnes as at Dec 31, 2024.
They may also face greater regulation that requires them to factor the price of their carbon emissions into their bottom lines.","SINGAPORE – Three million tonnes of planet-warming emissions have been directly reduced or removed from the atmosphere due to investments made by Singapore-based climate investment firm GenZero as at Dec 31, 2024.

In its inaugural sustainability report published on Sept 1, GenZero said it aims to contribute to at least seven million tonnes of direct emission reductions or removals through its investments by March 31, 2028 .

This is equivalent to about 10.9 per cent of Singapore’s emissions

projected for 2028

.

GenZero was set up by Singapore’s investment company Temasek in 2022 with an initial injection of about $5 billion.

Its focu s is on enabling a global trade in carbon credits by investing in nature and technology, as well as services to boost the credibility of carbon markets.

GenZero chief executive Frederick Teo declined to reveal the investment quantum utilised so far, saying only that “the majority of the firm’s initial funding has not been deployed”.

Setting a climate impact performance target puts GenZero among the first global investment entities to do so.

Other ways of measuring climate impact used by other firms include the size of investments in sustainability initiatives, size of nature areas restored, and species saved.

The report’s coordinator Sofia Galanek told the media at a briefing ahead of the report’s release that by setting the target, the firm hopes to hold itself to “a higher level of accountability” in a market where few set goals for the amount of emissions reduced or removed by their actual level of investment.

“We see a lot of net-zero targets, emission reduction targets, but not so much on the achievement of climate impact,” said Ms Galanek, GenZero’s senior associate of strategy and development.

“While the ecosystem is still on its journey to standardise climate impact measurement, we hope that by setting the target, we can contribute to the dialogue in this industry and demonstrate our achievements over time.”

GenZero’s climate impact target is also calculated based on its own stake in its investments.

Mr Teo said the firm chose 2028 as a near-term milestone, as the deadline provides “enough time to generate some climate impact from our early investments and instils early accountability for our impact performance”.

“The capital we have deployed will continue to generate climate benefits well beyond 2028,” he added. “Together with new investments in the coming years, we are laying the foundation for more ambitious long-term climate impact.”

The firm maintains a global portfolio of investments that are split across solutions that use nature to reduce emissions, decarbonisation technologies and levers that enable carbon markets to grow.

For instance, it has invested in Aurora Sustainable Lands, a firm that employs various ways of managing forests in the United States to maximise carbon dioxide absorption.

GenZero has backed CleanJoule, a firm that is commercialising technology to produce sustainable aviation fuel that can reduce aircraft emissions.

The investment firm has invested in related services that can boost the credibility of carbon projects, such as BeZero Carbon, a global carbon ratings agency that validates projects.

Mr Teo said GenZero’s climate impact target includes only emission reductions or removals that directly do so, such as nature restoration projects.

Investments that indirectly lead to climate impact, such as sustainable aviation fuel production, or those that contribute to a more favourable market for these technologies, are not factored into the target.

Mr Teo said such investments make nature and technology solutions investable, translating into direct impact in the long run.

“So without the enablers being in place, without investing into the development of a proper ecosystem, you cannot unlock the potential in nature and many other things.”

Responding to queries from the media, Mr Teo said it did not count carbon emissions from its carbon credit investment involving

US firm C-Quest Capital

, which had been embroiled in fraud charges.

Cumulatively, the direct and indirect climate impact by GenZero amounts to 12.9 million tonnes as at Dec 31, 2024.

GenZero also addressed questions on the outlook for carbon markets, given the ongoing trade tensions, economic uncertainty and faltering political support for climate action.

This follows a 2023 Guardian report that rubbished forest carbon offsets and claimed that about 90 per cent of rainforest credits were ineffective.

According to GenZero, climate technology financing dropped by 29 per cent, from US$79 billion (S$101.4 billion) between the f ourt h quarter of 2022 and the t hird qu arter of 2023, to US$56 billion in the following four quarters.

But there are tailwinds that could help lift the dampened outlook, according to GenZero’s director of policy and analytics Anshari Rahman.

He highlighted improved standards, as well as greater transparency and assurance in the quality of these credits, as being a silver lining for the market.

Moreover, many companies have set corporate net-zero targets. They may also face greater regulation that requires them to factor the price of their carbon emissions into their bottom lines.

One carbon credit represents one tonne of planet-warming emissions that is either prevented from being released or avoided. Emitters can buy these credits to offset their carbon footprint.

The carbon market can benefit countries that host carbon projects as it is a source of revenue for underfunded climate initiatives, such as forest conservation projects, that would not otherwise have been implemented.

South-east Asia has a lot of untapped potential for becoming a source of carbon credits, Mr Anshari added.

He said: “Carbon markets can be leveraged as an accelerator for decarbonisation in South-east Asia and the broader Asian region.”

Going forward, GenZero hopes to invest in more projects that have benefits that go beyond carbon, with biogas and agroforestry on its radar.

For example, biogas can contribute to energy security, while agroforestry has the potential to contribute economic opportunities that benefit local communities.

The firm’s managing director and head of investments Kimberly Tan said: “For instance, it may be sustainable cocoa production or sustainable coconut production where local communities benefit from carbon and increased productivities from what we’re doing.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e5bb8693669fe160021c5d4cf76707e0687486013944554ebb787e567f900d85,N,,2025-08-31 17:56:28.700852

The summit brought together over 500 experts from across the public and private sectors, ranging from energy executives to environmental advocates, to explore innovations in energy, climate resilience, and sustainable growth.

This year’s theme was the energy transition, highlighting the interconnectedness of supply chains, environmental policy, and the urgent need for decarbonization. These themes align directly with NYLCV’s advocacy efforts, especially our push for investments in clean energy and transportation electrification across New York State.

Much of the conversation focused on the potential for business to utilize innovation and investment opportunities to drive progress as well as profits, a mindset that NYLCV highly encourages. As a nonpartisan organization committed to clean air, clean water, renewable energy, and open space, we know that the energy transition isn’t just necessary, it is an opportunity to reshape our economy for the better.

Global Discourse, Local Action

The summit offered a unique opportunity for NYLCV to engage with leaders from both the public and private sectors. The event explored topics ranging from offshore wind and compressed air energy storage to clean transportation and carbon markets, many areas where New York has already taken bold action.

Panels on emerging tech, such as long-duration storage and sustainable aviation fuel, underscored the importance of innovation in scaling emission reduction efforts. A particularly notable presentation by Canadian green energy company Hydrostor detailed how compressed air can be used to store off-peak energy and reduce reliance on peaker plants during times of high demand. Another presentation from an energy storage company highlighted how large-scale battery facilities can alleviate blackouts, a timely concern as heatwaves become more frequent in NYC. These technology applications reflect the same principles NYLCV supports in advocating for grid modernization and resilience at the state level.

Also highlighted was the growing momentum around environmental justice and community-based adaptation. Organizations like CORE, in conjunction with speakers such as Chelsea Clinton, emphasized the need for proactive rather than reactive resilience planning. This is particularly vital in in vulnerable areas facing exceptionally high climate risks. NYLCV’s efforts to increase local investment in parks and green infrastructure echoes this focus on equitable climate solutions that benefit historically marginalized communities.

National Voices Encourage State Leadership

Though the scale of the summit was global, many of the issues hit close to home. From electrifying bus fleets to building smarter, more equitable cities, NYCV’s priorities were reflected in nearly every conversation, a reminder that state and local governments can lead when federal efforts lag.

Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, now with Bloomberg Philanthropies, delivered a keynote speech stressing the role individual states have in achieving climate targets. She emphasized that even in the absence of \ federal leadership, climate champions like New York must continue to lead on clean energy, emissions reductions, and environmental protections.

NYLCV’s mission to evaluate, endorse, and elect environmentally focused candidates remains essential in advancing this vision. Our work bridges the gap between grassroots advocacy and policy implementation, ensuring that ambitious climate goals are backed by political will and public support.

A Broader Perspective on the Energy Transition

Topics ranged broadly, from smart grid technologies to circular manufacturing. Whether discussing regenerative agriculture or advanced recycling systems, the summit reinforced that climate solutions must be integrated, interdisciplinary, and scalable.

Some other key insights from the conference included:

Expanding possibilities for public-private partnerships in funding the transition, including models supported by green banks and philanthropic capital, even in the face of unfavorable economic forecasts.

The need to better align climate finance and long-term infrastructure planning, particularly in high-cost, high-risk sectors like storage, carbon capture, and electrification.

These initiatives are reshaping the company’s financial trajectory and positioning it for long-term viability in the premium private aviation market.

Cost-Cutting and Fleet Modernization: The Foundation of Financial Recovery

Wheels Up’s 2024-2025 strategic overhaul has yielded measurable results. For Q2 2025, the company reduced its net loss by 15% year-over-year to $82.3 million and narrowed its Adjusted EBITDA loss by 22% to $29.0 million [1]. These improvements stem from a $50 million annual cost-saving plan, driven by fleet simplification, overhead reductions, and operational streamlining [2]. The shift to premium aircraft like the Embraer Phenom 300 and Bombardier Challenger 300 has already transformed 17% of the fleet, with plans to add three more Challenger 300s in Q3 2025 [3]. This modernization not only enhances customer experience but also improves unit economics, as premium jets offer higher utilization rates and lower maintenance costs compared to older models [4].

The financial impact is evident: despite a 3% revenue decline in Q2 2025, Wheels Up’s Adjusted Contribution Margin rose by 4 percentage points to 12.2% year-over-year [5]. This margin expansion underscores the effectiveness of cost discipline in offsetting revenue headwinds, a critical step toward breakeven.

Delta Air Lines: A Catalyst for Growth and Stability

Delta Air Lines’ partnership has been instrumental in Wheels Up’s turnaround. Beyond financial backing—a $100 million undrawn revolving credit facility and $150 million term loan [6]—Delta has integrated its corporate sales force into Wheels Up’s operations. This collaboration has unlocked a 25% year-over-year surge in corporate membership fund sales, with corporate customers now accounting for 45% of Wheels Up’s membership fund mix in Q2 2025 [7]. Delta CEO Ed Bastian has emphasized that this synergy is central to Delta’s premium travel strategy, leveraging its 20 million SkyMiles members to create a direct pipeline for Wheels Up’s services [8].

Delta’s influence extends beyond sales. By incorporating Wheels Up into its loyalty program, Delta offers SkyMiles members one million miles for using the private jet service, effectively converting its high-net-worth customer base into a growth engine for Wheels Up [9]. Additionally, Delta’s access to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fleet optimization expertise has helped Wheels Up align with ESG trends, a growing differentiator in the premium travel sector [10].

Integrated Corporate Sales: A New Revenue Engine

The integration of Delta’s corporate sales team has been a game-changer. Wheels Up CEO George Mattson noted that corporate sales are “outpacing expectations,” with the channel now representing the fastest-growing segment of membership fund sales [11]. This success is attributed to Delta’s ability to cross-sell Wheels Up to its corporate clients, who value the flexibility and prestige of private aviation. The hybrid model—allowing Delta One passengers to extend their itineraries with Wheels Up private jet legs—has further broadened the customer base, appealing to high-income professionals and HNWIs [12].

Risks and the Road to Profitability

While progress is clear, challenges remain. The private aviation market is highly competitive, and converting corporate sales into long-term profitability will require sustained execution. However, Wheels Up’s 2026 timeline for full cost-cutting results and fleet modernization completion offers a clear path to breakeven [13]. With the $500 million credit facility from Delta and other investors providing financial stability, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the $40 billion private aviation market, which is growing at 12% annually [14].

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Premium Travel’s Future

Wheels Up’s strategic turnaround—anchored by cost discipline, fleet modernization, and Delta’s ecosystem—has laid a robust foundation for long-term growth. The combination of improved margins, diversified revenue streams, and a scalable partnership model suggests that UP could emerge as a key player in the premium travel sector.

In an exclusive conversation with BioSpectrum Asia, Christopher Ong, Managing Director of DHL Express Singapore, shares how DHL’s latest investments — including a new €10 million pharmaceutical hub — are strengthening Singapore’s position as a strategic life sciences and healthcare logistics hub for the Asia Pacific region

How is DHL contributing to Singapore’s role as a strategic hub for the life sciences and healthcare industry in the Asia Pacific region?

At DHL, we align closely with Singapore's strategic vision to position itself as a leading global hub for life sciences and healthcare (LSHC). Singapore’s robust infrastructure, strong regulatory framework, and prime geographic location has become an attractive spot for multi-nationals and upcoming researchers to establish their presence in Singapore, especially in dedicated estates such as Tuas Biomedical Park and Biopolis. As Singapore’s biomedical sector continues to thrive, manufacturing products valued at nearly S$38 billion (estimated €25.4 billion) for global markets (JTC, 2025), DHL is committed to supporting this growth by providing tailored logistics solutions that meet the evolving needs of the life sciences and healthcare sector.

To do this, we recently launched our €10 million pharmaceutical hub in Singapore to enhance our capabilities and drive innovation in this space. At 8,200 square meters, the new pharma hub brings our total warehouse space in Singapore for dedicated LSHC operations to over 36,000 square meters. This is a major step for us in offering a full, comprehensive suite of solutions for the LSHC industry in cold-chain warehousing, pharmaceutical finished goods, and clinical trials.

The DHL Express global network also connects more than 220 countries and territories globally, with 3 global hubs, 19 regional hubs, and close to 300 aircrafts. In 2024, we upgraded our South Asia Hub (SAH) located by Singapore Changi Airport, further enhancing our global connectivity and boosting our operational capacity on the ground. SAH was established in 2016 to serve as a key logistics hub connecting Singapore to the rest of the world. Today, the hub is also home to five DHL-owned Boeing 777 freighters that optimise transit times between the Americas and Asia. We are equally well-equipped to serve Europe. Our Europe to Asia connection, operated by cargo airline AeroLogic since 2009, remains strong. A joint venture between DHL Express and Lufthansa Cargo, our AeroLogic network mainly serves routes between Europe and Asian destinations from Monday to Fridays, strengthening our service offerings to customers.

Our strong global aviation and ground network and ongoing investments are critical in building our life sciences and healthcare infrastructure and logistics capabilities to support Singapore’s role as a leading global life sciences and healthcare hub.

What does DHL's recent investment in a new pharmaceutical hub in Singapore entail?

Our new pharmaceutical hub in Singapore marks a significant enhancement of DHL’s healthcare logistics capabilities. The hub features specialized temperature-controlled zones, including ambient (15°C to 25°C) and cold room (2°C to 8°C) that ensures precise storage conditions for sensitive healthcare products. It is also Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant and features advanced cold chain infrastructure like airtight loading docks and dedicated anterooms. This is critical in ensuring uninterrupted temperature stability throughout the logistics process.

Located near the Tuas Bio-Medical Park, DHL’s new pharma hub also offers seamless connectivity to Changi Airport and Tuas Mega Port, enabling efficient regional and global distribution for our pharmaceutical partners.

Our vision does not stop here. We are already looking at introducing pharma-related value-added services such redressing activities within this facility. Regional partners can expect more development in the Asia Pacific, especially with DHL’s commitment to invest €500 million into healthcare logistics in Asia Pacific by 2030 to meet the increasing demands and complexities of the market.

How DHL addressing the needs of medical device companies operating in Singapore?

We are focused on deploying specialized logistics solutions tailored for the medical device sector. The export landscape for medical devices is complex and navigating it requires a comprehensive understanding of local regulations to ensure compliance and market access. Our shipping solution, DHL Worldwide Medical Express, or WMX caters specifically to this sector. This solution is designed to help companies navigate the complexities of shipping life-saving medical components internationally and is particularly beneficial for urgent deliveries of time and temperature-sensitive shipments.

Other offerings in the pipeline include dedicated warehousing options for seamless transits, customised transportation options for timely deliveries, advanced tracking systems that provide real-time visibility throughout the logistics process and meet UN 3373 and IATA Dangerous Goods standards.

In addition, we have DHL Certified Life Science Healthcare Specialists that are always ready to help our customers maintain adherence to the regulatory framework governing medical devices by providing guidance to navigate product classifications and compliance requirements across countries. Customers can also opt for shipment insurance that protect their shipments in transit too.

The number of clinical trials in Singapore has been relatively steady the past decade. How can DHL provide value to this segment?

We understand the multi-faceted logistical challenges surrounding clinical trials and take great care in offering comprehensive logistics services tailored for these trials to facilitate a smoother clinical trial workflow and value-add to the drug development process. In Singapore, this is done through temperature-controlled transportation and customized supply chain solutions that guarantee the timely delivery of clinical trial materials, be it investigational drugs, investigational medicinal products, or biological samples. Our services include real-time tracking and monitoring to ensure that all shipments are handled with the utmost care and precision.

WMX shipments receive top priority within our DHL network, with pickups by our couriers as late as possible in the day and deliveries at the earliest available service. Within Asia Pacific, our WMX solution prioritises temperature-controlled, time-critical shipments from over 20,000 clinical sites. Customers can also leverage DHL’s robust and extensive network across the Asia Pacific region to deliver their shipments from main metropolitan cities into Singapore within the next working day. A Saturday delivery option is also available upon request.

Can you elaborate on DHL’s cold chain facilities in Singapore and their importance for temperature-sensitive shipments?

Our cold chain facilities, including the newly opened pharmaceutical hub, are vital for maintaining the integrity of temperature-sensitive medical shipments. Equipped with cutting-edge monitoring technologies, these facilities ensure optimal temperature control throughout the handling process during shipping. By using our WMX service, customers can choose from ambient (room temperature), controlled-ambient (15°C to 25°C), refrigerated (2°C to 8°C), frozen with dry ice (-80°C), frozen (-15°C to -25°C), and ultra-deep frozen (below -180°C) options when shipping their active pharmaceutical ingredients. Contingency activation services like dry ice replenishment and access to refrigerated facilities are also available.

Just this year, our expertise in cold chain management was further strengthened by DHL’s acquisition of Cryoport’s CRYOPDP. CRYOPDP specializes in providing white-glove courier services. This strategic partnership with Cryoport integrates DHL's global health logistics capabilities with Cryoport's industry-leading expertise, giving us an edge in the provision of specialised solutions in a fast-growing life sciences and healthcare market segment.

Besides ensuring optimal temperature control, time is of essence when transporting temperature-sensitive shipments. Coupled with priority pickup and delivery services, our in-house customs team is experienced in clearing priority shipments to maximise efficacy for our customers.

How does DHL balance high-compliance healthcare logistics with its decarbonisation targets in Singapore?

As the healthcare sector in Singapore increasingly prioritises sustainability (Healthcare Asia, 2024), we recognize our role in supporting these efforts. Our investments are aimed at creating a more sustainable supply chain that not only meets international compliance standards but also addresses the environmental impact of healthcare logistics.

At DHL, we started our sustainability journey in 2009 to drive carbon efficiency, and in 2017, we were the first company in the transport and logistics sector to set a 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target. Last year, we strengthened our commitment by introducing a 4th bottom line to our new DHL Group Strategy 2030 - Green Logistics of Choice (on top of Employer of Choice, Provider of Choice, Investment of Choice).

We have been using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a lever in our emission reduction targets for air transportation since 2021. Most recently in July 2025, we signed a deal with Neste to supply 9.5 million litres of SAF from Singapore Changi Airport, one of the largest deals by volume in the air cargo sector in Asia. DHL customers can also opt in for GoGreen Plus and choose a desired proportion of SAF to be used in their international shipments through a “book and claim” system that targets their Scope 3 emissions through carbon insetting.

We have also been converting our ground fleet to electric vehicles (EVs) for last mile pickup and deliveries since 2022. Today, at the Express team, we are the proud operator of over 100 EVs, the largest fleet of commercial EV vans in Singapore.

As the managing director of DHL Express Singapore, what do you think sets DHL apart from other service providers?

I strongly believe that our people bring about growth and quality. Each DHL Express employee goes through a Certified Internal Specialists (CIS) programme that imparts values, and technical and soft skills. It is not by chance that we have been certified by global people analytics and consulting firm Great Place to Work® Institute as the Number 1 Great Place to Work in Singapore for 5 consecutive years, since 2020.

The culture of building a great workplace for all motivates employee to bring about great service quality for customers which eventually lead to customer loyalty, ultimately driving profitability that allows us to reinvest into our business to strengthen our infrastructure and capabilities.

With regards to our life sciences and healthcare segment, we build a culture around what is inside the box – a crucial shipment that can help save lives. This culture permeates throughout our entire logistical chain, where everyone works towards the same vision – to ensure that your time and temperature-sensitive shipments gets delivered to its destination on time.

Finally, how does DHL ensure pandemic resilience in its logistics operations?

The agility to respond to a global pandemic is not built overnight. Over time, DHL has established a robust framework to bolster resilience within our network and operations. In 2020, our capabilities were put to the test during the COVID-19 pandemic when we had to ensure the effective distribution of vaccines efficiently. Despite the lockdown, we did not close for a single day during the pandemic, and we were able to deliver the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines (and eventually over 11 million doses) successfully to Singapore, showcasing our ability to navigate even the most complex logistics challenges flexibly and reliably. As a group, DHL delivered over 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to over 160 countries in total.

COVID-19 will not be the last global pandemic. Our extensive global transportation networks and substantial local presence, coupled with our rapidly growing cold chain capabilities and scalable supply chain - and a proven track record in crisis response shows we are prepared for future health events and can be trusted to handle the logistical needs of the healthcare industry.

Transportation is a critical part of any health crisis, and we, at DHL, are in the business of supporting the healthcare system through the work we do, which is reflected in our mission – Excellence. Simply Delivered.

Hawaiian Airlines recently unveiled the forthcoming application of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on designated routes between Osaka, Japan, and Honolulu, Hawai. This undertaking, conducted in partnership with Alaska Airlines and Cosmo Oil Marketing Co., is designed to achieve meaningful reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and to advance the promotion of sustainable tourism within the Asia-Pacific corridor. By pioneering the deployment of SAF on international Asia–Pacific services, the carrier seeks to combine a rigorous response to the rising global demand for travel with a measurable commitment to minimising the environmental impacts of its operations.

This step not only aligns with the airline’s sustainability goals but also strengthens tourism between Japan and Hawaii, a region known for its pristine beaches and vibrant culture. Passengers on flights between Kansai International Airport in Osaka and Honolulu will be among the first to experience the benefits of SAF, which can cut life-cycle carbon emissions by up to eighty percent compared to traditional jet fuel.

A Game-Changer for Eco-Tourism

Hawaii’s tourism industry is one of its key economic pillars, with over ten million visitors arriving annually. The introduction of SAF on flights between Japan and Hawaii is poised to enhance the appeal of both destinations, offering an eco-friendly travel option for sustainability-conscious travellers. Tourists can now travel with peace of mind, knowing their flight contributes to reducing global carbon emissions.

The collaboration marks a significant leap towards greener aviation and could become a model for other airlines operating in the Asia-Pacific region. Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint considerably, helping to make tourism more sustainable for future generations.

Cosmo Energy Group’s Role in SAF Production

Cosmo Energy Holdings, a key partner in this initiative, is leading the charge in Japan’s sustainable fuel production. Through a subsidy from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO), Cosmo has developed a supply chain for SAF production, using domestically sourced used cooking oil. The partnership with Hawaiian Airlines allows for the first commercialisation of locally produced SAF in Japan, marking a historic milestone in the country’s push for more sustainable fuel options.

This collaboration not only addresses the aviation sector’s carbon emissions but also promotes local sourcing of materials, further enhancing the environmental benefits of this initiative. As Japan strives to meet its 2050 net-zero carbon emission target, this move demonstrates the country’s commitment to developing sustainable energy solutions and reducing environmental impact.

Promoting Sustainable Travel Between Osaka and Honolulu

As the travel industry increasingly focuses on environmental responsibility, the introduction of SAF will be a key factor in drawing eco-conscious tourists to Hawaii. The initiative enhances the appeal of Honolulu and Osaka as eco-tourism destinations. Hawaii is known for its unique ecosystems, while Japan’s cultural heritage and scenic landscapes continue to attract millions of visitors each year. This partnership highlights both regions’ dedication to balancing tourism with environmental sustainability.

In addition, the use of SAF supports the broader sustainability goals of both Hawaiian Airlines and its parent company, Alaska Airlines. The airlines have ambitious plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, and this move is a significant step toward reaching that target. Through investments in cleaner technology and sustainable fuel sources, the airlines aim to reduce their overall environmental impact.

A Shared Vision for a Greener Future

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, both long-established in the aviation industry, are now at the forefront of sustainability efforts. The airlines’ commitment to SAF, alongside other innovations in technology and fleet modernisation, aligns with their goal of making air travel more environmentally friendly.

The expansion of the SAF programme is part of a wider trend in the aviation industry to address climate change and promote sustainable tourism. This initiative provides a valuable opportunity for visitors to enjoy the beauty of Hawaii and Japan while supporting eco-friendly practices.

The Future of Travel: How SAF Benefits the Tourism Industry

The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on the Osaka–Honolulu route marks a significant advancement in the advancement of responsible tourism. As conscious travel becomes a central concern for increasing numbers of international visitors, this initiative serves as a prototype for expanding low-environmental-impact flight possibilities. When regarded alongside the rising consumer preference for eco-oriented journeys, the carbon-offset advantages derived from the use of SAF may in due course recalibrate the strategy for managing long-haul aviation.

Passengers flying the Osaka–Honolulu leg can take in Hawaii’s world-renowned shoreline, rich cultural heritage, and varied outdoor pursuits while knowing that their travel-related greenhouse-gas discharge has been markedly diminished. The gesture goes beyond compliance and underscores the obligation of the hospitality industry to sustainable governance, thereby preserving for subsequent generations the allure of both the Japanese archipelago and the Hawaiian Islands.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Airlines-1-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 17:56:39.094354

Quelle: PM Air France","Am 25. August 2025 nahm Air France in Paris ihren 46. Airbus A220-300 vom Airbus-Standort in Mirabel (Kanada) in Empfang. Der Überführungsflug war eine Premiere: Das Flugzeug wurde mit einer Mischung aus 50 Prozent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ausgeliefert, die direkt von Airbus zertifiziert wurde. Dieser Fortschritt zeugt vom Engagement von Air France-KLM, die Dekarbonisierung des Luftverkehrs voranzutreiben.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) spielt eine zentrale Rolle bei der Reduzierung des CO₂-Fußabdrucks des Luftverkehrs. Es ermöglicht eine Verringerung der CO₂-Emissionen über ihren gesamten Lebenszyklus hinweg um mindestens 65 Prozent im Vergleich zu herkömmlichem Kerosin.

Air France-KLM gehört zu den drei weltweit führenden Anwendern von SAF und verfolgt eine strenge Beschaffungspolitik: Es werden nur nachhaltige Kraftstoffe ausgewählt, die nicht in Konkurrenz zur menschlichen Nahrungsmittelversorgungstehen, nicht zur Abholzung von Wäldern beitragen und nicht aus Palmöl hergestellt werden.

Eine weitere gemeinsame Initiative der Gruppe und des Herstellers: Air France-KLM und Airbus haben eine Vereinbarung geschlossen, die es den Mitarbeitenden von Airbus ermöglicht, den CO₂-Fußabdruck ihrer Geschäftsreisen zu reduzieren, indem sie die SAF-Produktion unterstützen. Diese freiwillige Verpflichtung ist Teil des „SAF Corporate“-Programms von Air France-KLM, das die Finanzierung und den Kauf von SAF ermöglicht. Seit seinem Beitritt zum SAF-Programm im November 2023 hat Airbus durch den Kauf von mehr als 670 Tonnen SAF die CO2-Emissionen um mehr als 2.000 Tonnen reduziert.

Die Erneuerung der Flotte ist ein zentraler Bestandteil der Transformationsstrategie der Air France-KLM-Gruppe. Mit einem um 20 Prozent geringeren Treibstoffverbrauch und CO₂-Ausstoß pro Passagierkilometer im Vergleich zu Flugzeugen der vorherigen Generation verkörpert der Airbus A220 dieses Ziel.

Air France-KLM hat fast 200 Flugzeuge der neuen Generation (Airbus A220, A320neo, A321neo, A350 und Boeing 787) fest bestellt, und allein im vergangenen Jahr 41 Flugzeuge der neuen Generation für alle ihre Fluggesellschaften in Empfang genommen.

Diese strukturellen Investitionen – in Höhe von mehr als zwei Milliarden Euro pro Jahr – tragen dazu bei, dass bis 2030 bis zu 80 Prozent der Flotte der Air France-KLM-Gruppe aus Flugzeugen der neuen Generation bestehen werden.

Green hydrogen is a clean fuel, and producing it directly from seawater lowers costs and energy use.
A similar idea was explored at Northwestern University to draw nearly limitless energy from the soil using microbial fuel cells.
While the power output is relatively small, it shows how unexpected bio-resources can help real communities meet basic energy needs.
Many of these technologies struggle with high implementation costs, limited infrastructure, and skepticism from policymakers that favor established fuel sources.","In a world dominated by talk of solar panels, wind turbines, and nuclear reactors, some of the most fascinating breakthroughs in energy are happening in unexpected places. Scientists are experimenting with everything from using moisture to break down plastic into usable recycled material, to turning seawater into hydrogen, and even converting banana peels into biogas.

The future of energy isn't just about creativity, it's also about accessibility. A clean technology only matters if it's affordable enough to be adopted widely. That's why researchers are increasingly looking at low-cost, everyday materials that most of us see as waste. Imagine if the dredges of your morning coffee or the leftovers from a winery could one day fuel cars, buses, or even planes.

What once seemed useless might just be the key to fueling the world. So, let's take a look at 10 unexpected energy sources you probably never imagined could be turned into fuel.

Your daily caffeine fix might do more than help you live longer — it could literally power the bus you take to work. It sounds unbelievable, but researchers have discovered that used coffee grounds contain oils suitable for biodiesel production. A London-based startup called Bio-Bean, has already partnered with transport authorities to turn discarded coffee grounds into biofuel for buses.

The process is simple but brilliant. The grounds are collected from coffee shops, processed to extract oil, and converted into biodiesel. Remarkably, this new fuel works seamlessly in existing diesel engines, so there's no need for costly modifications. This approach is not only efficient, it's also eco-friendly because it reduces waste, lowers emissions and reduces the need for fossil fuels.

Billions of cups of coffee are consumed globally each year, producing massive amounts of waste. If even a fraction of that waste were redirected into fuel, the environmental impact would be enormous.

Seawater, which covers more than 70% of our planet, could become a major source of clean energy. At the University of Adelaide, scientists have developed a method to turn seawater into green hydrogen fuel, without the costly removal of the salt content. Traditional electrolysis (splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen) usually requires purified water because salt corrodes the electrodes. By using a specialized non-precious catalyst, the team bypassed this problem.

The benefits are huge. Green hydrogen is a clean fuel, and producing it directly from seawater lowers costs and energy use. Beyond the lab, companies like Equatic are scaling this idea further, with a process that not only extracts hydrogen fuel but also forces seawater to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, locking it away as stable minerals. This means the ocean doubles as both a carbon sink and a fuel factory.

While large-scale adoption is still in progress, this discovery could completely transform energy production, offering a pathway to clean fuel and climate action at the same time.

It sounds like a science fair prank, but urine can actually generate electricity. Researchers at the University of Bath have developed miniature fuel cells that harness bacteria to break down compounds in urine. As the microbes digest the waste, they release electrons, which flow through a circuit to produce an electric current. A similar idea was explored at Northwestern University to draw nearly limitless energy from the soil using microbial fuel cells.

This method has been trialed in schools in Kenya and Uganda, where it powers LED lights in bathrooms and even charges small electronics. Beyond the novelty factor, this technology excels in places where grid power is expensive or unreliable, converting waste into a low-cost source of electricity.

While the power output is relatively small, it shows how unexpected bio-resources can help real communities meet basic energy needs. Who knew the restroom could be a mini power plant?

Tofu might be a protein-packed meal on your plate, but its production leaves behind loads of soybean pulp and wastewater. Instead of letting these byproducts go to waste, scientists have found a way to convert them into biogas using anaerobic digestion. In this oxygen-free process, microorganisms break down organic matter, releasing methane-rich gas that can be used for cooking, heating, or generating electricity.

Factories in Indonesia are already tapping into this system. What's clever is that tofu waste can produce the very energy that keeps tofu-producing factories running. It's cost-effective, sustainable, and reduces dependence on fossil fuels. Unlike high-tech innovations, this solution is relatively straightforward and simply repurposes existing waste materials and technology.

By turning food waste into fuel, tofu factories demonstrate how circular economies can reshape industries. Not only are they feeding people, they're also powering themselves and contributing to a greener energy grid.

Air travel is a notorious contributor to carbon emissions, but a slimy green solution could change that. Algae, rich in oils and fast-growing in saltwater, is emerging as a powerful candidate for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike crops like corn or soy, algae doesn't compete with food supplies and produces far more oil per acre of land.

What makes algae oil especially exciting is its high calorific value, meaning it releases significant energy when burned. Airlines are under pressure to adopt SAF under the European Union's RefuelEU Aviation regulations, which require 2% SAF use by 2025, rising sharply in future decades. Algae biofuel could help to meet this demand without straining agricultural land or freshwater resources.

This unusual fuel source seems like science fiction, but it's real and faces significant challenges. Large-scale cultivation, affordability, and building supply chains are just some of the hurdles preventing widespread adoption. Still, the vision of planes powered by photosynthetic organisms harvested from the sea is compelling.

Cows aren't just milk and beef machines — they're also renewable energy generators. Their manure, which has always been useful for crops, is now helping to light up houses and run machines. When processed in biogas plants, cow manure breaks down into methane-rich gas that can heat homes, generate electricity, and even fuel vehicles. The leftover material is a nutrient-rich biofertilizer, creating a zero-waste system.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 28 times stronger than carbon dioxide. When released into the atmosphere unchecked, it contributes heavily to global warming. By capturing it for energy, farms prevent harmful emissions while creating usable fuel. For example, in Japan, a biogas facility handles about 250 tons of manure daily, producing 1.2 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 2,200 homes per year.

This approach turns farms into power plants. Instead of contributing to climate problems, livestock operations can become part of the solution. It's dirty work, but the result is a cleaner environment and a steady source of renewable power.

Every bottle of wine we enjoy leaves behind a surprisingly large amount of skins, seeds, and stems that are collectively called grape pomace. Traditionally, wineries either discard this material or use small amounts for livestock feed, but researchers are now turning it into bioethanol. By fermenting the natural sugars found in pomace with yeast, ethanol is produced, which can then be blended into fuel for cars or used as a renewable energy source.

The process has major environmental advantages. Instead of letting grape waste rot in landfills where it would release methane (a powerful greenhouse gas), it's transformed into a clean-burning fuel, helping to reduce reliance on petroleum.

Countries with thriving wine industries such as France, Italy, and Spain are especially well-positioned to scale this technology. With millions of tons of pomace generated annually, the energy potential is vast. What was once winery trash could end up fueling cars, blending sustainability with one of the world's oldest industries.

Slipping on a banana peel is a comedy trope, but in real life those peels can generate energy. When processed in anaerobic digesters, banana waste breaks down to release methane-rich gas, which can be used for cooking and electricity. According to researchers from the Agro-Energy Group at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), banana waste can provide up to 55% of the electrical needs of the Ecuadorian province of El Oro.

The potential is massive. A single kilogram of dried banana peels can produce up to 0.3 cubic meters of biogas — enough to run a small generator. With more than 125 million metric tons of bananas produced worldwide each year, the fuel capacity is staggering.

Urban markets and food processors throw away tons of banana waste daily. Instead of leaving it to rot in landfills (where it releases methane anyway), centralized digesters can capture that energy for communities. In some regions, researchers are even producing bioethanol from banana waste for vehicles. That means your fruit snack could one day help fuel cars.

What happens to the truckloads of tomatoes that spoil before reaching supermarket shelves? Instead of being discarded, scientists have discovered that these rotting tomatoes can actually generate electricity using microbial electrochemical cells. In this system, microbes feed on tomato waste and release electrons during digestion. Electrodes capture those electrons, creating an electric current.

Tomatoes are especially useful in this process because they contain lycopene, a natural pigment that improves the transfer of electrons. Even small amounts of waste (just 10 milligrams) can produce about 0.3 watts of power, so imagine the potential in farming regions where tons of produce are often lost due to oversupply or transport issues.

If farms and processing plants harnessed this method, they could generate energy to power their own facilities instead of paying for costly waste disposal. Microbial fuel cells are still in the early stages of development, but they're a great example of turning food loss into useful energy.

Plastic pollution is one of the world's biggest environmental headaches, but what if trash bags and bottles could be transformed back into fuel? Through a process called pyrolysis, non-recyclable plastics are heated in the absence of oxygen. This breaks their long polymer chains into smaller hydrocarbons, producing pyrolysis oil, which is a viable alternative to gasoline.

Unlike traditional recycling processes, pyrolysis can handle dirty or mixed plastics. Startups such as Petgas in Mexico are already proving the concept, converting 1.5 tons of plastic waste into 356 gallons of fuel in a week. The market for this fuel is currently valued at more than $1.4 billion in the U.S. alone, and it's projected to significantly grow in the next decade.

Challenges remain but pyrolysis offers a promising way to turn a waste crisis into an energy opportunity. Instead of piling up in landfills or choking oceans, plastics could literally keep engines running.

The promise of waste-to-energy is exciting, but adoption isn't simple. Many of these technologies struggle with high implementation costs, limited infrastructure, and skepticism from policymakers that favor established fuel sources. However, without supportive policies and public buy-in, many of these ideas may remain trapped in laboratories instead of reaching communities.

The potential payoff of adoption is clear. Diverting food waste into anaerobic digesters would reduce landfill emissions, lower energy costs, and provide decentralized power for small businesses. Plastic-to-fuel plants could reduce both pollution and dependence on imported oil. For rural areas, manure or banana peels could mean reliable electricity without waiting for the grid.

The shift might take time, but it's worth it. Waste doesn't have to be a liability; it can be a lifeline. By tackling adoption challenges head-on, governments, industries, and communities can turn overlooked byproducts into the building blocks of tomorrow's energy system.",https://www.bgr.com/img/gallery/10-unexpected-energy-sources-you-didnt-know-could-be-used-as-fuel/l-intro-1756392754.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 13:56:48.094810

The area spread across 5,50,000 acres of arid land. This is nearly three times the size of Singapore. The project is expected to transform India’s renewable energy landscape.

Addressing shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting on Friday, Ambani said the site would install 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day at peak pace, making it among the fastest rollouts globally. Within the next decade, the project could generate enough power to meet almost 10% of India’s electricity needs.

The facility will be integrated with Reliance’s existing marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla, enabling large-scale solar and hydrogen production. Ambani added that Reliance will focus on producing and exporting green ammonia, green methanol and sustainable aviation fuel, with a goal of scaling up to 3 million tonnes per annum of green hydrogen equivalent capacity by 2032.

Reliance’s solar PV manufacturing platform has also become operational, with the first 200 MW of heterojunction technology (HJT) modules already rolling out. These modules deliver higher energy yield, improved temperature performance and lower degradation compared with conventional panels. The facility will expand to 10 GWp of capacity in the near term and eventually 20 GWp, making it the largest integrated solar manufacturing site in the world.

In parallel, the company is building giga factories for batteries and electrolysers. The battery unit will begin operations in 2026 with a capacity of 40 GWh, scalable to 100 GWh. The electrolyser unit is scheduled to start by end-2026 with 3 GW of annual capacity, supporting cost-competitive green hydrogen production.

Ambani said the integration of solar, storage and hydrogen under one ecosystem will bring cost and technology advantages while strengthening supply chain resilience, positioning Reliance as a leader in the global energy transition.

Alaska stands at a crossroads in its economic development. Vast untapped resources could propel our state into a new era of prosperity, but without the infrastructure to move them to market, they remain stranded. Central to unlocking this potential are the Point MacKenzie Rail Spur and Port MacKenzie.

The rail spur, a 32-mile extension connecting Port MacKenzie to the Alaska Railroad mainline near Houston, creates the shortest rail route from the Interior to tidewater. Port MacKenzie itself is a deep-draft facility across Knik Arm from Anchorage, with 9,000 acres of industrial land ready for exports and logistics. It is as ice-free as the Port of Anchorage, has never needed dredging, and can handle Panamax-size ships. The dock already has the safety features in place, making it an excellent solution for bulk exports.

This is not a pie-in-the-sky idea. Most of the infrastructure is already built, with nearly $184 million invested. What remains is leadership to finish the job. We cannot call ourselves a resource state while refusing to complete the transportation projects that move our resources to market. The return on investment is undeniable, and the benefits far outweigh any lingering concerns.

Completing the spur would mean thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions in new revenue. Up to 3,000 jobs in mining, timber, energy, and construction could be created, and the project could generate $300 million annually in royalties, fees, and taxes. A 2007 study projected $4.4 billion in long-term benefits. These are not speculative numbers; they reflect the enormous value of turning stranded assets into revenue-producing exports in a state that develops resources better, safer, and with more environmental concern than anywhere else in the world.

The resources are already there. Copper and zinc from the Ambler Mining District, where companies plan to export 1.7 million tons annually, could move through Port MacKenzie. The same is true for graphite, antimony, rare earths, and other minerals critical to modern technology. Timber and coal exports would gain new life with this route, reducing shipping costs by up to 70 percent compared to trucking or air. The biomass and LNG needed for globally required Sustainable Aviation Fuel are available through Port Mack and could be produced right there. In a global market where efficiency determines competitiveness, that margin is decisive.

This infrastructure would make Alaska’s resources competitive in global markets, especially with our Indo-Pacific Allies. It would directly support projects such as the $43 billion Alaska LNG development, which depends on efficient material transport. For a state struggling with declining oil revenues and population stagnation, diversification through Port Mack is not optional; it is imperative.

The advantages are not just economic but strategic. Alaska’s Interior holds critical minerals the nation needs for technology, renewable energy, and defense. Today those assets are trapped, forcing dependence on foreign suppliers, including China, for materials like rare earths and antimony. Completing the rail spur aligns with President Trump’s 2025 Executive Order expanding rail infrastructure for oil, gas, timber, coal, and minerals. It advances energy independence, strengthens national security, and supports Arctic defense by creating an efficient logistics route between Interior bases and tidewater.

Critics point to Port MacKenzie’s limited past use, but without rail access the port cannot attract the volume needed for viability. This is a chicken-and-egg problem. Completing the spur breaks the cycle, opening the door to high-volume and bulk exports and finally putting this asset to work for Alaskans.

The construction progress underscores how close we are. Seventy-five percent of the spur is complete, including 25 miles of embankment, bridges, 110 culverts, and a one-mile loop. What remains is track and signaling. This is not a shovel-ready project; it is beyond shovel-ready and overdue.

Concerns about navigation in Cook Inlet and winter operations are real but not insurmountable. They are the same issues faced by the Port of Anchorage. More powerful tugboats and skilled pilots have already solved these challenges, and operators themselves confirm the risks are well within their capabilities. What is not acceptable is continuing to let our mineral wealth sit idle while past investments gather dust.

Diversification for Alaska is not optional; it’s imperative. We need infrastructure that creates jobs, broadens our revenue base, and strengthens our position in global supply chains. The Point MacKenzie Rail Spur and Port MacKenzie do exactly that. They offer Alaska the chance to move from potential to production, from stagnation to growth.

The next governor must make this project a priority. That means securing federal grants, state bonds, and private investment to finish the job. It means streamlining regulations to move construction forward. And it means standing up to critics who are content to watch opportunity slip away for political reasons. Alaska cannot afford another decade of delay.

In the end, this is not about politics or one port or rail line. It is about whether Alaska will live up to its identity as a resource state. The jobs, the revenue, the strategic advantages, and the diversification are all within reach. What we need now is the leadership to bring them across the finish line.

The Point MacKenzie Rail Spur and Port MacKenzie are the linchpins of Alaska’s future. They will define whether our resources remain stranded in the Interior or flow to world markets. They will determine whether our state prospers or continues to tread water. The choice before the next governor is simple: finish what Alaska has already started, or let our resources, and our children’s future, remain stranded. The right choice is clear.

Ce vol constitue une étape cruciale vers une aviation plus respectueuse de l’environnement, tout en soulignant l’importance de l’innovation pour lutter contre la pollution.

Le SAF : un carburant révolutionnaire

Le SAF, ou carburant d’aviation durable, révolutionne le secteur par son origine principalement issue de déchets organiques. Il utilise des huiles de cuisson usagées et des graisses animales, transformées par un procédé appelé HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). Ce mélange contient également un pourcentage de kérosène aromatique synthétique dérivé de sucres végétaux. Cette composition permet au SAF d’être entièrement compatible avec les infrastructures actuelles de l’aviation. Virgin Atlantic mise sur ce carburant pour atteindre l’objectif ambitieux de zéro émission nette de carbone d’ici 2050, soulignant son rôle essentiel dans la décarbonation du secteur.

Les traînées de condensation : un défi majeur

Outre l’efficacité du SAF, le vol de Virgin Atlantic a permis de mettre en lumière un autre enjeu environnemental : les traînées de condensation. Ces traces blanches, laissées par les avions, jouent un rôle significatif dans le réchauffement climatique. Une étude récente révèle que 57 % de l’impact climatique de l’aviation entre 2000 et 2018 est attribuable à ces traînées, surpassant même les émissions de CO2. Le Rocky Mountain Institute, en collaboration avec d’autres partenaires, explore des solutions pour minimiser cet effet en partageant les données collectées lors du vol avec l’industrie aéronautique.

Un soutien gouvernemental indispensable

Ce vol historique n’aurait pas été possible sans le soutien du gouvernement britannique, qui a assuré son financement. Cela a non seulement permis la réalisation du vol, mais a aussi encouragé les recherches sur les traînées de condensation. Le gouvernement s’engage à partager les découvertes avec l’industrie pour élaborer des procédures de vol visant à réduire l’impact climatique. Ces initiatives sont essentielles pour atteindre les objectifs environnementaux fixés et stimuler l’innovation dans l’aéronautique.

India is set to launch its first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) plant by year-end 🚀 Using used cooking oil from restaurants, hotels, and food chains, IOC will produce 35,000 tonnes of eco-friendly fuel annually 🌍💚

Used cooking oil is being transformed into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), offering a promising solution for greener air travel. This innovative approach reduces carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The process involves collecting used cooking oil, filtering and purifying it, and then refining it into jet-grade SAF through a series of chemical processes!

India has taken a significant step in this direction with the launch of its first green jet fuel plant in Panipat, powered by used cooking oil. This plant is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the country's sustainability goals 2. The use of SAF from used cooking oil is gaining traction globally, with airlines and countries exploring this eco-friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels.

A big leap towards cleaner skies and greener travel! 🌱✨

Ia menjelaskan, penguatan produktivitas petani merupakan satu dari dua kunci utama yang diusung PTPN IV PalmCo untuk mendukung program nasional mewujudkan ketahanan pangan dan energi nasional.
Tanpa itu, kita akan kehilangan daya saing sekaligus melemahkan kontribusi sawit bagi ketahanan pangan dan energi.
Jika kolaborasi untuk intesifikasi tersebut dapat terlaksana dengan baik, maka bukan hanya ketahanan pangan dari sektor sawit yang dapat di wujudkan, melainkan target pemerintah dalam implementasi B50 pada 2027 bisa terpenuhi.
“Jadi selain kunci meningkatkan produktivitas petani, dan penguatan prinsip ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) juga harus berjalan berkesinambungan,” tegas Jatmiko.","Jambi, Koranpelita .co – Direktur Utama PTPN IV PalmCo Jatmiko Santosa menyatakan kolaborasi menjadi kunci dalam upaya mewujudkan ketahanan pangan dan energi nasional. Kolaborasi tersebut, kata dia, dapat diwujudkan dengan mendorong intesifikasi produktivitas sawit petani yang saat ini masih memiliki ruang besar untuk optimalisasi.

Hal itu disampaikan Jatmiko di hadapan ratusan peserta seminar internasional, The 2nd International Conference on Agirculture, Food and Enviromental Science (ICAFES) tahun 2025 yang terdiri dari 60 dekan Fakultas Pertanian seluruh Indonesia, dosen, peneliti, dan mahasiswa pertanian saat menjadi keynote speakers di Universitas Riau, Pekanbaru, Sabtu hari ini (30/08/2025).

Kegiatan itu turut para ahli pangan dan lingkungan dari berbagai belahan dunia seperti Johan Kieft ahli lingkungan Badan Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa, Dr Idesert Jelsma peneliti Belanda, Prof Ir Usman Pato yang merupakan peneliti bidang ketahanan pangan lulusan Gifu University Jepang, serta sejumlah peneliti akademisi lainnya dari Malaysia dan Filipina.

Dalam pemaparannya, Jamtiko mengatakan bahwa ruang terbesar untuk penguatan ketahanan pangan dan energi dari komoditas sawit, yang selama ini menjadi penyumbang ekonomi Indonesia, bahkan pada saat beberapa krisis yang terjadi, adalah penguatan produtkivitas sawit petani.

“Ruang terbesar untuk improvement adalah dari sisi petani. Kita semua dapat berkolaborasi bersama, untuk meningkatkan produktivitas petani sawit Indonesia melalui intesifikasi,” kata Jatmiko.

Ia menjelaskan, penguatan produktivitas petani merupakan satu dari dua kunci utama yang diusung PTPN IV PalmCo untuk mendukung program nasional mewujudkan ketahanan pangan dan energi nasional.

Saat ini, rerata produktivitas petani sawit Indonesia masih di kisaran 2–3 ton crude palm oil (CPO) per hektare per tahun, jauh dari korporasi perkebunan yang dikelola secara profesional yang mampu mencapai 6 ton.

Untuk meminimalis disparitas itu, ia mengatakan PTPN IV PalmCo telah menempuh beragam inisiatif penting untuk mendongkrak produktivitas petani, mulai dari Program BUMN Untuk Sawit Rakyat, penyediaan bibit unggul bersertifikat yang kini tercatat lebih dari dua juta batang bibit sawit unggul telah diserap petani, penerapan skema off-taker yang menjangkau lebih dari 10.200 hektare, serta penguatan sistem kelembagaan organisasi koperasi.

Hingga 2024, PalmCo telah mendukung pencairan dana BPDPKS untuk areal peremajaan sawit mitra KUD seluas 15.321 hektare. Keberhasilan model kemitraan ini terlihat dari produktivitas tanaman menghasilkan (TM) plasma yang mencapai rata-rata 12,57 ton/Ha, bahkan ada yang mencapai 18,05 ton/Ha, melampaui standar nasional 12 ton/Ha.

“Peremajaan sawit rakyat (PSR) adalah kunci. Tanpa itu, kita akan kehilangan daya saing sekaligus melemahkan kontribusi sawit bagi ketahanan pangan dan energi. Dan melalui forum ini, kami berharap ke depan kita akan saling berkolaborasi dan bersinergi untuk bersama-sama memperkuat inisatif ini,” jelas Jatmiko yang disampaikannya menggunakan bahasa Inggris.

Jika kolaborasi untuk intesifikasi tersebut dapat terlaksana dengan baik, maka bukan hanya ketahanan pangan dari sektor sawit yang dapat di wujudkan, melainkan target pemerintah dalam implementasi B50 pada 2027 bisa terpenuhi. Untuk diketahui, target alokasi biodiesel B50 itu diperkirakan membutuhkan pasokan sekitar 20,11 juta kiloliter.

Lebih jauh, dalam paparannya, Jatmiko turut menyinggung bahwa perubahan iklim bukan lagi ancaman di masa depan, melainkan kenyataan yang berpotensi berdampak terhadap produktivitas pertanian global, termasuk komoditas kelapa sawit Indonesia. Tantangan ini jika tidak disikapi dengan bijak, maka sejarah Indonesia yang pernah menjadi eksportir gula di tahun 1930-an silam, dan kini malah menjadi salah satu importir gula terbesar dunia, juga dikhawatirkan akan terjadi dengan komoditas CPO.

Berdasarkan data yang ia paparkan, selama dekade 2015-2024 yang tercatat sebagai periode terpanas dalam sejarah, dengan konsentrasi CO₂ mencapai level tertinggi. Dampaknya, setiap kenaikan suhu 1°C menurunkan hasil panen antara 3,1 hingga 7,4 persen sehingga memicu yang disebut sebagai ‘climateflation’-kenaikan harga pangan akibat anomali iklim.

“Sehingga ini memerlukan solusi berkelanjutan yang hanya dapat diwujudkan melalui kolaborasi seluruh stakeholders, termasuk bapak ibu akademisi,” tuturnya lagi.

Sebagai produsen minyak sawit mentah (CPO) terbesar dunia yang menyumbang sekitar 60% pasokan global, ia menyebut Indonesia memiliki peran krusial. Namun, industri ini menghadapi tantangan multidimensi. Selain ruang perbedaan produktivitas antara petani dan korporasi yang tinggi, tekanan regulasi sustainability, khususnya dari Uni Eropa, juga semakin kompleks.

“Jadi selain kunci meningkatkan produktivitas petani, dan penguatan prinsip ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) juga harus berjalan berkesinambungan,” tegas Jatmiko.

Komitmen ESG PalmCo diwujudkan dengan pengembangan energi baru terbarukan (EBT). PalmCo telah mengoperasikan 7 unit Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Biogas (PLTBg) dan 4 unit co-firing biogas dengan total kapasitas 9,3 MW. Bahkan, perusahaan sedang dalam proses seleksi mitra untuk pengembangan 20 unit Compressed Biomethane Gas (CBG) dan 1 fasilitas Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Sehingga, di akhir penjelasannya, ia kembali menegaskan bahwa investasi strategis, kebijakan yang efektif, inovasi, dan kolaborasi yang erat antara petani dan industri, merupakan fondasi essential untuk membangun ketahanan dan mengamankan sistem pangan dan energi yang berkelanjutan bagi Indonesia.

“Sekali lagi kami sampaikan, kolaborasi adalah kunci menuju solusi berkelanjutan. Kesempatan ini kami harap menjadi awal yang baik untuk bersama mewujudkannya,” demikian dia.(Rizal).",https://koranpelita.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG-20250831-WA0023.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 13:58:00.243554

Global tours are known for their relatively heavy carbon footprints. However, Chris Martin and the band pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by half compared to their last world tour.

Four years later, with the ongoing 2025 leg at London's Wembley Stadium, Coldplay is reportedly standing by that commitment. The band claims that

""72% of all tour waste has been diverted from landfill and sent for reuse, recycling, and composting.""

That is an improvement from 66% in 2023. Moreover, eighteen shows in 2023 were powered entirely by a tourable battery system built from recycled BMW batteries. Coldplay has also funded two solar-powered ocean cleanup river interceptors. Notably, for every ticket sold, a tree has been planted through the global reforestation nonprofit organization, One Tree Planted.

Their signature LED wristbands have also been reworked to be 100% reusable, recyclable, and made from plant-based materials. Dancefloors at select shows are designed to generate electricity when fans jump. These are a few of the sustainability steps that Coldplay has taken.

Regarding CO2 emissions, the band states on their official website:

""Where we cannot reduce, we will be drawing down any unavoidable emissions following recognised best practices such as guidance within the Oxford Principles for Net-Zero Aligned carbon offsetting. We have teamed up with DHL as the tour’s Official Logistics Partner in order to minimise emissions from freight and transportation.""

They also add:

""As leaders in the field of sustainable transport and logistics, DHL support the tour by offering solutions to minimise logistics-related emissions and other environmental impacts, from advanced biofuels in the air to electric vehicles on land. Where we cannot reduce, we will be drawing down any unavoidable emissions following the guidance within the Oxford Principles for Net-Zero Aligned carbon offsetting.""

Some other steps that Coldplay have mentioned on their website are as follows:

SOLAR: We install solar photovoltaic panels in the build-up to each show, behind the stage and on top of PA and delay towers. The show batteries start charging as soon as we arrive at the venue.

SUSTAINABLE BIOFUELS: Across the tour we are utilising renewable diesel, a palm-oil free HVO-type (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) biofuel, produced 100% from renewable raw materials, primarily waste and residues such as used cooking oil. HVO use can lower generator carbon emissions significantly. HVO also fuels our trucking in as many locations as possible, meaning super-low emissions - as much as 75 to 95% reduced emissions, from these parts of our show transportation as well.

BATTERY SYSTEM: Prior to the tour we worked with experts to develop the first ever mobile, rechargeable show battery, made from recyclable BMW i3 batteries, which can power 100% of our show with renewable energy wherever we take it. We have a number of other batteries in use that we can charge from multiple sources including solar energy and even kinetic energy from the fans.

KINETIC ENERGY: We install kinetic floors in locations around the stadium so that the fans' dancing can be converted into energy and literally help to power the show. We also install electricity-generating power bikes so that fans can actively charge our show batteries.

GRID RENEWABLES: Whenever it is available, we use mains power from 100% renewable sources.

Notably, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin also pledged to take public transport whenever possible. He arrived in Cardiff by train for the band's shows at the venue.

Coldplay's partners for sustainable logistics, DHL, employ a carbon intelligence and monitoring system. For air transportation, DHL's GoGreen Plus program ensures Sustainable Aviation Fuel is used for the band's freight flights.

In June 2024, Coldplay announced that direct emissions from the first two years of the tour were 59% lower than their 2016-17 tour. DHL helped achieve an 85% reduction per flight compared to fossil fuels. That resulted in a 31% decrease in total transportation emissions in 2023.

New Delhi: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance is developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects spread across 5,50,000 acres of dry land in Kutch, Gujarat. This entire area is three times the size of Singapore. This information was shared on Friday, August 29, by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani.

At its peak, the solar project will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day, making it among the fastest installations globally, said Mukesh Ambani.

The site could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity needs

Addressing the shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting, Ambani said that the site could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity needs within the next decade. The project will connect seamlessly with Reliance’s marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla, enabling large-scale solar and hydrogen integration.

Production of green ammonia, green methanol, & sustainable aviation fuel

The company will produce and export green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel, positioning India as a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives. The company plans to scale up to 3MTPA (million tonnes per annum) of green hydrogen equivalent production capacity by 2032, while the initial focus will be on meeting Reliance’s own captive demand, said Ambani.

Reliance’s solar PV manufacturing platform is now operational

Ambani also announced that Reliance’s solar PV manufacturing platform has become operational, producing its first 200 MW of heterojunction technology (HJT) modules. These deliver 10% higher energy yield, 20% better temperature performance, and 25% lower degradation.

The platform will expand to 10 GWp per annum of integrated solar PV manufacturing capacity in the coming quarters and further to 20 GWp, making it the largest solar manufacturing facility and the most integrated single-site solar complex globally.

Reliance is constructing battery and electrolyser giga factories

Reliance is also constructing battery and electrolyser giga factories. The battery giga factory will start functioning in 2026 with 40 GWh annual capacity, expandable to 100 GWh, while the electrolyser giga factory will start by end-2026 with a capacity of up to 3GW per year, enabling large-scale, cost-competitive green hydrogen production.

Ambani said the integrated solar, battery storage, and hydrogen ecosystem under one roof will provide scale, cost and technology advantages, and supply chain resilience, creating long-term value as the global energy transition gathers pace.

Conversely, Praj Industries faces intense near-term pressure due to ethanol policy stagnation and geopolitical uncertainties, balanced by promising green energy diversification prospects.","Rail Vikas Nigam (RVNL), REC, Praj Industries were among losers on Friday as overall market sentiment was bearish during the week. RVNL touched yearly lows and there are many other public sector companies that could see fresh 52-week lows next week. IREDA and IRFC are also looking weak on technical charts. Praj Industries also faces selling pressure and the stock touched 52-week low during Friday's session. TopNews Team has reviewed news and technical levels for these stocks.

Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL): Navigating Earnings Headwinds Amid Contract Wins

RVNL reported a 40% year-over-year profit decline in Q1 fiscal 2026, sinking to Rs 134.36 crore, fueled predominantly by diminished revenue and operational challenges. Revenue from operations dipped roughly 4% to Rs 3,908.77 crore, while total income contracted 4.6% year-on-year to Rs 4,136.96 crore. This underperformance triggered a significant share price drop, with RVNL down about 24% year-to-date in 2025 and trading beneath crucial technical moving averages, reflecting bearish momentum.

The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for continued short-term weakness. Meanwhile, fresh Letters of Acceptance from Southern Railway and IRCON International signal ongoing contract acquisitions that may bolster future revenue streams. Notwithstanding, RVNL's full fiscal year 2025 revenue missed analyst forecasts by nearly 9.5%, with earnings per share also falling short by 11%.

Analyst Perspectives on RVNL

Market sentiment for RVNL is cautious, as recent analyst ratings predominantly cluster around ""hold"" and ""strong sell"" recommendations, with no current ""buy"" endorsements. Price targets vary, averaging approximately Rs 272 for the next twelve months, ranging from Rs 204 at the low end to Rs 340 at the high end. Anticipated revenue growth is modest, forecasted at a CAGR of roughly 9.7% over the coming two years, lagging behind the broader construction sector's 13% growth rate. This positions RVNL amidst moderate growth prospects but with pronounced near-term margin pressures and operational risks.

REC Limited: Strong Fundamentals Amid Market Pessimism

REC Limited recently touched a fresh 52-week low around Rs 350, declining over 8% in a single week and falling approximately 44% year-on-year. The stock currently trades below all primary moving averages (5, 20, 50, 100, 200-day), reflecting a bearish investor outlook.

Despite these headwinds, REC exhibits compelling long-term financial health, boasting a return on equity of about 20.3% and a robust dividend yield exceeding 5%, signaling intrinsic value that appears undervalued in the short term. The company also announced record PBDIT of Rs 14,520.76 crore and profit after tax of Rs 4,465.71 crore in its latest disclosures. Institutional holdings remain strong at 34.72%, underscoring sustained institutional confidence.

Analyst Sentiment and Price Targets for REC Limited

From a coverage perspective, 14 analysts recently assigned REC a decisive ""strong buy"" consensus. Average price targets hover near Rs 525, with projections ranging from Rs 460 to as high as Rs 633. This analyst optimism reflects belief in the stock’s undervaluation and confidence in a recovery trajectory underpinned by solid fundamentals and positive earnings surprises.

Praj Industries: Challenges Amid Ethanol Market Uncertainty and Green Energy Ambitions

Praj Industries faces a difficult year, with shares down over 50% year-to-date and foreign portfolio investor holdings dropping to a six-quarter low near 16.9%. Persistent profit declines have marked the trend, including an 8.4% drop in Q1 consolidated revenue and a striking 94% plunge in profits. Market caution stems from achieving the 20% ethanol blending target (EBP20) without further mandates, dampening near-term growth prospects.

Geopolitical uncertainty, notably US tariff policies, has delayed capital expenditure and growth momentum. However, the company reported a healthy order intake valued at about Rs 7,950 million, which could offer some near-term revenue stability. Management highlights that India’s installed ethanol capacity now surpasses current blending needs, likely deferring additional expansions until policy revisions occur.

Analyst Views on Praj Industries

The stock carries a neutral rating from analysts, averaging a one-year target price of Rs 444, with a range from Rs 346 to Rs 580. This stance encapsulates cautious optimism, tempered by profit margin pressures and demand uncertainties. The company’s long-term vision targets Rs 100 billion in revenue by 2030, fueled by ventures into sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, biopolymers, and other clean energy sectors, buoyed by favorable US policies incentivizing clean fuel production and carbon capture.

Praj Industries receives a balanced perspective from eight analysts featured on TradingView and MarketScreener, with Axis Securities offering commentary on cautious order flows and demand.

Strategic Conclusion for Investors

By August 2025, these three equities reveal markedly differing outlooks shaped by company-specific and macroeconomic factors.

Managing Director (Current Charge), Dhaka Bank

The Daily Star (TDS): How would you evaluate the current state of sustainable banking in Bangladesh?

A K M Shahnawaj (AKMS): Sustainable banking in Bangladesh has made remarkable strides in recent years, transitioning from a niche concept to a core strategic priority within the financial sector. The pivotal role of Bangladesh Bank — through its sustainable and green finance guidelines, refinancing facilities for renewable energy and energy-efficient projects, and mandatory sustainability reporting — has been instrumental in accelerating this growth. At Dhaka Bank, we have wholeheartedly embraced these initiatives, embedding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations deeply into our lending and investment decisions.

While sustainable finance currently represents a growing segment of the credit market, the foundation is firmly in place for rapid expansion. With increasing awareness, advancing technical capacity, and evolving transition finance, we are confident that Bangladesh is well positioned to scale sustainable finance significantly to meet its climate and sustainable development goals. The progress so far inspires optimism for a green and resilient future.

TDS: What sustainable financing/refinancing schemes does your bank offer, particularly for SMEs, women entrepreneurs, or other environmentally responsible enterprises?

AKMS: Dhaka Bank is deeply committed to promoting sustainable finance and actively participates in Bangladesh Bank's refinancing initiatives targeting renewable energy, particularly solar power, energy-efficient machinery, waste management, effluent treatment, and eco-friendly industrial projects. For sectors such as Ready-Made Garments and large-scale manufacturing, we leverage programmes including the Refinance for Environment-Friendly Green Projects, the Technology Development Fund, and the Green Transformation Fund to facilitate the adoption of energy-efficient technologies.

For SMEs, we provide access to government and central bank refinance schemes, including the Tk. 25,000 crore CMSME programme at 7% interest, the agro-processing refinance facility, and the SME Foundation's revolving fund at 6%. Additionally, our Start-up Fund offers young entrepreneurs concessional loans of up to Tk. 80 million at just 4% interest.

We also provide targeted financing for businesses in rural areas, marginal traders, and women entrepreneurs, with concessional rates as low as 5%, including our Oditiya Loan designed specifically for women entrepreneurs.

Through these efforts, Dhaka Bank aims to promote inclusive growth and contribute to Bangladesh's sustainable development.

TDS: What initiatives has your bank undertaken to promote sustainable banking, and what measures have you implemented to reduce your own carbon footprint?

AKMS: At Dhaka Bank, sustainability is deeply ingrained in both our operational framework and corporate culture. We have dedicated Sustainable Finance Help Desks in every branch to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk assessments into our credit appraisal processes through the Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) matrix.

Furthermore, training and awareness programmes are conducted to cultivate sustainability-mindedness among employees, ensuring accountability and engagement throughout the organisation.

Internally, we have implemented several initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint. These include digitising workflows — for example, adopting a ""go green"" approach for bill collection — to significantly lower paper consumption, and upgrading to energy-efficient lighting across our branch network.

Moreover, Dhaka Bank has recently partnered with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to enhance our capacity for measuring and managing financed emissions. This collaboration underscores our commitment to transparency and accountability in assessing the environmental impact of our loan and investment portfolios, positioning us among the pioneers in Bangladesh to adopt globally recognised carbon accounting standards.

TDS: What challenges has your bank encountered in adopting and promoting sustainable banking practices?

AKMS: We face several challenges. Many borrowers lack the technical capacity to develop green projects and often perceive sustainable technologies as costly with delayed returns. The absence of standardised ESG data complicates impact assessment and risk evaluation. Although Bangladesh Bank's refinancing schemes are beneficial, the local market for green bonds and sustainability-linked loans is still emerging, limiting financing avenues for large-scale initiatives. Moreover, cultivating a sustainability mindset among clients and staff requires sustained education and incentives.

TDS: What are your bank's future plans to advance sustainable banking, and what support do you seek from the government?

AKMS: Our strategy focuses on three key pillars: scaling, innovation, and partnership. We plan to increase our green financing portfolio substantially, focusing on renewable energy generation, climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable agriculture, and energy-efficient industrial modernisation.

We intend to introduce innovative financing instruments such as sustainability-linked loans, where borrowers receive better terms for meeting ESG targets, and explore partnerships with international climate funds to secure concessional financing for Bangladesh's green transition.

In terms of government support, fiscal incentives such as tax breaks for green investments, import duty exemptions on eco-friendly technologies, and targeted grants or subsidies will catalyse private sector participation. Capacity-building programmes are also vital — training entrepreneurs, stakeholders, and bankers in sustainable practices ensures long-term market growth and effectiveness.

A supportive, predictable regulatory environment combined with targeted incentives will be crucial for mobilising private capital at scale to meet the country's ambitious sustainable development goals.",https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/08/31/shahnawaz.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 20:56:10.209694

Esteemed Members,

Welcome to the 66th Annual General Meeting of your Company.

This annual meeting is not just a statutory occasion but a celebration of our shared journey — a journey built on trust, resilience, and a steadfast commitment to energise India’s progress.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each one of you for your continued confidence in the Company and for staying invested in our vision.

Business Outcomes

The year gone by reminded us that energy is never just about markets and molecules; it is shaped by the pulse of geopolitics.

The Russia–Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continued to cast a shadow on global stability. New fault lines in the Middle East, disruptions in the Red Sea, and heightened tensions around the Strait of Hormuz unsettled vital energy corridors. Towards the close of the year, tariff hikes in the United States added fresh headwinds, shaking investor confidence.

Against this backdrop of volatility and uncertainty, your Company delivered a resilient performance during 2024–25.

Sales volumes crossed the historic 100 million metric tonne mark, supported by beyond-capacity processing across 10 refineries.

Our 20,000 km pipeline network ensured seamless movement of hydrocarbons, underscoring the strength of our integrated model.

With over 40,000 fuel stations energising 3.2 crore customers every day, and Indane LPG trusted in 15 crore kitchens, IndianOil remains at the heart of India’s energy ecosystem.

Alongside refining and marketing, we maintained a strong presence in petrochemicals, natural gas, and E&P, reinforcing our diversified energy footprint.

On the financial front:

Revenue from Operations stood at ₹8.45 lakh crore, keeping us among India’s top three corporates.

Net Profit was ₹12,962 crore — the highest among OMC peers, though moderated from last year due to weaker refining margins, LPG under-recoveries, and exchange losses.

In Q1 FY 2025–26, your Company delivered its highest-ever quarterly sales and a consolidated net profit of ₹6,808 crore — nearly double that of the same period last year.

SPRINT: Powering Transformation

Resilience alone is not enough. To sustain leadership, we must evolve with speed and agility. With this vision, we launched Project SPRINT this fiscal.

SPRINT sharpens competitiveness across six focus areas:

Strengthening core businesses

Optimising costs

Reinforcing customer-centricity

Accelerating innovation and digitalisation

Nurturing talent

Advancing the energy transition

At its heart lies the 3Cs (Core, Cost, Customer) and 3Ts (Technology, Talent, Transition).

The impact is already visible:

One refinery is on track to become the first PSU refinery in India to achieve a Quartile-1 ranking in the Solomon Benchmarking Index.

Nearly half of new PSU OMC retail outlets since April 2025 have been IndianOil’s.

Non-fuel revenues grew 49% year-on-year in the first four months of this fiscal.

Cost optimisation initiatives are delivering higher efficiency and sustained profitability.

Reinforcing the Legacy

As India prepares to become the largest driver of global oil demand by 2035, your Company is scaling:

Refining capacity from 80.75 MMTPA to 98.4 MMTPA by 2028.

Pipeline network beyond 22,000 km, with 21 projects underway.

Petrochemicals capacity from 4.3 MMTPA to over 13 MMTPA by 2030, with a sharp focus on specialty chemicals.

We also advanced in upstream with 25 assets across India and overseas, including new hydrocarbon discoveries in Abu Dhabi, resumption in Libya, and acquisition of Mercator Petroleum in the Cambay Basin.

India’s Energy Lifeline

From fuel stations, LPG, and CNG to aviation, mobility, lubricants, and natural gas, IndianOil continues to be India’s most trusted energy partner.

Highlights of 2024–25 include:

14,000 EV chargers and 865 battery-swapping stations, advancing clean mobility.

68 Way Side Amenities and 138 Apna Ghar facilities for highway users and truckers.

LPG leadership strengthened with 45% market share and the launch of Chhotu Master (compact 5 kg LPG cylinder + cooktop).

Servo lubricants expanded to 45 countries, including the launch of Servo Futura eV for electric vehicles.

Natural gas sales surged 20% to 7.9 MMTPA; CGD JVs now cover 21% of India’s population.

Pioneering Innovation

Our R&D Centre is driving breakthroughs in green hydrogen, SAF, 2G ethanol, fuel cells, and carbon capture.

eCO₂Sorb, our patented enzyme-based carbon capture solution, is at pilot scale.

42 start-ups incubated under our Start-up Scheme have already generated 86 IPRs and 4 commercialized patents.

The upcoming New R&D Campus at Faridabad will lead frontier research in alternative energy and advanced sciences.

Transition to a Future-Ready Portfolio

We are transitioning into a diversified, integrated energy company anchored on three pillars:

Green Hydrogen – 10,000 TPA plant at Panipat (India’s largest).

Sustainable Aviation Fuel – India’s first ISCC-CORSIA certified SAF project; 30 KTPA from used cooking oil at Panipat.

Renewables – Clean energy portfolio scaling from 1 GW today to 18 GW in three years.

This green shift is supported by strong sustainability actions — 7 lakh trees planted, 89% wastewater reuse, GreenCo certifications, and a Net Zero by 2046 roadmap requiring ₹2.5 lakh crore investment.

Investments and Asset Optimisation

In 2024–25, IndianOil invested ₹40,000 crore, accounting for over one-fourth of MoPNG PSU CAPEX.

Over 160 projects worth ₹2.6 lakh crore are under execution.

Committed ₹1.66 lakh crore over five years with sharp focus on petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewables.

New revenue streams in bitumen, bunkering, LNG, cryogenics, and data transmission services are being seeded.

IOC Global Capital Management (IGCMIL) at GIFT City executed USD 500+ million in transactions, evolving into a Global Treasury Centre.

Driving Social Impact

In 2024–25, IndianOil spent ₹583 crore on CSR, touching 1.36 crore beneficiaries.

Healthcare focus: TB elimination, cancer care, sickle cell anaemia, dialysis centres.

Skilling & empowerment: Women, Divyangjan, and children rehabilitated through Badhte Kadam.

Growth for us is meaningful only when it uplifts lives.

Building Sports Champions

IndianOil athletes won 239 medals in 2024–25, including 85 global medals and India’s historic 29-medal Paralympics haul.

Our DivyaShakti initiative supports 100 para-athletes, half of them women. We remain committed to women’s hockey, para federations, and India’s “Road to LA 2028.”

Governance & Closing

Your Company upholds the highest standards of corporate governance, transparency, and preventive vigilance.

At the core of our journey lies one promise — energising lives with reliability, responsibility, and foresight.

I express my sincere gratitude to the Government of India, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, regulators, banks, employees, stakeholders, and above all, our customers for their enduring trust and support.

With your continued encouragement, IndianOil will keep energising lives, unlocking new frontiers, and advancing our shared aspiration of a Viksit Bharat.

Thank You.

Managing Director, Eastern Bank

The Daily Star (TDS): How would you assess the current state of sustainable and green banking in Bangladesh?

Ali Reza Iftekhar (ARI): Over the past decade, sustainable and green banking in Bangladesh has made remarkable progress. When Bangladesh Bank first introduced its Sustainable Finance Policy and Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) guidelines, banks mostly treated them as compliance requirements. Today, sustainability has become a strategic priority for the country's leading institutions.

The banking sector now recognizes that financing cannot be separated from realities such as climate change, resource scarcity, and the demand for inclusive finance. Bangladesh Bank has accelerated this shift with green refinancing schemes, channeling affordable funding into renewable energy, waste management, and other green projects. The recent adoption of IFRS S1 and S2 on sustainability and climate disclosures has further aligned us with global standards.

Eastern Bank PLC (EBL) is proud to be ranked among the top ten sustainable banks in Bangladesh Bank's 2024 Sustainability Rating. For us, this recognition validates our long-term ESG commitments—but it is not a destination. It is a responsibility to keep moving forward.

TDS: What sustainable or green financing/refinancing schemes does your bank offer, particularly for SMEs, women entrepreneurs, or environmentally responsible enterprises?

ARI: At EBL, inclusiveness is central to our sustainable finance strategy. In 2024, 35.24% of our total term loan portfolio was directed to green projects—almost double the previous year. Overall, 89% of our portfolio now qualifies as sustainable finance.

We actively utilize Bangladesh Bank's refinancing schemes and have already disbursed over BDT 200 crore to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and waste management ventures. Beyond financing, we offer training, advisory support, and flexible repayment terms for SMEs and women entrepreneurs whose businesses embrace sustainability. We also mobilize foreign funding from DFIs such as IFC, DEG, FMO, OFID, and ADB, primarily for green investments.

To encourage innovation, our EBL Startup Explorer program, launched with Startup Bangladesh, directly finances green and impact-driven startups. We also partner with NGOs to provide tailored refinancing solutions to grassroots entrepreneurs. Our vision is clear: make sustainable finance accessible not just to large corporates, but also to SMEs, women entrepreneurs, and innovators driving change from the ground up.

TDS: What initiatives has your bank undertaken to promote sustainable banking, and how are you reducing your own carbon footprint?

ARI: Sustainability at EBL goes beyond financing—it is embedded in our operations.

Our Head Office is a green building, equipped with solar glass panels generating 16 kW of electricity daily, along with rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment facilities. We use hybrid vehicles, smart AC systems, and energy-efficient lighting to further reduce consumption.

We are steadily moving towards a paperless culture. By digitizing LC processing, we've reduced paper use by 40–45%, saving more than a million sheets each year. Our e-leave, e-appraisal, and e-learning systems cut paper use further. On the customer side, digital platforms like EBL Connect and SkyPay process billions of taka electronically, reducing the carbon footprint of cash handling while enhancing efficiency and convenience.

EBL is also among the first banks in Bangladesh to measure Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, including financed emissions, through the Joint Impact Model (JIM). Additionally, our partnership with DHL's GoGreen Plus program reduces 30% of emissions from trade document transport by using Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

TDS: What challenges has your bank encountered in adopting and promoting sustainable banking practices?

ARI: While progress is evident, challenges remain.

Data gaps: Measuring financed emissions across diverse industries remains difficult due to limited data quality and availability.

Awareness and capacity: Many borrowers—particularly SMEs—lack the technical know-how to adopt green technologies. Banks often need to invest in awareness and capacity-building before financing can be effective.

High upfront costs: Renewable energy or green building projects involve significant initial investment, discouraging entrepreneurs despite long-term savings. Here, concessional funding from Bangladesh Bank and DFIs plays a vital role

We believe stronger policy support—such as tax incentives for green technology and a carbon credit framework—would accelerate adoption across the financial sector.

TDS: What are your bank's future plans to advance sustainable banking, and what support do you seek from the government?

ARI: Looking ahead, EBL plans to introduce Green Deposit and Green Asset products, allowing customers to directly contribute to sustainable projects. We are also piloting a Climate Risk Diagnostic and Management Model with IFC and DEG, which integrates climate risk into credit decisions—making us one of the first banks in Bangladesh to embed climate risk into portfolio management.

To scale up these efforts, we seek government support in three areas:

1. Incentives for green investment — including interest subsidies, tax benefits, and accelerated depreciation for renewable and energy-efficient technologies.

2. Capacity-building programs — equipping SMEs and entrepreneurs with the skills to adopt sustainable practices.

3. A robust carbon market framework — enabling banks and businesses to monetize emission reductions and attract greater climate finance.

(Alaska Airlines) -- Hawaiian Airlines will blend sustainable aviation fuel on select flights between Osaka and Honolulu. --

The initiative supports Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines’ strategy to reduce carbon emissions and grow the SAF market.

Hawaiian Airlines today announced it will be incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on flights between Osaka, Japan, and Honolulu, Hawai‘i under a sales agreement between parent company Alaska Air Group Inc., and Cosmo Oil Marketing Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings Co., Ltd. Fuel deliveries beginning this month at Kansai International Airport will mark the first time Hawaiian Airlines has introduced SAF – which can lower life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

""Japan is an important international market for Hawaiian Airlines, and we appreciate Cosmo’s investment in locally sourced SAF – the most effective technology to lower our carbon emissions – that we are now using on our flights between Osaka and Honolulu.” -- Alanna James, Sustainability innovation directorHawaiian Airlines

The SAF traded under this agreement was commercialized following Cosmo’s receipt of a New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) subsidy from the Japanese government in 2021, aimed at establishing a supply chain model for SAF production from used cooking oil sourced domestically in Japan. Cosmo Energy Group’s facility will be the first to mass produce SAF in Japan and the SAF will come with ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU certifications. These certifications are part of the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) initiative, which recognizes compliance with international standards for sustainable products.

""SAF is one of our key decarbonization products and plays an essential role in the decarbonization of the aviation industry. We are delighted to contribute to the decarbonization efforts of global airline Alaska Airlines and its customers through SAF. Moving forward, we will continue to support the realization of a decarbonized society, starting with this collaboration, by promoting the use of SAF.” -- Naoki Takayama, President and representative directorCosmo Oil Marketing Co., Ltd.

The fuel will be produced by SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC, a joint venture formed by Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION, and REVO International Inc.

""Since 2021, with the support of the Japanese government, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, and NEDO, we have been working with JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION, Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., and REVO International Inc. to commercialize SAF. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone involved for helping to build a major wave of domestic resource recycling through activities such as ACT for SKY and Fry to Fly.” -- Takeshi Takada, Representative SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC

The Cosmo Energy Group has worked to establish a supply chain to deliver Japan’s first locally made SAF, with the goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Group is also helping build social momentum through initiatives such as an ongoing pilot program to collect household used cooking oil at service stations for repurposing into SAF feedstock.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines – both founded more than 90 years ago to connect communities, bring people together, transport products, and enable economic growth – are committed to stewarding their environmental impact to create a durable long-term future for the company. As the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. carriers, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have an ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 through investments in SAF, technology and fleet modernization, among other initiatives.

Chinese PFY prices started August on a minor hike due to steady overseas demand and firmer raw material prices.
In the US market, PFY prices followed China’s trend and rose in early August as tighter import availability was compounded by higher downstream buying.
Toward month-end, PFY prices stabilized, reflecting balanced procurement and normalized supply flows.
In the near future, PFY prices in China and the U.S. are expected to remain range-bound, with stability depending on the recovery in seasonal demand and volatility in feedstock prices.","In August 2025, prices of PFY in China and the United States moved in synchronized trajectory, reflecting similar market fundamentals. Both markets began the month on a positive note with strong procurement and upbeat export streams, but mid-month activities dampened pressure to close out the month in a more price range-bound atmosphere. Regardless of local differences in trade flows and production plans, the overall pricing trend of PFY remained synchronized, created by steady supply and moderate demand at textile and apparel markets.

Chinese PFY prices started August on a minor hike due to steady overseas demand and firmer raw material prices. Low PTA levels that limited cost-push support were countered by firm MEG prices to maintain production economics intact. Exports to the U.S., Germany, and India absorbed surplus availability, counterbalancing local softness in demand. Operating levels of production in the moderate-to-high range satisfied steady export orders. No material disruption was visible, and export markets priced competitively thwarted oversupply from cutting prices.

Towards the end of the month, however, declining PTA values and subdued apparel and home-textile offtake exerted downward pressure. With near-92% utilized spinning lines and hand-to-mouth buying at fabric mills, PFY prices softened before levelling off during the final week with unchanging operating rates and normalized purchasing.

In the US market, PFY prices followed China’s trend and rose in early August as tighter import availability was compounded by higher downstream buying. Import offers were raised by Asian vendors, and storm-related bottlenecks at Shanghai and Ningbo drove transit times out, increasing landed costs. Despite a small drop in freight levels, delivery frictions and cautious inventory management allowed sellers to resist deep cuts in prices.

Demand for PFY picked up for back-to-school and early fall programs, with apparel and home-furnishing categories maintaining steady penetration. A 1.75% sequential increase in apparel and accessories sales bolstered replenishment activity. Speculative buying remained in check, though buyers tolerated modest price increases in order to receive on-time delivery. Toward month-end, PFY prices stabilized, reflecting balanced procurement and normalized supply flows.

In the near future, PFY prices in China and the U.S. are expected to remain range-bound, with stability depending on the recovery in seasonal demand and volatility in feedstock prices. In China, preparations for autumn textile season may give mild support, while sustained weakness in local consumption and deteriorating PTA values may limit advances.

On the American side, import-side tightness is expected to ease with alleviating weather disruptions, but sustained demand from apparel and home-furnishing pipelines will underpin current levels of PFY price. Market participants will be closely observing feedstock cues and export dynamics, both sides navigating cautiously optimistic but supply-sensitive ground.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-30 16:56:21.115259

The company aims to capitalize on the growing demand for low-carbon fuels and the increasing adoption of renewable energy policies. Green Plains' strategy involves expanding its renewable energy production capacity, improving operational efficiency, and generating additional revenue through its nitrogen fertilizer business.

Green Plains (NASDAQ: GPRE), an ethanol producer, is undergoing a significant transformation from a consistent cash burn to a free cash flow positive business model. This transition is being driven by operational improvements and the realization of additional revenue streams through strategic investments in renewable energy and carbon capture technologies.

The company's strategy involves expanding its renewable energy production capacity, improving operational efficiency, and generating additional revenue through its nitrogen fertilizer business. Green Plains is leveraging the growing demand for low-carbon fuels and the increasing adoption of renewable energy policies to drive this transformation.

One of the key initiatives in Green Plains' strategic shift is the development of the Trailblazer pipeline. This pipeline, which is connected to three of the company's ethanol plants in Nebraska, will facilitate carbon capture and sequestration. The company plans to monetize the associated carbon credits, which are afforded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to boost revenues and EBITDA. Initial estimates suggest that this project could generate between $100-$150 million in EBITDA, making it a transformative project for Green Plains [1].

In addition to the Trailblazer pipeline, Green Plains has committed four additional plants to a prospective sequestration project through Summit Carbon Solutions. This project is still in the permitting phase but is expected to be in service by the first quarter of 2027. The company aims to use the enhanced carbon footprint of its ethanol plants to become eligible for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which could provide an EBITDA uplift to the company's baseline ethanol business [1].

The company's valuation reflects its transition. Historically, Green Plains has produced volatile EBITDA, with an average of approximately $50 million from the base business. Adding the $125 million benefit from the Trailblazer sequestration project drives the company's EBITDA for 2026 to approximately $175 million. On a forward basis, the company currently trades at roughly 6x 2026 EBITDA, implying a solid value play once this project is fully operational [1].

The sale of the Obion plant for $190 million has also significantly de-levered the company and removed high-cost debt. This transaction provides another layer of value for shareholders, as the company's enterprise value has decreased from $1 billion to approximately $940 million after the sale [1].

However, risks associated with Green Plains' business include reliance on government regulation. Regulatory and government delays can present significant hurdles to realizing the projected cash flows for either of the company's CCS projects. The company's reliance on government entities presents regulatory risks to revenue collection [1].

In conclusion, Green Plains' strategic shift towards free cash flow positivity is driven by operational improvements, the realization of additional revenue streams through carbon capture and renewable energy investments, and the sale of the Obion plant. The company's valuation reflects this transformation, and the market appears to be underestimating the value of the Obion sale. However, regulatory risks remain a significant challenge for the company.

To the modern traveller, they are evolving into aspirational lifestyle spaces, marrying convenience, luxury, and technology—ultimately to create unforgettable experiences that are just as much a part of the journey as the destination itself. In exploring this transformation and the future of travel loyalty, Travel Radar spoke with Christopher Ross, Chief Brand Officer and EMEA Executive Chair at Collinson International, behind Priority Pass.

Airports as Destinations: A Psychological Shift

Airports have evolved far beyond their original role as transit points to becoming destinations in their own right, Ross explains. This transformation has been driven by technological advancements that streamline the airport journey, allowing travellers to move seamlessly… and immerse themselves in new experiences once past security.

World-class airports like Changi and Hamad International have set new benchmarks in automation, service, and experience. For brands, Ross notes:

Airports are no longer just points of transit—they are high-value stages for storytelling, engagement, and loyalty building. The brands that will thrive are those that see the airport as a pivotal touchpoint, investing in experiences, services, and environments that make the journey not only endurable, but aspirational and memorable.

Technology That Connects Emotionally

Technology is not only streamlining journeys—it is also enhancing the emotional experience of travel. According to Ross,

The top three technologies people say are improving their journeys today are digital boarding passes (71%), fast-track through security (68%), and advanced security scanners (62%). These innovations help reduce stress and free up valuable time, allowing people to relax, explore, and savour the airport experience rather than simply rushing from one point to another.

This smoother journey creates richer moments.

Ultimately, the technologies that make the journey smoother are also the ones that create space for richer, more memorable moments, helping travellers to connect more deeply with their surroundings, their companions, and the overall experience of travel.

Priority Pass and the Premium Mindset

Priority Pass offers a network of over 1,700 lounges alongside unique experiences from gaming hubs to sleep pods. Ross explains:

Recent additions include services such as access to health and wellness content on-the-go with TrvlWell. From digital mindfulness modules to guided walking tracks, these resources help ease travel anxiety, save valuable time, and create a smoother, stress-free journey.

Smart technology, seamless digital access, and personalised experiences form the backbone of Priority Pass’ premium approach. Ross continues, “whether it’s more destination choices, or exclusive value-added services, Priority Pass is dedicated to helping travellers get to where they are going with greater ease and comfort.”

Exclusivity, and Loyalty

Airport lounges have become a symbol of lifestyle and brand affinity. Ross underscores this:

Our global Value of Travel Benefits research found that 94% of customers say they would consider switching card providers if airport lounge access was removed – making it a critical offering for customer loyalty and retention.

By offering premium lounge access, brands signal that they understand their customers’ lifestyles and aspirations. Ross continues by explaining how “lounge access benefits create a halo effect for brands, positioning them as enablers of elevated travel experiences, which is especially important for customers who prioritise convenience and luxury.

Opportunities for Growth: Wellness, Dining, and Tech

Airport lounges are busier than ever, and travellers’ expectations are rising. To stay ahead of this demand, Ross explains:

We’re consistently expanding the breadth of our inventory through collaborations, strategic partnerships, and innovation, as well as direct investment in new airport experiences and travel services. He continues, While demand is surging, we’re also making a focused effort to ensure travellers have the relaxing, seamless experience they expect. We’ve invested in technology to transform the control and flexibility available to travellers, such as tech that streamlines capacity management by offering Pre-book capabilities and a fully digital waitlist solution through partners.

Airport 2030: Predictive, Personalised, and Human

Ross envisions airports as “far more digitally connected, predictive, and personalised.” Automation will handle routine processes, while human presence will remain crucial:

Many travellers still see a human presence as a vital anchor in the sometimes-stressful airport environment. In the UK, for example, travellers say human support is essential for customer service (67%), at security and border control (59%), and in lost-and-found services (49%), ensuring automation enhances rather than replaces human reassurance.

Cross-Industry Collaboration: The Key to Seamless Travel

Ross emphasises that the future of airports relies on collaboration across airlines, airports, tech innovators, and loyalty platforms:

Creating seamless, emotionally resonant airport experiences requires every player in the travel ecosystem—from airlines and airports to technology innovators, experience brands, financial services, and loyalty platforms—to work in harmony.

He also notes that, Priority Pass also offers wellness benefits, co-working spaces, airport transfers, car rentals, and access to attractions at destinations, ensuring every journey is memorable.

Reimagining the Terminal

If given the chance to redesign one element of the airport journey, Ross’ focus is clear:

Personally, I would redesign the airport terminal itself. Today’s savvy travellers expect experiences that are authentic and tailored to their unique lifestyles and preferences. By leveraging this data intelligently and responsibly, airports and travel businesses can shape benefits and loyalty programmes that truly resonate with customers, making the airport a more enjoyable, efficient, and personalised space for everyone, and in turn driving both loyalty and revenue.

Airports are now stages for luxury, innovation, and engagement. Priority Pass exemplifies this evolution, offering travellers choice, comfort, and memorable experiences at every step—transforming the journey itself into a destination. For brands, this evolution signals a new era of loyalty, engagement, and aspirational storytelling.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/changi-airport-c-conde-nast-traveller-.webp,N,,2025-08-30 13:56:32.498125

The 737s, configured with 12 Business Class seats and 162 Economy Class seats, will primarily operate short- and medium-haul services. One of the airplanes has already entered service, while the other is expected to do so in the near future.

RwandAir is also expected to take delivery of a widebody Airbus A330-200 later this year.

Airline officials said the investment in additional aircraft will help the carrier grow its intra-Africa and international networks, while also improving reliability.

Earlier this month, RwandAir announced it will start new services to Mombasa, Kenya, and Zanzibar in Tanzania in December.

Disrupted Operations

In recent months, RwandAir has experienced a number of unexpected technical disruptions across its fleet. These issues temporarily reduced the number of aircraft available for operations and impacted the airline’s flight schedule.

But the situation is improving, and the affected aircraft have been returned to service, officials said.

“RwandAir is pleased to have resolved the challenges to our schedules over the last weeks, and to welcome our aircraft back into operation,” RwandAir CEO Yvonne Makolo said in a press release. “We would like to sincerely apologise to all of our customers whose travel plans were disrupted during this period, and thank them for their patience while we worked on service disruptions.

The Bottom Line Japan Airlines advances into the second half of 2025 with confidence, modern aircraft, and strong inbound demand.","Japan Airlines is steering into 2025 with a dual focus capitalizing on Japan’s unprecedented inbound tourism surge while navigating macroeconomic headwinds such as currency fluctuations and rising operational costs. By modernizing its fleet and strategically expanding market presence, the carrier aims to strike a balance between sustaining growth from booming visitor demand and ensuring long-term financial resilience.

Japan Airlines (JAL) moves into the second half of 2025 with a determined growth strategy. Strong inbound tourism drives international demand, while domestic travel remains solid. The airline strengthens its market position by pairing upgrades on long-haul aircraft with the continued expansion of its low-cost subsidiary ZIPAIR Tokyo. This combination allows JAL to appeal to both premium and budget-conscious travelers, widening its influence across multiple segments.

Passenger demand remains a clear strength, yet cargo revenue no longer matches pandemic-era highs. JAL offsets this shortfall by diversifying revenue streams, including ventures with logistics partners. Even with strong fundamentals, the airline faces external risks such as currency volatility, fluctuating jet fuel costs, and new sustainability requirements.

Fleet Renewal and Market Reach

Japan Airlines is speeding up its fleet renewal by retiring aging long-haul aircraft and bringing in the Airbus A350-1000. The new jets deliver greater fuel efficiency and come equipped with refreshed premium cabins designed to attract high-value travelers. The airline places the A350-1000 on its key route linking Tokyo Haneda (HND) with Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), a corridor where demand for premium seating remains especially strong. By upgrading the passenger experience on this route, the carrier strengthens its ability to secure higher fares while solidifying its standing in highly competitive international markets.

The carrier intends to roll out the Airbus A350-1000 on additional long-haul routes, targeting key gateways such as New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles. At the same time, it is boosting seasonal capacity on popular leisure destinations to widen international reach. Its low-cost arm, ZIPAIR Tokyo, continues to grow with affordable long-haul services, complementing the premium network. These combined efforts enhance passenger loyalty and allow Japan Airlines to engage travelers across every segment of the market.

Economic Pressures

Macroeconomic conditions present the largest challenges for JAL. Currency swings directly influence travel demand. If the yen strengthens, Japan becomes more expensive for foreign tourists, potentially slowing inbound growth. A weaker yen, however, may discourage outbound leisure and business travel, affecting balance on the other side of the market. JAL must adapt quickly to these shifts to preserve revenue flows.

Fuel costs remain another critical factor. Jet fuel represents the airline’s biggest variable expense. Analysts expect softer prices through the remainder of 2025, but volatility poses constant risk. Any price surge could place immediate pressure on margins, limiting JAL’s ability to reinvest in growth and modernization.

Sustainability Mandates

Japan advances toward a 2030 requirement mandating a 10% blend of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). JAL must prepare to meet this target despite higher costs and limited global supply. The airline faces pressure to secure adequate SAF volumes while controlling operational expenses. Success in this area strengthens its environmental credibility, but failure could expose it to regulatory and financial strain.

By maintaining strong inbound passenger demand and pricing power in premium markets, JAL positions itself to absorb some of these challenges. Nevertheless, SAF compliance represents one of the most significant long-term hurdles for the airline.

Investor Sentiment

Investors maintain confidence in JAL’s outlook despite risks. Over the past year, the airline’s stock returned more than 25%, driven by strong travel recovery and supportive economic conditions. Earlier disruptions tied to global trade policy briefly lowered confidence, reducing JAL’s price-to-earnings ratio to around 9.2. As recovery gained pace, investor trust rebounded, lifting multiples above 11 by midyear.

Not all investors remain optimistic, however. Some hedge against uncertainty by short-selling, citing exposure to fuel volatility, currency fluctuations, and supply constraints. The Japanese aviation sector adds complexity, as only two major carriers—JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA)—control the market. This duopoly creates stability but also means growth depends more on external factors such as aircraft deliveries and global economic shifts than on domestic competition.

Outlook for 2025

JAL enters late 2025 with strong momentum, a modernizing fleet, and rising passenger volumes. Its ability to capture both premium and budget travelers through JAL and ZIPAIR provides a clear competitive advantage. Currency trends, fuel markets, and sustainability regulations pose real challenges, yet the airline has shown agility in navigating turbulence before.

The path forward requires balancing innovation with financial discipline. By expanding long-haul capacity, investing in passenger experience, and adapting to regulatory shifts, JAL seeks to solidify its role as a leader in Asia-Pacific aviation. For investors, the picture remains cautiously optimistic: strong performance so far suggests resilience, but macroeconomic volatility means risks remain high.

The Bottom Line

Japan Airlines advances into the second half of 2025 with confidence, modern aircraft, and strong inbound demand. Its growth strategy hinges on capturing premium traffic with upgraded long-haul cabins, expanding low-cost options with ZIPAIR, and navigating external pressures such as fuel volatility and SAF mandates.

Japan Airlines is preparing for 2025 by modernizing its fleet and strengthening its market presence, aiming to harness Japan’s tourism boom while countering economic pressures like currency swings and rising costs.

The airline’s financial performance, bolstered by a recovering global travel sector, shows resilience and adaptability. However, success depends heavily on managing external risks that lie outside its control. For now, JAL demonstrates the ability to balance growth with caution, positioning itself as a carrier ready to compete on a global scale in an unpredictable environment.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Japan-Airlines-4-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 11:56:40.707994

Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney told shareholders on Saturday that the company will invest Rs 1.66 trillion over the next five years to scale up its traditional oil operations while pushing aggressively into petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewable energy.

Refining power: capacity to touch 98.4 mt

At the heart of IOC’s plan is a major upgrade of its refining business. The company will raise its crude oil refining capacity from the current 80.75 million tonnes per year to 98.4 million tonnes by 2028.

Expansion projects are underway at Panipat, Gujarat, and Barauni refineries.

The pipeline network will be scaled up to 22,000 km, supported by 21 ongoing projects.

New storage facilities, including in Nepal, will strengthen cross-border energy supply lines.

Petrochemicals push to cut imports

IOC is also turning its attention to petrochemicals, aiming to triple its output from 4.3 million tonnes today to more than 13 million tonnes by 2030. The focus will be on specialty chemicals, an area where India remains import-dependent.

Its retail presence of over 40,000 fuel stations will evolve into multi-energy hubs, integrating:

EV chargers and battery-swapping stations

CNG and LNG dispensing units

Expanded convenience services for India’s growing mobility market

Clean energy and the 2046 net-zero goal

A central pillar of IOC’s strategy is the energy transition. The company has earmarked ₹2.5 trillion for clean energy projects as it targets net zero operational emissions by 2046.

Key areas of focus include:

Expanding renewable power capacity from 1 GW to 18 GW within three years

Green hydrogen production facilities

Sustainable aviation fuel projects

Sahney stressed that this diversification will “future-proof IndianOil” while balancing national energy needs.

Natural gas and new business verticals

IOC’s natural gas segment is seeing rapid growth, with volumes rising 20 percent to 7.9 million tonnes annually. The business now spans:

49 geographical areas across 21 states

Coverage of 21 percent of India’s population

Beyond energy, IOC is expanding into allied businesses such as explosives, cryogenics, and shipping infrastructure, signalling its intent to tap into wider industrial opportunities.

Global headwinds, local resilience

Sahney acknowledged that global turbulence, from the Russia-Ukraine war to Middle East unrest and US trade barriers, continues to roil energy flows. Yet IOC posted record sales of more than 100 million tonnes in FY25, supported by:

A vast retail network reaching every corner of India

Strong pipeline infrastructure

LPG distribution to over 15 crore households

Large/Extra-large investors: Inflow ratio around 0.44–0.49, still showing some buying pressure but mixed sentiment.

Small/medium investors: Inflow ratios hover near 0.49–0.48, showing retail and smaller institutions are also cautious.

With a fund flow score of 7.62, the stock still holds a ""good"" rating in our proprietary scoring system, indicating that while there is a negative bias, the stock is not entirely shunned by the market.

Key Technical Signals

Technically, Veralto remains in a neutrality phase, with mixed signals from recent candlestick and oscillator indicators:

Bearish Engulfing (8/28/2025): Internal diagnostic score: 7.27 – this pattern could signal a potential reversal, but it's still too early to confirm.

RSI Overbought (8/13/2025): Internal diagnostic score: 1 – this is a strong bearish flag, as overbought RSI often precedes a price correction.

WR Overbought (8/13/2025): Internal diagnostic score: 6.41 – indicating a potential pullback.

WR Oversold (8/25–8/28/2025): Internal diagnostic score: 6.15 – showing some short-term support.

Overall, the technical landscape is mixed, and the internal diagnostic score of 5.3 reflects a wait-and-see stance. The key technical insight is that while some indicators point to a possible pullback, others suggest caution and volatility without a clear trend.

What's the story

India's largest oil company, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), has announced a massive investment of ₹1.66 lakh crore over the next five years. The move is aimed at expanding its core operations in oil refining and fuel marketing, along with ventures in petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewable energy. The company's chairman, Arvinder Singh Sahney, revealed the plans during the annual shareholder meeting on Saturday.

Expansion plans

Major expansions in refining and pipeline network

IOC is planning to ramp up its crude oil refining capacity from 80.75 million tons per annum (MTPA) to 98.4 MTPA by 2028. This will be done with major expansions at Panipat, Gujarat, and Barauni. To enhance its infrastructure and support its operations, IOC is also expanding its pipeline network, the largest in the country, to 22,000km with 21 projects under execution, including extensions and new storage facilities in Nepal.

De plus, l’origine des biocarburants autorisés pour l’aviation est très large, et inclut par exemple l’huile de palme si problématique.
En France, le report à 2031 du contrôle des compensations carbone pour les vols nationaux illustre ce recul politique.","L’aviation produit 3 % à 6 % des émissions mondiales de CO2, sans compter sa contribution en vapeur d’eau et en oxydes d’azote. En 2021, au sortir de la crise du Covid, l’Association du transport aérien international (IATA) précisait les moyens d’atteindre la neutralité carbone à l’horizon 2050 : 81 % de l’effort reposait sur les carburants « durables » (sustainable aviation fuel) et sur les technologies de propulsion à l’hydrogène. Le reste passait par des compensations, par le biais de la géo-ingénierie et des achats de crédits carbone. L’avion vert était prêt à décoller !

Que sont devenues ces ambitions ? Le secteur a retrouvé son niveau d’avant Covid avec 5 milliards de passagers en 2025 et ses perspectives de croissance de 3 % par an pourraient le conduire à atteindre 10 milliards de passagers en 2050 alors que la Nasa travaille sur un avion hypersonique pouvant voler à Mach 5 (plus de 6 000 kilomètres par heure). À un tel rythme, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre pourraient tripler d’ici à 2050. Les prévisions traversent une zone de turbulences…

De fait, les promesses techniques et économiques ne sont pas au rendez-vous. Le recours à la biomasse et, ce qui est moins connu des passagers végans, aux graisses animales, se heurte à une offre insuffisante et à la concurrence d’autres secteurs avides de biocarburants à substituer aux énergies fossiles. De plus, l’origine des biocarburants autorisés pour l’aviation est très large, et inclut par exemple l’huile de palme si problématique.

L’hydrogène provient en majorité de sources non renouvelables. En outre, il exige des réservoirs quatre fois plus grands que pour le kérosène et d’être maintenu à – 253 °C pour rester liquide. Notons que les techniques de capture et de séquestration du carbone ne compensent aujourd’hui que 1 % des émissions mondiales de CO2 et que leur coût reste prohibitif.

Quant au système d’échange de crédits carbone Corsia (pour Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) créé par l’Organisation de l’aviation civile internationale en 2016, il fait l’objet d’une rafale de critiques : trop d’exemptions prévues, flou sur la provenance des biocarburants, compensations forestières inefficaces… Or mettre en avant des solutions techniques irréalistes pour perpétuer les modèles existants constitue des allégations trompeuses sanctionnées par la loi.

À la suite d’une plainte pour greenwashing du Bureau européen des unions de consommateurs (le BEUC) déposée en 2023, la Commission européenne a ouvert une enquête sur vingt compagnies aériennes qui affirment que le transport aérien peut être durable, écoresponsable ou vert. En juin 2025, le BEUC a publié un rapport indiquant que, malgré quelques améliorations mineures, le compte n’y est pas.

Et il est loin d’y être… La directive Green Claims, anti-greenwashing, est happée par le tourbillon bruxellois de la casse des normes environnementales. En France, le report à 2031 du contrôle des compensations carbone pour les vols nationaux illustre ce recul politique. La coalition de pays, formée lors de la Conférence internationale sur le financement du développement tenue en juillet 2025, n’appelle ni à la sobriété, ni à la réduction des émissions qui aurait pu s’appuyer sur la taxation des billets de première. On se souvient du tollé provoqué par Jean-Marc Jancovici qui proposait d’instaurer non pas des prix dissuasifs, mais un quota individuel de quatre vols par vie pour réduire le trafic aérien.",https://medias.pourlascience.fr/api/v1/images/view/68a44a41e989363dd40bdd12/wide_1300/image.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:57:00.046773

This initiative aims to enhance its refining and fuel marketing capabilities while also expanding into petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewable energy sectors. Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney shared these insights during the company’s annual meeting, highlighting the strategic focus on meeting the growing demand for auto fuels alongside the global energy transition.

Expansion of Refining Capacity

IOC plans to increase its refining capacity from the current 80.75 million tonnes per year to 98.4 million tonnes by 2028. This growth will be driven by expansion projects at key locations, including Panipat, Gujarat, and Barauni. Sahney emphasized the company’s commitment to investing ₹1.66 lakh crore, which will primarily target the petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewable energy sectors. This strategic move is designed to balance the rising demand for auto fuels in India with the ongoing global shift towards sustainable energy solutions.

To support these ambitious plans, IOC is also expanding its extensive pipeline network from 20,000 kilometers to 22,000 kilometers through 21 ongoing projects. This includes the development of new storage facilities in Nepal. The company aims to boost its petrochemicals business significantly, increasing production from 4.3 million tonnes to over 13 million tonnes annually by 2030. A particular focus will be placed on specialty chemicals to reduce imports and enhance profit margins.

Diversification into Green Energy

In addition to its core operations, IOC is diversifying into green energy with a substantial investment of ₹2.5 lakh crore aimed at achieving net-zero operational emissions by 2046. This includes initiatives such as green hydrogen production, sustainable aviation fuel, and a significant increase in renewable power capacity from 1 GW to 18 GW within three years. The company is also enhancing its fuel station network, which exceeds 40,000 locations, by adding electric vehicle (EV) chargers, battery-swapping facilities, and CNG/LNG dispensing outlets.

Sahney noted that IOC is sharpening its focus on improving throughput per outlet and exploring non-fuel retail opportunities. The company is also venturing into emerging segments such as bitumen, bunkering, and LNG-based shipping. Furthermore, IOC is investing in coastal infrastructure and data transmission services, ensuring that every investment is made with long-term value creation in mind.

Market Leadership and Innovations

IOC continues to maintain its leadership position in the LPG market, holding a 45% share. The company has recently introduced BIS-certified 5 kg Chhotu Master cylinders, with the first retail outlet launched in Ahmedabad. Additionally, it has rolled out innovative products like XtraBoost nano-additized AutoLPG and Propane Plus for industrial customers. The reach of IOC’s Servo lubricants has expanded to 45 countries, further solidifying its market presence.

In the aviation fuel sector, IOC retains a commanding 54.5% market share and has opened new fueling stations in Srinagar and Rewa. The company’s natural gas volumes have surged by 20%, reaching 7.9 million tonnes annually, supported by global sourcing agreements. Its city gas business has expanded across 49 geographical areas in 21 states. Beyond energy, IOC is also making strides in the explosives sector with new plants in Neyveli and projects in Telangana and Maharashtra.

Challenges and Resilience

Sahney acknowledged the challenges facing the global energy sector, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, tensions in the Middle East, and disruptions in the Red Sea. These factors, along with new U.S. tariff hikes, have impacted trade flows. Despite these challenges, IOC has achieved significant milestones, surpassing 100 million tonnes in sales and serving over 32 million customers daily through its retail network. The company also supplies LPG to 150 million kitchens across India, demonstrating its resilience and commitment to meeting the energy needs of the nation.

Therefore, it is necessary to include the climate impact of the non-CO2 emissions from burning SAF when quantifying the climate impact benefits of SAF.
In this study, we perform the Life Cyle Climate Impact Analysis (LCCIA) to evaluate the climate benefit of SAF.
Well-to-wake CO2e emissions results The well-to-wake CO2e emissions consist of two contributions: (1) the lifecycle CO2 emissions (production, distribution and combustion); and (2) the inflight non-CO2 emissions (PtW).
The flights at higher cruise altitudes usually have a higher non-CO2 climate impact contribution than flights with lower cruise altitudes26.","Aviation is an important economic sector that provides a fast and reliable means of transportation. However, in 2018, the sector was responsible for the emission of almost 1 Gt CO2, equivalent to 2.4% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions including land use change1. Lee et al. (2021) estimated that the share of anthropogenic effective radiative forcing from aviation was around 4%, including both CO2 and non-CO2 effects1.

The non-CO2 climate impact stems primarily from the releases of nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapour (H2O), and particle emissions. These non-CO2 effects have strong spatial and temporal dependencies and are associated with a high degree of uncertainty1,2. NOx emissions can lead to positive radiative forcing (warming effect) as they serve as a precursor for short-term ozone (O3) production but also cause a cooling effect as they destroy background methane (CH4) and the associated ozone (named as Primary Mode Ozone, PMO)3,4. Water vapour has a negligible greenhouse gas (GHG) effect when emitted in the lower levels of the troposphere due to its short lifetime, but when emitted at high altitudes (near the tropopause or in the stratosphere), its GHG effect becomes stronger due to its increased residence time5. Soot and sulfur particulate emissions have relatively small direct climate effects, but when H2O condenses onto these particles and freezes to form a contrail, this can lead to a significant positive forcing, especially at night6. In total, the non-CO2 effects represented roughly two-thirds of total aviation’s radiative forcing in 2018 considering the best estimate1.

One way to reduce aviation’s climate impact is by using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)7. For instance, aircraft operators are allowed to use SAF to reduce their carbon offsetting requirements through the Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)8. The carbon footprint of SAFs is often quantified in grams of CO2 equivalence per megajoule (gCO2 e/MJ) by means of a Lifecycle Analysis (LCA), which allows the user to identify the environmental benefit of SAF compared to Conventional Jet Fuel (CJF)9,10,11. Based on these findings, a certain type of SAF can be promoted or discouraged by decision-makers. As mandated by regulatory frameworks, e.g., CORSIA, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (California), the current LCAs focus mainly on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions produced from Well to Wake (WtW). The WtW scope is composed of two stages: (1) fuel production and distribution (Well-to-Pump (WtP)) and (2) fuel combustion (Pump-to-Wake (PtW)). Accordingly, 100% SAF has the potential to reduce the lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 94% compared to CJF, depending on the feedstocks and technology pathways, e.g., carbon capture11,12.

When it comes to the PtW non-CO2 emissions, burning SAF can reduce soot particles and thereby reducing contrail radiative forcing13. Meanwhile, SAF has little effect on the NOx emissions14. Therefore, it is necessary to include the climate impact of the non-CO2 emissions from burning SAF when quantifying the climate impact benefits of SAF. The previous work15,16 analyzed the inflight non-CO2 climate effects of SAF using the Global Warming Potential (GWP) with horizons of 20-100-500 years. It was concluded that the incorporation of these non-CO2 effects reduced the relative merit of using SAF, as SAF could not mitigate the non-CO2 climate impact. However, the analysis did not consider the fact that SAF is able to reduce the contrail climate impact17,18 because of the reduced soot emissions compared to CJF19,20. Moreover, recent work from Megill et al.21 tested climate metrics against requirements, such as the consistency between the climate impact evaluation based on a requirement and a scenario analysis. The analysis showed that Average Temperature Response (ATR) as a climate metric was better suited for aviation than, e.g. GWP.

In this study, we perform the Life Cyle Climate Impact Analysis (LCCIA) to evaluate the climate benefit of SAF. To do so, we quantify the climate impact of NOx, H2O and contrails from the PtW stage and convert them to the gCO2e/MJ value based on two climate metrics, GWP and ATR, respectively for time horizons of 20-50-100 years22,23. The resulting gCO2e/MJ values are then combined with the Lifecycle GHG emissions of the CORSIA Eligible Fuels to obtain the overall WtW GHG emissions of SAF24. Accordingly, we reflect on environmental benefits of SAF and show in the discussion that the GHG emission reductions can be increased by allocating SAF to long range flights. The overall approach includes an integrated modelling chain of emission inventory generation, climate impact calculation and Monte Carlo simulations. The details are described in the method section.

Climate impact of inflight emissions for CJF and SAF

Figure 1 shows the radiative forcing (RF) and the resulting near surface temperature change (∆T) caused by in-flight CO2, NOx, H2O emissions and contrails from the beginning of aviation to roughly 100 years after introduction of considerable amount of SAF (i.e., 1940–2130) for two cases: (1) 100% CJF (solid line) and (2) 100% SAF (dotted line). Case (1) assumes all aircraft use CJF from 1940 to 2130. For case (2), all aircraft use 100% CJF from 1940 to 2018, and in 2019 a perturbation is introduced that all aircraft use 100% SAF until 2130. The emission indices and calorific values of CJF and SAF are given in Table 1. The emission index of CO2 for SAF is based on the emissions at the engine tailpipe and does not include the reduction in Lifecyle CO2 in order to evaluate the CO2 equivalence for non-CO2 effects. Furthermore, the change in contrail RF for SAF in Table 1 is due to the reduction of soot number particles and is derived using the methodology from Grewe et al. (2021)25. The GHG emissions in Table 1 considers the amount of CO2 from combustion process. The RF and ∆T in Fig. 1 do not consider WtP emissions from fuel production and distribution. From 2019 onwards, the implementation of SAF will result in lower fuel consumption because of the higher calorific values of the fuel, which slightly reduces CO2, NOx, and soot emissions for given emission indices.

Furthermore, the CO2 emission index (EICO2) of SAF is lower than CJF, hence reducing the total CO2 emission, the corresponding RF and ∆T. Due to the increased H2O emission index (EIH2O) for SAF, the RF and ∆T related to H2O emissions for SAF are slightly higher. The NOx emission index (EINOx) is the same for both fuels, as NOx emissions are mainly affected by the engine architecture and combustion technology not the fuel itself14. The contrail RF of SAF is reduced by about 21% in 2130, mainly due to the reduced soot numbers of burning SAF. The reduction of soot number reduces the contrail lifetime, optical properties, and hence the climate impact18. More details about the RF derivations for SAF are given in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3. The Supplementary Table 4 compares the change of RF using SAF from different literatures and shows a large variation range from 20% − 50% depending on the model setups. While the current analysis falls into the variation range, further research is required to reduce the uncertainty of using SAF on the contrail radiative forcing.

CO2 equivalent factors for CJF and SAF

Based on the temporal evolution of ∆T in Fig. 1, the ATRi,H (average temperature response over a time horizon of H for an individual climate specie, i) is obtained. Accordingly, the CO2 equivalent (CO2e) factors of individual species as a ratio to the \({\text{ATR}_{\text{CO}_{2},\text{H}}}\) is derived (see Eq. (1)). These CO2e factors indicate the significance of non-CO2 effects on the increase of the average surface temperature compared to the CO2 emissions by CJF and SAF, respectively.

$$\:{CO}_{{2e,\:all,\:\:ATR}_{H}}=\:\frac{{\sum\:}_{i}{\int\:}_{2019}^{2019+H}{\varDelta\:T}_{i}\left(t\right)-{\varDelta\:T}_{i}\left(2019\right)\:dt}{{\int\:}_{2019}^{2019+H}{\varDelta\:T}_{{CO}_{2}}\left(t\right)-{\varDelta\:T}_{{CO}_{2}}\left(2019\right)\:dt}\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:$$

(1)

In Eq. (1), H is the time horizon. The subscript i denotes the climate species of NOx, H2O, CO2 and contrail, respectively. The temperature change in 2019 caused by species i emitted by global aviation before 2019 (i.e.,\(\:{\varDelta\:T}_{i}\left(2019\right)\)) is subtracted to eliminate the temperature change that already has happened before 2019.

In Fig. 2, the CO2e ratios of all individual climate agents for SAF and CJF are presented for three different time horizons of 20, 50 and 100 years. For the shorter time horizon, the CO2e is larger since non-CO2 effects have a stronger short-term climate impact. As the time horizon increases, CO2 emissions build up and the resulting warming effect becomes more prominent over the long term. Hence, the total CO2e ratios reduce.

CO2e ratios based on the GWP have also been calculated following the similar approach of Eq. (1), but based on the time integrated RF. The consequent CO2e ratios indicate how much radiation (stratospherically adjusted RF) is forced back by non-CO2 effects compared to CO2. The results for CO2e ratios based on GWP are present in Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 7 and agree well with available literature15 (see Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Table 9 for more details).

Well-to-wake CO2e emissions results

The well-to-wake CO2e emissions consist of two contributions: (1) the lifecycle CO2 emissions (production, distribution and combustion); and (2) the inflight non-CO2 emissions (PtW). In Table 1, the amount of CO2 emitted per MJ of fuel due to combustion are 73.3 gCO2/MJ for CJF and 70.2 gCO2/MJ for SAF. By multiplying these values with CO2e ratios in Fig. 2, the PtW CO2e emissions for the inflight non-CO2 effects can be derived. As a result, the PtW CO2e emission of CJF, due to the non-CO2 climate effects, is 167.9 gCO2e/MJ (based on the ATR100). Similarly, the PtW CO2e emissions for the non-CO2 effects of SAF is 147.7 gCO2e/MJ.

The PtW CO2e emissions of SAF for the non-CO2 effects can be flexibly included to any existing LCAs to obtain WtW CO2e emissions of SAF (see Eq. (2)). These novel WtW CO2e values thus represent the lifecycle climate impact in the format of gCO2e/MJ.

$$\:{\left[\frac{g{CO}_{2}e}{MJ}\right]\:}_{WtW}=\:{\left[\frac{g{CO}_{2}e}{MJ}\right]\:}_{WtP}+\:{\left[\frac{g{CO}_{2}e}{MJ}\right]\:}_{PtW}\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:$$

Figure 3 shows a set of WtW CO2e emissions considering the ICAO CORSIA eligible fuels and the CJF based on ATR100. The CORSIA core LCA emissions (in green) are taken from24. The Induced Land Use Change values (referring to the additional land used for fuel production, in pink).

Upon the inclusion of PtW non-CO2 effects, the equivalent CO2 emissions per MJ for CJF increases from 89 (the CORSIA LCA value, orange dotted line) to 256.9 [192.3-334.9] gCO2e/MJ (red dotted line). The PtW CO2e of SAF for the non-CO2 effects is about 147.7 g per MJ (blue bars in Fig. 3), which is slightly less than CJF (167.9 gCO2e/MJ). This indicates that the relative merit of using SAF increases mainly due to the reduction of contrail’s climate impact. For a shorter time horizon of 20- or 50- years, the CO2e ratios shown in Fig. 2 increase considerably, driven by the non-CO2 climate effects. Namely, using these shorter time horizons increases the non-CO2 emission reduction potential from SAF.

Furthermore, it is observed that some pathways like the palm oil (open pond) HEFA and corn grain EtJ, which previously had higher lifecycle emissions than CJF, now have lower WtW CO2e emissions than CJF. This is mainly because SAF contains less aromatics and decreases non-CO2 climate impact, i.e. the contrail impacts. It should be noted that in the RED (the legal framework used for the quantification of emissions reductions in the EU ETS), the standards set for a fuel to be classified as SAF are different. Nevertheless, the PtW values derived in this analysis are still applicable. We find that the intrapathway uncertainty increases which is aligned with the findings in15. If GWP based CO2e ratios were used instead of ATR based CO2e ratios to calculate the PtW results, the intrapathway uncertainty would decrease, as there is more uncertainty associated with calculating temperature change responses than radiative forcing responses.

While having one set of CO2e ratios for the entire fleet is convenient, it is not entirely fair for flights. The flights at higher cruise altitudes usually have a higher non-CO2 climate impact contribution than flights with lower cruise altitudes26. Therefore, flight-distance dependent CO2e factors are calculated for the clusters defined in Table 2 based on (great circle) flight distances. For each group, the ATR100 per climate species are calculated, and accordingly, cluster-specific CO2e ratios are derived for both CJF and SAF (the values are presented in the Supplementary Fig. 5). The main takeaway is that for the shorter-range flights, the climate impact reduction attained with SAF reduces compared to the long-range flights. The main reason is that short flights hardly reach contrail-forming altitudes. Therefore, the lower soot emissions from SAF will not benefit for contrail climate impact.

In this work, the PtW CO2e emissions based on the non-CO2 climate effects from NOx, H2O and contrails are newly derived and are combined with typical ICAO CORSIA LCA emissions to obtain the WtW CO2e emissions. Considering different climate metrics, the final LCCIA WtW varies. An example of considering the ATR100 metric shows that CJF has a WtW CO2e emissions of about 256.9 g per MJ. The LCCIA WtW for SAF varies from about 150 to 250 gCO2e/MJ depending on the exact SAF pathways. Furthermore, non-CO2 effects contribute to approximately 69.6% and 67.7% of the overall in-flight CO2e emissions of CJF & SAF respectively. Two possible ways to decrease this climate impact are by lean combustion engines with less NOx and soot emissions27 or by avoiding climate sensitive areas28,29,30. With the new LCCIA WtW CO2e emissions values, policy and decision-makers can make informed decisions about the climate impact reduction potential of SAF.

One of the primary reasons why non-CO2 effects are currently excluded from the quantification of emissions reduction using CORSIA and EU ETS (RED) is because of the uncertainty associated with their climate impact. We have investigated the impact of a range of uncertainties (see methods) on the equivalent emissions by running a Monte Carlo analysis that generates a whole range of different CO2e factors and pump-to-wake results (grey bars in Figs. 2 and 3). To ensure that non-CO2 climate impact is fairly and adequately accredited, the CO2e factor and PtW results of the Monte Carlo’s 5th percentile can be taken, meaning it is 95% certain that climate impact is at least higher than the accredited value. Moreover, to study the robustness of the model prediction, a sensitivity study has been performed for the NOx RF. By replacing the calculated NOx RF in the AirClim model with the values presented by Lee et al. (2021)1, we observed a significant drop in the magnitude of the CO2e factors (methodology bar in Supplementary Fig. 5), as the climate-chemistry model that was used in the development of AirClim is at the upper end of the ozone increases per NOx emission of the range given in Lee et al. (2021)1. Nevertheless, the variation is within the uncertainty range.

One limitation of this study is that the direct aerosol effects are not considered due to their relatively small values. The absence of sulfur in SAF reduces SO2 and volatile H2SO4 emissions, hence reducing the corresponding cooling effects. Therefore, the CO2e ratio for SAF is slightly underestimated in this regard15. On the other hand, the cooling effect of sulfur-related emissions might be roughly cancelled out by the direct warming effect of soot emissions (see Supplementary information section 7). The results of the ECLIF-II17 and ECLIF-III measurements31 indicate that sulfur particles possibly play a role in soot particle activation, as they are thought to increase the soot particle’s hydrophilicity. A higher soot particle activation will lead to a higher number of ice particles with smaller particle diameters, leading to a decreased sedimentation loss of ice particles and therefore longer contrail lifetime. The induced indirect global warming effects due to change in sulfur contents in SAF require thorough analysis.

Furthermore, a recent study32 indicates that at sufficiently cold temperatures and low soot emission regime (e.g., lean combustion), background sulfur and organic volatile particles can play critical roles in ice nucleation, hence the contrail radiative forcing. In such situations, the benefit of SAF in reducing the contrail climate effect requires further investigation.

The flight range based CO2e ratios shows that the reduction of CO2e emissions increases as the flight range increases, this implies that for limited availability of SAF, allocating it to longer flights with higher flight altitudes would allow more climate benefit, as suggested by33. Further, the previous study also33 showed that the allocation of SAF to night-time flights would have increased climate benefits, as especially the contrails at night have the highest climate impact. If distinct CO2e factors for day and night were used, this could lead to substantially lower CO2e factors for SAF at night and thereby much higher emissions reductions would be achieved per MJ of SAF. Nevertheless, due to the lifetime of contrails, they are advected into day regions, even if they are produced at night, which complicates, though not rule out, the target SAF use.

Moreover, lean combustion engines emit less NOx and soot and will cause a lower climate impact per unit of fuel used, which means that the CO2e factor should also be aircraft type dependent. Even more accurate CO2e factors could be made when they would also be weather type dependent as aircraft operators would then be incentivized to allocate their SAF to flights with the highest probability of e.g. contrails cirrus outbreaks. The more factors are considered by the CO2e factor, the more accurate the quantification of emissions reductions becomes and the better the incentivization of aircraft operators becomes to use SAF at the right time, in the right aircraft and for the right aircraft trajectory. However, this will also result in more work and cost and possibly require running weather simulations before take-off. Further work should focus on exploring different types of CO2e factors, their effect on aircraft operator behavior and the associated cost of making them. In addition, the knowledge and understanding of non-CO2 climate impact must be further deepened and uncertainties included in the assessment of mitigation options such as SAF to better understand the impact of those uncertainties on the mitigation potential.

The LCCIA method used to derive the WtW values is based on the climate response model, AirClim, which considers a global aviation emission inventory adapted for SAF usage, the growth of aircraft traffic and the relevant background atmospheric species, like CO2 and CH4. The entire modelling chain is explained in Supplementary Fig. 1. The detail of each element is described in this section.

Climate assessment

The calculation of global RF and temperature responses resulting from global aviation is performed using AirClim (version 2.0)34,35. AirClim is a non-linear climate-chemistry response model to estimate the atmospheric response, radiative forcing, and near-surface temperature changes resulting from the emissions of CO2, H2O, NOx and contrails. AirClim achieves this by combining emission perturbation data with pre-calculated, altitude- and latitude-dependent atmospheric input data obtained from 85 steady-state simulations performed with the ECHAM4 and E39/CA climate chemistry models. The Supplementary Table 5 shows the RF in 2018 calculated by AirClim model comparing to the literature1. To convert the RF to the temperature response, a set of climate sensitivity parameters were taken from the published literature35 and are used here in this study. The program does not account for the direct warming effects of soot aerosols nor the direct cooling effects of sulfate aerosols. Indirect aerosol-cloud interactions are omitted from consideration as these are very uncertain, and the climate impacts of CO and unburn hydrogen carbons (UHCs) are also disregarded as they represent a negligible portion of aviation climate impact1. A process flow diagram displaying the critical inputs and outputs of AirClim in the context of this research is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The three main inputs to generate a baseline 100% CJF scenario are (1) an emissions inventory, (2) a fuel background scenario, and (3) a CO2 and CH4 background scenario. For the background, we consider an increasing scenario to represent the growth of the air traffic and the involvement of the atmospheric concentrations.

Emission inventory

The emission inventory used for this research is generated using the Global Aviation Model Emission Inventory (GAMEI) developed in-house36. This model generates a 3D grid representing Earth’s atmosphere with a horizontal resolution of 1° by 1° and a vertical resolution of 1000 feet. The fuel consumption, NOx emissions, non-volatile particulate matters nvPM) and flown kilometres by global aviation in 2019 are calculated. To produce this 3D grid, flight departure and destination airports are taken from a flight database of 2019 from flightradar24 which also indicates aircraft type. For each flight, a trajectory is created and segmented into waypoints. At each waypoint, the aircraft’s performance metrics (fuel flow, rate of climb, and velocity) are calculated using BADA (EUROCONTROL) performance data. CO2 and H2O emissions are calculated by multiplying the used fuel at a certain waypoint with the emission indices of CJF for CO2 and H2O of 3.16 and 1.25 respectively. NOx emissions for each waypoint are calculated using the Boeing Fuel Flow Method 2 (BFFM2)37 and the ICAO Emissions Database (EDB). The result was an emissions inventory with 266.6 Tg fuel, 5.06 Tg NOx and 52.43 × 109 flown km for 2019. The emissions inventory is verified and validated with the emissions inventory from38 in Supplementary information (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1).

Fuel background scenario

The fuel background scenarios used in this study are the “Current Technology” (CurTec) and “Business As Usual” (BAU) scenarios taken from25 (Supplementary information). These are a top-down series of historic fuel use by global aviation and have been extended from 2100 to 2130. For this extension, an annual Revenue Passenger Kilometer growth of 0.5% per annum has been assumed from 2101 to 2150, and it is assumed that the [#pax/flight] will increase from 85 to 88 for both the CurTec as well as the BAU scenario. Lastly, for CurTec, it is assumed that the fuel efficiency stays 4.67 [kg/km] from 2100 to 2150, whereas for the BAU scenario, this [kg/km] is assumed to decrease with 0.25%/year in 2100 and 0.01%/year in 2150. The Supplementary Fig. 3 shows a good agreement between the temporal evaluation of temperature response using the emission inventory in this work when comparing the literature25 under the identify scenario.

CO2 and CH4 background scenario

Another important input for AirClim is a CO2 and CH4 background scenario. For this analysis, the SSP1-2.6 scenario from the IPCC is chosen. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios are five distinct socio-economic narratives used by the IPCC and in climate change research that predict different global futures based on varying societal developments39. SSP1 is the sustainability scenario based on so-called “green road” development. The 2.6 refers to the radiative forcing level, specifically 2.6 W/m2 by the year 2100. We have chosen SSP1-2.6 CO2 and CH4 background scenario, since during the assignment of emissions savings to players in the aviation sector, it must be assumed that all other sectors in all countries are also contributing to emissions savings. In the Supplementary Table 10, the effect of varying the CO2 and CH4 background scenarios is presented.

Uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo

The climate impact of non-CO2 effects is associated with a large uncertainty. To account for this, some of the model input parameters, like the CO2 and CH4 atmospheric residence times, the radiative forcing (RF) strengths and climate sensitivity parameters of all 6 modeled aviation climate agents (CO2, CH4, H2O, O3, PMO and contrail cirrus) are prescribed as uncertainty parameters with uniform uncertainty distributions. This gives a total of 11 parameters for which a uniform uncertainty distribution is prescribed and for which 2000 Monte Carlo simulations are done. 2000 simulations were chosen as by then; good convergence (with nominal/default values) was observed.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-13445-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_13445_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-08-30 04:56:08.462012

""Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world's largest Conventional Energy complex and the world's largest New Energy complex.
""It will enable cost-competitive green hydrogen production at global scale, backed by exclusive global technology partnerships, and strengthened by our in-house capabilities,"" he said.
This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives,"" he said.","Reliance Industries Ltd is doubling down its clean energy business with planned start of a mega battery production factory in 2026, a solar electricity generation project spread over an area three times the size of Singapore, and 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen capacity by 2032.

Making his debut at the company's annual general meeting, Anant Ambani, the youngest son of billionaire Mukesh Ambani and executive director of Reliance, said the company is building the world's most integrated new energy ecosystem -- from sand to electrons to green molecules.

The company is investing in producing every single piece of clean energy -- modules that will turn sunlight into electricity, batteries that can store the energy, electrolysers that can use such renewable energy to split water molecule to produce the fuel of the future -- hydrogen, giga factories to produce green hydrogen and its derivatives like green ammonia and green methanol for domestic and export market, make sustainable aviation fuel, and produce biofuels from organic waste.

Reliance -- India's largest conglomerate whose interest spans from oil and petrochemicals to telecom and retail -- had in 2021 unveiled a USD 10 billion plan spanning renewables, storage and hydrogen as it chased net zero emissions status by 2035.

The plan was to develop the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex at its integrated refinery complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat. Jamnagar, the world's biggest single-site integrated refinery complex, has two refineries and is the main hub for Reliance's oil-to-chemicals business.

The company using the same site to create platforms that will deliver a multi-pronged, gigawatt-scale clean energy ecosystem -- solar, battery storage, hydrogen -- all under one roof, he said.

""Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world's largest Conventional Energy complex and the world's largest New Energy complex. Jamnagar is the face of New Reliance and New India,"" he said.

Having started the first line for manufacturing of solar panels, the company is now looking to scale up to 20 GWp capacity in coming quarters, which would be the largest solar manufacturing facility and the most integrated single-site solar complex globally, he said.

""We have successfully produced our first 200 MW of HJT modules. These deliver 10 per cent higher energy yield, 20 per cent better temperature performance, and 25 per cent lower degradation,"" he said. ""We are scaling rapidly."" In parallel, it is rapidly constructing battery and electrolyser giga factories. ""Our battery giga factory will start in 2026. It will begin with 40 GWh per year capacity and expand modularly to 100 GWh per year,"" he said.

The electrolyser giga factory will also be operational by end-2026, with the ability to scale up to 3 GW per year. ""It will enable cost-competitive green hydrogen production at global scale, backed by exclusive global technology partnerships, and strengthened by our in-house capabilities,"" he said.

""At peak, we will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. This will be among the fastest installations globally. This single site could meet nearly 10 per cent of India's electricity needs within the next decade,"" he said.

""We will produce and export green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives,"" he said.

While the initial focus will be to meet Reliance's own large captive demand, it plans to scale up to 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen equivalent production capacity by 2032.

Reliance, he said, is also building compressed biogas (CBG) plants with an annual capacity of 0.5 million tonnes. ""Our target is to scale up to 500+ CBG plants by 2030,"" he said.

Ambani said the company is investing Rs 75,000 crore in a 1.2 million tonne PVC plant at Nagothane in Maharashtra, expansion of a PTA facility at Dahej in Gujarat and a 1 million tonne specialty polyester facility at Palghar.

""These projects are positioned to meet India's rising demand,"" he said. ""Our Hazira carbon fibre facility will be one of the world's three largest, serving aerospace, Defence, and Advanced Materials."" On Jamnagar refineries, it said the company was ""on course to realising the autonomous refinery"".

At Jamnagar, the firm has set up the world's largest Bioenergy Technology and R&D centre. Here, it is developing advanced enzymes, microbial consortia, and high-yield energy crops to boost biogas productivity.

""We are also realising our Chairman's (Mukesh Ambani) vision of growing energy plantations on wastelands. This includes building the world's first integrated energy hub, combining smart farms, modular CBG and green hydrogen plants, agrivoltaics, and batteries,"" Anant said.

""I am especially proud of our agrivoltaics business, where Compressed Biogas (CBG) and Solar PV are deployed on the same land. By capturing biogenic CO2 from CBG plants, these hubs will become platforms for green chemicals, aiming at fossil parity."" This model creates triple value for Indian farmers -- green gas, green electricity, and higher rural incomes.

The case, registered as DS618, centered on the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), which Indonesia argued discriminated against crude palm oil. The WTO panel sided with Indonesia, and the EU has agreed to amend RED II by February 24, 2026.

“We expect the European Union to respond sensibly and fairly to this ruling. We are optimistic the EU will implement the WTO decision on biodiesel,” said Djatmiko Bris Witjaksono, Director General of International Trade Negotiations, on Thursday, August 28, 2025.

The WTO found that the EU’s reasoning for imposing duties ranging from 8 to 18 percent on Indonesian biodiesel was not supported by sufficient evidence and recommended that the measures be adjusted. Under the ruling, the EU has fifteen months to comply, meaning the duties must be removed by November 22, 2026.

Djatmiko described Indonesia’s win as a signal to its trading partners to act carefully when drafting trade measures related to Indonesian commodities, stressing that all WTO members are obliged to ensure their policies are consistent with international trade rules.

Trade Minister Budi Santoso echoed this view, calling the ruling proof of Indonesia’s consistent compliance with global trade regulations, in contrast to the EU’s accusations. He said the WTO panel dismissed the EU’s claim that Indonesia pushed palm oil producers to sell raw materials at artificially low prices for the benefit of biodiesel companies. It also concluded that Indonesia’s export taxes and levies on palm oil could not be treated as subsidies, and that the European Commission had failed to show any real harm to European biodiesel producers, overlooking other factors that affect the market.

Croatia Airlines is a full-service carrier that provides domestic and international air passenger and cargo transport services within Europe, as well as providing aircraft maintenance and professional training of aviation personnel.

In 2024, the company’s 35th year of operation, Croatia Airlines embarked on the largest project in its history, a complete fleet renewal with the Airbus A220. The first A220 aircraft was introduced to the fleet in July 2024, followed by the second in December of the same year, with the plan to have 15 new A220 aircraft in the fleet by 2027. During 2025, five new aircraft will be delivered (three have already arrived), five more in 2026, and the final three in 2027.

Davor Misic, Director of Operations and Fleet, joins us to elaborate on how this project will benefit the business and its operations moving forward. “Our fleet renewal project is the biggest project in the history of the company and is a significant step for Croatia’s economy and tourism, pushing boundaries and opening new possibilities,” Davor opens. “This project will facilitate further development, enabling successful and sustainable operations in the future. It also further confirms the position of Croatia Airlines as a strategically important segment of Croatia’s transport and tourism infrastructure.

“We’re constantly aware of the significance of Croatia Airlines for the country and its passengers, and this program will enhance operational efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and improve the overall passenger experience. With each new arrival, we are getting closer to achieving the goals of our post Covid-19 strategy while consistently following our mission and vision.

“Fleet renewal is one of the most complex decisions for any airline, as a wrong choice can lead to severe consequences. It is a strategic decision made for a long-term period of approximately ten-to-15 years and cannot be implemented over a short period of time. However, the Airbus 220 aircraft represent a new generation and are designed as an entirely new product. They offer the best performance in terms of efficiency and noise emissions, as well as premium experience for crew and passengers, thanks to innovative design and state-of-the-art technology. Airbus 220s are designed for the market segment of passenger aircraft with 100-to-150 seats, with a maximum range of up to 6700 kilometers.”

Croatia Airlines sets clear goals for the fleet modernization process, assessing multiple dimensions like increased efficiency, compliance with environmental regulations, simplified technical maintenance procedures, and enhanced passenger comfort. “The A220 features an innovative cabin design focused on comfort, with the widest seats and highest ceiling in its class, increased legroom, a quieter cabin, a wider aisle, more overhead storage space, and large panoramic windows that allow more natural light into the cabin,” Davor explains. “Onboard Croatia Airlines’ A220, passengers can enjoy high-speed inflight Wi-Fi for the first time in the company’s history. Each seat is equipped with USB-A and USB-C ports, a smartphone and tablet holder, and access to wireless digital content, all of which contribute to a more connected and personalized travel experience.

“Beyond fleet renewal, which represents a significant technological leap for us, achieving 25 percent lower fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions, Croatia Airlines has implemented ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 standards for environmental and energy management over recent years. We have started using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on selected flights and plan to replace airport service vehicles with electric alternatives.”

Croatia Airlines has been a member of Star Alliance since 2004, and this partnership remains vital for the company, offering collaboration, strategic advantages in global connectivity, reputation, and innovation. “Our membership of Star Alliance provides access to a global flight network, enhancing Croatia’s connectivity and attracting travellers from around the world,” Davor states. “Being part of the world’s largest airline alliance strengthens our reputation and reinforces our position as a reliable, high-quality carrier. We also partner with the Croatian airline, Trade Air, to ensure availability in markets where the airline does not operate direct flights or to increase capacity on existing routes.”

As our conversation closes, Davor turns to what’s facing Croatia Airlines in the remainder of 2025. “Our key priorities are centered around continuing the successful implementation of our fleet renewal program, with additional Airbus A2200 aircraft set to arrive,” he states. “Training our crew remains a top priority, as we must ensure safe and efficient operations with the new aircraft. We’re also strengthening existing strategic partnerships and exploring new route opportunities within Europe and the Mediterranean as we work to further improve connectivity and support Croatia’s economic growth.

“We’re focusing on further business optimization, fleet modernization, and enhanced competitiveness. Once the fleet renewal is completed, our focus will shift to consolidating the benefits of this investment, ensuring improved operational reliability, cost-efficiency, and environmental performance. Over the next five years, we aim to strengthen our role as Croatia’s national carrier by continuing to provide safe, high-quality, and reliable service, while supporting the country’s connectivity, tourism, and economic development.

“If there’s one final message, it’s that the time has come to visit Croatia. Zagreb, Split, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Pula, Rijeka, and Osijek are available to our passengers all year round,” Davor concludes. “Come and experience our warm hospitality, rich tourist offerings, natural beauty, cultural heritage, and the unique identity of each Croatian region.”",https://tlimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Croatia-Airlines-133-headline-image.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 02:56:09.107367

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Reward Proposition Spirit Airlines’ post-Chapter 11 restructuring embodies a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario.","Spirit Airlines’ recent Chapter 11 restructuring has positioned it at a crossroads, balancing aggressive debt reduction with existential liquidity risks in a volatile post-pandemic airline sector. The carrier’s March 2025 emergence from bankruptcy—marked by a $795 million debt-to-equity swap and $350 million in new equity—initially signaled a path to stability. However, its Q2 2025 net loss of $246 million and a 53% drop in liquidity to $407.5 million underscore the fragility of its recovery [1]. This analysis evaluates whether Spirit’s strategic restructuring can offset sector-specific headwinds, including fuel volatility, labor shortages, and shifting consumer preferences.

Strategic Restructuring: Debt Reduction and Operational Overhaul

Spirit’s Chapter 11 process focused on three pillars: deleveraging, fleet optimization, and cost restructuring. By converting $795 million in debt to equity and securing $350 million in fresh capital, the airline reduced its debt burden while retaining operational flexibility [2]. However, these measures have proven insufficient to address its $600 million free cash flow deficit for 2025 [3]. To bolster liquidity, Spirit has sold 23 Airbus aircraft and 14 spare engines, generating $449 million and $250 million, respectively [4]. These asset disposals, while necessary, highlight the airline’s reliance on short-term fixes rather than sustainable operational improvements.

Operational adjustments include a 27.7% reduction in flight capacity for Q3 2025 and furloughs of 270 pilots, reflecting a shift toward aligning capacity with “profitable demand” [5]. Yet, critics argue that Spirit’s restructuring lacks ambition, particularly in renegotiating aircraft leases or addressing its bloated cost structure [6]. For instance, its adjusted CASM ex-fuel rose to 8.77 cents in Q2 2025, outpacing the industry average of 7.36 cents in 2024 [7].

Sector-Specific Risks: A Perfect Storm for Low-Cost Carriers

Spirit’s challenges are compounded by broader industry trends. Fuel prices, averaging $87 per barrel in 2025, remain a significant cost driver [8]. Meanwhile, labor shortages—particularly in pilot and maintenance technician roles—threaten operational reliability [9]. Regulatory pressures, such as the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), add further complexity, with SAF priced at 4.2 times conventional jet fuel [10].

The post-pandemic demand landscape also favors premium services over budget travel. Spirit’s pivot to tiered fare classes (Spirit First, Premium Economy, and Value) aims to capture this shift, but its core customer base may resist paying for amenities it historically avoided [11]. This strategic tension mirrors broader industry struggles, as legacy carriers like Delta and Southwest achieve operating margins of 7.55% and 2.17%, respectively, while Spirit’s Q2 2025 margin hit -18% [12].

Liquidity Crisis and the Path Forward

Spirit’s liquidity position remains precarious. With $2.689 billion in debt and $1.1 billion in long-term repayments due in 2025, the airline has maxed out its $275 million revolving credit facility and secured a card-processing agreement that allows U.S. Bank to hold up to $3 million daily in collateral [13]. These measures, while stabilizing for now, signal a high-risk reliance on external financing.

The airline’s survival hinges on three factors:

1. Successful execution of cost-cutting measures, including further capacity reductions and lease renegotiations.

2. Securing additional equity or debt financing to bridge its liquidity gap.

3. Adapting its value proposition to retain budget travelers while monetizing premium demand [14].

However, the likelihood of another bankruptcy filing looms large. Aircraft lessors have already begun assessing interest in remarketing Spirit’s fleet, and management has warned of “substantial doubt” regarding the airline’s ability to continue as a going concern [15].

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Reward Proposition

Spirit Airlines’ post-Chapter 11 restructuring embodies a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario. While its aggressive deleveraging and operational overhauls provide a foundation for recovery, the airline’s liquidity crisis and structural challenges in the low-cost model pose existential threats. For investors, the key question is whether Spirit can execute its transformation without further bankruptcies—a feat that would require both operational discipline and favorable market conditions. In a sector where peers like Delta and Southwest enjoy robust margins, Spirit’s path to profitability remains fraught with uncertainty.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 05:56:22.737073

((Beijing Institute of Technology Press Co., Ltd/EurekAlert!) As the world grapples with climate change and dwindling fossil fuel reserves, biodiesel emerges as a promising renewable alternative to conventional diesel. However, the journey toward sustainable biodiesel production faces significant hurdles, particularly in selecting the right feedstocks that don't compete with food supplies. A groundbreaking comprehensive review reveals how artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning technologies are revolutionizing this field, offering unprecedented solutions to longstanding challenges.

Traditional biodiesel production relies heavily on edible crops like soybean, palm oil, and rapeseed – creating a problematic ""food versus fuel"" competition. With fossil fuels still accounting for 88% of global energy consumption, the urgency to develop sustainable alternatives has never been greater. Second-generation biodiesel, derived from non-edible sources such as algae and jatropha, presents an attractive solution but faces obstacles including high production costs and limited commercial viability. This is where deep learning enters the picture, offering a transformative approach to feedstock selection and production optimization.

The research demonstrates remarkable achievements through deep learning applications. ANNs have shown superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods, with some models achieving R² values exceeding 90% in predicting crucial biodiesel properties like kinematic viscosity and cetane numbers. These neural networks excel at analyzing complex relationships between feedstock characteristics, production parameters, and environmental factors, enabling rapid assessment of diverse feedstock options without extensive experimental testing.

Particularly impressive are the results from hybrid deep learning models that combine generative and discriminative approaches. For instance, researchers using genetic algorithm-based support vector machines (GA-SVM) successfully optimized biodiesel production from waste cooking oil, while others achieved significant yield improvements by integrating ANNs with response surface methodology (RSM). These advances translate to substantial time and cost savings – critical factors for commercial viability.

The integration of deep learning with Internet of Things (IoT) technology promises to revolutionize biofuel production further. Real-time monitoring and optimization through IoT sensors combined with predictive modeling enable unprecedented control over production processes. This synergy allows manufacturers to adapt quickly to varying feedstock qualities and market demands while maintaining optimal efficiency.

Future applications include developing comprehensive ANN models applicable across diverse engine types and fuel variations, enhancing transferability between different geographical regions and feedstock types. The potential for multi-omics integration and advanced data augmentation techniques will address current limitations in dataset size and model generalization, opening doors to previously unexplored feedstock sources.

This comprehensive review underscores deep learning's pivotal role in accelerating biodiesel development as a sustainable fuel alternative. By dramatically reducing the time and resources needed for feedstock evaluation and process optimization, ANNs are breaking down barriers that have long hindered biodiesel's commercial expansion. The technology's ability to uncover hidden correlations within complex datasets not only advances scientific understanding but also paves the way for more efficient, environmentally friendly fuel production.

As we stand at the intersection of artificial intelligence and renewable energy, the innovative application of deep learning in biodiesel production represents more than technological advancement – it embodies our commitment to a sustainable future where renewable fuels can effectively compete with and eventually replace fossil fuels.

Speaking at the company’s annual general meeting for the first time, Anant Ambani, Executive Director and son of Chairman Mukesh Ambani, laid out the company’s vision to create one of the world’s most integrated renewable energy ecosystems — spanning solar modules, batteries, electrolysers, and green fuels like ammonia and methanol.

Reliance is investing in the entire clean energy value chain: from producing solar modules and energy storage systems to building electrolysers that use renewable electricity to generate hydrogen — seen as a key fuel for the future. The company also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel and biofuels from organic waste for both domestic use and export.

“We are building platforms to deliver a comprehensive clean energy ecosystem — solar, battery storage, hydrogen — all at scale and under one umbrella,” said Anant Ambani. The products manufactured at these giga factories will support 24/7 renewable electricity supply and help produce green chemicals including green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuels.

Jamnagar, already home to Reliance’s twin oil refineries — the world’s largest refining complex — is being transformed into the base for the company’s renewable energy ambitions. Construction of the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is progressing rapidly and is expected to become the world’s largest clean energy hub in terms of scale and integration.

“Jamnagar will represent both the legacy of conventional energy and the future of new energy,” Mr Ambani said. Reliance has already begun producing solar photovoltaic modules at its Jamnagar facility. The company aims to scale up to a capacity of 20 GWp in the coming quarters, making it the largest single-site solar manufacturing facility in the world.

So far, it has successfully produced its first 200 MW of heterojunction (HJT) modules, which offer better performance and durability compared to conventional modules.

Alongside solar, the company is also building battery and electrolyser giga factories. The battery facility, scheduled to open in 2026, will start with an annual capacity of 40 GWh and expand to 100 GWh in phases. The electrolyser plant, also set to be operational by the end of 2026, will have the ability to scale up to 3 GW annually — supporting cost-effective hydrogen production on a global scale.

In Kutch, Gujarat, Reliance is developing one of the largest single-site solar projects in the world, covering 550,000 acres of arid land. At full pace, the site will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. Once complete, it could supply nearly 10% of India’s electricity demand within the next decade.

The company’s logistics and port infrastructure in Jamnagar and Kandla will support export operations for green hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia and methanol.

“India can become a global leader in affordable green hydrogen and its derivatives,” said Ambani, noting that the initial phase of production will serve the company’s own needs before scaling to 3 million tonnes per year by 2032.

Reliance is also focusing on bioenergy. It is building compressed biogas (CBG) plants with a target capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per year, aiming to scale to over 500 plants by 2030.

To support this, the company has set up the world’s largest Bioenergy Technology and R&D Centre in Jamnagar, where it is developing advanced technologies to increase biogas yields, including enzymes, microbes, and high-efficiency energy crops.

As part of its broader clean energy strategy, Reliance is also launching integrated energy hubs that combine smart farming, biogas and hydrogen production, agrivoltaics (dual land use for agriculture and solar power), and battery storage. These hubs aim to capture CO2 from CBG plants for green chemical production, targeting cost parity with fossil fuels.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Anant-Ambani-Executive-Director.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 21:56:19.765130
