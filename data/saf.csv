Ministry of Civil Aviation, in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and with support from the European Union has officially released the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Feasibility Study for India.

The launch event was addressed by Union Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu, Secretary of Civil Aviation Samir Kumar Sinha, Director General of Civil Aviation Faiz Ahmed and Jane Hupe, Deputy Director Environment, Air Transport Bureau, ICAO.

Welcoming stakeholders, the Minister underscored SAF’s critical role in advancing India’s sustainable aviation growth. He reaffirmed India’s readiness to become self-sufficient in SAF production, targeting 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in line with the CORSIA mandate.

The Minister stated, “SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonize the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional fuel”. He further highlighted that with over 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter.

Naidu pointed to important milestones already achieved, including the designation of COTECNA Inspection India Pvt. Ltd. as the country’s first SAF certification body and the certification of Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery as India’s first SAF producer. The Minister emphasised that SAF production will reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually.

The feasibility study, undertaken under the ICAO ACT-SAF Programme, assesses the potential for producing and utilising drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in India. It evaluates domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, infrastructure and policy readiness and the enabling conditions needed to establish a robust domestic SAF market. Drawing upon international best practices and tailoring them to India’s socio-economic and environmental context, the report provides a roadmap for sustainable fuel adoption.

The study is being deliberated at a two-day workshop at Udaan Bhawan, New Delhi, with participation from ICAO, EASA, DGCA, industry partners, and multiple government departments, reflecting a whole-of-government approach towards SAF.

Also speaking at the event, the Aviation Secretary underlined that global warming is a collective challenge and mitigating its impact is a shared responsibility.

Boeing, the U.S. aerospace giant, is ramping up its decarbonization efforts. On Sept. 3, the company announced a partnership with carbon removal startup Equatic and the Sarawak state government in Malaysia to pilot ocean-based carbon removal technology.

At the same time, it signed a collaboration with i-CATS University College to train talent in sustainable aviation technologies.

Ocean carbon removal pilot in Sarawak

Malaysia has long been a key base for Boeing in the Asia-Pacific, producing commercial aircraft components. Now, Sarawak will also serve as a testbed for new carbon removal solutions. Under Sarawak’s clean energy plan, Boeing will deploy Equatic’s ocean carbon removal technology, designed to boost the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide while generating green hydrogen. The pilot facility is scheduled to begin operations in 2026.

According to the plan, the pilot plant will remove 365 tons of CO₂ annually, while producing 10 tons of green hydrogen and 80 tons of calcium carbonate. These three revenue-generating outputs would offset the project's cost of operations.

Erika Pearson, Vice President of Commercial Sales and Marketing for Boeing Southeast Asia and Oceania, said the company is committed to advancing sustainability goals for both customers and shareholders while supporting Sarawak’s energy transition and carbon removal initiatives.

Robert Hardin, CEO of Sarawak Economic Development Corporation Energy (SEDCE), added that the state is well-positioned to develop clean hydrogen and carbon removal technologies, maximizing the potential of Equatic’s innovations.

From airliner to flying laboratory At the time of its retirement, Hefty Bee was one of only 15 other active B747-200s left in the world.
Regardless of its role in researching such current matters, the ALECSys program marks the end of the road for Hefty Bee.
Rolls-Royce told AeroTime that the company plans to continue using “a blend of flying test beds and ground test facilities in the future”.
It is not yet known which specific aircraft the engine maker plans to use as future flying test beds.","On July 9, 2025, one of the most peculiar jumbo jets to ever take to the sky was withdrawn from service after a distinguished career spanning 45 years. Although it first flew as an airliner, for the last two decades this aircraft’s mission has had nothing to do with carrying passengers or cargo.

Since 2005, the aircraft, officially called the “Spirit of Excellence”, a Boeing B747-200 with registration N787RR, was operated by none other than British engine maker Rolls-Royce, which used it as a Flying Test Bed or FTB.

A flying test bed is in essence a flying laboratory that allows engineers to test new engine types in all sorts of real operational environments.

The aircraft, nicknamed “Hefty Bee”, was specially configured to carry a supplementary engine mount so that new engine types can be tested in real flight conditions while preserving full propulsion redundancy. This means that one of the aircraft’s wings carries three engines instead of the usual two, for a total of five.

The aircraft cabin was fitted with instruments capable of collecting large amounts of data about the engine’s performance in flight.

From airliner to flying laboratory

At the time of its retirement, Hefty Bee was one of only 15 other active B747-200s left in the world.

Its first operator was Cathay Pacific, back in 1980. The aircraft was operated by the Hong Kong-based carrier until 1999, when it was acquired by ACMI and cargo operator Air Atlanta Icelandic and its subsidiary Air Atlanta Europe until its acquisition by Rolls-Royce in 2005.

Shortly after its acquisition by the engine maker, Hefty Bee underwent a thorough transformation at L-3 Communications (later rebranded as L3Harris) in Texas, United States, in order to be able to fulfill its new, specialized role.

Hefty Bee’s first, and perhaps most prominent mission, was to test the Trent 1000 engine, designed specifically to power the, what was then new and revolutionary, Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

However, the aircraft’s useful life did not end with the Trent 1000’s entry into service in 2011. By mid-2025, Hefty Bee’s service record included 250 flights and 800 flying hours, 10 and five times more, respectively, than the 25 flights and 150 flight hours that had originally been planned by Rolls-Royce. In fact, the British engine ended up doubling the aircraft’s use rate from two to four flights per week.

The need to keep working on the Trent 1000 program after some operators reported reliability issues and premature blade corrosion, ensured that Hefty Bee would continue to be engaged in the successive development and update of this engine type.

But Rolls-Royce’s unique B747 also took part in other notable engine research programs. More recently, the smaller Pearl 10 engine, developed by the British engine maker to power the Dassault Falcon 10X business jet, has also used Hefty Bee as a test bank. Rolls-Royce tested the specially modified B747 between May and October 2024.

Some of those test flights were performed using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). However, this was not a first for Hefty Bee. The aircraft had already completed a 100% SAF flight test in 2021 although on that occasion it was using a Trent 1000 instead of a Pearl 10 engine.

In a written response to AeroTime’s questions about the recent missions undertaken by Hefty Bee, Rolls-Royce highlighted the aircraft’s central role in the firm’s commitment towards sustainable aviation.

“It made history in 2021 by flying a Trent 1000 powered entirely by 100% sustainable aviation fuel. More recently it played a key role in the certification of the durability enhancement package to more than double time on wing for that engine, part of a wider £1bn investment,” the statement read. “Its final mission, completed in July 2025, supported our Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) engine demonstrator, marking a significant step towards delivering more efficient and sustainable engines.”

The statement referred to an ongoing research program, backed by the EU’s Clean Sky initiative and the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), which aims to lower the environmental footprint of aircraft engines by making the fuel burning process more efficient by pre-mixing fuel and air.

Regardless of its role in researching such current matters, the ALECSys program marks the end of the road for Hefty Bee.

What next for Hefty Bee?

The aircraft has been donated to the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona, right next to what has been its base for the last two decades. There it will join another jumbo jet N747GE, a Boeing 747-100 which was used by Rolls-Royce’s competitor GE Aerospace as a test bank between 1992 and 2017.

Rolls-Royce had long been preparing for Hefty Bee’s retirement. In 2019, the engine maker even acquired another jumbo jet, a much newer B747-400, registration N747RR, previously operated by Australian airline Qantas.

In a surprising move, though, Rolls-Royce cancelled a project to transform N747RR into another flying test bed in 2022 and sent the aircraft to be scrapped.

The engine maker, which has spent the last few years immersed in a major turnaround, has stated its willingness to use a mix of platforms and processes to test its new engines going forward.

Rolls-Royce told AeroTime that the company plans to continue using “a blend of flying test beds and ground test facilities in the future”.

It is not yet known which specific aircraft the engine maker plans to use as future flying test beds. However, it seems likely that its engine programs, such as the UltraFan technology which Rolls-Royce is developing for the Trent family, will see increased reliance on ground testing and simulators in the near future.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/08/53616604336_dfc351c087_k.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 04:56:33.455732

Airbus' new narrowbody, the A220, won't be helping their concerns. It is a clean-sheet design set to outperform its rivals in a number of metrics.

In this article, discover how Airbus has designed the A220 to dominate its competition, along with the challenges it faces and how the aircraft will continue to develop in the future.

The Three Ways That The A220 Could Win

In launching its new narrowbody aircraft, Airbus has outlined three ways it believes it can win with the A220 in competition with Boeing's narrowbody planes. Firstly, this will be a clean-sheet aircraft. It is a notable departure from the 737 MAX and A320neo variants, all of which are built upon pre-existing aircraft. A clean-sheet design allows all new innovations in aerodynamics, materials, and avionics to be integrated into a single aircraft. The target in doing so is to build a low-noise and environmentally friendly aircraft that can outperform its rivals with minimal impact on those on the ground. This makes the jet ideal for urban operations, particularly at night.

Airbus intends this jet to have a capacity for 100-160 passengers, offering a level of comfort never before experienced on a narrowbody aircraft. Passengers can enjoy wider seats, panoramic windows, and overhead bins that beat any other aircraft in its class. Of course, Airbus can't control all of these factors. Some are within the control of the airlines. As always, comfort aboard the aircraft will still depend on the airline operating it. Meanwhile, such a commitment to a small jet aircraft indicates a belief that airlines will continue moving towards high frequency rather than high-capacity services.

Finally, the A220 is built for versatility and efficiency. These characteristics open up more opportunities for airlines, allowing them to increase their revenues. Moreover, Airbus says this jet will have 25% lower operating costs per seat compared to previous-generation planes. These factors combine to mean better profit margins.

A220 Overview

In 2018, Airbus launched a new family of five-abreast narrowbody jets, based on the Bombardier CSeries (launched 2012). The jet became known as the A220 after Airbus purchased a majority stake in the joint venture to manufacture the aircraft. It is Airbus' most advanced clean-sheet design narrowbody, utilizing PW1500G geared turbofans from Pratt & Whitney, fly-by-wire controls, carbon composite wings, and an aluminum-lithium fuselage. Airbus has committed to this jet to challenge the Boeing 737 MAX 7 and four-abreast Embraer E-jets. It complements the A319neo. It has allowed Airbus to gain a 55% market share in the small jet airliner category.

The table below outlines the key specifications of both variants of the A220: -100 and -300. It has been put together from data collected by Airbus:

The A220 has already gathered modest success. Delta Air Lines is the largest operator, with 45 -100s and 34 -300s, and a further 66 -300s on order. This is unsurprising, given that they are also the largest operator of the Airbus A330 and Boeing 717, 757, and 767. In total, airlines have ordered 941 A220s, with 435 delivered to date. Those in service, spread between 24 operators, have completed over 1.5 million flights and 2.7 million block hours.

A220 Variants

Airbus currently has two variants of the A220: -100 and -300. The -100 is currently Airbus' smallest jetliner. The unit price is $81 million, substantially higher than Embraer's E-190 E2 and E-195 E2, which are priced between $61 million and $69 million; however, airlines placing bulk orders will receive the jets for less than this. 72 A220-100s are currently in service, with Delta leading the pack.

Airbus' marketing of the -100 is angled towards its capabilities as a ""route opener"" and the ""lowest risk solution."" They hope airlines will utilize it to operate in short-haul and small markets. The greatly decreased operating cost per seat and low capacity could make previously impractical routes profitable. Yet, its range also allows for some medium-haul routes to be operated. For example, Airbus states that, from Paris, the jet can reach African, Asian, and Middle Eastern destinations, like Islamabad, Muscat, Addis Ababa, and Entebbe.

The larger variant is the A220-300. This jet was first delivered as the CS300 to airBaltic following its maiden flight in February 2015. It is a slightly more affordable aircraft ($91.5 million) than the A319neo ($101.5 million), making it a cheaper complementary alternative. There are currently 363 -300s in service, with JetBlue being the largest operator with 51 aircraft. Airbus hopes airlines will use this aircraft as a ""network builder"" due to its combination of lean efficiency and greater capacity. Its range and versatility allow for both regional and intercontinental routes. For example, for airlines using Dallas as a hub, it states the edge of its range to be Anchorage, Lima, Bridgetown, and Cayenne.

The A220 and Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Alongside its high-tech construction, the A220 is also part of Airbus' efforts to transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a goal of 100% SAF by 2030. It made headlines this month for flying from Mirabel in Canada to Paris using a 50% SAF mixture. All Airbus aircraft are certified to fly with a 50% SAF blend, and the company has delivered 78% of its aircraft using this blend in 2025. Meanwhile, 75% of its aircraft deliveries in 2024 used a SAF blend. The flight was carried out to deliver a new A220 to Air France. Airbus claims this is the first time that its Canadian site has issued sustainability credentials to a customer.

Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM, said: ""Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical, and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s.""

The next step is to collaborate with airlines to increase the frequency of SAF blends appearing on commercial flights, and Airbus is currently forming partnerships to make this possible. For example, it conducted an operational trial with Charleroi Airport (Brussels) and Wizz Air, involving 50 commercial flights using a SAF blend.

What Challenges Could The A220 Face?

With Boeing becoming an increasingly unreliable manufacturer in recent years, it appears that ensuring aircraft reliability is maintained and production targets are met are easy wins for Airbus and others. The A220 has been largely without major issues, with a handful of notable exceptions. In January 2025, Air Canada's AC609 (a -300) suffered a pressurization issue, forcing the aircraft to return to base. However, the cause was swiftly identified as the shearing off of an aft cargo vent flap idler bearing, and the aircraft returned to service after it was fixed.

More concerning was SWISS's 2019 grounding of its entire A220 fleet after issues involving the Pratt & Whitney engines in October 2019. SWISS told Simple Flying: ""Only following a faultless inspection will these aircraft be returned to regular flight duties. This will put substantial restrictions on SWISS’s flight operations, as numerous flights will have to be cancelled."" However, the airline successfully returned its entire A220 fleet to the skies less than a week later.

The A220's only 'accident' has also occurred with a SWISS aircraft. Flight 1885, from Henri Coanda International Airport to Zurich Airport, diverted to Graz Airport after engine issues caused smoke to fill the cabin and cockpit during cruise. All 79 people on board were successfully evacuated after landing, but 17 people had to be rushed to the hospital. One member of the cabin crew died a week later.

What Next For The A220

The main development expected from the A220 in coming years will be the A220-500, a stretched version of the aircraft set to enter service in the early 2030s. A number of airlines are already interested in a higher-capacity A220.

Some doubts still remain about whether this jet is guaranteed to come into existence. A longer A220 was also on the cards back when it was the Bombardier CSeries, but never came to pass. However, this jet has strong commercial reasoning, as it could function as a direct competitor to the 737-800 and 737 MAX 8.

Successfully rolling out this variant will require ongoing A220 production issues to be fixed. During a June 2025 Airbus Business Update, Florent Massou dit Labaquère, the Executive Vice President of Operations of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, referred to issues with plants constructing A220 pylons, systems, strut-to-wing hardware, aft fairings, wings, control surfaces, and the mid-fuselage sections.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a220-reveal-first-arrival-in-airbus-livery-13_ai-eve-a220-firstdelivery-cropped.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-04 21:56:34.018962

The carrier posted record Q2 2025 revenues of $14.4 billion, a 5% jump in international passenger unit revenue, with especially strong demand across the Atlantic. Its operating margin climbed to 8%, while earnings per share of $0.95 beat Wall Street expectations. AAL is also giving a strong net-zero push with significant investment in SAF.

Let’s deep dive into its revenue and its sustainability goals below.

American Airlines’ Passenger Growth Gives Earnings a Lift

The earnings release showed that premium cabins led the charge, with families, leisure travelers, and business flyers paying up for long-haul comfort. The airline also leaned into its AAdvantage loyalty program, which grew 7% in 2025. Upticks in co-branded credit card use and new perks like instant upgrades helped drive repeat bookings.

Together, these gains signaled more than just post-pandemic recovery—they showed targeted growth in high-margin categories.

Holiday Travel Tailwinds

Heading into the year-end holidays, American is adding capacity both at home and abroad. Routes to resilient leisure destinations are expanding, while premium travel remains a strong revenue engine. The airline is betting that higher engagement and a growing loyalty base will keep its planes full during the holiday surge.

Yet, investors are cautious. AAL shares trade at $13.39, nearly 28% below their 2025 peak of $18.66. AAL stock has been volatile, with 22 swings of more than 5% this year alone. Analysts maintain a neutral outlook, with a median 12-month price target of $13.55, suggesting limited upside unless cost pressures ease.

Q3 Forecast: Clear Skies or Turbulence Ahead?

Despite Q2 strength, management offered a more sober Q3 forecast. The company expects a loss per share between $0.10 and $0.60, missing analyst profit estimates. That guidance reflects the industry’s most stubborn challenges:

Fuel volatility – oil prices are holding around $86 per barrel.

Labor pressures – wage hikes, including a 10% pilot raise, are cutting into margins.

Tariff and macro risks – global trade uncertainties remain a drag.

Margins for Q3 are projected between -1% and +2%. At the same time, costs per available seat mile may climb another 2.5–4.5% year-on-year. Pilot shortages and weather disruptions have also played their part, denting operational efficiency.

Still, the company is leaning on its $12 billion liquidity buffer to manage volatility. With the industry facing similar headwinds, investors will watch closely to see how well the airline balances growth with cost control.

A Different Flight Path: American Airlines 2050 Net Zero Goals

While financials dominate headlines, American Airlines is also pushing ahead on climate commitments. Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, but the carrier has tied its long-term competitiveness to a net-zero emissions goal by 2050. Intermediate targets for 2030 and 2035 add pressure to deliver progress sooner.

Decarbonizing air travel requires public-private collaboration, innovation, and policy support. However, the company is investing heavily in efficiency, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and next-generation aircraft within its operations.

Capital Investments with Climate Benefits

In 2024, roughly 55% of American’s capital spending supported both profitability and decarbonization. That included billions invested in new aircraft, fuel-saving initiatives, and fleet modernization. Although deliveries slowed in 2024 due to supply chain delays, the company expects to take delivery of more efficient aircraft in 2025.

Next-generation aircraft is the key to the airline’s climate playbook.

It became the largest airline to sign a conditional purchase agreement for 100 ZeroAvia hydrogen-electric engines. They can power regional jets with zero emissions beyond water vapor.

The company aims to induct hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2032 or earlier.

Betting Big on Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is widely regarded as the most critical near-term lever for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF can cut life-cycle emissions by up to 85%. But supply remains limited, and high costs are slowing adoption.

It aims to replace 10% of its jet fuel use with SAF by 2030, which would avoid about 3.5 million metric tons of CO2. In 2024, the airline used 2.9 million gallons of SAF, a modest 9.7% increase from 2023 but still under 0.1% of total fuel use.

It has signed offtake deals to scale SAF. They include

Up to 10 million gallons from Valero by mid-2026.

Agreement with Infinium, an e-fuels producer, with deliveries expected as early as 2027.

The company also became a founding member of the SAF Coalition, which lobbies for federal incentives to make SAF cost-competitive.

American applies strict sourcing principles to its SAF purchases, requiring at least a 50% life-cycle emissions reduction, full feedstock impact assessments, and sustainability certifications.

Airspace Efficiency

Beyond fuel, American is working with policymakers to modernize airspace management. Better flight planning and optimized routing reduce emissions while boosting safety and on-time performance.

In 2024, the airline rolled out a flight planning optimization tool and equipped its A321 fleet with ADS-B In technology, allowing pilots to adjust routes in real-time for efficiency. These upgrades enhance both operational reliability and sustainability.

Carbon Markets as a Backstop

American Airlines also participates in voluntary carbon markets to neutralize residual emissions. The company is exploring offsets and removals as complementary tools to in-sector solutions.

Last year, it onboarded new digital tools to help corporate customers meet their own decarbonization goals, signaling growing demand for carbon-aligned travel options.

Momentum vs. Risk: Can AAL Keep Flying High?

For shareholders, AAL stock presents a mix of opportunity and risk. The airline is benefiting from record revenues, stronger loyalty engagement, and solid demand for premium travel. Yet, rising costs, $38 billion in debt, and the heavy price of climate transition investments are weighing on its outlook.

With a price-to-sales ratio of 0.16 compared to the industry average of 0.69, AAL appears undervalued. Still, challenges like wage pressures and fuel volatility temper bullish sentiment. Most analysts recommend patience, noting that future gains will hinge on execution and broader market conditions.

Looking ahead, American Airlines has shown it can soar when demand is strong, but turbulence is likely in 2025. The airline is balancing earnings volatility with billions committed to its net-zero pathway. Its ability to manage profitability while pushing forward on decarbonization will shape its role as both a leading U.S. carrier and a case study in how aviation adapts to market and climate pressures.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_738219229.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 00:56:13.847519

The order reduces U.S. tariffs on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, with the change set to take effect by the end of this month. The lower duties on autos will begin seven days after the order's publication, while some tariff relief is retroactive to August 7. Reuters earlier reported, citing a Japanese government source, that the cut had been expected as part of broader negotiations.

Trump lowers tariffs on Japanese imports: What we know

Trump's levies on global shipments, imposed in August, had weighed heavily on Japanese carmakers. Toyota said last month it expected a nearly $10 billion hit from the tariffs on vehicles shipped into the United States.

Toyota said in a statement Thursday, ""We appreciate President Trump's leadership in securing a trade deal with Japan. While nearly 80% of the vehicles Toyota sells in the U.S. are made in North America, this framework provides much needed clarity. We are encouraged by this development and hopeful for progress with Canada and Mexico to continue providing our U.S. customers with affordable vehicles that fit their needs.""

The order also notes Japan is ""working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements... and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel)"" and other U.S. products totaling $8 billion per year.

It further reiterates that the Japanese government has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States in projects selected by Washington. The Japanese government declined to comment.

The two countries had agreed in July to reduce tariffs on Japanese automobiles, though the timing had been uncertain until Trump signed the order. Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, traveled to Washington on Thursday to press for the executive order.

Japan has said the deal ensures that as the U.S.'s fifth-largest trading partner, it will always receive the lowest tariff rate on chips and pharmaceuticals negotiated by Washington. The agreement also removes tariffs on commercial airplanes and parts.

The order is also expected to include provisions clarifying that the 15% levy agreed in July will not be stacked on Japanese imports already subject to higher tariffs, while items with rates below 15% would be raised to the new level, the source said. The $550 billion investment package, which includes equity, loans and guarantees from Japanese state-owned banks, was agreed to as part of the July deal.

The European Union reached a similar agreement with Washington in July, securing a 15% baseline tariff as part of a framework trade deal and averting new tariffs on chips and pharmaceuticals. Last week, the European Commission proposed scrapping duties on imported U.S. industrial goods in exchange for reduced American tariffs on European cars.

What does the US Import from Japan?

The United States imports a wide range of goods from Japan, with automobiles and auto parts making up the largest share. Other key imports include machinery, electronics, medical instruments, and steel products. Japanese cars, in particular, dominate U.S. markets, making tariffs on them a focal point of recent trade negotiations.

What does the US Export to Japan?

U.S. exports to Japan are led by agricultural products such as corn, soybeans, beef, and rice, along with industrial goods like aircraft, machinery, and chemicals. Energy exports, including liquefied natural gas and bioethanol, have also grown in recent years. Trade deals often emphasize boosting Japan's purchases of American farm goods, reflecting the sector's importance in U.S. trade policy.

The minister also said that SAF production will not only reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually but also boost farmers’ incomes by creating a strong value chain for agricultural residue and biomass.

Recently, Indian Oil Corporation became the first Indian company to get the ISCC CORSIA certification for production of SAF at its refinery in Panipat, Haryana.

CORSIA refers to Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) of the ICAO.

The minister also reaffirmed India's readiness to become self-sufficient in SAF production, targeting 1 per cent blending in ATF (Aviation Turbine Fuel) by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030 in line with the CORSIA mandate.

Meanwhile, COTECNA Inspection India Pvt Ltd has become the country's first SAF certification body.

Last month, Air India and Indian Oil Corporation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the supply of SAF.

The OMB publishes two unified agendas annually: a spring edition and a fall edition. The agendas outline rulemakings and other actions currently under development by federal agencies, along with projected timelines.

According to the latest version of the OMB’s regulatory agenda, the EPA is targeting October 2025 for the promulgation of its final RFS “Set 2” rule.

The EPA initially released its proposed RFS “Set 2” rule in June. A public comment period closed Aug. 8 and the EPA on Aug. 29 resubmitted the RFS rulemaking to the OMB for review.

The RFS “Set 2” rule aims to set RFS renewable volume obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027. The rulemaking also included several provisions that aim to fundamentally alter the RFS program, including those to boost domestic biofuel production by limiting the ability for imported fuels and feedstocks to participate in the RFS and eliminate electricity, or eRINs, from the program.

The unified agenda also indicates the EPA is targeting September 2025 for the issuance of a final rule regarding its reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding and vehicle emissions standards. The agency in late July released a proposed rule to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which forms the legal basis for the agency’s greenhouse gas (GHG) regulations, and vehicle GHG emissions standards.

The EPA in July also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to reconsider its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The agency currently plans to take final action on that reconsideration by November 2025.

A full copy of the Spring 2025 Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions is available on the OMB website.

Blends are being tested At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, mixed with conventional jet fuel.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel.
Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story.","The federal spending law passed in early July, often called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, significantly reduces federal funding for efforts to create renewable or sustainable types of fuel that can power aircraft over long distances while decreasing the damage aviation does to the global climate.

Aviation contributed about 2.5% of global carbon emissions in 2023. It’s particularly hard to reduce emissions from planes because there are few alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. Electric batteries with enough energy to power an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

One potential solution, which I work on as an aerospace engineer, is a category of fuel called “sustainable aviation fuel.” Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is refined from petroleum, sustainable aviation fuels are produced from renewable and waste resources — such as used cooking oil, agricultural leftovers, algae, sewage and trash. But they are similar enough to conventional jet fuels that they work in existing aircraft tanks and engines without any major modifications.

Prior to Donald Trump’s second term as president, the U.S. government had set some bold targets: by 2030, producing 3 billion gallons of this type of fuel every year, and by 2050, producing enough to fuel every U.S. commercial jet flight. But there’s a long journey ahead.

A range of source materials

The earliest efforts to create sustainable aviation fuels relied on food crops – turning corn into ethanol or soybean oil into biodiesel. The raw materials were readily available, but growing them competed with food production.

The next generation of biofuels are using nonfood sources such as algae, or agricultural waste such as manure or stalks from harvested corn. These don’t compete with food supplies. If processed efficiently, they also have the potential to emit less carbon: Algae absorb carbon dioxide during their growth, and using agricultural waste avoids its decomposition, which would release greenhouse gases.

But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All these approaches – and others being explored as well – aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging US$2.34 a gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 a gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand – starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

Planes can use these fuels

Companies such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce have shown that the jet engines they manufacture can run perfectly on sustainable fuels.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel. That means the aircraft’s weight distribution and flight range could change.

And other parts of the aircraft also have to be compatible, such as those that store, pump and maintain the balance of the fuel. That includes valves, pipes and rubber seals. As a visiting professor at Boeing in the summer of 2024, I learned that it and other aircraft manufacturers are working closely with their suppliers to ensure sustainable aviation fuels can be safely and reliably integrated into every part of the aircraft.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story. Usually, the fuel on those flights contains a small amount of conventional jet fuel or special additives. That’s because sustainable fuels lack some of the aromatic chemical compounds found in fossil-based fuels that are required to maintain proper seals throughout the aircraft’s fuel system.

Good promise, with work ahead

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change.

The work will take research, and investment from governments, manufacturers and airlines around the world, whether or not the U.S. is involved. But one day, the fuel powering your flight could be much greener than it is now.

Important development in the aviation sector The aviation ministry is likely to soon come up with a sustainable aviation Fuel policy, the policy that aims to promote SF and the production of CSF in the country and for the same the aviation ministry along with ECO, the International Civil Aviation Organization, they have come up with a feasibility study. Now this study will provide the valuable insights and the research for the formation for for framing the policy on the essay for the sustainable aviation fuel. A policy. Moreover, this policy will also provide the much needed guidelines to the all marketing companies. We have always seen that the government has set an ambitious target of blending the SF with the with the petrol, with the aviation fuel and the ambitious target is to have a SPF blending of 1% by year 2020, seven 2% by 2028 and 3% by 2029. So for this government has has done the consultation with the stakeholders. In addition to this, the government. Also understand that the promotion of SF will help to reduce the carbon emission by around 20 to 25,000,000 tons annually and this also will help to give much needed push to farmers income and also to save significant amount of money when it comes to the import of aviation fuel in the country as well.

This operation not only expands the airline’s SAF footprint but also positions Portland strategically to benefit from the growth of this fuel in the United States.

Over 400,000 Gallons in First Delivery

The batch, totaling more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF, was domestically produced from waste materials. Shell supplied the pure SAF to the Zenith terminal in Portland, where it was blended with conventional jet fuel to meet regulatory standards. It was then transported to the airport via barge, truck, and pipeline. Earlier this month, the fuel entered the airport’s private fueling system.

Collaboration Paves the Way

“Every SAF delivery demonstrates the power of collaboration to open markets for this sustainable fuel,” said Charlotte Lollar, Director of SAF at Delta. “By working with Shell and the Port of Portland Authority, we can leverage existing infrastructure, access more airports, and prove that its use is both viable and scalable for the industry.”

Dan Pippenger, Aviation Director at the Port Authority, emphasized that this move will help improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions: “We hope that state and local policies will support the development of the necessary infrastructure and market to expand the use of SAF and unlock all the environmental and health benefits it offers.”

A Fuel with Potential, Yet Still Limited

SAF, produced from renewable sources, can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional fuel. It can also be distributed through existing infrastructure and used in current engines without modifications. However, production technology is still under development, which drives up costs and limits availability. In fact, current global production would not be enough to supply airlines for even a single week.

Policies and Incentives Make a Difference

Delta is collaborating with the Port of Portland Authority and other stakeholders to build a sustained SAF market in the region. The airline is also engaged at the federal and state levels in promoting incentives that boost production and reduce costs. In 2022, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, then Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, helped pass the first federal incentives for SAF, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. Both have become benchmarks for state policies, and the latter was extended by Congress until 2029.

Global Strategy Based in Portland

This inaugural delivery follows previous Delta SAF shipments at airports such as Minneapolis-St. Paul and Detroit, reinforcing its strategy to expand SAF across different airport systems.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

Section 1. Background. On July 22, 2025, I announced a framework agreement between the United States and Japan (Agreement), which lays the foundation for a new era of United States-Japan trade relations grounded in principles of reciprocity and our shared national interests. The Agreement establishes a tariff framework that levels the playing field for American producers and accounts for American national security needs. In my judgment, the Agreement is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended; and Proclamation 10962 of July 30, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Copper Into the United States). The Agreement will reduce the United States trade deficit, boost the economy of the United States, and address the consequences of the United States trade deficit, including by strengthening the manufacturing and defense industrial base of the United States.

Under the Agreement, the United States will apply a baseline 15 percent tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States, alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the United States. This new tariff framework, combined with expanded United States exports and investment-driven production, will help reduce the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall United States trade position.

Japan, meanwhile, will provide American manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, food, energy, automobile, and industrial goods producers with breakthrough openings in market access across key sectors. Specifically, the Government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75 percent increase of United States rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products, in amounts totaling $8 billion per year. The Government of Japan is also working to accept for sale in Japan United States-manufactured and United States-safety-certified passenger vehicles without additional testing. Separately, Japan will purchase United States-made commercial aircraft, as well as United States defense equipment.

Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States. These investments — which will be selected by the United States Government — will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.

In my judgment, I determine that the following actions are consistent with the national interest of the United States and are necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended; Proclamation 9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and Proclamation 10962.

Sec. 2. General Tariffs. (a) The additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to products of Japan shall be determined by a product’s current ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (“Column 1 Duty Rate”).

America’s prolific exports of oil, gas, and coal both create jobs at home and expand our Nation’s global influence. With clear-eyed leadership in Washington, D.C., the Trump Administration is now also mobilizing America’s agricultural abundance in pursuit of American energy dominance.

The multi-generational boom in American agricultural production is an often-overlooked success story. In 1925, American farmers produced 27.4 bushels of corn per acre, totaling 2.3 billion bushels across the country. This year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicts that national production of corn will set two new records of 188.8 bushels per acre and 16.7 billion bushels in total. A new record will also be set for soybeans, for which USDA predicts an historic yield of 53.6 bushels per acre. The grit and innovation of American farmers have unlocked these historically unparalleled harvests.

The dramatic increase in crop yields has helped to fuel food security at home and the production of biofuels across the country. Ethanol is now produced in 21 states and the United States has been a net-exporter of the fuel since 2010. Other biofuels—such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel—are produced in 22 plants across 13 states.",https://www.americafirstpolicy.com/assets/uploads/Energy_and_Environment_-_CAT.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 19:56:20.483069

Continue the Conversation at Skift Aviation Forum These forces are not passing headwinds but tectonic shifts, setting the stage for aviation’s next decade.
Skift Aviation Forum is where the answers come into focus.","Aviation has always moved in cycles, swinging from record profits to steep downturns with each economic shock or oil spike. But the turbulence facing the industry now feels different.

Supply chains are stretched thin, traveler behavior is fragmenting, and regulators are reshaping cost structures in real time.

As 2026 approaches, these five forces, among others, are setting the rules for how airlines compete and innovate. These are the very dynamics fueling the conversations at the Skift Aviation Forum, where leaders gather to map aviation’s next chapter.

1. Supply Chain Strains and Tariff Risks

Modern aircraft are global puzzles, assembled from thousands of parts sourced everywhere from Wichita to Shenzhen. That puzzle is increasingly missing pieces. Supply chain disruptions, worsened by new tariffs between the U.S., EU, and China, are driving up costs and delaying deliveries.

Boeing and its vast supplier base feel the crunch first, with ripple effects on airlines waiting for new fleets. A few points of tariff increase can mean billions in unexpected costs, layoffs across suppliers, and years of stalled growth plans. If trade tensions drag into 2026, airlines will be stuck with slower fleet modernization just as demand shifts keep accelerating.

2. Changing Demand Patterns and Market Uncertainties

Forecasting demand has always been an airline specialty, but 2025 has made those models wobble. Premium cabins and international routes, especially transatlantic, remain strong. U.S. domestic and economy-class demand, however, has softened. Several U.S. carriers have already trimmed forecasts, pointing to shaky consumer confidence.

Meanwhile, European groups are still betting big on long-haul. The lesson is clear: agility matters more than scale. Airlines that can pivot products quickly and redeploy capacity will keep an edge while others get caught off balance.

Want to hear from the leaders navigating this turbulence? Join JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty and Breeze Airways founder David Neeleman at Skift Aviation Forum.

3. Geopolitical Tensions and Route Adaptation

Every route map is now a negotiation. Wars, airspace closures, and diplomatic standoffs force carriers to redraw flight paths constantly, often at high cost. Each closure adds fuel burn, cuts into capacity, and limits growth.

Take India’s long-haul ambitions: aircraft orders are only half the story. Expanded access agreements are equally crucial, and without them, planes will sit idle. In a volatile geopolitical climate, airlines need as much savvy in diplomacy as in operations.

Sustainability has shifted from a marketing claim to a financial reality. In Europe, mandated use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has already added more than $1 billion in costs. Production, however, remains scarce. Airlines face fines for failing to hit ambitious blending targets, forcing them to balance compliance against credibility.

For travelers, that pressure can mean higher fares. For airlines, the real challenge is showing progress on emissions beyond what regulators require. The industry is being pushed to prove climate impact while absorbing higher costs.

5. Digital Transformation and Industry Consolidation

Behind the booking engines, airlines are racing to modernize their digital backbone. New Distribution Capability (NDC) promises sharper retailing and better margins, while data-driven systems are reshaping customer service and operations. At the same time, financial strain is pushing carriers toward consolidation.

Mergers are on the horizon, with stronger players eyeing growth and weaker ones seeking survival. By 2026, fewer competitors could mean more efficiency but also higher fares and reduced choice in some markets. The winners will be airlines that combine digital agility with smart acquisitions.

Continue the Conversation at Skift Aviation Forum

These forces are not passing headwinds but tectonic shifts, setting the stage for aviation’s next decade. Airlines, airports, and suppliers that fail to adapt risk being left behind.

The question is how quickly the change unfolds. Skift Aviation Forum is where the answers come into focus. Seats are filling fast.

What Is SAF?

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, derived from renewable biological sources. These include:

Biomass

Waste lipids

Sugars converted into hydrocarbons

Agricultural residues

Plant and animal oils & fats

Bio-derived hydrocarbons

Fatty acid esters

These sources make SAF a powerful tool in reducing the carbon footprint of air travel.

Why SAF Matters

One of SAF’s most compelling advantages is its compatibility with existing aircraft. It can be blended with conventional jet fuel up to 50%, offering a substantial reduction in emissions without requiring modifications to aircraft engines or infrastructure.

Even more promising, aircraft engines have successfully run on 100% unblended SAF, proving that the skies of tomorrow could be entirely powered by sustainable fuel.

The Future Is Flying Green

As the aviation industry embraces innovation and responsibility, SAF stands out as a key enabler of change. The future of flight is being redefined, cleaner, greener, and more sustainable than ever before.

In the Netherlands specifically, Shell said it has invested €6.5 billion in recent years for energy transition projects.
Shell’s decision to walk away from the Rotterdam biofuels follows the operator’s ongoing shift to focusing on projects that deliver both lower emissions and better returns.","Shell PLC said it has officially pulled the plug on subsidiary Shell Nederland Raffinaderij BV’s proposed biofuels plant in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

After calling an interim suspension of works on the planned 820,000-tonnes/year (tpy) biofuels plant last year to reassess the project's competitiveness, Shell said on Sept. 3 it will not resume construction on the plant following conclusions of an in-depth commercial and technical evaluation showing the investment no longer makes financial sense.

“It became clear the project wouldn’t be competitive enough to meet our customers’ demand for affordable, low-carbon products,” said Machteld de Haan, who leads Shell’s Downstream, Renewables, and Energy Solutions business. “It was a tough call, but the right one.”

Approved for final investment decision in 2021 and started for construction in 2022 at Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, the plant was to become one of Europe’s biggest for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel made from waste, with SAF initially projected to make up more than half of the site’s production.

Despite the project’s cancellation, Shell said it remains committed to biofuels and will continue trading and supplying low-carbon fuels, including SAF.

While the Rotterdam project is off the table, the operator said it is investing heavily in other low-carbon areas, with $8 billion between 2023-24 dedicated to reduced-carbon technologies, including hydrogen, carbon capture, and electrification.

In the Netherlands specifically, Shell said it has invested €6.5 billion in recent years for energy transition projects. These include:

The Porthos carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at the port of Rotterdam that in 2026 will begin capturing and transporting carbon dioxide (CO2) from local industrial companies for storage in empty gas fields under the North Sea, including about 2.5 million tpy collected for a period of 15 years from Shell, ExxonMobil Corp., Air Liquide SA, and Air Products and Chemicals Inc.

The Holland Hydrogen 1 electrolyzer, a 200-Mw plant under construction that will be powered by offshore wind from the North Sea to produce up to 80 tonnes/day of hydrogen upon completion later this decade.

Upgrades to subsidiary Nederland Chemie BV’s Moerdijk’s petrochemicals plant, which hosts a 500,000-tpy steam cracker for ethylene production.

Shell’s decision to walk away from the Rotterdam biofuels follows the operator’s ongoing shift to focusing on projects that deliver both lower emissions and better returns.

Launched in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the EU, the study presented key findings on SAF’s growth potential in India ahead of ICAO’s Innovation Fair in Montreal. The workshop sets a comprehensive roadmap for SAF adoption across India, from production to deployment.

At the summit, Minister Ram Mohan Naidu noted:

SAF offers a practical and immediate pathway to decarbonise aviation, with the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The Minister added that scaling SAF production could reduce India’s carbon emissions by 20 to 25 million tonnes annually. Now one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, SAF could be critical to scaling Indian aviation while maintaining net-zero emissions targets.

As a country with over 750 million metric tonnes of biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, India is well-positioned to become a global hub for SAF manufacture and export. Additionally, the country’s young aircraft fleet is already among the most energy-efficient in the world, providing a solid foundation for further sustainable development.

India’s government has set ambitious targets for SAF deployment: 1% of total fuel for international flights by 2027, and an increase to 5% by 2030. Production at the first certified SAF refinery, Indian Oil’s Panipat, is expected to begin by the end of 2025.

While SAF could potentially reduce the carbon emissions of the energy-intense aviation sector significantly, its long-term feasibility has been challenged. A 2024 report from the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) labelled sustainable fuels ‘a false solution’ that are impossible to scale effectively in line with net-zero emissions targets.

Meanwhile, Shell announced on 3 September 2025 announced that they were cancelling the construction of their flagship biomass fuel facility in the Netherlands. The oil and gas giant had already paused the project in 2024 due to technical difficulties, but will now shelve it entirely. Machteld de Haan, head of downstream, renewables and energy solutions at Shell, said:

As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products.

With India preparing to scale SAF investment, the world will be watching closely to determine whether SAF can deliver on its promise to reduce emissions.

Join us at Aerospace Tech Week 2026 for our Sustainable Aerospace summit, where industry leaders will discuss the future of SAF and operational sustainability.

The company stated that completing the site no longer offered the necessary competitive conditions, following an internal reassessment of costs and market outlook.

A trade-off between profitability and industrial commitment

The President of Shell’s “Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions” division, Machteld de Haan, said that investments must meet “the expectations of customers and shareholders,” highlighting a portfolio optimisation strategy. Construction had already been suspended in July 2024. The plant was expected to become one of the largest biofuels facilities in Europe, with an annual capacity of 820,000 tonnes.

SAF, an emerging but fragile market

Among the planned outputs was Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), produced from used oils, algae or wood residues. This fuel can be blended up to 50% with kerosene in existing aircraft. Despite growing interest from the aviation sector, industrial production of SAF remains limited and its high cost continues to hinder adoption. Its commercial viability has not yet reached balance against conventional fossil fuel supply chains.

Capital allocation strategy under pressure

Shell had already announced in December the termination of new offshore wind projects. These successive decisions form part of a reorientation towards hydrocarbons, perceived as more profitable in the short term. While aligned with shareholder interests, this strategy comes as the group had previously communicated on a gradual shift towards alternative energies.

Industrial choices raising contradictions

The decision to abandon a project already advanced raises questions over the coherence of Shell’s energy commitments. The group continues to express interest in low-carbon molecules, while simultaneously cutting investments in this field. This refocusing highlights the internal trade-offs between profitability requirements and positioning in emerging energy markets.",https://energynews.pro/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/en_114030941540-1.webp,N,,2025-09-04 13:56:26.697226

Delta Air Lines has announced the successful delivery of over 400,000 gallons of blended Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into the fuel system at Portland International Airport (PDX). This marks the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at the airport, achieved through a collaboration with Shell and the Port of Portland.

The SAF was produced in the United States using waste-derived feedstock. Shell supplied the neat SAF, which was then blended with conventional jet fuel at Zenith Terminal in Portland to meet regulatory standards. The blended fuel was transported to PDX via barge, truck, and pipeline, entering the airport's privately owned fuel supply system earlier this month.

This initiative is part of Delta's broader strategy to expand its SAF footprint and increase the availability of sustainable fuel options across various airports. The airline has previously facilitated SAF deliveries to other hubs, including Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) and Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW).

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is an alternative jet fuel derived from renewable sources, capable of reducing lifecycle carbon emissions by more than 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. Despite its environmental benefits, SAF production technology is still developing, resulting in limited availability and higher costs. Current production levels are insufficient to meet global airline fuel demands for even a single week.

Delta is actively working with local and federal stakeholders to establish a sustainable market and delivery infrastructure for SAF at the Port of Portland. The airline is also advocating for government incentives to boost SAF production and improve its cost competitiveness. In 2022, federal incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, were introduced, with the latter extended through 2029.

The delivery at PDX reflects Delta's ongoing efforts to demonstrate the viability and scalability of SAF across different airport systems. The airline's operations in Oregon include providing nonstop service from PDX to nearly all of Delta's hub airports, supported by a workforce of approximately 4,500 employees in the Pacific Northwest.",https://www.travelindustrywire.com/theme/Nevistas2/images/icon.png,N,,2025-09-04 17:56:23.485423

This year, BP put an SAF project at its Kwinana oil refinery in Australia on hold.
Of course, it may well be better for the planet if airlines filled up with SAF.
Even so, with the likes of Shell cutting back on SAF, Reeves’s game-changer may take a while to land.
Raising dough Some toppings would even fox Domino’s Pizza.","Sawan reckoned that by 2035 — Reeves’s panglossian date for the opening of the new runway — only “a very, very small proportion” of flights would be using SAF.

And now? Well, as if to drive the message home, Shell has just scrapped construction of one of Europe’s biggest biofuel plants: a site in Rotterdam due to produce SAF and renewable diesel. Hence a key question: if Shell can’t make a go of SAF, who can?

Listen to Shell executive Machteld de Haan and this was a site-specific decision, for which it’s now taking a post-tax hit of around $785 million: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products”.

Still, it was only in 2023 that Shell also opted not to go ahead with a SAF project at Singapore’s Bukom Island, due to supply Asian airports. And it’s hardly alone. This year, BP put an SAF project at its Kwinana oil refinery in Australia on hold.

World Energy said in March that it was putting SAF production at its California refinery into “warm idle”.

Of course, it may well be better for the planet if airlines filled up with SAF. But, as Sawan noted in February, it’s more expensive: two to four times the price of kerosene. So, “unless there are mandates — obligations on either customers or airlines — it is difficult to see a penetration that is going to be massive … airlines will not simply erode their bottom lines for the sake of it”. Worse, he’d seen “backsliding on mandates in multiple countries”, hitting Shell’s investments.

Britain’s mandate started this year at 2 per cent of total UK jet fuel demand, rising linearly to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040. So, even by then, 78 per cent of all flights will still be fuelled by kerosene. Other countries have similar mandates but, as the airline lobby group IATA said in June, SAF production will reach only 2 million tonnes this year — enough for “just 0.7 per cent of aviation’s total fuel needs”. As its boss Willie Walsh pointed out, “even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill”.

There are other issues. Scaling up the industry will need new feedstocks, such as non-food crops, which compete with road biodiesel, or other oils, such as palm, which lead to deforestation. In May last year the Institute for Policy think tank cast doubt on whether SAF even combatted climate change in a report titled: “Greenwashing the skies.” That is open to debate. Even so, with the likes of Shell cutting back on SAF, Reeves’s game-changer may take a while to land.

Raising dough

Some toppings would even fox Domino’s Pizza. Take the one demanded by its 5 per cent investor Browning West: an outfit that does seem to be struggling to make up its mind.

• Domino’s Pizza urged to return £100m to shareholders

Atop the tomato goo and mozzarella, it wants a blowout share buyback: £100 million, up from the £20 million the company’s presently serving up. It also wants a message spelt out in ham and pineapple that, with the shares at a “ten-year low” and earnings declining for the past five quarters, the chairman Ian Bull and chief executive Andrew Rennie will delay their distracting hunt for a “second brand” — pausing “any contemplated acquisitions for six months”. Still, here’s Browning’s pepperoni twist: if the board is hell-bent on a “multi-brand strategy”, it should “take the company private by actively identifying a credible private equity partner”.

What sort of pizza is that? A “Ham & Pineapple” crossed with an “Absolute Banger”? As Browning’s managing partner Usman Nabi, a Domino’s non-exec between 2019 and 2023, points out in his letter to the board, since 2014 the company’s “PE multiple has collapsed from 20 times to 11 times”. Given that and the bombed-out shares, why would Domino’s put itself up for sale now? Any bid would be light on dough.

Sure, by going public, Browning may start a debate over the best use of Domino’s capital and perhaps get backing from other big investors: the likes of Capital Group, with 14.4 per cent, and Abrams Capital, with 9.6 per cent. And the board needs to serve up something tastier, even if it has grown UK market share in a tough pizza takeaway market to 53.7 per cent. Yet the shares rose by less than 1 per cent to 207¼p, implying that Browning’s recipe is no sure-fire winner with investors. In fact, for now, it looks a bit half-baked.

The tale of an Indian petroleum behemoth embracing the appeal of renewable energy begs two questions – why Reliance and why now?
Legacy The renewable energy embrace however, is unlikely to signal a pivot for the conglomerate.
India’s renewable energy roll-out has picked up pace in recent years.
Year-on-year capacity additions are driven by investors such as KLP backing New Delhi’s renewable energy vision.","Four years ago, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani allocated $10bn for a ‘New Energy’ business. It was a notable change of tide, given the Indian conglomerate’s large-scale petroleum refining operation that Ambani spearheaded back in the 1990s.

That same year, RIL began work on a new integrated renewable energy manufacturing hub named after the group’s founder: the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex.

At the 2025 AGM, Anant Ambani – the chairman’s son - gave shareholders a glimpse into its scale. A build area four times the size Tesla’s gigafactory, a steel order large enough to build 100 Eifel Towers and a stretch of cables enough to ‘reach the moon and back’.

The tale of an Indian petroleum behemoth embracing the appeal of renewable energy begs two questions – why Reliance and why now?

New energy, old spirits

The gigafactory’s location adds to its symbolism. It is based in Jamnagar – the home of RIL’s largest refining complex. “Jamnagar is the face of New Reliance and New India”, said Anant Ambani in his address to shareholders.

“Products from the giga factories would be deployed for delivering round-the-clock renewable power and producing green chemicals, including green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel”, Ambani explained.

Alongside the gigafactory, Reliance has also expanded into other opportunities.

“In Kutch, Gujarat, we are developing one of the world's largest single-site solar projects spanning 5,50,000 acres of arid land – three times the size of Singapore”, Ambani noted.

Ambani also mentioned other simultaneous forays into the energy transition opportunity - solar PV, battery storage, green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel are all part of the plan.

Legacy

The renewable energy embrace however, is unlikely to signal a pivot for the conglomerate. In what was his first ever address at a Reliance AGM, Anant Ambani was quick to point out that legacy businesses have been doing well too.

The exploration business, where nearly a third of India’s natural gas supply comes from, earned a before tax income of $2.5bn. Production from the KG-D6 gas well was up 4% and new drilling is expected in 2026. Reliance is therefore seemingly convinced that the investment case for renewables does not necessarily erode the appeal of its legacy.

Investor interest

Reliance now joins a group of investors who, despite India’s fossil fuel dependence, are optimistic over the long-term. That group includes Norway’s largest pension provider, KLP.

In December last year, the fund announced a NOK 1.1bn ($100m) investment in an Indian grid company, in partnership with Norfund. The two entities acquired a 49% stake in an Indian solar farm two years prior.

“KLP's interest in investing in renewable energy in India is primarily related to the sector's financial attractiveness and the KLP group's strategy for sustainable and responsible investment”, says Eric Nasby, an investment analyst at KLP.

“We have invested in solar and wind power projects in India, in addition to electricity transmission networks. We continue to see opportunities in hybrid parks that often can combine solar and wind power with battery storage, as well as transmission”, Nasby told Net Zero Investor.

KLP’s investment thesis takes into account India’s current energy mix. 50.5% of the country’s installed power capacity still comes from fossil fuels.

“As we all know, India is one of the world's fastest growing markets and still very dependent on coal-fired power generation”, notes Nasby.

“As a result of this, investments in India have significant climate benefits. India also has a large well-functioning market for these investments and as a result it has become an important part of our investment portfolio”, he adds.

India’s renewable energy roll-out has picked up pace in recent years. As of June 2025, renewable energy installed capacity stood at 226.9 GW. The roll-out has been largely led by solar which accounts for 47% of non-fossil fuel power capacity.

Year-on-year capacity additions are driven by investors such as KLP backing New Delhi’s renewable energy vision. With Reliance joining their ranks, confidence and competition is now on the rise.

With clear-eyed leadership in Washington, D.C., the Trump Administration is now also mobilizing America’s agricultural abundance in pursuit of American energy dominance.

The multi-generational boom in American agricultural production is an often-overlooked success story. In 1925, American farmers produced 27.4 bushels of corn per acre, totaling 2.3 billion bushels across the country. This year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicts that national production of corn will set two new records of 188.8 bushels per acre and 16.7 billion bushels in total. A new record will also be set for soybeans, for which USDA predicts an historic yield of 53.6 bushels per acre. The grit and innovation of American farmers have unlocked these historically unparalleled harvests.

The dramatic increase in crop yields has helped to fuel food security at home and the production of biofuels across the country. Ethanol is now produced in 21 states and the United States has been a net-exporter of the fuel since 2010. Other biofuels—such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel—are produced in 22 plants across 13 states.

On the global stage, our Nation’s surging agricultural productivity presents unique opportunities for American leadership. In sharp contrast with America’s copious production of fossil and biofuels, countless countries around the world remain blighted by a lack of energy resources. For example, some 65% of the population in India suffers from one form or another of energy poverty. The American agricultural abundance means that these challenges can be ameliorated by trade and new export opportunities. By exporting the fruits of American agricultural innovation, farmers in the heartland can help bolster global access to desperately needed energy.

To make this possible, America First leadership in the Federal government is now tackling an often-unbalanced global trading playing field that unfairly constrains American energy. In June, the Trump Administration struck an initial trade accord with the United Kingdom, within which British tariffs on American ethanol were effectively abolished in exchange for removing tariffs on British aircraft parts. The deal gives American farmers tariff-free access to a market worth around $700 million each year.

But much work remains to be done. As the United States Trade Representative highlighted earlier this year, India maintains a ban on American fuel ethanol imports. Thailand similarly has restricted American ethanol imports since 2005. And Brazil—the world’s second largest producer of ethanol—maintains an 18% tariff on American ethanol. Breaking down these barriers and striking reciprocal trade deals that provide bilateral market access will benefit both American farmers and consumers around the world.

Ongoing trade discussions with the European Union also provide an opportunity to further American energy exports. In July, the Trump Administration struck an initial trade deal that commits the European Union to purchasing $750 billion worth of American energy exports over three years. To meet this enormous opportunity, and for Europe to uphold its end of the bargain, greater American biofuel exports will likely be necessary. European rules that unfairly limit American biofuel exports—such as the exclusion of crop-based feedstocks from the EU’s sustainable aviation fuel scheme—should be a topic of discussion as negotiations continue.

As President Trump declared on the first day of his second term, “America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation’s economic prosperity.” Unleashed by America First policies, exporting abundant American biofuels worldwide will also help to propel American energy dominance.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/696210_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-09-04 11:56:22.773986

Shell abandons Rotterdam biofuels plant plan: Update

Shell abandons Rotterdam biofuels plant plan: Update

Updates with SAF, HVO pricing and fundamentals, adds quote from Shell London, 3 September (Argus) — Shell has abandoned a plan to build an 820,000 t/yr biofuels facility in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, saying it could not be competitive. Shell temporarily halted construction at the facility in July 2024. The plant was planned to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) — also known as renewable diesel — from waste feedstocks. It would have been the third largest HVO and SAF refinery in Europe, behind Preem and Neste's plants in the Sweden and the Netherlands, respectively. ""Following an in-depth commercial and technical evaluation to reassess the project's competitiveness, Shell will no longer proceed with the project,"" it said today. It already took an up to $1bn write down on the Rotterdam project. Shell has been streamlining its renewables production portfolio, and said most of its renewables activities were loss-making in the second quarter of 2025. Prices for SAF in 2025 had generally held below recent years and Argus Consulting expects a structural surplus of SAF supply globally until mandates rise in the 2030s. More plants are scheduled to come online globally, but the EU plans to keep mandates steady at 2pc until the end of this decade, and fresh SAF mandates from other countries are not expected to soak up the surplus. Spot prices in northwest Europe for HEFA-SPK — currently the primary commercial pathway for physical SAF — averaged around $1,939/t fob during January-September so far, compared with roughly $2,316/t during the same period last year. The HVO Class II fob ARA price averaged around $1,954/t and $1,626/t during the same periods. HVO and SAF can be made from used cooking oil via hydrotreatment, but HVO requires fewer processing steps, making it usually the cheaper grade. But recently, HVO had fetched higher prices, supported by firm demand. An increase in spot demand for HVO has been supported by changes to renewable fuel ticket carryover rules. Tickets are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet mandates for the use of renewable energy in transport. The Netherlands cut its allowance from 25pc to 10pc for 2025 compliance, and Germany froze its carry-over, reducing flexibility for obligated blenders and prompting more near-term buying. Protectionist trade tariffs have also been reshaping HVO trade. The EU imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese biodiesel and HVO in February in addition to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties in place for HVO and biodiesel of US and Canadian origin. US-origin HVO flows to the UK were unaffected, but London began an anti-dumping investigation into US HVO in March, which could raise demand for European product instead.

The project, initiated in 2022 at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park, was intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel from waste. It will not advance following a reassessment of its commercial and technical viability.

The decision comes as Shell aims to solidify its role as a major player in the global energy transition.

In 2024, Shell Nederland Raffinaderij temporarily halted the construction of the facility due to current market conditions impacting project delivery and competitiveness.

Shell had taken a final investment decision on the Rotterdam biofuels plant in September 2021. The plant was designed to produce 820,000 tonnes a year of SAF and renewable diesel.

Shell downstream, renewables and energy solutions president Machteld de Haan said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders”

“We continue to believe that low carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system. Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including SAF.”

The company also confirmed that the Netherlands continues to be a crucial location for its diverse energy operations, which include upstream oil and gas production and a network of retail sites.

Shell said that it has invested €6.5bn in various energy transition projects within the country. These include CO2 storage initiatives like the Porthos CCS project and the development of renewable hydrogen at Holland Hydrogen 1.

The company had earmarked an expenditure of $8bn on lower carbon alternatives between 2023 and 2024. These investments covered areas such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and low-carbon fuels.

In 2024, Shell emerged as a major player in the sustainable aviation fuel market, particularly in North America and Europe where it is said to have contributed nearly 20% of total sales.

The Avelia platform, developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express GBT, is another key initiative by Shell to bolster the supply and demand for SAF. By March 2025, more than 57 corporations and airlines had engaged in transactions via Avelia, resulting in over 33 million gallons of SAF being integrated into existing fuel networks.

In addition to these initiatives, Shell’s joint venture in Brazil with Raizen focuses on delivering low-carbon bioethanol. In 2022, Shell expanded its capabilities by acquiring EcoOils, a waste recycling company that produces advanced biofuels feedstock in Malaysia and Indonesia.

EcoOils utilises advanced recycling technology to process waste into valuable feedstocks like Spent Bleaching Earth Oil (SBEO) and Refined Palm Oil Mill Effluent (R-POME).",https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Shell.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 13:56:40.918815

“Today marks the start of an exciting few months for Clean Planet Technologies,” added Dr Odjo.","Dr Andrew Odjo, CEO of Clean Planet Technologies (CPTech), and CTO of Clean Planet Energy, part of the Clean Planet Group, today unveiled the UK’s first Plastics-to-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (P2SAF) technology during a keynote speech at the prestigious SAF Global Summit 2025 in London.

Addressing more than 500 policymakers, energy leaders, airlines, and investors, Dr Andrew Odjo, introduced the company’s proprietary SAFe-P2SAF system – a breakthrough process designed to transform hard-to-recycle waste plastics into ultra-clean, low-carbon jet fuel that could meet the stringent aviation standards.

The technology, now progressing towards ASTM certification, converts mixed waste plastics into a direct drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that can be seamlessly blended with conventional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft and fuel infrastructure. With a potential 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil jet fuels and the ability to divert thousands of tonnes of plastic from landfill and incineration, SAFe-P2SAF represents a major step towards decarbonising one of the most challenging sectors in the race to Net Zero 2050 and building the bridge towards clean air.

“Our mission is simple: tackle two global challenges at once – plastic pollution and aviation emissions,” said Dr Odjo. “With SAFe-P2SAF, we’re turning a waste problem into a climate solution, supporting the UK’s ambitions for SAF production and helping diversify feedstock beyond traditional pathways like HEFA, which face growing supply pressures.”

CPTech’s innovation comes at a pivotal time for the industry. With REFUEL EU Aviation’s 2% SAF blend target launching in 2025, the UK’s pioneering SAF mandate, and increasing investor interest in circular feedstocks, the race is on to scale production and secure supply chains for sustainable aviation fuels.

The SAFe-P2SAF technology builds on Clean Planet Technologies’ flagship SAFe Hydroprocessing system, already proven at commercial scale for upgrading pyrolysis oils into low-carbon fuels. By adapting this platform to process plastic-derived feedstocks into ultra-clean SAF, CPTech aims to place the UK at the forefront of feedstock diversity and innovation for sustainable aviation.

The company’s upcoming roadmap includes progressing ASTM certification, developing its first pilot-scale P2SAF facility in the UK later in 2025, and expanding partnerships with key industry stakeholders to accelerate deployment attractive to investors.

“Today marks the start of an exciting few months for Clean Planet Technologies,” added Dr Odjo. “With a new facility announcement coming at the end of this year, our focus remains on scaling solutions that deliver real environmental impact while supporting the UK’s leadership in sustainable aviation.”

“The future of flying must be both more sustainable and affordable,” said Eurowings CEO Jens Bischof. “The SAF real-world laboratory at our largest site in Düsseldorf demonstrates in concrete terms how electricity-based SAF can be made technologically feasible. However, commercial viability is just as crucial. In order to get the market ramp-up underway, policymakers should develop measures that promote investment in PtL production facilities and, through this, help close the price gap between PtL-SAF and fossil kerosene.”

“Eurowings‘ declaration of intent to purchase SAF produced at our airport is an important and strong signal,” commented Lars Redeligx, CEO of Düsseldorf Airport. “The provision of sustainable fuels is of central importance for the sustainable transformation of our industry. In order for electricity-based SAF to be offered at a lower price in the future, production ramp-up must be strengthened and improvements in the manufacturing process achieved through innovative approaches. That is why we are very pleased to be working with Euref Campus and Eurowings to advance the project of the Essen-based start-up and thus move one step closer to the SAF real-world laboratory at our airport.”

“We are proud to have found two pioneering partners in North Rhine-Westphalia in Eurowings and the airport, who believe in the potential of our technology for climate-neutral flying,” added Florian Hildebrand, CEO and co-founder of Greenlyte. “With this project, we are taking the next big step: we want to show that eSAF can be produced cost-effectively and scalably – and that this is precisely how our technology will become a catalyst for transforming aviation. The project fits seamlessly into our project portfolio and underlines that defossilisation cannot be achieved through innovation alone, but through bold partnerships.”

The first delivery into the Portland International Airport fuel system is not just about fueling airplanes but also represents a crucial step in unlocking the potential of SAF to significantly reduce lifecycle carbon emissions in aviation. SAF has the ability to reduce emissions by over 80% when compared to traditional jet fuel, making it a vital tool in the fight against climate change.

The Role of Industry Collaboration in Expanding SAF Availability

According to Charlotte Lollar, Delta’s SAF Director, this achievement demonstrates the power of industry collaboration. By working with Shell and the Port of Portland, Delta is able to utilize existing infrastructure to scale SAF access at more airports, proving the fuel’s viability and laying the foundation for future expansion. Delta’s ongoing efforts to integrate SAF into its operations are part of a larger strategy to improve sustainability across the aviation sector.

This collaboration is a prime example of how airlines, fuel suppliers, and airport authorities can work together to drive change in the industry. The Port of Portland’s Chief Aviation Officer, Dan Pippenger, highlighted that this initiative is crucial for improving local air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, benefiting both the airport’s operations and the surrounding community. With this move, PDX is positioning itself as a leader in the development and adoption of sustainable aviation practices.

Expanding Delta’s Commitment to Sustainability

While the delivery of SAF to Portland is a landmark event for Delta Air Lines, the airline is not stopping there. Delta has previously secured SAF deliveries to other major hubs such as Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) and Detroit (DTW), underscoring its commitment to expanding SAF usage across its network. This move is part of a larger industry-wide push for greener aviation and reflects the airline’s broader sustainability goals.

Delta’s expansion of SAF initiatives is directly aligned with efforts to advocate for government incentives to support SAF production and availability. At the federal level, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon has championed significant policy advancements, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. These tax credits are expected to increase SAF production and lower its costs, making it more accessible for airlines. Delta’s active participation in pushing for these incentives ensures that SAF will play a central role in the airline’s future growth and environmental strategy.

Enhancing Local Operations in Oregon

Delta’s commitment to the Oregon region extends beyond sustainability. The airline continues to operate a robust service network at Portland International Airport (PDX), offering direct flights to nearly all of Delta’s hub airports across the United States. With this SAF delivery, the airline not only strengthens its environmental commitment but also enhances its operational footprint in Oregon, providing residents with access to over 300 one-stop destinations.

Delta’s workforce in the Pacific Northwest comprises nearly 4,500 employees, and the airline remains committed to its community engagement efforts. The introduction of SAF to Portland reflects both an environmental and operational commitment, ensuring that Delta’s actions align with the region’s broader sustainability goals.

The Challenges of Scaling SAF

Despite the promise of SAF, scaling its production to meet the aviation industry’s needs remains a challenge. SAF technology is still in its early stages, and the current production capacity is insufficient to fuel the world’s airlines for even a single week. Delta’s collaboration with Shell, the Port of Portland, and other stakeholders aims to build the necessary infrastructure and expand SAF production. These efforts are essential for overcoming the barriers that currently limit SAF’s widespread use.

The costs of SAF remain high, primarily due to the nascent stage of its production, which makes it a relatively expensive alternative to traditional jet fuel. However, as production scales and the technology improves, SAF is expected to become more cost-competitive and widely accessible.

Looking Toward the Future of Aviation

The delivery of SAF at Portland International Airport marks a significant step in Delta’s broader commitment to environmental sustainability. By leveraging existing infrastructure, collaborating with key industry players, and advocating for supportive policy frameworks, Delta is setting the stage for the future of sustainable aviation. The successful integration of SAF into Delta’s operations demonstrates that aviation can move towards more sustainable and eco-friendly fuel alternatives, aligning with global environmental goals.

As Delta continues to expand its SAF footprint and work towards making it a mainstream aviation fuel, the industry’s push for greener alternatives will become increasingly important. The airline’s ongoing efforts serve as an example of how the aviation industry can play an active role in mitigating climate change while maintaining operational excellence.

Conclusion: A Step Toward a Greener Aviation Future

Delta’s recent SAF delivery at Portland International Airport is a key milestone in the airline’s commitment to sustainability and a greener aviation future. This achievement underscores the importance of industry collaboration, government incentives, and technological advancements in driving the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuels. As Delta continues to scale its SAF efforts, the airline is helping to pave the way for a more environmentally responsible and sustainable aviation industry.

Over the past three months, four students from Stanford University in California, USA, have been using their knowledge to create environmental change at Vector, Auckland Council and Auckland Football Club.

Professor Jacqueline Beggs, director of the University of Auckland’s Centre for Climate, Biodiversity and Society, Ngā Ara Whetū, helped organise the internships.

Ngā Ara Whetū supported the students in learning about environmental issues in New Zealand and te ao Māori.

“This has been a remarkable collaboration.

“It has given the students an invaluable insight into Aotearoa’s sustainability challenges,” says Beggs.

Stanford student Kaitlyn Sanchez worked with Auckland Council as a climate intern, using global models to inform the city’s climate change plan.

Sanchez recommended Auckland embed sustainability into all its economic initiatives, rather than treating them as separate issues.

“The economy and environment are intrinsically linked. Doing this research made me realise just how much the two overlap,” she says.

Samuel Desai and Sarah Oyegoke have just finished internships at Vector.

Desai looked at global electricity markets to find models that might help Vector encourage customers to use more electricity during non-peak times.

Oyegoke’s research aimed to help Vector prepare for the introduction of time of use power pricing, following a government move to require power retailers to offer time of use pricing by June 2026.

She surveyed more than 2850 people, discovering that about 24 percent of energy use is currently shifted to more affordable, off-peak times.

“I recommend time of use plans, because they can be beneficial for customers,” Oyegoke says.

As an intern at Auckland FC, Reilly McKnight focused on making training sessions and match days more sustainable.

Transport made up a huge part of the club’s greenhouse gas emissions, so he suggested supporting sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsetting.

McKnight helped bring public transport into the cost of match tickets, allowing the club to significantly reduce the number of fans travelling to matches in private vehicles.

As many as 82 percent of fans used private vehicles when there were no trains, but 43 percent used trains when they were offered within the ticket price, he says.

Installing water coolers has helped reduce the use of plastic water bottles, while reusable metal cups could replace single-use plastic for fans buying drinks in the future, McKnight says.

Solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations are also being introduced at some Auckland stadiums to increase sustainability.

The paid internships in Auckland were spearheaded by Stanford Dean Arun Majumdar and prominent US-based New Zealanders Tim Brown, a former professional footballer and co-founder of sustainable footwear company Allbirds, and Anthony Mosse, investment director for New Zealand Trade and Enterprise in North America.

Beggs hopes this year’s internship programme is the first of many to come.

The initiative would involve the creation of a multinational company in collaboration with Central American and Caribbean countries.

During the Siemens Energy Forum held in Mexico City, José Samaniego, Deputy Minister of Sustainable Development and Circular Economy, SEMARNAT, announced that authorities are evaluating a plan to use sargassum as a feedstock for aviation biofuel. He highlighted the possibility of creating a multinational company with Central American and Caribbean countries dedicated to producing biofuel derived from the algae. “This would help us address a common problem and benefit all of us if we enter the international aviation market,” Samaniego said.

The rapid growth of sargassum along the Caribbean beaches has created significant social and political pressure. Alicia Bárcena, Minister, SEMARNAT, emphasized that sargassum blooms across the Caribbean exceed 5Mt, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts between regional and national authorities to address the problem effectively. Leticia Durand, Researcher, UNAM’s Regional Center for Multidisciplinary Research, reported that the cost of removing sargassum can exceed US$1 million per kilometer of beach per year, making long-term solutions critical.

If the proposed project moves forward, it would give sargassum a productive use while potentially lowering costs for airlines. Currently, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is approximately 3.5 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, posing a significant financial challenge for widespread adoption.

Recently, the state-owned company Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA) announced an investment of MX$300 million (US$16 million) to expand a mixing plant in Cancun. This facility produces biofuel from used cooking oil and is considered a first step toward integrating other raw materials, such as sargassum, into production.

Samaniego also noted that such a project would help airlines comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandate to decarbonize flights starting in 2027, established under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

CORSIA is a global plan designed to stabilize the growth of CO₂ emissions from international aviation by requiring airlines to purchase carbon credits for each ton emitted above 85% of 2019 levels. According to ICAO, buying credits is intended to be a last-resort measure, after airlines have implemented other emissions-reduction strategies. These strategies include making aircraft and engines more efficient and lighter, optimizing take-off and landing procedures, and adopting electric engines for short-haul flights.

The program is being rolled out in phases before becoming mandatory for all international flights in 2027. During the pilot phase (2021–2023) and the first phase (2024–2026), offsetting applies only to flights between countries that volunteer to participate.

The project was under development by Shell Nederland Raffinaderij B.V., a subsidiary of Shell plc. As originally planned, the facility would have the capacity to produce 820,000 metric tons per year of SAF and renewable diesel.

Shell announced in September 2021 a final investment decision on the project and construction began the following year. At that time, the biorefinery was expected to begin operations in 2024. In July 2024, Shell announced it was pausing on-site construction “to address project delivery and ensure future competitiveness given current market conditions.”

Following an in-depth commercial and technical evaluation to reassess the project’s competitiveness, Shell on Sept.3 announced it will no longer proceed with the project.

“As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products,” said Machteld de Haan, downstream, renewables and energy solutions president at Shell. “This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritize our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders”

“We continue to believe that low carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system,” De Haan added. “Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world's largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).”

A full copy of Shell’s announcement is available on the company’s website.

Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with Shell and Portland International Airport (PDX), has taken delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into the PDX fuel system, marking the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at PDX. This achievement not only expands Delta’s SAF footprint but positions PDX – owned and operated by the Port of Portland – to capitalize on the continued growth of SAF across the U.S.

The batch of more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF was made in the U.S. from waste-derived feedstock. Shell supplied the neat SAF shipment to Zenith Terminal in Portland where it was blended with traditional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements, then delivered to PDX via barge, truck and pipeline. Earlier this month, the blended SAF entered the airport’s privately owned fuel supply system.

“Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel,” said Charlotte Lollar, Delta’s SAF director. “By working with Shell and the Port of Portland to tap into existing infrastructure, we’re able to access SAF at more airports and continue to prove its viability and ultimately scale it in a way the industry needs.”

“We're excited about this step toward bringing Sustainable Aviation Fuel to PDX. It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities,” said Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger. “We're looking forward to working with our partners to make sure state and local policies support development of the infrastructure and market needed to bring SAF here on a larger scale – and unlock all of the health and environmental benefits it offers.”

Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland. Delta is also working at the federal level and across key states to advocate for continued and new government incentives that will increase production, improve cost-competitiveness and make SAF more accessible at scale. In 2022, Oregon U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, then Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, championed enactment of the first federal SAF incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and creating the current fuel-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. 40B and 45Z provided the initial policy frameworks for state level incentives emerging across the country and 45Z was extended by the U.S. Congress this year through 2029.

The bill, which would legalize E15 immediately upon the governor’s signature, now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for final approval. California is the only state in the nation that does not currently allow the sale of E15.

“With today’s passage of AB30, California is taking a big step toward lower gas prices and a cleaner, more sustainable future for families across the state,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. “Many other states have already seen the benefits of E15—healthier air, better engine performance, and cost savings at the pump. Now, California drivers are on the cusp of experiencing those same advantages, and we urge Gov. Newsom to sign the bill into law as quickly as possible. E15 will provide relief at the pump for Californians who continue to face the highest gas prices in the country.”

Cooper continued, “We applaud the California legislature for swiftly passing this critical bill, and we especially thank the bipartisan California Problem Solvers Caucus for bringing awareness and attention to this issue. AB30’s sponsors, Assemblymembers David Alvarez and Heath Flora, also deserve special recognition for their leadership in opening the California marketplace to more affordable, cleaner fuel options.”

“California’s regulatory agencies have reviewed the E15 gasoline blend for nearly eight years and have yet to issue any rulings,” said Assemblymember Alvarez. “This unnecessary holdup has prevented California’s drivers from accessing a cleaner, more affordable fuel option that’s already approved across the country. AB 30 sends a clear message: Californians cannot afford to wait while bureaucracy stalls progress. This bill delivers economic benefits to Californians struggling with high fuel prices, and I am especially grateful to the Problem Solvers Caucus for their partnership on this commonsense solution.”

Recent studies show E15 could save California drivers $2.7 billion annually, or $200 per household, and significantly cut the emissions of tailpipe pollutants that create smog and contribute to illness and disease.

Gov. Newsom has expressed his support for legalizing E15, saying last year that “there is massive potential for this [E15] to be a win-win for Californians: lowering gas prices by up to twenty cents per gallon while keeping our air clean.”

RFA has been leading the effort to secure E15 approval in California for the past seven years, Cooper noted, beginning with the 2018 initiation of a “multimedia evaluation” of E15 in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and other ethanol industry stakeholders. While California’s recently finalized 2025-2026 state budget includes funding for CARB to complete the E15 approval process, AB30 allows the fuel to be sold while CARB’s work progresses.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/1438/1000/Calif+roads.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 18:56:58.736621

SAF is an alternative jet fuel made from renewable sources that can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by more than 80%, when compared to conventional jet fuel' + drupalSettings.data.extlink.extLabel + '. Existing jet fuel infrastructure can be leveraged to deliver SAF to airports today, and it is safe to use in current aircraft engines. However, the technology to produce it remains nascent, so it is expensive and not widely available. In fact, there is not enough SAF in production today to fuel the world's airlines for a single week. This is why the work to scale SAF and bring it to new markets, like Portland, is so important.

Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland.

Welcoming stakeholders to this landmark event, the Minister underscored SAF’s critical role in advancing India’s sustainable aviation growth. He reaffirmed India’s readiness to become self-sufficient in SAF production, targeting 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in line with the CORSIA mandate.

The Minister stated, “SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonize the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional fuel”.

He further highlighted that with over 750 million metric tons of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tons of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter.

Shri Ram Mohan Naidu pointed to important milestones already achieved, including the designation of COTECNA Inspection India Pvt. Ltd. as the country’s first SAF certification body and the certification of Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery as India’s first SAF producer.

The Minister emphasized that SAF production will not only reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tons annually, but also boost farmers’ incomes by creating a strong value chain for agricultural residue and biomass.

“Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India is on track to become the world’s largest domestic aviation market. With a collaborative approach, we are committed to positioning India as a leader in green aviation”, Minister Shri Ram Mohan Naidu added.

The Secretary underlined that global warming is a collective challenge and mitigating its impact is a shared responsibility. He reiterated India’s commitment to the UNFCCC framework and emphasized that India already operates one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient aircraft fleets in the world. He also noted that 88 airports have already transitioned to 100% green energy usage, setting benchmarks for global best practices.

Faced with weak market conditions, the company last year suspended construction of the renewables biofuel factory in Rotterdam that was intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and diesel from waste.

“As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive,” Machteld de Haan, Shell’s downstream, renewables and energy solutions president, said in a statement.

The project was first announced in 2021 as part of plans to help Europe meet internationally binding emissions reduction targets.

Shell and rival UK energy giant BP have been walking back various climate objectives and focusing more on oil and gas to raise their profits, which has drawn criticism from environmental activists.

More than half of the facility’s capacity was intended to produce SAF — a biofuel made from plant and animal materials like cooking oil and fat which produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel.

Under plans to tackle climate change, the EU requires airlines to gradually increase the amount of SAF they use to power planes.

Airlines, however, complain that SAF is not widely available and too expensive.

Shell won't restart construction of a Rotterdam biofuels facility, as the global market for the fuel faces a yearslong slump.

The British energy giant said Wednesday that it conducted a commercial and technical evaluation and deemed the project no longer competitive.

""It became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers' need for affordable, low-carbon products,"" Machteld de Haan, president of Shell's downstream, renewables and energy division, said.

Shell took a $780 million impairment when it temporarily paused on-site construction work at the energy and chemicals park--expected to become one of the largest in Europe--in July 2024. It started the project in 2022 and green-lit it a year prior.

Before construction was halted, the Rotterdam biofuels facility was expected to produce 820,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste.

The move comes after Shell rival BP halted two biofuel projects and scaled back plans on others last year, amid rising competition from new imports, particularly from China. Sweden and Finland's decisions to reduce the minimum threshold for renewable-fuel concentration in fuel or heating oil also contributed to the glut of biofuels.

Key Risks for Investors in Aviation Fuels

The guide — Just transition, environment & social considerations for the aviation fuel transition: An investor guide — identifies three often-overlooked categories of risk in SAF production and procurement:

Environmental: Biofuel feedstocks may cause biodiversity loss, land-use change emissions, or breach environmental rules, leading to regulatory penalties.

Just Transition: Poor worker reskilling, lack of local economic planning, or weak community engagement could destabilise jobs and damage reputations.

Social: Misuse of resources like food, water or energy could exacerbate insecurity, undermining community wellbeing and long-term investment stability.

Relevant: 4AIR Celebrates Monumental Milestone: 100+ Worldwide Locations Now Have Sustainable Aviation Fuel Available for Business Aviation Aircraft

To mitigate these risks, the guide provides a framework of questions investors can use to engage with portfolio companies, including requirements for transparent lifecycle emissions accounting, holistic risk assessments, and greater accountability in SAF projects.

Yet, despite its promise, SAF currently accounts for less than 1 percent of global jet fuel demand, with steep cost premiums and production challenges limiting widespread adoption.

Overcoming production barriers

The most significant obstacles to large-scale SAF production stem from both supply constraints and economic factors. “SAF currently makes up less than 1 percent of global jet fuel demand,” Roland Berger, the global management consultancy firm, explained, underscoring how early the market still is. The cost disparity remains stark, with SAF priced four to five times higher than conventional jet fuel, deterring broad uptake.

The predominant SAF pathway today, Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), is relatively cost-effective but faces scalability limits due to finite sustainable feedstocks. “HEFA is the most cost effective today, but faces scalability challenges because of limited availability of sustainable feedstocks,” the company continued. Emerging technologies like Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and other advanced pathways show promise for greater scalability but are burdened with high production and technology costs, slowing commercialisation.

The inconsistent global policy environment compounds these challenges. While regions such as Europe have strong mandates like ReFuelEU driving SAF uptake, others, notably the U.S., lack federal mandates, creating a fragmented market landscape.

Airlines have a critical role in breaking through these barriers. “Partnering with suppliers and exploring appropriate contracting frameworks is essential,” the source explained. Airlines can adjust contract structures to longer timeframes — 10 years or more — which helps de-risk long-term capital projects for producers. Fixed-price contracts, rather than pricing tied to fluctuating Jet-A fuel costs plus premiums, provide revenue certainty, encouraging more investment.

Strategic co-investment also plays a vital role. “By investing into production, airlines can secure offtake volumes and reduce capital costs,” the consultancy outlined. Additionally, airlines can facilitate collaboration among infrastructure and debt investors, alongside regulators, to accelerate technology readiness and bring down costs for advanced SAF pathways.

Financing SAF

To lower SAF costs, the aviation industry must develop a full value chain approach — from feedstock sourcing through production to offtake agreements. “The key to lowering SAF costs is to build and invest across the full supply chain and pair this with long-term fixed price contracts,” the organisation laid out . This model attracts infrastructure-style investors who can provide capital at lower costs, essential to scaling the industry.

Increasing certainty across the supply chain reduces overall production costs. “Ideally, these arrangements should be shareable to clearly showcase the strength of the demand signal.”

Investment returns vary by project stage. Airlines can invest in early-stage projects, targeting levered internal rates of return (IRRs) similar to other growth equity investments. Projects nearing final investment decisions, where construction and offtake are more secure, typically target lower returns similar to other infrastructure investments to reflect the lower risk. Fully operating assets with contracted offtake represent the lowest risk and thus lower IRR thresholds. Airlines can also invest in complementary infrastructure, such as blending and delivery systems, with variable returns.

Such involvement is not without risk, but it also offers airlines an opportunity to influence production scalability directly. “Increasing stability and certainty to offtake chains helps bring down costs,” the firm stated, highlighting the importance of equity stakes and long-term contracts.

Global strategies

With SAF pricing and policy support varying widely by geography, airlines must leverage their networks and procurement mechanisms like book-and-claim systems to optimise costs. “In Europe, ReFuelEU mandates blending, which leads to higher SAF prices, whereas US incentives reduce local production costs, resulting in lower price premiums,” Roland Berger expressed.

European airlines face geographic constraints under regional mandates, limiting book-and-claim use to some extent. Yet, book-and-claim systems are effective for exceeding mandatory blending targets through voluntary commitments, enabling airlines to leverage corporate willingness to pay for emissions abatement. Airlines can also source SAF from regions with cost advantages and apply those credits toward compliance with global frameworks like CORSIA.

Innovative procurement strategies are proving vital in securing supply and lowering risk. Early in the SAF market, consortia such as SAFUG helped airlines commit volumes and align sustainability standards. “Initiatives like SABA have pushed market education and voluntary SAF adoption by connecting corporate customers with SAF certificate providers,” the organisation said. These platforms have promoted book-and-claim systems that decouple environmental attributes from physical fuel delivery, helping close the cost gap for voluntary demand.

Contract structures also matter. Traditional short-term deals with floating prices are giving way to longer-term fixed-price contracts with risk-sharing mechanisms linked to incentives like those in the U.S. “Some contracts include price collars with floors and ceilings, easing project financing risks,” they noted. Equity deals represent the highest form of risk sharing, attracting more generalist investors and de-risking the sector.

Together, these innovations strengthen supply chains and offer airlines tools to manage price volatility. Hedging strategies, including contracts pegged to power prices for PtL or ethanol futures for alcohol-to-jet pathways, are gaining traction and expected to evolve as the market matures.

Scaling SAF

The path to scaling SAF sustainably without eroding airline profitability involves several integrated steps. Reducing production costs through technological innovation and economies of scale is fundamental. “This includes lowering electrolyser costs, expanding renewables, and improving bio-feedstock availability,” the firm said. Government subsidies and support also play a pivotal role, not only through mandates but also via fuel production incentives and funding for technology development.

Airlines, in turn, must secure scalable production by backing advanced technologies and accessing low-cost capital. They need to send strong demand signals with long-term contracts and equity stakes, monetise SAF through differentiated customer offerings, and leverage global policy frameworks to approach cost parity with conventional fuels. Risk management through structured contracts and financial tools is essential.

This multifaceted strategy ensures SAF moves from a niche sustainability solution toward becoming a mainstream, financially viable fuel — a vital step if aviation is to meet its net-zero commitments by mid-century.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Page-12-shutterstock_2438041735-copy-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 12:56:57.539682

The aviation industry is in the midst of an important transformation. With rising global awareness around climate change, airlines are seeking ways to balance growth in air travel with the urgent need to reduce emissions. Hawaiian Airlines has now taken a meaningful step by introducing sustainable aviation fuel on selected flights between Osaka and Honolulu.

This initiative is not only about meeting regulatory expectations but also about reshaping the way passengers view long-haul international travel. By embedding sustainability into their daily operations, airlines are signaling a future where flying responsibly becomes the new norm.

Hawaiian Airlines Introduces SAF on Osaka to Honolulu Flights

On August 29, 2025, Hawaiian Airlines announced the integration of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into its daily flights connecting Osaka-Kansai International Airport and Honolulu. The arrangement has been made possible through a partnership between its parent company, Alaska Air Group, and Cosmo Oil Marketing, a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings.

The first deliveries have already begun at Kansai International Airport, fueling Hawaiian’s Airbus A330 aircraft. For the airline, this marks a milestone moment, as it is the first time SAF has been included in its fuel operations. According to the airline, SAF can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared with conventional jet fuel.

Why Japan Matters in This Move

Japan has long been a critical international market for Hawaiian Airlines. The daily service between Honolulu and Osaka supports not only tourism but also cultural and business exchanges between Japan and Hawai‘i.

In comments accompanying the announcement, Alanna James, Sustainability Innovation Director at Hawaiian Airlines, expressed appreciation for Cosmo Oil’s commitment to developing locally sourced SAF. This local connection is vital, as it demonstrates how sustainability efforts can be woven into regional supply chains, reducing dependency on imported fuels and creating new economic opportunities.

Building a Sustainable Supply Chain in Japan

The SAF being supplied under this agreement has its origins in a Japanese government-backed program. In 2021, Cosmo Oil Marketing received support from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to create a supply chain model for SAF production. The chosen feedstock is used cooking oil, collected from households and businesses across Japan.

What makes this initiative remarkable is the circular economy element. By transforming everyday waste into aviation fuel, the program not only addresses carbon emissions but also promotes responsible resource use. It sends a strong message that sustainability is not just about new technologies but also about rethinking how existing materials are managed and repurposed.

Certified for a Cleaner Future

The SAF supplied to Hawaiian Airlines will carry ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU certifications, confirming compliance with international sustainability and carbon reduction standards. These certifications ensure transparency and accountability, making it clear that the fuel is not just greener in name but also in practice.

Cosmo Energy Group’s facility will become the first in Japan to mass-produce SAF, creating a blueprint for other countries to follow. Partnerships like these highlight the importance of both innovation and collaboration in meeting global climate goals.

Voices from the Collaboration

The partnership has been welcomed with optimism by both Hawaiian Airlines and Cosmo Oil Marketing.

Naoki Takayama, President of Cosmo Oil Marketing, noted that SAF is a key decarbonization tool for aviation. He emphasized the company’s commitment to helping build a decarbonized society, with this agreement serving as a starting point for broader adoption of SAF in Japan and beyond.

Hawaiian Airlines echoed this sentiment, reiterating its ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. This long-term commitment is supported by a multi-pronged strategy that includes SAF adoption, technological innovation, and modernizing its aircraft fleet.

The Broader Picture of Sustainable Aviation

This development is part of a larger movement in aviation. Airlines across the world are testing, investing, and scaling SAF as one of the most viable solutions to decarbonize flight operations. Unlike experimental fuels, SAF can already be used in existing aircraft with minimal modification, making it a practical option for rapid deployment.

By selecting a key route such as Osaka to Honolulu for its first SAF operations, Hawaiian Airlines is showing that sustainability can align with commercial viability. This route carries a mix of leisure travelers, business passengers, and cultural exchange visitors, many of whom are increasingly conscious about the environmental footprint of their journeys.

Toward a Net-Zero Ambition

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines, both with histories spanning more than 90 years, are using this initiative as an opportunity to reinforce their values. Their joint statement highlighted a shared mission of connecting communities while safeguarding the environment.

The commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 places both carriers ahead of many industry peers. It sets an example for how airlines can simultaneously focus on growth and responsibility, balancing commercial goals with environmental stewardship.

A Glimpse Into the Passenger Experience

While the technical aspects of SAF adoption are critical, there is also a human dimension. Travelers booking Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka to Honolulu flights can now feel assured that their journey is contributing to a greener planet. Although the shift may seem subtle today, it builds momentum for a future where environmentally responsible choices are seamlessly built into the travel experience.

The airline’s Airbus A330 aircraft on this route can carry 278 passengers. Every flight powered partly by SAF represents not just reduced emissions but also a step toward normalizing sustainability in aviation.

Conclusion

The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel on Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka to Honolulu flights is more than a technical upgrade. It is a statement of intent, a sign of collaboration across industries and nations, and a step toward reshaping air travel into a force for positive environmental change.

As the aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its impact, stories like this provide hope. They show that progress is possible when airlines, governments, and energy providers work together to unlock solutions. The journey toward net-zero aviation is far from complete, but initiatives such as this highlight the path forward.

India is currently the world’s third-largest aviation market, with passenger traffic set to double to 500 million by 2030. Naidu shared that India aims to become self-reliant in SAF production, having the target set for 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in line with the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) mandate. CORSIA is a market-based mechanism to achieve carbon-neutrality in aviation developed by ICAO.

“India is on track to become the world’s largest domestic aviation market. With a collaborative approach, we are committed to positioning India as a leader in green aviation,” Naidu added.

The feasibility study examines India’s potential for producing SAF, by assessing the availability of domestic feedstock, and feasible production pathways. The study also seeks to evaluate preparedness of infrastructure and policy.

The study was prepared by Ministry of Civil Aviation and International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO.) The study was commissioned by European Union as part of the ICAO’s Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) programme.

Under this series, the EU is conducting a total of 16 studies, of which India is a part of. The other countries where the study was conducted included Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote D’Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, and Ethiopia.

The India feasibility study started in November last year, and according to the ministry, the prepared report will be discussed at a two-day workshop at Udaan Bhawan, New Delhi, with participation key stakeholders including representatives from ICAO, EASA, DGCA, industry partners, and multiple government departments.

Naidu shared that the COTECNA Inspection India Pvt. Ltd. has been designated as India’s first SAF certification body. Additionally, Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery has been certified as the country’s first SAF producer.","https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india/2025-05-15/islgv8wx/Kinjarapu-Ram-Mohan-Naidu.jpeg?rect=0,46,1975,1037&w=1200&ar=40:21&auto=format,compress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100",N,,2025-09-03 08:56:47.560955

Shell is one of the world’s biggest oil and gas groups, with annual profits of almost $24 billion last year.

Under the former chief executive Ben van Beurden it set a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and set out plans for an array of green energy projects, including its 2021 decision to build the 820,000-tonnes-a-year biofuels plant in Rotterdam, which was originally scheduled to start production last year.

It said at the time that SAF could make up more than half of the plant’s output, with the rest being renewable diesel, made from used cooking oil, waste animal fat and other industrial and agricultural residual products. It also planned to use sustainable vegetable oils, given a shortage of suitable waste feedstocks.

Wael Sawan, who succeeded Van Beurden at the start of 2023, has rowed back on many of Shell’s green commitments that were struggling to make desired returns, such as ditching plans to build lots of wind farms.

De Haan said: “We continue to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system. Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel.”

Shell said that last year it “traded over 10 billion litres of low carbon fuels and sold ten times more than we produced”, becoming “one of the world’s leading suppliers of SAF” with almost a fifth of total sales in North America and Europe.

However, Sawan had already sounded the alarm over the economics of SAF. He said earlier this year that the take-up of SAF in the aviation industry was less than 0.1 per cent and its growth would depend on government action.

“The reality is that SAF is more expensive and therefore unless there are mandates — obligations on either customers or airlines — it is difficult to see a penetration that is going to be massive,” he said, warning that “airlines will not simply erode their bottom lines for the sake of it”.

Shell is taking action to be the investment case and partner of choice through the energy transition. Between 2023 and 2024, Shell has invested U.S.$8 billion in lower carbon options, including power, carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen and low-carbon fuels. In 2024, Shell traded over 10 billion litres of low carbon fuels and sold 10 times more than we produced. In the same year, Shell became one of the world’s leading suppliers of SAF.

The Netherlands remains a key location for Shell, where our businesses span the breadth of its energy system - from upstream production of oil and gas through to our network of retail sites. In recent years, Shell has invested €6.5 billion across a wide range of energy transition projects in the Netherlands. This includes enabling CO2 storage through the Porthos CCS project, developing renewable hydrogen at Holland Hydrogen 1, and installing new furnaces and the electrification of key manufacturing processes at Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk.

Shell’s net carbon intensity

Also, in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI), which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.

Shell’s net-zero emissions target

Shell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period, respectively, and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly, the outlook reflects our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio, efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.

Forward-Looking non-GAAP measures

This announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.

However, industry experts say the lack of supporting infrastructure and ecosystem makes SAF production costly.","New Delhi: India is working on a comprehensive policy to promote both the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Union Civil Aviation Minister K. Ram Mohan Naidu has announced, reports The Hindu businessline.

SAF, which is made from renewable sources or waste, is seen as a key step toward greener aviation.

Naidu said India has a natural advantage in this sector. “Our location gives us the chance to become an exporter, and we also have plenty of raw material available,” he noted.

Currently, India has more than 750 million metric tonnes of biomass and around 230 million metric tonnes of surplus farm residue.

“India has the potential to be a global leader in SAF production,” the Minister said, adding that the country could produce more than its domestic demand and emerge as a major exporter.

He also pointed out that the SAF industry could create 1.1 to 1.4 million jobs across the value chain, reduce India’s crude oil import bill by $5–7 million every year, and raise farmers’ income by 10–15 per cent through the use of crop residue.

Naidu said India’s skilled workforce and strong manufacturing base would make SAF more affordable compared to other regions. But he admitted that pricing remains a challenge.

“Right now, SAF is costlier than normal jet fuel. To make it cheaper, we need to increase production,” he explained.

Industry estimates show that SAF costs two to six times more than conventional jet fuel. Still, Naidu highlighted strong demand within India, driven by the fast-growing aviation sector. The country’s refining capacity also allows it to export half of its aviation turbine fuel production.

SAF is expected to play a key role in meeting India’s future fuel needs. Aviation turbine fuel demand is likely to rise to 15–16 million tonnes by 2030, and nearly double by 2040.

“SAF is an essential part of our strategy to make aviation sustainable. It offers a practical solution to cut emissions right now,” Naidu said.

The upcoming SAF policy will also draw from a feasibility study carried out by the Centre along with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

SAF is an important part of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). India has not joined its voluntary phase (2021–2026), but Indian carriers will need to comply with offset requirements from 2027.

The government plans to start with a one per cent SAF blend in jet fuel in 2027, increase it to two per cent in 2028, and reach five per cent by 2030.

Indian Oil Corporation recently received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery—an important step toward large-scale production, certification, and distribution.

However, industry experts say the lack of supporting infrastructure and ecosystem makes SAF production costly. Large investments are needed to set up facilities, but financing remains limited, especially in the early stages.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-09-03 08:57:16.724993

The move to scrap the project in Rotterdam marks another setback for its biofuel designs, after the company cancelled a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project on Singapore’s Bukom Island in March 2023.

It comes amid a wider shift away from renewable energy projects in the oil and gas sector as fossil fuel companies pursue higher profits.

In March last year Shell watered down a key emissions target, setting out a plan to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade compared with its previous goal of 20%.

Shell began construction of the plant in Rotterdam in the Netherlands in 2021, initially expecting to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels, with plans to bring it online in April 2024. This was later pushed back to 2025.

Machteld de Haan, the company’s head of downstream, renewables and energy solutions, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders.”

She added that the company continued “to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system” and that Shell was “one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel”.

Biomass, agricultural residue and used cooking oil are among the key feedstocks that can be tapped for production of SAF, which can be used as a drop-in fuel for aircraft.

The civil aviation ministry in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and with support from the European Union have prepared an SAF feasibility study for India.

The study assesses the potential for producing and utilising drop-in SAF in India. It evaluates domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, infrastructure and policy readiness and the enabling conditions needed to establish a robust domestic SAF market, the ministry said in a release on Wednesday.

Drawing upon international best practices and tailoring them to India's socio-economic and environmental context, the report provides a roadmap for sustainable fuel adoption, it added.

The study was undertaken under the ICAO's Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels programme (ACT-SAF) initiative.

India is the world's third largest aviation market and the passenger traffic is expected to double to 500 million by 2030.

In the release, Naidu said SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonise the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional fuel.

""With over 750 million metric tonne of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonne of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter,"" he said.

The minister also said that SAF production will not only reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually but also boost farmers' incomes by creating a strong value chain for agricultural residue and biomass.

Recently, Indian Oil Corporation became the first Indian company to get the ISCC CORSIA certification for production of SAF at its refinery in Panipat, Haryana.

CORSIA refers to Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) of the ICAO.

The minister also reaffirmed India's readiness to become self-sufficient in SAF production, targeting 1 per cent blending in ATF (Aviation Turbine Fuel) by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030 in line with the CORSIA mandate.

Meanwhile, COTECNA Inspection India Pvt Ltd has become the country's first SAF certification body.

Ashley Kelty, a leading analyst at Panmure Liberum, said it was “another nail in the ideological coffin for SAF and biofuels”.
Britain alone consumes about 11m tonnes of aviation fuel a year and emissions soared to 37m tonnes in 2024 – more than double the 16m tonnes seen in 1990.
That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.
Despite the decision, Shell said it remained committed to a low-carbon future.","Shell has abandoned plans to build a biofuels factory in the Netherlands, dealing a blow to Europe’s hopes of decarbonising the aviation industry.

The oil giant has scrapped the project after pausing work on the site last July, with a review concluding that the plant was too expensive and “insufficiently competitive”.

Under its proposals, the plant in Rotterdam was designed to be one of Europe’s biggest converters of waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel.

The decision to axe construction will pose a significant challenge for Europe as it seeks to reduce the environmental impact of flying.

It also marks the latest step in Shell’s shift away from net zero, as the company scales back green investment to focus more on oil and gas.

Ashley Kelty, a leading analyst at Panmure Liberum, said it was “another nail in the ideological coffin for SAF and biofuels”.

He said: “It means that SAF is going to be more expensive, limited in supply and therefore difficult for airlines to justify using.”

The take-up of green jet fuel – which is produced from waste materials such as used cooking oil – has struggled in recent years amid faltering production, which has kept prices high.

Machteld de Haan, Shell’s downstream, renewables and energy solutions president, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders.”

It marks a considerable turnaround for Shell, which only announced the biofuels project in 2021.

At the time, the company said it was transforming 14 oil refineries into five low-carbon energy sites to meet growing demand from the transport sector.

This formed part of a target to “reduce the production of traditional fuels by 55pc by 2030 and provide more low-carbon fuels such as biofuels for road transport and aviation, and hydrogen”.

However, these targets have been dashed as part of a pivot away from renewables, posing a problem for Europe’s airlines.

Aviation is the most climate‑intensive form of transport and its growth means its emissions have been growing faster than any other mode of transport.

Britain alone consumes about 11m tonnes of aviation fuel a year and emissions soared to 37m tonnes in 2024 – more than double the 16m tonnes seen in 1990.

That is set to grow even faster in the next two decades.

The UK Government has attempted to reverse this by ordering airlines to use 10pc of SAF by 2030.

However this requirement, also in effect across Europe, requires a network of refineries which are not yet materialising.

Shell’s decision to abandon the Rotterdam project is just the latest of several such schemes to fail.

In 2022, Boris Johnson – the prime minister at the time – announced a new policy known as “jet zero” to enforce a minimum threshold of green fuel use.

He also pledged the construction of a minimum of five new SAF plants, which have not been built.

It means the only company making SAF in the UK is the Phillips 66 refinery on Humberside in North Lincolnshire – and its output is just 20,000 tonnes a year.

That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.

Despite the decision, Shell said it remained committed to a low-carbon future.

Ms de Haan said: “We continue to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system. Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including SAF.”

Thailand’s energy giant Bangchak is broadening its renewable energy footprint. Its bio-based subsidiary BBGI (Bio-Based Green Innovation) announced a THB 2 billion (USD 61.6 million) investment in developing bio-LNG. The company is also partnering with government agencies to explore the production of algae-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Turning wastewater into renewable with lower-carbon bio-LNG

Amid global decarbonization efforts, Bangchak sees growing demand for biofuels. BBGI plans to use wastewater generated from its ethanol and methyl ester production processes, converting it into biogas through anaerobic fermentation before refining it into bio-LNG. Compared with fossil-based LNG, bio-LNG has a smaller carbon footprint.

According to BBGI CEO and President Daechapon Lersuwanaroj, the company will source wastewater and solid residues from ethanol plants in Kanchanaburi and Khon Kaen. “This marks a significant step towards advancing the use of renewable energy from wastewater,” he said.

BBGI’s partners include Singapore’s Keppel Corporation and waste-to-energy firm CleanEdge Resources. The company initially planned to supply bio-LNG as marine fuel for Keppel’s fleet, but due to the long lead time and engine technology upgrades required for fuel switching, BBGI is pivoting toward power generation instead—using bio-LNG to produce renewable electricity.

Daechapon added that data center operators, given their energy-intensive operations, have also expressed interest in bio-LNG. BBGI’s bio-LNG facility is slated to begin operations in 2027, with a planned output of 100 tons per day.

Expanding biofuels to meet shipping and aviation needs

While BBGI’s new plant will not supply marine fuel, Thailand’s government has been pushing major players to scale up biofuel solutions. Both Bangchak and state-owned PTT are actively developing Bio-VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil) to support the shipping sector in meeting IMO decarbonization targets.

The meeting, chaired by civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu, was attended by aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha, ICAO representatives, DGCA officials, oil companies and representatives from Boeing and Airbus.

Policy framework and blending targets

Officials told Hindustan Times that the workshop will help shape a policy framework and implementation steps to ensure India meets its SAF blending targets. These include 1 per cent of total fuel for international flights by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030.

Indian Oil’s Panipat refinery has already been certified as the country’s first SAF producer, with production expected to begin by the end of the year.

“The workshop is expected to finalise policy and implementation steps, ensuring India meets its SAF blending targets while reducing crude oil imports by an estimated $5–7 billion annually and boosting farmer incomes through the use of crop residue,” an official said.

Growth and supply potential

India’s aviation sector carried 240 million passengers in 2024, with numbers projected to double by 2030. Fuel consumption is expected to reach 16 million tonnes by 2030 and 31 million tonnes by 2040.

Officials said SAF could play a central role in balancing aviation growth with emissions reduction, with potential lifecycle emission cuts of up to 80 per cent.

Advt

“India is well positioned to become a global leader in SAF, because of its large agricultural base, availability of surplus biomass and strong refining capacity. Estimates suggest India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2040, more than domestic demand, opening export opportunities and creating up to 1.4 million green jobs,” another official said.

Wider decarbonisation efforts

At present, 88 airports in India run entirely on green energy. Bengaluru airport holds the highest level of global carbon accreditation, while Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad airports are carbon neutral.

Advt

Alongside SAF, India is also pursuing green hydrogen initiatives. Cochin airport has set up what it says is the world’s first airport-based hydrogen production facility, and companies including NTPC and Indian Oil Corporation are working on large-scale SAF and hydrogen projects.

One of the key ways to achieve this is through making eco-friendly aviation fuel alternatives more viable. Piper Alderman’s client is a key partner in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance (SAFFA), a joint venture with major airline carriers. SAFFA’s goal is to accelerate the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by investing in projects that are technologically mature and commercially viable. Our client specialises in financial advisory and capital raising services within the financial sector.

Piper Alderman acted for our client in relation to the establishment of a private equity fund for SAF. Each investor in the fund entered into an off-take agreement from the project refinery for the supply of aviation fuel. An off-take agreement is an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer’s upcoming goods.

One of Australia’s major airline carriers, represented by Minter Ellison, was the lead negotiator for the terms of the off-take. The investment by this carrier and the other airlines, and the negotiations of the various off-take arrangements, raised a number of complex competition law issues. This is primarily because it is illegal for businesses to make contracts, arrangements or understandings that substantially lessen competition. There is potential for Limited Partnership Agreements and Off-take Allocation Agreements, such as those used in the SAFFA, to be scrutinised under competition laws to ensure they don’t unfairly restrict competition or harm consumers.

Piper Alderman reviewed and provided competition law advice in relation to the Limited Partnership Agreement and the Off-take Allocation Agreement. Given that the investors in the fund were airline competitors, we had to ensure that the arrangements set out in the agreements did not breach the cartel conduct provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act.

Where and when moisture matters most In biomass production, moisture monitoring is not a one and done task.
In a market increasingly focused on ESG metrics, real time moisture control isn’t just a quality improvement, it’s a sustainability strategy.","Biomass has emerged as a powerful contributor to global decarbonization goals, offering a renewable path forward for energy production. Whether in the form of wood chips, pellets, or agricultural residue, biomass fuels serve as a flexible, renewable, and carbon-neutral energy source. However, this versatility comes with challenges, particularly ones concerning moisture content.

Moisture, often treated as a byproduct of the process, is in fact a critical performance variable. Biomass moisture levels influence combustion efficiency, emissions, equipment performance, fuel costs, and the quality of downstream products such as pellets. In short, moisture content has a direct line to profitability and sustainability.

Yet for many biomass producers and power plants, moisture is still managed reactively through lab sampling, visual inspection, or outdated sensor technology. These legacy methods not only introduce costly delays but also fail to capture the rapid moisture variability typical of biomass feedstocks. As the bioenergy sector evolves, so too must its approach to moisture control.

The hidden costs of moisture mismanagement

Improper moisture levels in biomass feedstocks can undermine operational efficiency. If the material is too wet, combustion becomes incomplete, emissions rise, and calorific value plummets. The extra energy required to evaporate excess moisture during burning directly translates to higher fuel usage and operating costs. In pellet manufacturing, excess moisture compromises densification, leading to weak, crumbly pellets that underperform in both combustion and storage.

Conversely, biomass that’s too dry can be brittle, abrasive, and difficult to process. In pellet mills, variations of just 1% in moisture content can throw off amperage loads on main drives, forcing frequent recalibration and increasing equipment wear. When moisture varies by more than 3-5%, producing a consistent, durable pellet becomes nearly impossible.

Then there’s the matter of safety. Fine biomass particles with low moisture content are more prone to combustion and dust explosions. On the other end of the spectrum, sticky, wet biomass can cause clogs in conveyors and silos, risking unplanned downtime. The cumulative effect of these inefficiencies is significant: reduced yield, elevated maintenance, higher emissions, and increased capital spend.

Where and when moisture matters most

In biomass production, moisture monitoring is not a one and done task. It must occur at multiple points in the process, with the most critical stages including:

Incoming feedstock: Moisture content at the point of entry affects not only drying efficiency but also pricing and combustion value. Undetected high moisture biomass can lead to overpaying for material with less usable energy.

Before and after drying: Real time moisture feedback allows operators to dynamically adjust dryer temperatures and retention times. This minimizes fuel usage and helps prevent over drying, which can create dust, fines, and unnecessary mechanical strain.

Pre-pelletization: Precision is paramount at this final stage. Even a small deviation in moisture can dramatically alter pellet sheen, density, and durability. Properly calibrated in-line sensors ensure consistent output quality and reduce off-spec batches.

The ability to maintain moisture within optimal thresholds, typically 6–10% for wood pellets and under 20% for biomass combustion, can transform the economics of a facility. Operators gain tighter control over energy use, product quality, and equipment longevity.

Why traditional methods fall short

Despite the high stakes, many biomass operations still rely on periodic lab testing or operator intuition to assess moisture content. These methods are slow, inconsistent, and inherently reactive. Visual inspections, still surprisingly common in some facilities, are subjective and prone to human error. Manual sampling and lab testing, while more reliable, introduce significant time delays. By the time an out-of-spec moisture level is detected in the lab, large quantities of material may already be processed, stored, or shipped, leading to preventable waste or product rejection.

In an effort to modernize, some facilities use technologies such as radio frequency (RF), oven weight loss, or contact probes. While these offer incremental improvements over manual methods, they remain vulnerable to variability in biomass materials. For example, RF and probe systems often struggle to deliver consistent results when particle size, bulk density, or material color shifts. There are factors that fluctuate widely in wood chips, agricultural residues, or mixed biomass feedstocks. These technologies also tend to require frequent recalibration or maintenance, reducing uptime and operator confidence in the data they provide.

Traditional measurement approaches also fall short when it comes to scalability. Batch testing cannot deliver 100% product inspection or offer actionable, in-line feedback. Operators are left to extrapolate based on incomplete data, making it harder to fine tune drying cycles, control combustion conditions, or ensure consistency in final pellet quality.

In contrast, near-infrared (NIR) moisture sensors overcome these limitations through non-contact, continuous scanning. NIR analysis eliminates the need for collecting and drying samples, while also avoiding chemical exposure and labor intensive processing. By enabling real time measurement directly on conveyors, silos, or pellet presses, these sensors allow biomass producers to detect moisture variability instantly and adjust on the fly. The result is faster decision making, reduced waste, lower energy use, and more predictable product performance.

The solution lies in non-contact, near-infrared (NIR) technology that measures moisture continuously, unaffected by material heterogeneity or conveyance method. Instead of estimating trends, manufacturers can now see exactly what’s happening inside their processes, moment to moment. One company leading this transformation is MoistTech, global leader in moisture measurement and control, whose IR3000 series sensors are purpose built for industrial applications like biomass. These sensors provide real time, in-line moisture data using NIR technology that requires no contact with the material. With rugged design, one time calibration, and drift-free operation, the IR3000 excels in high dust, high vibration environments typical of pellet plants and biomass power stations.

Unlike older sensors that require frequent recalibration, MoistTech’s systems maintain consistent accuracy over time, helping operators act on reliable data without pausing production. Because the sensors are unaffected by changes in particle size, material flow height, or color, they deliver repeatable results across a wide variety of biomass feedstocks. More importantly, the sensors can be integrated at multiple points in the production line, before and after the dryer, on conveyors, or near the pellet press, to deliver a holistic view of moisture trends. When connected to plant control systems, they enable closed loop automation that responds instantly to moisture deviations, optimizing performance without manual intervention.

This level of insight does more than prevent spoilage or inefficiency. It helps facilities cut drying costs, reduce fire hazards, minimize emissions, and increase product consistency. In a market increasingly focused on ESG metrics, real time moisture control isn’t just a quality improvement, it’s a sustainability strategy.

A clear path to smarter operations

Biomass production is a balance between energy efficiency, equipment reliability, and product quality. Moisture is at the center of this balance. Variations in moisture content affect everything from grinding resistance to combustion emissions and pellet durability to electrical load on motors. Adopting continuous moisture monitoring through advanced NIR sensors transforms that challenge into an opportunity. Operators can eliminate guesswork, reduce energy consumption, streamline compliance, and boost throughput, all without increasing overhead.

Moisture management doesn’t have to be reactive. When monitored in real time, moisture becomes one of the most controllable, high impact variables in a biomass facility. And in an industry where margins are tight and expectations are high, that control is a serious advantage.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Moist_Tech_Sept251_34da6d1961.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 20:56:17.627856

SAF is a key lever in Air New Zealand’s journey toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Through a ‘book and claim’ system, corporate partners like MinterEllisonRuddWatts can purchase SAF certificates that contribute to the airline’s use of sustainable fuel, while applying the associated emissions reductions to their own carbon reporting.

“Our involvement reflects our deep commitment to climate leadership and responsible business,” said Janine Stewart, Chair and Partner at MinterEllisonRuddWatts.

“As a firm that values sustainability, innovation and accountability, we are proud to support the development of sustainable aviation in Aotearoa New Zealand and to take meaningful action toward our net-zero goals.”

The SAF used in the trial is produced from waste feedstocks and offers a significantly lower carbon footprint over its lifecycle than fossil jet fuel. SAF’s ‘book and claim’ model allows businesses to support SAF use without requiring physical delivery of the fuel on their specific flights – similar to how Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) work in the electricity sector.

“This partnership aligns with Kia toitū te taiao, one of our firm’s three pillars in our Sustainability Strategy and reinforces our commitment to reducing Scope 3 emissions from business travel,” said Holly Hill, Partner and Sustainability Leader.

“By contributing financially towards SAF, we’re not only addressing a portion of our carbon footprint – we’re also helping to stimulate local demand for SAF for the future.”

Air New Zealand has offered emissions reductions through SAF to a group of early adopters to better understand market demand and inform future SAF investment, says Kiri Hannifin, the airline’s Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer.

""SAF is a complex commodity to understand, and it's a big step for a New Zealand company to buy SAF certificates because they're so new. We are very grateful to MinterEllisonRuddWatts for the leap of faith they have shown and for their leadership,"" said Kiri Hannifin.

""Customers contributing to SAF like this is meaningful not only for climate reasons, but also because their action helps set up and scale a global SAF system for the future.""

MinterEllisonRuddWatts has previously offset its air travel emissions through carbon credits and sees this SAF initiative as a more direct and impactful way to support the transition to low-emissions travel. The firm has committed to ensuring 80% of its travel during the working week is sustainable and continues to explore new ways to reduce its environmental impact.

EDMOND, OK, UNITED STATES, September 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Green Fuels Operating (GFO), a subsidiary of Clean Refineries Inc., and Eden Carbon Solutions Pty Ltd announced today a groundbreaking partnership that will transform how refineries convert carbon dioxide emissions into valuable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership grants GFO exclusive North American rights to Eden's proven carbon capture and synthesis technology, positioning the companies to revolutionize fuel production across the continent.

The partnership combines Clean Refineries’ Net-Zero Emissions Technology (NZET) with Eden's advanced CO₂-to-fuel conversion system, creating a revolutionary approach to sustainable fuel production.

The patented technology Eden utilizes operates through a three-stage process that captures and converts CO₂ into premium transportation fuels. The system uses Hot Potassium Carbonate (HPC) absorption technology—proven in hundreds of industrial installations—to capture over 95% of CO₂ emissions from flue gases at dramatically lower energy costs than traditional methods.

""Our technology captures carbon dioxide and converts it into high-performance fuels using hydrogen and precision-engineered chemical pathways—delivering a scalable, infrastructure-ready solution for deep decarbonization,"" explained Gavin Rodel, CEO of Eden Carbon Solutions. ""We capture CO₂ from any source—whether it’s our partner’s refinery or a nearby cement plant—and combine it with renewable hydrogen to create the building blocks for ultra-clean jet fuel.""

Clean Refineries’ NZET technology provides the ideal foundation for Eden integration. Unlike conventional refineries that boil oil at extreme temperatures over 1,000°F with massive energy requirements, NZET facilities use precision molecular separation in a low-temperature closed-loop, zero-toxic-emission design.

""The NZET system already achieves an unprecedented emission reduction compared to traditional refining,"" stated Derek Williamson, CEO of Green Fuels Operations. ""By integrating Eden's technology, we’re not just eliminating our remaining emissions—we’re becoming carbon sinks that actively remove CO₂ from the atmosphere while producing premium fuels.""

Consider a typical deployment: A 20,000 barrel-per-day NZET refinery integrated with Eden technology could process CO₂ from a nearby coal plant, converting what would be 2.2 million tons of annual emissions into approximately 220 million gallons of feedstock for high-value SAF production.

Market Transformation at Scale

With exclusive rights across Mexico, Canada, and the United States, the partnership addresses a massive market opportunity. North America's industrial sector emits over 6.8 billion tons of CO₂ annually, while airlines desperately seek sustainable fuel supplies to meet regulatory mandates and corporate commitments.

""This partnership doesn’t just solve one problem—it solves three,"" noted Williamson. ""We help heavy industry manage their carbon liabilities, provide airlines with certified sustainable fuel, and create a profitable new business model for refineries. It’s a true win-win-win scenario.""

Immediate Implementation Plans

The first integrated facilities are planned for development within 24 months, with sites under evaluation in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Alberta. Each location has been selected for proximity to both CO₂-intensive industries and aviation fuel markets, ensuring efficient aggregation and distribution.

Future Growth at the Airport Beyond the new terminal project, Pittsburgh International Airport has its sights on several other innovations.","It all began with a scribble on the back of a receipt.

When Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis was discussing with other aviation leaders her dilemma about what to do about Pittsburgh’s way-too-big-and-outdated airport, Jeff Fegan, former CEO of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, had an idea.

He made the bold suggestion of moving the landside terminal building over to the airside terminal — making it one complex. Why do you need two buildings, connected by a half-mile tram? He illustrated his idea on the back of a restaurant receipt dated April 2, 2015.

“I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, that’s a great idea,’” Cassotis recalled at the time. The scribble evolved into a rough blueprint for the $1.7 billion terminal that is on track to open this fall.

City and regional leaders see the new terminal as a way of reintroducing Pittsburgh to the world — and the city will get that opportunity in a big way next April, when the NFL Draft is expected to draw 700,000 to the Steel City.

“For us, from a travel perspective, the airport is oftentimes the very first impression and the very last impression that a lot of travel consumers have of the destination,” says Jared Bachar, president and CEO of VisitPittsburgh. “Travel is a $6.8 billion sector in Allegheny County alone, supporting 40,000 jobs. So having an airport that is world class, that is cutting edge, is absolutely critical to everything that we’re trying to do to continue to move in a direction of being hyper-competitive as a travel destination across the board.”

The design is quintessentially Pittsburgh. Signs are in black and gold. A pedestrian bridge and tunnel — patterned after the Fort Pitt Tunnel and Bridge — connects landside operations with the airside terminal. The undulating roof mirrors the region’s rolling hills. A larger and more comfortable meet-and-greet area at baggage claim acknowledges the charming habits of Pittsburghers who come inside to pick up their loved ones, friends and colleagues — a practice that Cassotis says is “rare” these days at airports. The restaurant and retail corridor is packed with local brands.

When the current terminal opened in 1992, The New York Times called it the “airport of the future.” It served as a model for other airports around the world. It also was built to be the largest connecting hub for US Airways; it was a place where 80% of travelers simply changed planes.

At its peak in the mid-’90s, the airport served 21 million passengers per year. But in 2004, as US Airways struggled through two bankruptcies, it abruptly canceled its lease for the hub.

That led to the loss of two-thirds of its passengers. And with that action, PIT became an origin-destination airport, meaning travelers flew out of Pittsburgh and returned to Pittsburgh. Now, about 10 million are using the airport each year; only 2% are switching planes.

The new 811,000-square-foot terminal, which broke ground in October 2021, is “right-sizing” and modernizing the airport for Pittsburgh’s future, airport officials say. By eliminating the half-mile tram that links the two terminals, passengers will be able to go from curb to gate in half the time it takes them now. And the airport will save $25 million a year in operating and maintenance costs, says Paul Hoback, chief development officer and executive vice president of the Allegheny County Airport Authority.

“The whole point was to redefine what it means to be an airport, and what it means to its community and to a global industry,” Cassotis told a group of international aviation leaders meeting at the new terminal in May.

The design of the new terminal, developed by Gensler + HDR in association with Luis Vidal + Architects, follows trends across the aviation industry: New terminals or airport spaces are bringing in more natural light and greenery and adding outdoor spaces. They’re creating sustainability, enhancing comfort and wellness and tailoring design, artwork and amenities to the specific city.

In a major preparation for the new terminal, a dress rehearsal of sorts will be held on Sept. 20 in which 2,000-2,500 volunteers will be testing all aspects of the airport. PIT hired Daniel Bryan, an industry consultant who has overseen similar tests at airports around the world, to lead the tests here. When PIT put out the call for volunteers in late June, it expected 3,000 to 4,000 people to respond; instead, 18,000 signed up. Bryan will be helping to select the volunteers who will best represent all types of travelers — families, those with disabilities, those who don’t have smartphones or aren’t technologically savvy, business folks and the leisure traveler.

The airport also has scheduled a Community Open House for the public from noon to 7 p.m. on Oct. 11 for people to explore at their own pace all aspects of the new terminal.

When opening day arrives, the switchover will occur during the few hours in the middle of the night between when the last flights of the previous day depart and arrive, at about 11 p.m,, or later, to when the first flights depart on opening day before dawn. The roads to the new terminal are finished, and new directional signs are up. Just a single strip of Jersey barriers needs to be moved to open up the new roadway to the new terminal.

Cassotis is confident the new terminal will be well-received.

“It’s going to work for the passengers,” she says. “It’s going to work for the people who work here. It’s going to work for the people who pick up and drop off. And it’s going to work for our partners.”

The Design

When PIT officials embarked on the terminal project, they brought in architectural teams with the aim of finding and building collaboration first before considering design.

“We wanted to find a firm that was going to be very collaborative — but also disruptive a little bit, and not avoid conflict because we believe conflict was something that could help elevate the design,” Hoback has said.

They selected a pair of global firms – Gensler + HDR and Luis Vidal + Architects.

The next step was getting them acquainted with the Steel City — to show them what made Pittsburgh Pittsburgh. Bill Flanagan, senior advisor for the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, took them on a bus ride around the city. They looked at the city skyline from Mount Washington; they walked through Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens; they toured the universities; they drove through neighborhoods.

The firms came up with a design theme based on their observations: Nature, Technology, Community — or NaTeCo.

You see nature in the steel columns shaped like trees that stretch to the ceiling in the departure area. You see it in the tall windows and wavy, wood-like ceiling (the panels are actually made of metal to look like wood; developers learned that the wood could warp) that bring in natural light, cutting down on the use of electricity. You see it in the constellation lighting. And you see it in other greenery and the four outside terraces.

Each of the terraces — two before the security checkpoint and two post-security — will be filled with native plants, walkways and benches. Rainwater will be collected and recirculated to water the landscaping, says Chad Willis, the authority’s vice president of planning, environmental and sustainability at PIT.

“The use of nature — natural light, ventilation, color, vegetation, outdoor activity — all those things are very rare in an airport, and this will be one of the very first airports in the world to take advantage of all these possibilities,” architect Luis Vidal said in an airport video.

Another aim of the design is to reduce travel stress. “We’re trying to reduce stressors and stimuli as much as possible,” Siri Betts-Sonstegard, senior vice president of experience and design for the airport authority, said on a recent tour of the new terminal.

“We can’t be a completely quiet airport, but we’re trying to reduce, [for example,] sound coming out of speakers — we put that into our concession agreements … We’re really creating a sense of calm, because we know [that] travel can be difficult.”

PM Managing Editor Sean Collier contributed to this report.

Ticketing & Security

The airline ticket counters are in the main lobby, where passengers enter the airport for departures. Each airline counter will have a lower section accessible to wheelchairs. Improved signage, lighting and design aim to help more quickly guide travelers through this area.

From there, travelers will follow signs or the constellation lighting in the ceiling to the security checkpoint. The distance between the individual lights in the ceiling narrows as they progress toward the checkpoint — serving as a decorative wayfinding tool.

There are 12 public Transportation Security Administration lanes (double the number of what’s in the main security area now), including lanes for TSA PreCheck, CLEAR and Priority boarding. The number of lanes dedicated to each will vary according to demand; there’s also an additional line exclusively for staff and airline employees.

With state-of-the-art scanning equipment, travelers no longer will have to remove phones, tablets, laptops or liquids, Hoback says. And, because of a change recently made by the TSA, they don’t have to remove their shoes, either.

Peak waiting times to get through the new TSA lanes have been estimated to be no more than 30 minutes, he says.

Once through security, passengers will walk 160 feet across a bridge and through a tunnel — which emulates the entrance to Downtown through the Fort Pitt tunnel — to get to the airside terminal, with its shops, restaurants and gates. A wall of video screens on each side of the bridge will present wayfinding information and more. Once passengers get through the tunnel, they’ll take escalators or elevators down to the center core of the airside terminal to the gates.

Checked baggage will be handled on the terminal’s ground floor, where robots will be assisting TSA agents in their inspections of suspicious bags and those that trigger alarms. Currently, the agents have to pick up a suspicious 50-pound bag, take it to another belt, open it, inspect it and then manually return it to another belt.

“We will have 41 robots in this airport that do all of that,” Hoback says. “The TSA agent will never have to lift up that bag, which is certainly a safety issue” and can cause back injuries for the agents. He added that PIT will be one of a handful of airports using robots in this way.

Getting There

Visitors to the new terminal at Pittsburgh International Airport will take the same exit off of Interstate 376 that they do now. They will enter the airport property on a similar horseshoe-shaped roadway as they do now — it will just go deeper into the property. And they’ll use the same exit out of the airport property as they do now.

In fact, passengers may not even notice much change as they use the new airport roadways —- and airport officials say that is by design.

Passengers will be directed by overhead signs to parking options (including a new garage, with more than 3,200 spaces for public parking — tripling the number of covered parking spaces currently at the airport), or to a double-decker bridge on the front of the terminal that will separate traffic into three levels. The top is for departures, like it is now. The middle is for arrivals, dedicating space to passenger pickup. The bottom level will be for all rideshares, taxies, vans and buses.

Gone will be the current confusion at the baggage-claim level, in which passenger pickup is on one side of the building and public transportation, rideshares and taxis are on the other.

Regarding parking, there now is a designated cell-phone lot where drivers can park at no cost while waiting to pick up arriving passengers. It will be near the entrance to the airport property and will be called the Free Wait Lot, where motorists can wait, for free, for up to an hour.

There are 2,800 spaces in the Terminal Lot, a surface lot next to the terminal, plus those in the new Terminal Garage. The garage will offer a “smart parking system” that will assist drivers in finding open spaces on the four floors of public parking. Travelers would walk to the terminal from these two areas. More parking will be available in the airport’s Shuttle lots, currently known as the long-term, extended and economy lots. From here, travelers must take shuttles (with new, bigger buses) to the terminal. The bus shelters will be heated, and buses have been upgraded to better accommodate those with disabilities.

Shopping & Dining

Over the last year, new stores have opened or expanded in the airside terminal. More are yet to come — in a combination of local businesses and national chains.

Many of the 15 new stores and restaurants being added were requested by local travelers and visitors. “We’ve listened to what our travelers wanted — a balance between showcasing not only our local brands, but also having the availability of unique and respected national and international brands,” says Travis McNichols, chief operations officer for the Allegheny County Airport Authority.

“We know many different types of travelers go through our airport every day, and we want to ensure that our offerings meet the needs of everyone that we serve.”

Even before the switch to the new terminal, these new retail and dining options opened their doors.

Hammer Made — A men’s clothing retailer founded in Minneapolis, Hammer Made has about 10 locations in malls and airports around the country. This location, the first in the Pittsburgh area, opened in July in Concourse B.

Duquesne Supply Co. — This Pittsburgh-centric gift shop carries such items as: locally made Tabbara Chocolates, Sarris candies, Pittsburgh Popcorn Co. products, Una Biologicals and Spectrum Fudge; mugs, shot glasses, keychains and more bearing “Pittsburghese” terms including “nebby” and “yinz”; hot sauces, OMG Pretzels and more.

Sambazon Acai Bowls — Found in many airports and universities around the country, this Brazilian-influenced chain offers acai bowls, smoothies and other healthy options.

Champion City Sports — This shop offers Steelers, Penguins and Pirates gear and memorabilia, an interactive sports simulator and all sorts of gifts. It also has collaborations with Build-A-Bear and Vera Bradley franchises.

MAC Cosmetics — A national cosmetic company, MAC also has counters at area Macy’s, Nordstrom and Ulta locations.

Jimmy John’s — A national sandwich-shop chain.

More stores and restaurants are due to open before the new terminal debuts, including the region’s second location of Shake Shack, a fast-casual restaurant based in New York. It is slated to open in the former McDonald’s spot in the center core in September.

Mineo’s Pizza, a Squirrel Hill institution, also will be in the center core. Two locally owned coffee chains are planned: Convive Coffee, which will be opening in Concourse A, and two locations of Wexford-based Cafe Conmigo, in the center core across from Sarris candies (opening in early September) and in the meet-and-greet area. Also in the center core will be Mi Casa Cantina, at the entrance of Concourse B; Bad Egg Breakfast Bar, a breakfast spot found in other airports; and Stack + Press Delicatessen.

The Gates

Seating in most areas has been upgraded to be more comfortable and to include in-seat device chargers. Original artwork also has been added to the gate areas.

Bathrooms along the concourses have been modernized or are undergoing improvements. In particular, stall doors are being changed to open out rather than in — to allow ample space inside for carry-on luggage. Each concourse will include a nursing room, as well as a bathroom with an adult changing table.

Presley’s Place, a 1,500-square-foot room that provides a quiet, peaceful spot for people with sensory sensibilities and their families, will remain near Gate A9. It opened in 2019 after a PIT heavy equipment operator dropped a comment in the CEO suggestion box asking the airport to provide a quiet place for children like his son, Presley, who has autism. The room is now serving as a model for other airports around the world.

Kidsport, a 2,100-square-foot aviation-themed play area for children, is being revamped in collaboration with the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh and will reopen in Concourse C.

Baggage Claim & Meeting Spaces

One of the major changes in the upgraded baggage system involves the distance the checked luggage will now travel from plane to baggage carousel — it’s being reduced from 8 miles to 3, Hoback says. The carousels also are larger.

Does that mean that the bags will be waiting for passengers as soon as they arrive at baggage claim? Not necessarily, Hoback says. Passengers will have a much shorter distance to walk from plane arrival to baggage claim — absent the tram ride — so they’ll get there in less time.

But there will be a circular bar, two outdoor terraces and other amenities at baggage claim to help pass the time. It’s part of the expanded meet-and-greet area, named Welcome Point, which addresses the “Community” part of the NaTeCo theme. Pittsburghers like to park their cars and go inside to wait for loved ones or friends rather than just picking them up at the curb, Hoback says.

“We want a place for families [or] business partners to be able to wait,” Cassotis says, “so they would have access to the landside terraces, free security, great views of the airfield.” She calls the practice of face-to-face meetings “lovely.”

Pittsburghers will be pleased to see the return of the Alexander Calder mobile called “Pittsburgh,” which is now hanging in the atrium of the departures area. It had hung in the airside terminal since 1992 — and since 1959, at the older airport in Moon.

The piece, designed with paddle-like forms suspended on metal rods that rotate with air currents, won first place in the 1958 Pittsburgh International Exhibition of Contemporary Paintings and Sculpture (now known as the Carnegie International) at the Carnegie Museum of Art. After the exhibition, it was purchased by G. David Thompson, who donated it to Allegheny County; at times it traveled to exhibitions around the world, including to Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain. Calder, who was born outside of Harrisburg, died in 1976 at age 78 in New York City.

Three statues now greet travelers at the entrance of the landside terminal: George Washington, 19th-century investigative journalist and world traveler Nellie Bly and Pittsburgh Steelers legend Franco Harris. Harris definitely will be placed in the new terminal; at press time, officials were trying to figure out places for the other two. Still up in the air is whether there will be places for the replica of the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton (provided by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History) or Miss Pittsburgh, the restored Waco 9 airplane that made the first airmail flight from Pittsburgh to Cleveland.

The Hotel

The 11-story, 338-room Hyatt Regency is the only hotel on airport property, and it has been connected to the landside terminal via a peoplemover since it opened in 2000. It loses that connection once the new terminal opens.

A system of shuttles will run between the hotel and the new terminal. These are being paid for through a settlement reached on June 27 between the Allegheny County Airport Authority and owners of the Hyatt Regency. That settlement includes a payment of $152,000 to Hyatt Regency owners MCSW Penn Hospitality LLC the first year and increases in subsequent years to cover the costs.

Floor Plans

These are the floor plans of the departures and arrivals levels of the new landside terminal.

Future Growth at the Airport

Beyond the new terminal project, Pittsburgh International Airport has its sights on several other innovations.

It’s the first airport in the world to be solely powered by its own 23-megawatt microgrid with an on-site natural gas plant and a solar panel field that is being doubled in size. By 2027, it hopes to have more than 20,000 solar panels stretched over 20 acres of landfill property that can’t be used for any other purpose. When expanded, the solar field will produce 7.7 megawatts of power; 4.3 megawatts of that will supply energy to the regional electric grid, giving the community additional renewable energy.

In June, the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which owns and runs the airport, announced it is partnering with New Jersey-based Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel to develop the first on-airport sustainable aviation fuel production facility in the nation. Once built, the facility is expected to produce more than 100 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel each year to meet local and regional commercial and cargo needs at PIT and for other entities.

According to Avina’s press release, the plant — which will employ hundreds of full-time workers when it opens — will have a carbon intensity that is at least 65% lower than that of conventional jet fuel. It will use KBR’s PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology — developed and owned by Swedish Biofuels AB and licensed globally by KBR, which is headquartered in Houston.

Since 2019, the authority also has been developing Neighborhood 91, a 195-acre advanced manufacturing campus on the western end of the airport’s 8,800 acres. The Regional Industrial Development Corp. is handling property management and business attraction for the site.

Among the businesses opening on airport property near Neighborhood 91 (named to represent an extension of Pittsburgh’s 90 neighborhoods) is Mainspring Energy, a Menlo Park, California-based company that plans to produce 1,000 low-emissions linear power generators per year. Its 292,000-square-foot facility — slated to open in 2027 — is expected to employ 600 people.

At press time, airport officials had made no decision about what would happen to the current landside terminal — whether it would be reused for other purposes or torn down.

The airport also sees expansion in its cargo operations; the manufacturing companies at Neighborhood 91, for example, can benefit from their close proximity to cargo operations that can ship their products around the world, says Sara Innamorato, Allegheny County executive.

“They’ve been incredibly creative and innovative,” she says about the authority’s vision. “They have pushed the bounds of what that authority can do, and now it’s time for Allegheny County economic development to bring the right partners around the table to make sure that we can continue to build on that success and build out that campus to really put us on the map.

“There’s a lot of opportunity that is adjacent to the new terminal that is very exciting for the growth of our entire region.”",https://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/content/uploads/2025/09/q/y/tmp-arrivals-constellation-lightingwebp.jpeg,N,,2025-09-02 15:56:21.326272

EDMOND, OK, UNITED STATES, September 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Green Fuels Operating (GFO), a subsidiary of Clean Refineries Inc., and Eden Carbon Solutions Pty Ltd announced today a groundbreaking partnership that will transform how refineries convert carbon dioxide emissions into valuable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The partnership grants GFO exclusive North American rights to Eden's proven carbon capture and synthesis technology, positioning the companies to revolutionize fuel production across the continent.

The partnership combines Clean Refineries’ Net-Zero Emissions Technology (NZET) with Eden's advanced CO₂-to-fuel conversion system, creating a revolutionary approach to sustainable fuel production.

The patented technology Eden utilizes operates through a three-stage process that captures and converts CO₂ into premium transportation fuels. The system uses Hot Potassium Carbonate (HPC) absorption technology—proven in hundreds of industrial installations—to capture over 95% of CO₂ emissions from flue gases at dramatically lower energy costs than traditional methods.

""Our technology captures carbon dioxide and converts it into high-performance fuels using hydrogen and precision-engineered chemical pathways—delivering a scalable, infrastructure-ready solution for deep decarbonization,"" explained Gavin Rodel, CEO of Eden Carbon Solutions. ""We capture CO₂ from any source—whether it’s our partner’s refinery or a nearby cement plant—and combine it with renewable hydrogen to create the building blocks for ultra-clean jet fuel.""

Clean Refineries’ NZET technology provides the ideal foundation for Eden integration. Unlike conventional refineries that boil oil at extreme temperatures over 1,000°F with massive energy requirements, NZET facilities use precision molecular separation in a low-temperature closed-loop, zero-toxic-emission design.

""The NZET system already achieves an unprecedented emission reduction compared to traditional refining,"" stated Derek Williamson, CEO of Green Fuels Operations. ""By integrating Eden's technology, we’re not just eliminating our remaining emissions—we’re becoming carbon sinks that actively remove CO₂ from the atmosphere while producing premium fuels.""

Consider a typical deployment: A 20,000 barrel-per-day NZET refinery integrated with Eden technology could process CO₂ from a nearby coal plant, converting what would be 2.2 million tons of annual emissions into approximately 220 million gallons of feedstock for high-value SAF production.

Market Transformation at Scale

With exclusive rights across Mexico, Canada, and the United States, the partnership addresses a massive market opportunity. North America's industrial sector emits over 6.8 billion tons of CO₂ annually, while airlines desperately seek sustainable fuel supplies to meet regulatory mandates and corporate commitments.

""This partnership doesn’t just solve one problem—it solves three,"" noted Williamson. ""We help heavy industry manage their carbon liabilities, provide airlines with certified sustainable fuel, and create a profitable new business model for refineries. It’s a true win-win-win scenario.""

Immediate Implementation Plans

The first integrated facilities are planned for development within 24 months, with sites under evaluation in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Alberta. Each location has been selected for proximity to both CO₂-intensive industries and aviation fuel markets, ensuring efficient aggregation and distribution.

Julie de Cevins, the Daher Group’s chief sustainability officer, stated: “Daher’s climate policy is a clear response to the climate emergency.","Staying true to its founding values as a committed and responsible family-owned business, Daher is taking a major step forward in its sustainable development strategy by adopting an ambitious and structured climate policy.

This new initiative is designed to accelerate the transition toward a low-carbon future, aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

As a unique player in the aerospace value chain – with activities ranging from aircraft manufacturing to industrial logistics – the Daher Group recognizes its responsibility in driving the sector’s environmental transformation.

This distinctive positioning enables the Group to act on multiple fronts, working directly with its entire ecosystem: customers, suppliers, partners, and employees.

In a context where the aerospace industry faces major challenges related to energy transition, Daher intends to lead by example. With a long-term vision and collective mobilization, the Group places climate action at the center of its priorities – serving both current and future generations.

This climate policy is built on four complementary pillars:

Reducing carbon emissions from operations

Daher is committed to significantly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, aligned with the 1.5C target set by the Paris Agreement. The goal is clear: a 50 percent reduction in emissions from operations between 2022 and 2032, with the first step of a 23 percent reduction from 2027.

To achieve this, the Group is focusing on energy efficiency: the application of electrification, the adoption of lower-carbon energy sources (such as sustainable aviation fuels/SAF and biofuels), and the optimization of its processes and facilities.

Engaging suppliers in the transition

Recognizing that climate performance also depends on upstream activities, Daher places its suppliers at the core of its strategy. By 2027, the Group will assess the carbon maturity of its 50 highest-emitting suppliers, expanding this analysis to the top 100 by 2032.

Daher will work to ensure reliable CO₂ data for its upstream emissions in the Paris Agreement’s Scope 3 emissions category by collecting data from its most impactful Tier 1 suppliers.

Representative CO₂ data will be integrated into the Group’s management and reporting tools.

The objective is to co-develop emission reduction pathways for the Paris Agreement’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 categories with these partners, aligned with the Agreement’s 1.5C target.

Reducing emissions from products and services

Daher is taking action on three fronts to reduce the carbon footprint of its products and services.

The Group has committed to developing a lower-carbon aircraft by 2027, while also continuously improving the energy efficiency of its airplanes and increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuels in its own flight operations.

The share of SAF blended with conventional kerosene will exceed 10 percent by 2027, reaching 20 percent by 2032. Daher also supports initiatives to authorize SAF blends above 50 percent to accelerate the sector’s transition.

In parallel, Daher is heavily investing in innovation to make its products lighter in weight. At least 50 percent of its research and development budget is dedicated to research in composite materials, with the goal of delivering lighter aerostructures for future aerospace programs. By the end of 2027, eco-design testing and training will be conducted to integrate these principles from the design phase.

Finally, the Group is enhancing the energy efficiency of its services and transportation operations, while promoting the use of biofuels in ground operations.

Research and development investments will continue to optimize tools and transportation methods, with a clear commitment to offering more sustainable services to its customers.

Adapting activities to climate risks

Daher also is anticipating the impacts of climate change on its infrastructure. By the end of 2027, comprehensive physical risk mapping will be conducted for its sites, as well as those deemed critical in its value chain. Based on this assessment, an adaptation plan will be defined by 2032 for the most exposed sites to strengthen their resilience to climate hazards and ensure operational continuity.

Julie de Cevins, the Daher Group’s chief sustainability officer, stated: “Daher’s climate policy is a clear response to the climate emergency. It reflects our commitment to act with methods, ambition, and responsibility. Every employee has a role to play in this collective effort. Progress will be tracked regularly, with annual carbon footprint mapping to ensure transparency, effectiveness and continuous improvement in our actions.”

LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) has announced a significant breakthrough in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, expanding its capability to produce SAF via the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway. This innovation offers a sustainable palm oil substitute, leveraging LanzaTech's versatile technology for decarbonization efforts across various sectors. The development was collaboratively achieved with the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial Engineering and Biotechnology IGB and the Mibelle Group.

The breakthrough involves a unique dual fermentation technology that transforms waste CO₂ gases into alcohol and further into a palm oil-like fat using non-GMO oil yeasts in a secondary fermentation process. This process addresses the environmental challenges associated with palm oil, such as deforestation and biodiversity loss, by providing a sustainable alternative.

The collaboration between LanzaTech, Fraunhofer IGB, and Mibelle Group marks a significant milestone in the cosmetics industry, as the palm oil substitute replicates essential functional properties needed. The development also introduces a novel route to the HEFA pathway for SAF production, circumventing the sustainability and supply challenges currently present with conventional oil crops and waste oils.

The Environmental Challenge and the Innovative Solution

Palm oil is a critical raw material due to its high yield, long shelf life, and heat resistance. However, the global dependency on palm oil has resulted in extensive deforestation, biodiversity loss, and significant CO₂ emissions, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable alternatives. LanzaTech's technology addresses this challenge by transforming waste CO₂ gases into a palm oil substitute, reducing the environmental impact associated with palm oil production.

Addressing Aviation's Decarbonization Challenge

Alcohol from the LanzaTech process is already an ideal feedstock for SAF production. Via the Alcohol to Jet Process, LanzaTech’s technology enables the production of advanced sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and when the ethanol is made from CO₂ and green hydrogen, e-fuels. The versatility of LanzaTech's technology could potentially now extend into another route to SAF, namely the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway: transforming ethanol into synthetic oils that function as alternatives to conventional HEFA feedstocks.

This innovation advances LanzaTech’s position at the forefront of the rapidly expanding SAF market, offering airlines and fuel producers a new tool in their decarbonization arsenal while demonstrating how circular carbon solutions can transform entire industries.

With mounting global pressure to reduce carbon emissions, developing and scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production has become increasingly urgent. SAF, a fully certified jet fuel made from nonpetroleum feedstocks, can be used in existing aircraft engines and transported via current infrastructure, making it a vital tool for aviation decarbonization. However, the success of SAF depends not only on its usage but also on the methods used in its production.

Today’s Standards and Challenges

ASTM International plays a crucial role in ensuring the credibility and reliability of SAF production methods. Its approval of eight fully synthetic SAF production pathways provides the foundation for the industry's sustainability efforts. These pathways can utilize various renewable feedstocks, including used cooking oil, municipal solid waste, woody biomass and ethanol, each converting materials to jet fuel through specific chemical processes using heat, water and hydrogen. Each pathway has different feedstock requirements, capital costs and carbon reduction potentials. Further, each pathway has different limitations on the blending ratio with conventional jet fuel (5%-50%).

The most commercially mature pathway is hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), which starts with oils, fats or greases and converts that material to jet fuel by treating it with hydrogen (hydroprocessing). The Fischer-Tropsch (FT) method converts solid biomass or waste into syngas and then into liquid fuels. Alcohols derived from biomass fermentation (e.g., ethanol or butanol) or from chemical transformations (e.g,. methanol) can be converted into jet fuel through dehydration and oligomerization for the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathways. HEFA, FT and ATJ pathways, each approved for 50% blending with conventional jet fuel, represent the most promising options for significant carbon intensity reductions.

SAF demand is projected to increase tenfold by 2030, reaching over 7 billion gallons annually. However, this will still only represent about 5% of global jet fuel demand, indicating significant room for growth. While HEFA currently dominates the market with a 95% share due to relatively low deployment costs, it faces mounting feedstock availability challenges.

The U.S. produced 23 million tons of HEFA feedstock in 2024, with soybean oil making up 57% of the domestic supply. Used cooking oil remains limited by small-scale collection, while animal fats are concentrated in states like Nebraska, Texas and Iowa. Transporting these feedstocks to facilities, especially in western states like California, can raise carbon intensity scores and logistics costs, further straining scalability. These challenges, combined with HEFA SAF’s premium price—already two to four times higher than conventional jet fuel—underscore concerns about its long-term viability and highlight the need to diversify SAF pathways for sustainable growth.

Turning Waste into Wings

Fuel producers are actively exploring alternative pathways with more abundant feedstocks to meet the growing demand for SAF. FT pathways, particularly waste gasification, show significant promise by using abundant, low-cost feedstocks like municipal, agricultural and forest waste. This conversion of waste into valuable fuel could have a substantial positive impact on both the environment and the aviation industry. However, FT processes remain more expensive than HEFA, primarily due to higher capital costs per unit of production capacity and more complex production processes.

Any plant with this more costly technology must find ways to optimize resource use and maximize output to remain economically viable. A potential opportunity for increased economic stability at these plants lies in the byproduct. FT plants making SAF will produce up to 20% byproduct of renewable naphtha or liquid petroleum gas (LPG). While these materials can reduce carbon intensity in fossil fuels or as chemical feedstocks, their economic value falls short of SAF. Additionally, FT plants that process gasified waste are often located far from potential buyers of naphtha or LPG, further complicating their monetization.

Biofuel engineers are making notable progress in increasing the economic viability of FT by finding new opportunities for its low-value byproducts. Emerging technologies for renewable naphtha include using it for an integrated hydrogen unit that turns renewable feed sources into hydrogen with low greenhouse gas emissions. One add-on chemical process can upgrade renewable naphtha and LPG into aromatic SAF, a molecule type that FT does not make but is needed in jet fuel. Both the HEFA and FT pathways only produce paraffinic SAF. A way to produce this type of molecule from a low-value byproduct would unlock the economic viability of distributed FT and HEFA plants, enabling their widespread adoption.

Adding the Aromatics

Conventional jet fuel contains both paraffinic and aromatic molecules. The aromatics are ring-shaped molecules necessary for the fuel’s physical properties. ASTM standards require that finished jet fuels contain between 8% and 25% aromatics. Currently, only a 50% blend of FT SAF with conventional jet fuel is approved by ASTM, so fossil jet fuel provides the aromatics for these blends. However, ASTM and the industry are moving toward higher SAF blends—eventually to 100% drop-in synthetic SAF—where no blending with fossil jet is required. Processors will face a critical challenge in finding a source for the aromatics. This is crucial to ensure that their fuel will not require continued blending with fossil fuels, highlighting a key challenge in the future of SAF production.

Even before the 100% SAF becomes a reality, a producer that can offer a fully fungible product like drop-in SAF with a molecular composition matching that of a fossil jet fuel would be able to use common carrier pipelines and fuel storage facilities, saving costs and making it easier for the airports and airlines to use their product.

A significant way to decrease the cost-per-unit of FT SAF and increase the technology's economic viability is to increase the value of the byproducts. With 20% of the plant's output transformed from low-value naphtha and LPG to high-value aromatic SAF, this technology increases the plants revenue by anywhere from 10% to 20%. Including this add-on technology would make the FT plant a better investment, produce more cost-competitive SAF with conventional fuels, and enable a fully synthetic, 100% drop-in-ready product that can be sold directly to airlines without blending, once ASTM-approved.

Setting a New Standard

SAF is a crucial element in aviation's mission to reduce carbon emissions, offering a scalable solution that works with existing infrastructure while addressing waste management challenges. Meeting the International Air Transport Association's net-zero emissions goal by 2050 will require substantial investments in SAF technologies and infrastructure, with estimates suggesting investments in the hundreds of billions of dollars across the supply chain.

The pathway to sustainable aviation involves multiple parallel approaches. While HEFA technology has paved the way for initial SAF adoption, the industry must diversify its production methods to meet future demand. FT pathways, despite challenges in initial capital costs and waste management integration, offer auspicious opportunities. By optimizing byproduct utilization and effectively processing solid waste, this technology addresses multiple environmental challenges simultaneously: reducing aviation emissions, managing municipal waste and decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.

As the industry continues to evolve, integrating waste-to-fuel technologies with existing infrastructure and developing new processing capabilities will be crucial. These advancements will not only support aviation's sustainability goals but also contribute to a broader circular economy, where waste materials become valuable resources. With continued investment in research, development and scaling of these technologies, the aviation industry can work toward a future where sustainable fuel is not just an alternative, but a new standard.

Also known as liquefied biomethane, bio-LNG is a biofuel made from biogas through a process called anaerobic digestion, which can potentially replace fossil fuel-derived LNG.

BBGI plans to make bio-LNG from wastewater and solid waste from its ethanol production plants in Kanchanaburi and Khon Kaen provinces, said chief executive and president Daechapon Lersuwanaroj.

A process to produce ethanol and methyl ester, two key biofuels used to blend with gasohol and diesel respectively, results in wastewater. The company wants to upcycle the unwanted water, making it an alternative fuel.

“This marks a significant step towards advancing the use of renewable energy from wastewater,” said Mr Daechapon.

BBGI is cooperating on the bio-LNG production project with Singapore-based Keppel, a global asset manager and operator, and CleanEdge Resource, which specialises in industrial wastewater treatment and waste-to-energy plant development.

BBGI initially intended to supply bio-LNG to ships operated by Keppel, but later decided to adjust the plan by providing it for power generation because changing ship fuels is time-consuming, as vessels must replace their engine technology.

LNG, heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil are widely used by ships, but these fuels emit more carbon dioxide than bio-LNG.

According to Mr Daechapon, the bio-LNG factory is scheduled to start operations in 2027 and is designed to have a production capacity of 100 tonnes a day.

Operators of data centres, which require a huge amount of electricity, are also interested in bio-LNG as a renewable source of cleaner energy, he said.

In another development, BBGI on Tuesday signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives for a joint study on the use of algae to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a biofuel for aircraft.

Competitive Positioning: Boeing vs. Airbus While Boeing's 737 MAX has gained traction, Airbus's A320neo family remains a formidable competitor.
Certification delays for the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants, now expected in 2026, could disrupt delivery schedules.
Investment Implications For investors, Boeing's 737 MAX order represents more than a short-term win—it signals a sustainable recovery anchored in operational discipline and market demand.","The recent 30-aircraft order for Boeing's 737 MAX from Macquarie AirFinance, the aircraft leasing arm of Australia's Macquarie Group, has reignited discussions about Boeing's operational resilience and its ability to capitalize on long-term demand in commercial aviation. This deal, which expands Macquarie AirFinance's 737 MAX order book to 70 aircraft, underscores a critical shift in market sentiment. For investors, the question is no longer whether Boeing can recover from its post-2019 grounding crisis but how it will sustain its momentum in a competitive landscape dominated by Airbus's A320neo family.

Operational Resilience: A New Benchmark for Boeing

The 737 MAX order reflects renewed confidence in Boeing's production capabilities. Deliveries for the 70-aircraft order are scheduled through 2032, a timeline that aligns with Boeing's stated goal of scaling up production to 52 aircraft per month by 2030. This long-term delivery schedule is a testament to Boeing's ability to stabilize its supply chain and address quality control issues that plagued the program in recent years.

Key to this recovery is Boeing's strategic realignment, including the acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems, a major supplier of 737 MAX fuselages. This move has reduced bottlenecks in critical components and provided greater control over production timelines. Additionally, Boeing's adoption of real-time data analytics for inventory management has mitigated the “bullwhip effect” in its supply chain, ensuring smoother operations.

Financial metrics further support this narrative. Boeing's stock has surged 32.12% year-to-date in 2025, reflecting investor optimism. The company's cash reserves of $23 billion and a 63% reduction in second-quarter losses compared to 2024 signal improved fiscal discipline. Analysts project adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to reach $11.92 by 2029, driven by the 737 MAX's dominance in the single-aisle market.

Long-Term Demand: The 737 MAX as a Fleet Modernization Engine

The 737 MAX's 20% reduction in fuel use and carbon emissions compared to older models positions it as a linchpin for global fleet modernization. Boeing's 2025 Commercial Market Outlook forecasts a need for 33,000 new single-aisle aircraft over the next two decades, with the 737 MAX family expected to capture a significant share.

Macquarie AirFinance's CEO, Eamonn Bane, emphasized the 737 MAX's role in enabling sustainable and cost-effective aviation solutions. This aligns with broader industry trends: airlines and lessors are prioritizing fuel efficiency and environmental compliance, particularly as carbon offset regulations tighten. The 737 MAX's versatility—capable of carrying up to 210 passengers and operating on routes up to 3,500 nautical miles—makes it a strategic asset for both short- and medium-haul operations.

Competitive Positioning: Boeing vs. Airbus

While Boeing's 737 MAX has gained traction, Airbus's A320neo family remains a formidable competitor. In July 2025, the A320neo family recorded only three orders, but its backlog of 7,128 aircraft (as of July 2025) reflects its entrenched market position. The A321neo variant, in particular, has attracted 214 orders in 2025, driven by its extended range and larger capacity.

However, Boeing's recent order momentum—30 737 MAX orders in July 2025, compared to the A320neo's three—suggests a narrowing gap. Airbus's production rate of 38 aircraft per month (matching Boeing's current output) is expected to increase to 75 units by 2027, but supply chain constraints and engine shortages may delay this target. Boeing's focus on incremental production increases (42 units by late 2025, 47 by year-end) appears more aligned with current demand and supplier readiness.

Risks and Opportunities

Despite Boeing's progress, challenges persist. Certification delays for the 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants, now expected in 2026, could disrupt delivery schedules. Additionally, labor disputes in Boeing's defense unit and global supply chain volatility remain risks.

Yet, Boeing's strategic partnerships—such as its expansion into the Asia-Pacific market and investments in sustainable aviation fuel—position it to capitalize on long-term trends. The company's collaboration with airlines like United and Delta, which now report improved transparency and delivery predictability, further strengthens its credibility.

Investment Implications

For investors, Boeing's 737 MAX order represents more than a short-term win—it signals a sustainable recovery anchored in operational discipline and market demand. The aircraft's role in fleet modernization, combined with Boeing's financial stability and production scalability, makes it a compelling long-term play.

However, caution is warranted. The 737 MAX's success hinges on maintaining production stability and navigating regulatory hurdles. Investors should monitor Boeing's ability to meet its 52-unit-per-month target by 2030 and its progress in securing certifications for newer variants.

In conclusion, Boeing's strategic turnaround is gaining traction, but its sustainability will depend on its ability to outpace Airbus in innovation and execution. For now, the 737 MAX order from Macquarie AirFinance is a strong indicator that Boeing is not just recovering—it is redefining its competitive edge in the post-pandemic aviation era.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-09-02 11:57:00.760610

The plan involves creating a multinational company that would tackle a common environmental challenge while helping airlines meet international targets to cut emissions, reports Noticias Ambientales.

Under guidelines from the International Civil Aviation Organization, airlines must begin decarbonizing operations in 2027. Officials see sargassum as a promising raw material for sustainable aviation fuel, part of Mexico’s push toward a circular and low-carbon economy. The initiative is being driven by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat).

Currently, sustainable aviation fuel costs more than triple the price of conventional jet fuel. To close that gap, the state-owned Airports and Auxiliary Services (ASA) has announced a multimillion-dollar expansion of its Cancun plant, which produces biofuel from waste oil and could eventually process sargassum.

The plan would turn one of the Caribbean’s most troublesome macroalgae into an energy source. Each year, massive quantities of sargassum blanket beaches across the region, harming ecosystems, damaging tourism, and creating health risks.

Experts, however, caution that fuel production alone will not solve the problem. They argue that broader policies are needed, including safer collection methods, more research into the algae’s life cycle, and strategies that balance environmental protection with the well-being of coastal communities.

In Quintana Roo, sargassum has already disrupted marine habitats, killing fish, turtles, and corals by blocking oxygen in the water and releasing toxins as it decomposes. Its buildup also threatens human health, as workers who manually clear beaches face exposure to harmful gases.

Tourism, the state’s economic lifeline, is heavily impacted as hotels and local authorities spend millions each season on beach cleanup. The worsening influx of sargassum, fueled by climate change and ocean pollution, has led to repeated calls for a national emergency declaration to ensure federal resources and coordinated action.

Without structural measures, experts warn, the growing tide of sargassum will continue to place severe pressure on ecosystems and coastal communities.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-5.png,N,,2025-09-02 11:57:47.749623

The Environmental Challenge and the Innovative Solution

Palm oil is a critical raw material due to its high yield, long shelf life, and heat resistance. However, the global dependency on palm oil has resulted in extensive deforestation, biodiversity loss, and significant CO₂ emissions, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable alternatives.

The unique dual fermentation technology, pioneered by LanzaTech and Fraunhofer IGB, transforms waste CO2 gases into alcohol and further into a palm oil-like fat using non-GMO oil yeasts in a secondary fermentation process. Following successful laboratory trials at Fraunhofer IGB and promising application tests at Mibelle laboratories, efforts are now focused on scaling up production. This process is currently underway at Fraunhofer’s Center for Chemical-Biotechnological Processes in Leuna, representing a crucial step toward commercial production.

Addressing Aviation's Decarbonization Challenge

Alcohol from the LanzaTech process is already an ideal feedstock for SAF production. Via the Alcohol to Jet Process, LanzaTech’s technology enables the production of advanced sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and when the ethanol is made from CO₂ and green hydrogen, e-fuels.

The versatility of LanzaTech's technology could potentially now extend into another route to SAF, namely the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway: transforming ethanol into synthetic oils that function as alternatives to conventional HEFA feedstocks.

This innovation advances LanzaTech’s position at the forefront of the rapidly expanding SAF market, offering airlines and fuel producers a new tool in their decarbonization arsenal while demonstrating how circular carbon solutions can transform entire industries.

In Singapore, CUB partnered with leading renewable energy company Apeiron Bioenergy at the end of 2023 to launch its first green trade finance facility. The full loan amount was dedicated to supporting the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), demonstrating CUB’s concrete actions in the clean energy sector.

In Vietnam, CUB structured several green loan initiatives, including green building financing for ICT sector companies, participation in a syndicated loan for VP Bank (with at least 50% of proceeds allocated to green or social projects), and sustainable financing for public water utilities and wind power development—highlighting its impact across diverse industries.

Further reinforcing its commitment to green corporate finance in the region, CUB hosted the “ESG: Challenges and Practices in Sustainable Development” forum on Earth Day 2025 in Vietnam. The event gathered over 80 industry leaders to explore global and local ESG trends and challenges. The forum showcased CUB’s 20-year presence in Vietnam and its role as a key partner in corporate sustainability transformation. During the event, CUB introduced its “Cathay One” one-stop transition finance platform, designed to help enterprises conduct carbon inventories, formulate decarbonization strategies, and access green financing—enhancing their resilience and competitiveness in the face of climate risks.

These achievements build on CUB’s milestone in 2022, when it became the first Taiwanese bank to sign a sustainability-linked loan in the Philippines, underscoring its determination and action in promoting green finance across Southeast Asia.

Leading ESG Disclosure in Asia’s Financial Sector

CUB is the first commercial bank in Asia to participate in CDP’s Corporate Banking Programme, helping corporates systematically assess carbon emissions, climate risk management, decarbonization targets, and governance frameworks to meet growing transparency demands from global investors and supply chains. In 2024, CUB further distinguished itself as the only Asian bank invited to join CDP’s SME Technical Working Group.Through this opportunity, CUB provided insights and advice that helped shaped CDP’s approach to SMEs, including the development of the SME questionnaire.

After the launch of the SME questionnaire in 2024, CUB invited over 150 companies to participate in the programme. Through the joint efforts of participating enterprises, CDP experts, and CUB colleagues, a total of 121 companies completed the questionnaire and received CDP scores—resulting in a response rate of over 80%, significantly higher than the global supply chain average of around 66%. Notably, 110 of these companies were first-time participants.

Growing regional reach

“We are committed to building a sustainable financial ecosystem and working with corporate partners to achieve clean energy and climate action goals,” said Michael Wen, Executive Vice President from CUB. CUB will continue to leverage its financial capabilities and regional influence to drive sustainable development across Asia.",https://s44650.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/In-conversation-with-14-copy.png,N,,2025-09-02 11:58:08.545887

This tri-partnership showcases how shippers, forwarders, and airlines can jointly drive sustainable logistics and accelerate aviation decarbonisation.

In a significant step toward sustainable logistics, Swiss-based Belimo Automation AG, a global leader in HVAC field devices, has partnered with Swiss companies Lamprecht Transport and Swiss WorldCargo to reduce carbon emissions on international air freight shipments. By investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the initiative will mitigate approximately 650 tons of CO₂e emissions in its first year of operation, with the ambition to further increase the percentage of SAF used in subsequent years – marking a tangible contribution to the decarbonization of air cargo.

This partnership represents a best-practice example of a tri-partite collaboration between a shipper, freight forwarder, and airline’s cargo division. It demonstrates how collective action can drive meaningful progress on the path to more sustainable freight transport.

“At Belimo, sustainability is an integral part of our corporate strategy,” says John Muncey, Head of Group Transportation at Belimo. “This investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is not just about reducing emissions — it’s about taking direct responsibility for our environmental impact and working with our trusted partners to drive meaningful change”.

Lamprecht Transport coordinated the logistics, while Swiss WorldCargo facilitated the SAF integration within its cargo operations. The SAF used in this collaboration is certified and contributes to an immediate reduction in lifecycle emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

“We are proud to be part of this joint effort,” says Gieri Hinnen, Head of Global Sales at Swiss WorldCargo. “By working hand in hand with like-minded partners, we’re taking concrete steps toward our shared ambition of more sustainable air logistics.”

This initiative reinforces the importance of supply chain collaboration and supports broader industry goals to accelerate the use of SAF and reduce the climate impact of aviation.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SAF-One_Kent_Partnership-min-scaled-1-1080x552.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 11:58:13.989070

The text would keep kerosene for intra-EU flights and bunker fuels for shipping within long-standing EU tax exemptions until at least 2035, in an effort to complete the overhaul of the Energy Taxation Directive first proposed in 2021.
Before the 10-year period ends, only small aircraft with a maximum of 19 seats and boats classified as “private pleasure craft” would face minimum EU taxes, according to the draft.
Any agreement on the Energy Taxation Directive requires unanimous approval from all 27 EU countries.
Supporters of the exemption argue that taxation alone may shift traffic without cutting emissions, while environmental groups say exemptions weaken price signals and reduce potential revenues from pricing aviation emissions.","EU governments are considering a 10-year delay to introducing bloc-wide minimum excise taxes on aviation and maritime fuels, according to a draft compromise circulated under Denmark’s rotating presidency.

The text would keep kerosene for intra-EU flights and bunker fuels for shipping within long-standing EU tax exemptions until at least 2035, in an effort to complete the overhaul of the Energy Taxation Directive first proposed in 2021.

The draft states: “In 2035, the Commission should examine the possibility of taxation of air navigation and waterborne navigation and propose amendments to this Directive, where appropriate,” and says the extended exemption is intended “to maintain the competitive position of Union companies.”

Negotiators from member states are due to discuss the proposal in Brussels on Friday, with the presidency aiming for a deal in November.

Before the 10-year period ends, only small aircraft with a maximum of 19 seats and boats classified as “private pleasure craft” would face minimum EU taxes, according to the draft. Any agreement on the Energy Taxation Directive requires unanimous approval from all 27 EU countries.

The European Commission’s 2021 proposal sought to align energy taxation with climate goals by phasing out fossil-fuel exemptions and taxing the most polluting fuels at higher minimum rates; Parliament is consultative on tax files while the Council decides by unanimity. The draft also points to implications for companies already navigating other rules.

In aviation, ReFuelEU Aviation requires a 2% share of sustainable aviation fuel in 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and 20% by 2035; carriers including Lufthansa have introduced environmental surcharges of roughly €1–€72 per ticket depending on route and cabin; IATA has estimated about $1.2 billion in SAF purchases in 2025 to meet mandates.

In shipping, the sector entered the EU Emissions Trading System on 1 January 2024 with surrender obligations phased in at 40% for 2024 emissions payable in 2025, 70% for 2025 and 100% from 2026; carriers including Maersk have implemented ETS-linked surcharges; FuelEU Maritime started in 2025 with a requirement to reduce the greenhouse-gas intensity of marine energy starting at 2% in 2025 and scaling up through 2050.
