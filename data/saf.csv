This article explores how airlines, governments, and innovators are accelerating the shift to cleaner skies.

Why Biofuels Matter in Aviation

Aviation currently accounts for about 2% of global CO₂ emissions, and airlines face growing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Biofuels — particularly Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) made from renewable sources — can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional kerosene jet fuel (AFDC, 2024). This emissions reduction is a key driver behind SAF adoption.

The international aviation sector has set an aspirational goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2050, with SAF widely viewed as the best near-term solution. Airlines also see biofuels as a hedge against oil price volatility and supply disruptions. As Delta’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Amelia DeLuca, put it: “SAF is the best-known lever we have to decarbonize aviation… we need as much SAF as we can get” (CARB, 2024).

In addition, SAF enhances brand reputation — helping airlines attract environmentally conscious travelers while signaling climate leadership to investors and regulators alike.

As SAF moves from early adoption to global momentum, several key trends are emerging across the aviation industry. From airline strategies and policy mandates to technological breakthroughs, these developments are shaping the future of biofuels in the aviation industry. The following five trends reveal how the sector is moving from ambition to implementation.

1. Airline commitments to biofuels in the aviation industry

Airlines across the globe have announced bold commitments to incorporate biofuels in their operations. Many see SAF as crucial for meeting industry climate targets (like the IATA pledge for net zero by 2050) and government mandates.

For example:

Delta & Southwest: Have publicly committed to replacing 10% of their jet fuel with SAF by 2030.

Oneworld Alliance (including American Airlines, British Airways, and Qantas): Collective 10% SAF target by 2030.

United Airlines: Leads the U.S. market with multiple SAF investments and off-take agreements, including a $200 million fund dedicated to SAF innovation.

KLM & Lufthansa: Pioneers in SAF adoption, with regular SAF use on select routes and long-term supply agreements.

These biofuel commitments aren’t just PR—many airlines are signing multi-year purchase deals with SAF producers (e.g., Delta with Gevo, Singapore Airlines with Neste). As of 2023, over 360,000 commercial flights have flown using SAF blends. That number is expected to grow exponentially as production ramps up.

Early adoption of biofuels also boosts an airline’s brand image among eco-conscious travelers, demonstrating leadership and innovation in climate strategy.

See Top 5 Advanced Biofuel Companies for key players behind these shifts.

2. The cost & scalability challenges of biofuels in the aviation industry

Despite growing momentum, cost and supply remain major hurdles to widespread SAF adoption. Currently, SAF is significantly more expensive than conventional Jet A fuel. According to industry reports, U.S. jet fuel averages around $2.85 per gallon, while SAF can range from $4.00 to $7.00 per gallon or more—often 2–5 times the price.

This price premium, or “green premium,” reflects high production costs, limited refining capacity, and expensive feedstocks. While SAF can deliver substantial emissions reductions, the economics still make large-scale adoption challenging for airlines operating on thin margins.

In 2022, SAF accounted for only about 0.1% of total jet fuel used in the U.S. The Biden administration’s SAF Grand Challenge aims to scale annual production to 3 billion gallons by 2030, a dramatic increase from roughly 16 million gallons produced in 2021. But even with aggressive investment, projections suggest the U.S. might reach only ~2.1 billion gallons without further policy and capital support.

“A lot of additional investment is needed to hit that target” – Gordon McManus

Meanwhile, producers are working to improve conversion efficiency, build larger refineries, and explore cheaper feedstocks such as municipal waste and used cooking oil. Many SAF pathways are also beginning to benefit from learning-curve effects, with the expectation that costs will decline as technology scales.

3. Government policies supporting biofuels in the aviation industry

Government support is one of the most important accelerators for sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is still in its early days, and clear policies can make the difference between pilot programs and industry-wide transformation.

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) introduced a blender’s tax credit for SAF of up to $1.75 per gallon, depending on lifecycle carbon intensity. This helps narrow the price gap with fossil jet fuel. Additional federal incentives, grants, and Department of Energy (DOE) funding have supported new SAF projects and refineries.

California provides further support through its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which offers SAF producers credits that can be sold to emitters, creating a direct financial reward for low-carbon fuel use at airports like LAX and SFO.

The European Union has taken a more regulatory approach. The ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates a minimum of 2% SAF blending by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050. The regulation also requires e-fuels (made from green hydrogen and CO₂) to account for at least 2% by 2030, signaling a strong push toward synthetic fuels.

Other countries are also stepping up. Singapore has announced plans for SAF blending mandates by 2026, Japan has a 10% SAF goal by 2030, and Australia is funding domestic SAF production. Globally, the CORSIA scheme from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sets emission caps and encourages airlines to adopt offsets or cleaner fuels.

As more governments implement mandates and incentives, they create stable demand signals that encourage investment and innovation across the SAF supply chain.

See The Pros and Cons of Advanced Biofuels for more context.

4. Can biofuels in the aviation industry replace kerosene?

Many stakeholders are asking the big question: Can SAF and other aviation biofuels fully replace fossil jet fuel?

While the answer is “not entirely”—at least not soon—there’s strong evidence that SAF can replace a substantial portion of aviation fuel over the next two to three decades. According to IATA, SAF could deliver up to 65% of the CO₂ reductions needed for the sector to hit net zero by 2050.

However, aviation demand is projected to grow significantly in that timeframe. This means that SAF will need to expand at an extraordinary pace to maintain or reduce emissions.

Short-haul flights may gradually transition to electric or hydrogen propulsion, but medium and long-haul flights, representing the majority of emissions, are expected to rely heavily on SAF.

Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels, made from renewable electricity, hydrogen, and captured CO₂, are another piece of the puzzle. These can be blended with SAF or used as standalone fuels. The EU’s e-fuel mandate is already pushing this segment forward.

Blending levels are expected to increase: from today’s 1–2% SAF on most commercial routes, to 10–20% by the early 2030s, and 50% or more in the 2040s. Some pioneering flights have already flown on 100% SAF in test conditions, proving that the technology works even if it’s not yet widespread.

The consensus is that SAF will be the primary solution for decarbonizing long-distance air travel, but it must be paired with continued R&D, infrastructure investment, and supportive policy.

5. Innovation on the horizon for biofuels in the aviation industry

Although SAF is already viable today, the next generation of technologies and feedstocks will be essential for making it cost-effective, scalable, and truly sustainable. Here’s what’s coming:

Algae-Based Fuels: Algae can produce far more oil per acre than traditional crops, grow in brackish or saltwater, and don’t compete with food production. Companies are racing to commercialize algae as a low-impact SAF feedstock.

Municipal Waste & Captured Carbon: SAF is now being developed from household garbage and even direct air capture (DAC) CO₂ streams. These ultra-low-carbon pathways turn trash and emissions into flight-worthy fuel.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Fuels: These synthetic fuels combine green hydrogen with captured CO₂ to create e-kerosene. Already in European pilot production, PtL fuels are expected to scale significantly in the 2030s.

Advanced Catalysts & Refining Tech: R&D is reducing energy input and increasing conversion efficiency, making fuel production faster, cheaper, and less resource-intensive.

New Feedstock Certification: The industry is working on certifying novel feedstocks like halophytic plants (which grow in saltwater) and volatile fatty acids from fermentation. More approved pathways = more flexibility and innovation.

In parallel, engine manufacturers like Rolls-Royce and GE are testing engines that can run on 100% SAF. Some OEMs are even considering aircraft optimized specifically for SAF use in the future.

As innovation continues, the barriers to SAF adoption—cost, feedstock availability, and conversion efficiency—will likely shrink. That means biofuels will play an even more significant role in the future of aviation’s clean energy.

The aviation industry’s journey toward net zero is just beginning—and SAF will be one of the jet engines powering that shift.

Tutti questi Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites ora utilizzano sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per le loro operazioni interne.

Grazie a questo sviluppo, entro la fine del 2025, tutti i clienti Airbus, indipendentemente da dove ricevano il loro aeromobile, potranno farlo con SAF a bordo, gratuitamente. Nel 2024, il 75% delle 766 aircraft deliveries utilizzava un SAF fuel blend e si prevede che questa percentuale aumenterà presto, una volta che le consegne di aeromobili che utilizzano SAF inizieranno a Mirabel più avanti quest’anno.

Il SAF rimane una leva fondamentale per gli obiettivi di decarbonizzazione del settore dell’aviazione. Si prevede che il SAF fornirà la maggior parte delle riduzioni delle emissioni necessarie al settore dell’aviazione per raggiungere il suo obiettivo di emissioni di carbonio nette pari a zero entro il 2050, con l’International Air Transport Association (IATA) che stima che il SAF potrebbe contribuire a circa il 65% della riduzione delle emissioni richiesta. Negli ultimi anni, Airbus ha aumentato la percentuale di SAF utilizzata nelle proprie operazioni al 16%, che include viaggi di lavoro, voli di consegna (in cui un aereo viene consegnato alla base della compagnia aerea acquirente dopo il trasferimento della proprietà) e trasporto di parti di aeromobili tra diversi siti di produzione”.

“Per raggiungere questo obiettivo, Airbus ha firmato accordi con fornitori di SAF come TotalEnergies, che forniscono SAF per le consegne di aeromobili a Tolosa dal 2016. Grazie a una partnership firmata nel 2024, TotalEnergies fornisce più della metà del SAF per soddisfare le esigenze di Airbus in Europa. Abbiamo anche unito le forze con le compagnie aeree. Volotea, che opera un volo Amburgo-Tolosa per i dipendenti Airbus come parte del nostro internal shuttle service, utilizza un SAF blend al 34% su questa rotta dal 2022. Dopo un programma pilota di successo nel 2023, dal 2024 Air France-KLM e Airbus hanno un “SAF fares agreement”, con Airbus che acquista opzioni SAF per i viaggi di lavoro dei dipendenti che collegano Parigi con cinque sedi: Amburgo, Madrid, Marsiglia, Monaco e Tolosa.

Guardando più lontano, nel 2024 Airbus ha lanciato un programma pilota con easyJet, che opera voli sulla rotta Tolosa-Bristol, una rotta popolare per i viaggi di lavoro grazie alla vicinanza ai siti Airbus di Tolosa e Filton. In esecuzione tra novembre 2024 e gennaio 2025, il programma ha visto Airbus finanziare 106 tonnellate di SAF, la quantità equivalente di carburante necessaria per effettuare voli tra Tolosa e Bristol con una SAF blend al 30% durante il periodo.

Nel gennaio 2025, Airbus, Wizz Air, Moeve e Charleroi Airport hanno completato un SAF operational trial. Airbus ha fornito consulenza tecnica e competenza durante il trial, durante la quale Wizz Air ha operato più di 50 voli utilizzando una miscela di SAF e jet fuel tradizionale. Durante questo periodo è stato inoltre completato un sondaggio che ha fatto luce sulla consapevolezza e gli atteggiamenti dei passeggeri nei confronti dell’aviazione a basse emissioni di carbonio, incluso il SAF“, prosegue Airbus.

“Sebbene la quantità di SAF disponibile sia aumentata negli ultimi anni, la domanda rimane sotto pressione a causa del costo più elevato del SAF rispetto al cherosene, 2,8 volte in base agli European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. Il settore deve affrontare questa disparità e ridurre il divario di prezzo con il fuel tradizionale.

Sebbene Airbus non sia un produttore di SAF, può svolgere un ruolo. Oltre a integrare l’uso del SAF nelle proprie operazioni, Airbus investe e collabora con i partner per ampliare l’ecosistema SAF. Nel 2024, Airbus ha investito in SAFFA, il Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund. SAFFA si concentra su SAF idoneo per la certificazione RefuelEU Aviation o CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), sebbene gli investimenti possano avvenire in diversi percorsi di produzione e regioni. Il primo investimento di SAFFA in Crysalis Biosciences, con sede negli Stati Uniti, aiuterà l’azienda a produrre SAF e prodotti biochimici a bassa intensità di carbonio.

Nel 2024, Airbus ha anche investito nella sustainable aviation fuels producer and technology company LanzaJet. L’investimento di Airbus supporta LanzaJet nell’ampliamento del suo SAF production process che utilizza etanolo, noto come Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway. LanzaJet ha recentemente aperto un nuovo impianto SAF a Soperton, in Georgia, con la capacità di produrre 9 milioni di galloni di SAF ogni anno.

Guardando al futuro, Airbus prevede di continuare ad aumentare l’uso di SAF nelle proprie operazioni, con l’obiettivo di utilizzare almeno il 30% di SAF nel suo global fuel mix entro il 2030″, conclude Airbus.

Owning a Gulfstream G650 or a Bombardier Global 7500, ultra-long-haul private jets capable of flying from pretty much anywhere on Earth to pretty much anywhere else (with extremely limited exceptions), may seem like the ultimate status symbol. For the most part, this is true, as these jets are lavish, with massive cabins that can be configured in several different ways.

Get all the latest aviation news from Simple Flying!

However, for those looking for a private jet that will undoubtedly go above and beyond, one which will offer exceptional performance and unparalleled range, all while providing passengers with a cabin that is significantly larger than even that of a Gulfstream or Bombardier private jet. Even the largest, most lavish purpose-built private jets fall short of the capabilities, comfort, and flexibility that can be offered by a commercial aircraft that has been converted to serve an executive role.

While the market for such aircraft is actually extremely small, there are still a few buyers interested in exactly this kind of purchase. We are speaking, of course, about Boeing Business Jets (BBJs) and Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJs), both of which offer passengers an exceptional passenger experience. These aircraft offer unbelievable amounts of space for passengers, providing exceptional passenger comfort. As a result of their unbelievable size, however, these jets are almost always the most expensive private jets on the market.

For about a decade now, the ultimate prize in the world of private jets has undoubtedly been the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is the most capable private aircraft to ever hit the market. With unprecedented range and game-changing efficiency, the Boeing 787 has fundamentally changed the commercial aviation industry and, at the same time, it offers private jet operators the most technologically advanced platform for their transport solutions. In this article, we will take a deeper look at the Boeing 787 private jet, and what makes this VIP aircraft so impressive.

A deeper look at Boeing Business Jets

Before diving deeper into the Boeing 787 business jet itself, it is important to understand what exactly a Boeing Business Jet is. These aircraft play a smaller role in the world of private aviation, but they are some of the most lavish to have ever entered the skies. By definition, a Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) is a private, corporate, or other VIP-configured aircraft modified from Boeing's popular series of commercial airliner models, with modifications made to offer passengers a luxury experience, extended range, and executive transport.

The BBJ brand was launched back in 1996 as a collaboration between Boeing and industrial conglomerate General Electric. The first BBJ model was rolled out in 1998, and it was a modified Boeing 737-700 model. Since the introduction of this model, Boeing has introduced BBJ variants of all the following aircraft:

Boeing 737 MAX

Boeing 777

Boeing 777X

Boeing 747-8

Boeing 787 Dreamliner

Boeing Business Jets offer spacious interiors that can be customized by their customers. These can be efficiently tailed for VIP transportation, government leaders, or even corporate offices, as the cabin can be configured to serve as a boardroom with offices. The aircraft's interior can be modified to include everything from conference rooms, lounges, master bedrooms with shower suites, and high-tech living spaces. The aircraft has an advanced cabin pressurization system which is designed to improve passenger well-being and provide a more comfortable flight experience, by pressurizing the cabin to a significantly lower cabin altitude.

One of the key selling points of Boeing Business Jet variants is that they offer extended-range capabilities and exceptional performance. These BBJ variants have larger fuel tanks and reinforced wings and landing gear, which allow them to handle the additional weight required for ultra-long-haul operations. The reinforced landing gear also allows Boeing Business Jets to handle the stresses of high-frequency operation, ensuring that they have a longer service life.

The Boeing Business Jet 737 MAX 7, for example, is set to have an extended range of 6,600 nautical miles, far beyond that of a commercially configured 737 MAX 7 that would be loaded up with passengers. An even more drastic example of this is true of the Boeing Business Jet 777X, which will be able to fly up to 11,800 nautical miles, making it one of the longest-range aircraft to ever enter the business aviation market. This allows the BBJ 777X to fly pretty much all the way around the world without stopping, making it ideal for high-profile executive travelers demanding operational flexibility.

Boeing Business Jets also offer a range of efficiency-oriented and operational benefits, primarily stemming from the historical reliability and efficiency of Boeing's proven commercial aircraft. With operating costs ranging from between $5,200 to $5,600 per flight hour, these aircraft offer significantly lower operating costs than many other business aircraft. These planes also benefit from the exceptional reliability that Boeing has historically been known for, with aircraft being subject to low-maintenance schedules, something which makes them ideal for long-term ownership.

A look at the different Boeing Business Jet series

The Boeing 737 MAX family offers an impressive balance of range and efficiency for operators, with three models (the BBJ 737-7, the BBJ 737-8, and the BBJ 737-9) all on offer. These aircraft all feature retractable airstairs, high-thrust engines, and custom-designed interiors.

The manufacturer does also offer a series of widebody Boeing Business Jets, the final of which will be the subject of this analysis. The Boeing 747-8 BBJ is the largest business jet ever made, and it offers passengers more than 4,700 square feet of cabin space. The Boeing 777X BBJ variants, as previously mentioned, will offer unheard-of range capabilities that could fundamentally change private aviation. The Boeing 787 BBJ, which offers a composite airframe and exceptional operational efficiency, offers a range of 9,960 nautical miles, according to the manufacturer.

As a result of these impressive capabilities, the Boeing 787 business jet has become popular with Fortune 500 companies, billionaires, and investment firms, as well as some high-net-worth owners. Other customers for this business jet include governments and heads of state, especially those from the Middle East.

How lavish is the Boeing 787 business jet?

The Boeing 787 BBJ is undeniably one of the most luxurious and spacious private jets to hit the market. Every feature of this game-changing aircraft has been exquisitely designed to provide passengers with unparalleled comfort, an unbeatable sense of exclusivity, and long-range travel capabilities. Featuring a cabin that is a full 18 feet wide, the aircraft offers an unparalleled sense of space in comparison to most traditional business jets, which are known for more cramped interiors. This flexibility allows customers to create custom interiors tailored to their specific needs.

Unlike the commercial Boeing 787 variants, which are designed to seat a maximum of 242 passengers, the Boeing 787 BBJ offers a maximum capacity of just 40 passengers, meaning it can provide impressive amounts of personal space and comfort. Those who buy the aircraft will receive a ""green"" model, one with no pre-installed interior. After being delivered by the manufacturer, the aircraft will go to a completion center, where owners can modify their aircraft to whatever specifications they would like.

Boeing 787 BBJ owners have been known to install all kinds of different features, including master bedrooms, private en-suite bathrooms, lounges, dining rooms, cabins for guests, and large boardroom-style seating areas. Known for offering an exceptionally quiet cabin, the Boeing 787 BBJ provides an excellent passenger experience, according to Corporate Jet Investor.

The cabin altitude is pressurized to just about 6,000 feet, significantly below the 9,000 that is standard on commercial aircraft. This allows passengers to sleep better and experience reduced fatigue. Today, the Boeing 787 business jet demonstrates an unparalleled level of luxury, typically only available to royals, world leaders, and ultra-wealthy individuals willing to spend lavishly on the best travel experience in the sky.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/main-image-16_9-16-3.png,N,,2025-03-22 13:57:36.714366

The global aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint and meet stringent environmental regulations. Platts has observed growing interest in ETJ SAF since it provides a solution to lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with air travel. The capacity for ETJ SAF is projected to keep growing, driven by rising demand and ongoing investments in production processes.

The ETJ SAF values will reflect ASTM D7566 standard specification, with a relative density of 759.5 kg/cu m (at 15 degrees Celsius), basis USGC. The ETJ SAF values will be published in cents/gal. Platts will publish values with and without environmental credits by deducting the federal SAF tax credit and D4 biomass-based diesel RINs.

The values will reflect a reference Carbon Intensity of 33 gCO2e/MMBtu (31.278 gCO2/Mj).

Platts will calculate the credit by multiplying the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction percentage by the maximum credit price, $1.75/gal. Platts will calculate lifecycle GHG emissions reduction percentage as a fraction, the numerator of which will be the maximum carbon intensity -- 50 kgCO2/MMBTU -- minus the SAF CI of 33 kgCO2/MMBtu, and the denominator of which will be the maximum carbon intensity. The credit will be rounded to the nearest hundredth cent.

(50 - 33)/50 x 175 cents/gal = 59.50 cents/gal

Therefore, the total SAF tax credit Platts will use in its USGC ETJ SAF without credits prices is 59.50 cents/gal.

These calculated values will reflect the cost of SAF produced via the ethanol-to-jet pathway. Feedstock considered will be ethanol from Brazil's sugarcane and Gulf Coast hydrogen; coproducts will include renewable diesel and naphtha/gasoline; and utility costs will include Gulf Coast natural gas and electricity. Platts daily prices for feedstocks, coproducts, and utilities will also be taken into account.

The cost-based values will follow the Platts US publishing schedule. For days when Brazil there is a publishing holiday in Brazil but not in the US, Platts will take the last published Brazil ethanol price.

The launch of the new values was first proposed in a subscriber note published March 6, available here(opens in a new tab).

This impressive range allows the Bombardier Global 7500 to offer passengers the flexibility to fly nonstop between far-flung destinations, such as New York and Hong Kong or Los Angeles and Sydney. This jet currently stands as the longest-range private jet in active service, although its position as the market leader could be set to change in coming years with new market entrants preparing to make their impact on the industry.

American manufacturer Gulfstream, which is a subsidiary of the greater General Dynamics Corporation, offers a range of 7,500 nautical miles on its flagship business jet, the Gulfstream G650ER, according to Aviation Week. This jet, which is known more for its speed (it flies at Mach 0.925) and its lavish interior, has long been a favorite among executive travelers as it offers both efficiency and comfort when connecting long-haul destinations.

Some other aircraft also offer exceptional long-range capabilities

Another major ultra-long-range business aircraft is the Dassault Falcon 8X, which offers an impressive range of 6,450 nautical miles. While this plane is not able to fly to as many destinations as the Bombardier Global 7500 or the Gulfstream G650ER, the Falcon 8X is extremely versatile, and it is designed to access shorter runways, something which makes it ideal for travelers looking for flexibility when it comes to airport selection.

Some smaller aircraft also offer impressive long-range capabilities, with the added benefits of lower operating costs and more flexible operational requirements. Examples of such aircraft include the Cessna Citation X+, which is capable of traveling more than 3,400 nautical miles, and the Embraer Praetor 600, which has a range of 4,000 nautical miles. The aircraft offers exceptional performance for a mid-range aircraft, and it can reach a strong number of international destinations from a base like New York.

At the end of the day, the Bombardier Global 7500 and the Gulfstream G650ER stand out as the most dominant ultra-long-range aircraft, while mid-size flexible jets like the Praetor 600 do offer long-range capabilities in a more compact aircraft. The decision on which aircraft to purchase eventually just comes down to individual preferences. Let's take a deeper look at these extended-range aircraft and their capabilities.

A deeper look at the Bombardier Global 7500

The Bombardier Global 7500, and its upcoming successor, the Global 8000, are the longest-range business jets on the market. These aircraft offer unmatched speed and range capabilities, while also offering an impressive luxury experience. Developed by Canadian manufacturer Bombardier Aviation, the Global 7500 was originally designated as the Global 7000, before its range was extended beyond 7,700 nautical miles. The plane made its first flight in November 2016, and it quickly received certification in September 2018 before entering service in December 2018.

According to Business Jet Traveler, the aircraft featured a clean-sheet design, and it was fitted with a new transonic wing while also being the first business jet to ever be fitted with a four-zone cabin. As a result, the plane was able to offer superior comfort and operational flexibility to passengers. The aircraft's successor, the Bombardier Global 8000, is set to enter service in 2025 and expands upon the 7500's capabilities by offering an extended range of 8,000 nautical miles.

When this aircraft enters service, it will be the longest-range private jet on the market. The aircraft is also set to offer maximum operational speeds of Mach 0.94, which will make it the fastest civilian aircraft to fly since Concorde. While the aircraft was initially planned as a three-zone aircraft, the Bombardier Global 8000 was redesigned in 2022 to match the four-zone cabin offered by the Global 7500, which allowed for more passenger comfort and extended-range capabilities.

The Global 7500 faced serious delays as a result of its wing redesigns, which improved its performance and efficiency. The aircraft shares the same fly-by-wire controls (intriguingly) with the Airbus A220, which was originally designed by the Canadian planemaker. The aircraft features an airframe built out of aluminum-lithium alloys which were designed to reduce weight. The plane underwent extensive flight testing, with the plane logging more than 2,700 hours prior to receiving certification.

A deeper look at the capabilities of the Global 8000

While initially planned as a shortened version of the Bombardier Global 7500, the Global 8000 is set to be a game-changing aircraft, one which will push the limits of aircraft range while also not compromising on cabin space. The plane will be powered by a pair of General Electric Passport 20 engines, which collectively deliver nearly 19,000 pounds of thrust with reduced fuel emissions. The Global 7500 holds numerous speed records, while also having flown some of the longest individual flights in the history of business aviation.

Back in 2019, the aircraft completed an impressive 8,152-nautical mile experimental flight between Singapore and Tucson, which set a record for the longest individual flight flown by a business jet. Another record-breaking flight took place between Sydney and Detroit, which covered a distance of around 8,200 nautical miles.

The Global 7500 has been received well by the market, with more than 200 deliveries logged by December 2024. Notable customers for the aircraft include large-scale private jet charter companies, like NetJets, VistaJet, and Bellawings Jet. Here are some additional specifications for the upcoming Bombardier Global 8000, which is set to become the world's longest-range private jet:

A look at the Gulfstream G650ER

The Gulfstream G650ER, an ultra-long-range business jet intended to offer high-speed capabilities, offers an exceptional combination of luxury and efficiency. Despite being a long-standing favorite of corporate executives and high-net-worth individuals, the aircraft does fall slightly short of the Bombardier Global 7500 in terms of range. Nonetheless, it can still connect some of the world's most far-flung points to each other.

The aircraft offers a range of 7,500 nautical miles when operating at a speed of Mach 0.85, making it one of the longest-range jets on the market. It can still fly between far-flung city pairs, and it does not require refueling. Despite not being the longest-range jet on the market today, it is still important to take a deeper look at the Gulfstream G650ER and its capabilities, as it is an important competitive offering in the industry.

The Gulfstream G650ER extended the range of the earlier Gulfstream G650 by around 500 nautical miles, by adding fuel tanks that allowed for the plane's fuel capacity to be increased by around 4,000 pounds. This enabled passengers to bypass layovers and allowed them to reduce overall travel time, something which made the aircraft extremely marketable. This was especially appealing to corporate customers who wanted extremely efficient business travel solutions.

With a top operational speed of Mach 0.925, the Gulfstream G650ER allows executives to quickly travel across continents, and it minimizes the amount of time they have to spend in transport. The plane's advanced aerodynamics and its Rolls-Royce BR725 engines offer impressive operational efficiency and exceptional performance.

The Gulfstream G650ER's spacious cabin offers four different areas, including private sleeping rooms, a galley, and a state-of-the-art entertainment system. The plane also boasts large elliptical windows which let in large amounts of natural light and panoramic windows. The plane, which is pressurized to a lower cabin altitude of 4,850 feet, reduces passenger fatigue.

The plane can also effectively be used as a mobile office, and corporate leadership teams can configure the cabin in a boardroom-like setting. The ultra-long-range business jet is equipped with high-speed internet, satellite communication capabilities, and unique workspaces. The plane, as a result of this flexibility, has become popular with government and military agencies. The aircraft has become one of the most important business jets on the market, and it is designed for nonstop intercontinental travel, blending the best elements of multiple Gulfstream models that came before it. The plane's game-changing range has made it one of the most sought-after in private aviation.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/artboard-16_9-6-3.jpg,N,,2025-03-22 12:56:16.191206

Airlines are facing ongoing challenges, with hundreds of flights canceled or delayed, aircraft out of position, and crews scattered across Europe.

The chaos began late Thursday night when a fire broke out at the North Hyde electrical substation in Hayes, west London. This facility supplies power to Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest airports. The fire, now under investigation, knocked out critical systems and forced the cancellation of more than 1,300 flights on Friday, affecting an estimated 200,000 passengers.

By Saturday, operations had resumed and Heathrow declared itself “open and fully operational.” But the reality on the ground told a different story. British Airways, the airport’s largest airline, canceled nearly 80 more flights on Saturday. Other airlines have also struggled to return to normal schedules, with many planes, pilots, and cabin crews now stranded at airports they were never meant to be.

Sean Doyle, CEO of British Airways, called the fire “an unprecedented situation” and warned that the disruption would have a “substantial impact on our airline and customers for many days to come.”

The ripple effects have created a logistical nightmare. Aircraft are out of place, and the crews needed to operate them are bound by mandatory rest periods before they can fly again. This mismatch of people and planes has forced further cancellations and reshuffling of routes. Aviation experts say the domino effect could extend into the week ahead.

John Strickland, an aviation consultant, told the UK’s Press Association news agency, “All these long-haul aircraft—particularly BA’s—have ended up at airports they were never supposed to be at. If there are no crews there to pick them up, then airlines will struggle to get their aircraft moving again as normal.”

Heathrow has attempted to ease the strain by adding 50 extra takeoff and landing slots to accommodate up to 10,000 more passengers on Saturday. But for airlines still facing staffing and aircraft shortages, those extra slots offer little relief unless they can be filled.

While the airport’s runway lights and control tower systems remained functional thanks to backup power supplies, the wider electrical outage exposed a serious vulnerability in Heathrow’s infrastructure. The incident has sparked criticism from industry veterans and raised concerns about how a single substation failure could bring such a major airport to a standstill.

Willie Walsh, former head of British Airways and current Director General of IATA, called the outage a “clear planning failure” by Heathrow. Current airport CEO Thomas Woldbye acknowledged that while critical systems had backup power, they were never designed to run the entire airport. He added that the airport would be reviewing whether it needs a more robust standby power solution in the future.

National Grid, which owns and operates the affected substation, confirmed that power had been restored to all customers, including Heathrow. It also said steps were being taken to improve network resilience to avoid similar disruptions in the future.

Meanwhile, the investigation into the fire continues. While the Metropolitan Police’s counterterrorism command initially led the inquiry, they later confirmed there were no signs of foul play. The London Fire Brigade is now focusing on the substation’s electrical distribution systems as a possible cause.

The timing of the outage has only compounded the difficulties. With the travel season ramping up and airports already operating near capacity, the sudden blackout has placed additional strain on systems that were already stretched thin. Passengers across Europe and beyond have faced last-minute cancellations, rebookings, or overnight diversions to other cities.

For travelers hoping to pass through Heathrow in the coming days, patience may be necessary. Airlines continue to adjust flight schedules and reposition aircraft as quickly as regulations and staffing allow. Many passengers have taken to social media to express frustration, while others simply want to know when they’ll be able to fly.

Despite the airport’s reopening, the recovery will be gradual. Airlines are urging travelers to check flight statuses before heading to the airport, and many are still offering waivers for rebooking fees or full refunds.

As Heathrow re-evaluates its emergency protocols and the National Grid investigates the failure, one thing is clear: a fire in a single power facility can ignite widespread disruption—affecting planes, passengers, and global schedules far beyond a single terminal.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/heathrow_Airplane-landing.webp,N,,2025-03-22 12:56:28.133220

Eric Fobes, Pilot’s Head of Renewables, said the company is committed to helping fleets transition to cleaner fuels.
By expanding access to biodiesel, Pilot is playing a crucial role in helping the trucking sector shift toward cleaner energy.
The company’s move sets a new benchmark for travel centres and commercial fleets looking to lower their carbon footprint.","In a major step toward cleaner fuel use in the trucking industry, Pilot has become the first travel centre network in the United States to offer B99 biodiesel for commercial fleets. The company launched its first B99 fueling station at its Decatur, Illinois location to mark National Biodiesel Day on March 18, 2025, reports Chemanalyst. News.

This initiative is the result of a partnership between Pilot, PepsiCo, and ADM. PepsiCo, which operates one of the largest private truck fleets in North America, and ADM, a global agricultural supply chain company, worked with Pilot to make this alternative fuel more accessible to long-haul truckers. The move is aimed at helping the transportation sector reduce carbon emissions, which has been a significant challenge.

B99 biodiesel is made from renewable sources like vegetable oils, animal fats, and recycled cooking grease. It produces fewer emissions than regular diesel while maintaining similar performance. By making this fuel available, Pilot is giving trucking companies an option to cut their environmental impact without making major changes to their existing vehicles.

A key part of the project is the involvement of Optimus Technologies, a company that develops technology to help diesel engines run on up to 100% biodiesel. Their system allows trucking companies to switch to B99 without needing expensive vehicle modifications.

Eric Fobes, Pilot’s Head of Renewables, said the company is committed to helping fleets transition to cleaner fuels. “We know sustainability is important to our customers, and we want to support their efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Bringing B99 to our travel centres is a big step in that direction,” he said.

The initiative has also received support from organizations like the Iowa Soybean Association, Iowa Biodiesel Board, Illinois Soybean Association Checkoff Program, and the American Lung Association. Their involvement highlights the broader effort to make sustainable fuel a standard option in the trucking industry.

Para estimular o desenvolvimento de estudos sobre a aplicação do SAF no Estado, com o etanol como alternativa para o setor de aviação, o Sindicato das Indústrias do Açúcar e do Álcool de Pernambuco (Sindaçúcar-PE), com o auxílio de uma consultoria apropriada, iniciou um pré-projeto na área.

“O Estado de Pernambuco tem um potencial na área dos combustíveis renováveis limpo para aviação extremamente consistente. O objetivo é substituir o querosene de aviação por mecanismos da natureza do SAF que são os combustíveis limpos. No Brasil, isso pode vir de duas rotas principais: uma rota HEFA e uma rota ATJ, que é o querosene parafínico sintetizado por álcool, no caso o etanol”, afirmou o presidente do Sindaçúcar-PE, Renato Cunha.

Segundo Cunha, o Brasil tem quantidade suficiente de etanol para abastecer a demanda da aviação.

“O Brasil é autossuficiente no consumo de etanol, exporta etanol e terá etanol para abastecer essa necessidade dos combustíveis de aviação”, disse.

Ele ressaltou que, no Estado, o potencial de produção para fornecimento de etanol existe, o que pode ser um diferencial, com mais renda, empregos e tributos.

Diálogo

Para avançar nas pesquisas, o Sindaçúcar-PE está em diálogo com diferentes entes, como o Governo Federal, por meio dos ministérios de Portos e Aeroportos e Minas e Energia; o Governo do Estado, a partir da secretaria de Desenvolvimento Econômico; com a Aena Brasil; a Federação Nacional das Indústrias do Estado de Pernambuco (Fiepe); e o economista e sócio da Ceplan, Jorge Jatobá.

Na próxima semana, Renato Cunha se reúne com o secretário estadual de Desenvolvimento Econômico, Guilherme Cavalcanti. “Iremos procurar apoio para realizarmos estudos compartilhados com o Governo do Estado para que se lance em Pernambuco essa base do SAF para substituir o QAV dentro das rotas tecnológicas já aprovadas, como a ATJ”, explicou Renato Cunha.

Anteriormente, o Sindaçúcar-PE também realizou uma audiência com o ministro de Portos e Aeroportos, Silvio Costa Filho. No encontro, o ministro considerou fundamental unir a cadeia produtiva do etanol no projeto SAF, que integra a Lei do Combustível do Futuro (14.993/2024).

Outra reunião com o ministro, desta vez para entender as regras de certificação da Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (Anac), também está nos planos.

“Além do CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), que faz esse disciplinamento internacional, no Brasil já existe a resolução 496 da Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (Anac) que verifica dados de emissão de CO2 relativos ao transporte aéreo internacional. A Anac é responsável por criar um plano de monitoramento dessas emissões e tem feito esse trabalho desde 2019”, destacou Renato.

Consumo

Em Pernambuco, as vendas de querosene de aviação, que será substituído pelo SAF, totalizaram, em 2024, mais de 300 milhões de litros, tornando o Estado o quarto maior consumidor do Brasil, ficando atrás apenas do Distrito Federal, Rio de Janeiro e São Paulo. No País, são quase 7 bilhões de litros consumidos.

“O Aeroporto dos Guararapes é um aeroporto moderno, com bons níveis de tecnologia, e faz vários voos internacionais. A gente sabe que o aeroporto tem um hub da Azul que tem sido um diferencial favorável desde fevereiro de 2026”, reiterou Renato Cunha.

""A modernized and resilient energy infrastructure—it doesn't matter whether through distributed generation, renewable energy integration, or modular systems—ensures other sectors can function, grow, and innovate.""
""When I say we need to focus on energy infrastructure, I'm not just talking about power generation.
Rick Whitaker invites decision-makers, investors, and practitioners to embrace this reimagined approach to foreign aid.
states Whitaker.","Regions across the globe are confronting post-conflict reconstruction needs born from prolonged instability and disruptive events. These needs manifest as demands to rebuild critical infrastructure, revitalize essential services, and ensure communities have the foundation to thrive even in challenging circumstances.

The United States finds itself at a critical juncture in its approach to foreign aid following this moment of recalibration. Significant structural changes highlight its dilemma, as the traditional role of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is being reformed, with key functions now absorbed into the State Department.

Rick Whitaker, co-founder and managing partner of ViVA International, joins the conversation in this space. He possesses over three decades of operational and strategic experience, assuming leadership roles in major multinational corporations and hands-on projects in post-conflict and rapidly evolving regions. Whitaker's extensive experience at the policy level and in the field, spearheading fuel cell power plant initiatives, managing large-scale renewable energy and hydroelectric projects, and more informs his insights regarding reimagining how the US delivers infrastructure support overseas.

As a seasoned expert in international infrastructure development and institutional strengthening, Whitaker observes that the current global landscape presents immense reconstruction challenges and valuable opportunities. Outdated infrastructure and energy systems strain the capacity of local institutions to sustain growth and stability in many parts of the world.

Accompanying these challenges is the emergence of a consensus that traditional aid mechanisms require radical thinking. Whitaker stresses that this reimagining must move away from broad, unfocused spending and toward strategic, measurable investments in key sectors. This aligns with recent discussions and reports in policy and industry circles that advocate for an overhaul in how reconstruction projects are conceptualized, managed, and executed.

Given this context, Whitaker points to utilizing local talent and modernizing critical energy systems. He introduces a framework with a tripartite approach that emphasizes the role of the private sector, the indispensability of local partnerships, and the imperative of commercialization.

Whitaker argues that the future of effective foreign aid is in leveraging the expertise and efficiency of private enterprises to deliver specialized services through competitive contracts. This would ensure that projects are executed precisely and with accountability.

Similarly, building robust partnerships with local entities is needed. After all, these collaborations are essential for building capacity, generating employment, and ensuring that the community benefits from the reconstruction. The third principle focuses on commercial viability. What does this entail? It involves structuring projects in a way that clearly demonstrates return on investment for all stakeholders, such as public financiers, local organizations, and private investors.

Whitaker emphasizes that these elements converge around one non-negotiable foundation—the energy sector. ""Energy forms the backbone of any successful reconstruction initiative,"" he states. ""A modernized and resilient energy infrastructure—it doesn't matter whether through distributed generation, renewable energy integration, or modular systems—ensures other sectors can function, grow, and innovate.""

Whitaker's insights challenge conventional foreign aid paradigms. His framework that revolves around leveraging the strength of the private sector, bolstering local human capital, and prioritizing economic stability represents a unique view of how to utilize market dynamics to drive development.

""When I say we need to focus on energy infrastructure, I'm not just talking about power generation. I'm pointing to creating an ecosystem where efficient energy systems boost broader economic growth, support modern technology, and enable communities to become stronger and more resilient, even as they face adversity,"" Whitaker supplies.

Rick Whitaker invites decision-makers, investors, and practitioners to embrace this reimagined approach to foreign aid. He asserts that the US can set a new standard for international development by aligning public initiatives with the private sector's expertise and commitment to measurable outcomes. This can pave the way for the nation to deliver sustainable benefits to communities worldwide while strengthening the global economy, ""The ultimate goal is fostering peace and economic prosperity, country by country."" states Whitaker.",https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4588698/rick-whitaker.jpg,N,,2025-03-22 14:56:49.778482

But there’s a quieter, largely overlooked threat lurking above us — one that’s steadily impacting aircraft performance, operational efficiency and long-term sustainability.

This threat isn’t always visible. In fact, it’s often ignored until it disrupts visibility entirely or leads to unexpected maintenance issues. It’s not mechanical, or technological. It’s airborne dust.

Yes, airborne dust — tiny, mineral-rich particles lifted from deserts and drylands — is posing a growing risk to the global air cargo industry. As the total flight volumes are expected to hit over 40 million globally in 2025, this invisible adversary is increasingly degrading engine performance, shortening maintenance cycles, and undermining sustainability goals across some of the world’s busiest cargo routes.

While dust storms occasionally make headlines due to dramatic visuals and flight cancellations, the real issue lies in chronic exposure to fine dust particles. Numerous scientific research has confirmed what many aviation engineers and operators have long suspected: dust ingestion causes cumulative and costly damage to aircraft.

A global problem with local intensities

A 2024 study led by the University of Reading, supported by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), analysed 17 years of dust exposure data using CAMS reanalysis and NASA’s CALIPSO satellite. The study examined 10 major airports situated in regions with high dust activity, including Phoenix, Canary Islands, Marrakesh, Niamey, Dubai, Delhi, Beijing, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Sydney.

Their findings were striking: aircraft engines routinely ingested up to 6.6 grams of dust per cycle, especially during takeoff, landing and holding phases. For a high-utilisation freighter operating 1,000 flight cycles in a dusty region, that equates to more than 10 kilograms of particulate matter funnelling through the engine. Even these seemingly small quantities can wreak havoc on high-performance turbofan engines over time.

Dust particles range from sub-micron to several hundred microns in size. The smaller particles can remain suspended in the atmosphere for days, travelling thousands of kilometres. These particles are not only abrasive but when exposed to high engine temperatures, can melt and resolidify, forming deposits that block nozzles, vents and cooling systems.

Invisible engine damage = Visible costs

Dust ingestion impacts nearly every part of the engine system:

Compressor blade erosion reduces aerodynamic efficiency, requiring more fuel to generate the same thrust.

Melted mineral buildup clogs cooling vents and fuel nozzles, increasing heat and wear.

Protective coatings corrode, accelerating the need for maintenance and part replacement.

These effects lead to higher fuel burn, increased emissions, shorter maintenance intervals, and ultimately, higher operational costs. For cargo airlines — whose profit margins hinge on load efficiency and tight schedules — this translates into a compounding threat to bottom-line profitability.

Even more concerning, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), dust and sand ingestion can reduce engine power and, in extreme cases, lead to complete engine failure. In addition, the infiltration of fine dust into avionics and cockpit instrumentation poses risks to electrical systems and sensors.

Holding patterns and hot zones

The vertical distribution of dust is also critical. The study found that aircraft are most vulnerable to dust ingestion during arrivals, particularly when flying in holding patterns at altitudes of 1–2 kilometres, where dust concentrations often peak.

Dust ingestion during arrivals was 24% higher than during departures.

In some cases, over 50% of dust exposure occurred while aircraft circled in holding patterns awaiting landing clearance.

This phase of flight, often overlooked in engine wear modelling, is now seen as a critical moment where operational changes can yield major sustainability gains.

Dust and sustainability: A clashing forecast

From an environmental perspective, the implications are concerning. Engine degradation from dust increases fuel consumption, which in turn drives up CO₂ and NOₓ emissions. As airlines invest in newer aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) among others to meet net-zero goals, the hidden drag from airborne particulates risks offsetting those gains.

Worse still, climate change may exacerbate the problem. Rising surface temperatures, changing wind patterns and desertification are contributing to more frequent and intense dust events. Satellite data and global models suggest dust activity could increase in coming decades, particularly in regions already prone to high particulate emissions.

According to the WMO, phenomena like haboobs—intense dust storms driven by convective downdrafts—can suddenly create zero-visibility conditions and expose engines to extreme loads of particulate matter. These localised events often escape broader weather models, making real-time monitoring even more essential.

Operational fixes: Simple changes, big gains

The good news? Practical solutions are available—and they don’t require expensive retrofitting or radical technology shifts.

The Reading-CAMS study suggests two mitigation strategies:

1. Night-time flight operations

Dust concentrations are significantly lower at night due to cooler temperatures and reduced convective activity. For example, at Dubai International, shifting landings to nighttime hours could cut dust ingestion by up to 41%.

2. Adjusted holding altitudes

By increasing the altitude of holding patterns, aircraft can avoid layers of peak dust. At Delhi, rising holding altitudes during the monsoon season reduced engine dust exposure by 44%.

Monitoring and forecasting: The next frontier

To make these adjustments work consistently, cargo airlines must adopt more data-driven operational planning. Integrating dust forecasts from CAMS, vertical profiles from ground-based lidar, and real-time satellite data (like CALIPSO and CATS) can help dispatchers, pilots, and ATC make smarter decisions.

Airport authorities in dust-prone regions could also invest in real-time air quality and dust layer monitoring, just as they currently do for wind shear or runway contamination.

Planning for a dustier future

The global air cargo sector is expanding rapidly, and with e-commerce, cold chain logistics, and pharmaceutical freight on the rise, the pressure for efficient, timely, and green operations will only grow. If the aviation industry continues to overlook the role of environmental particulates, it may find its climate gains and cost-control efforts eroded — literally and figuratively — by a cloud of dust.

Mitigating airborne dust exposure isn’t just about prolonging engine life. It’s about safeguarding sustainability pledges, ensuring reliable delivery, and keeping costs manageable in an increasingly volatile environment.

As cargo fleets crisscross dusty skies from Phoenix to Delhi, the industry must adapt with smarter flight paths, predictive planning and atmospheric awareness. What’s invisible to the eye today could become a visible cost tomorrow.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/03/22/80203-dubai-airport-dust-arabia-weather.jpg,N,,2025-03-22 11:57:29.945950

EgyptAir is pressing ahead with its modernisation and expansion efforts, aiming to boost its market share locally and compete with international carriers in Egypt. The national airline is set to receive its first Airbus A350 by the end of this year, as part of a deal for 10 aircraft. It is also working to introduce 18 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, with deliveries expected to be completed by 2026.

Beyond fleet expansion, EgyptAir is aligning with European Union aviation regulations by adapting to the REFUEL E directive and negotiating with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) providers. The airline has secured an offer from Sky NRG, backed by Microsoft, covering up to 70% of SAF costs.

Strengthening digital services, customer engagement

EgyptAir has upgraded its website and frequent flyer program while expanding its call center operations. Currently covering Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the service is set to extend to the United States, Canada, France, the UK, Kuwait, and Jordan to increase revenue from foreign currency sources.

The airline is also actively forming partnerships with major corporations to attract new customers and boost its market share amid growing competition in Egypt’s aviation sector.

A strategic expansion plan

EgyptAir’s long-term growth strategy, running until 2028, seeks to position Cairo International Airport as a key hub connecting Africa with the rest of the world. The airline plans to launch new routes across Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, North America, and Africa, targeting key tourism markets.

By 2028, EgyptAir aims to handle 22 million international passengers annually–double the 11 million recorded in the 2023/24 financial year. To achieve this, the airline is increasing its European destinations from 25 to 33, its Middle Eastern routes from 19 to 25, and its Asian destinations from 9 to 17. North American services will also expand from 4 to 9 destinations, while African routes will grow from 26 to 30. The airline’s fleet is expected to reach 97 aircraft.

Advancing maintenance, technical capabilities

EgyptAir’s maintenance division is expanding its aircraft servicing capacity through the construction of Hangar 9000, which will include a dedicated aircraft painting facility. The company is also upgrading its repair workshops, modernising tools and equipment, and expanding daily maintenance stations across Africa and the Middle East.

Investing in human capital is another priority, with intensive training programmes in line with international aviation standards. Engineers and technicians are being trained to service new aircraft models, such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, while recruitment efforts are underway to support the growing fleet.

Enhancing catering, cargo operations

EgyptAir’s catering services aim to produce 60,000 meals daily over the next three years to meet the airline’s expanding operations. The company is also working on infrastructure improvements, including new storage facilities and the renewal of equipment at its Cairo, Hurghada, and Sharm El Sheikh facilities.

Meanwhile, EgyptAir Cargo is operating 20 weekly freighter flights to European airports during peak agricultural export seasons. The company has also introduced competitive shipping rates to maximise Egypt’s export opportunities.

A fleet expansion plan is in motion, with two Airbus A330-200P2F freighters set to join operations, increasing daily cargo capacity from 740 to 1,180 tons. EgyptAir Cargo is also investing in digitalisation, implementing AI-driven customer service tools and upgrading cargo management systems to improve efficiency and streamline bookings and tracking.

As EgyptAir pushes forward with its modernisation strategy, the airline is looking to cement its position as a leading player in the region’s aviation industry, enhancing its global connectivity and service offerings.",https://egyptian-gazette.com/media/2025/03/1-11.webp,N,,2025-03-22 11:57:34.615108

And when asked what the business community needed to do to meet net zero targets, panelist Frans Calje OBE, the CEO of PD Ports, felt Teesside was in a great position.

He told delegates: “Change is going to come, so what’s going to happen? A reality check is inevitable but there’s a positive side for Teesside.

“If you understand the infrastructure, there’s no way on this green earth that you can replicate the requirement and the intensity of energy that we need – especially if you go into renewables – anywhere else than Teesside.

“Look at the north bank and south bank of the River Tees – the infrastructure is about two tunnels beneath the river. You can walk underneath the Tees from one end to the other.

“But by that very integrated nature and the landbank and skills we’ve got, it aligns Teesside as the only place in the UK you can do energy transition on an industrial scale.

“Things like sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen, carbon capture – the government is going to spend £8bn on the carbon capture scheme, for example. Is it going to work?

“The Norwegians have been doing it for years. So, when you see that spin-off in terms of where energy transition is going to go and the work that’s forthcoming for SMEs,

“Teesside is going to be the energy hub of the UK and I think it’s incredibly exciting.”

He was also bullish about the Tees business region as a whole, adding: “The way the Tees Valley has continually bounced back I find incredibly fascinating.

“No matter how bad things get, there is always a sense of pride and belonging. The ability of Teesside to continually reinvent itself is inspiring.”

Elaine McLaine-Wood, managing partner of Punch Robson Solicitors, said she wanted the next 10 years to see Teesside “remain successful, continue to grow and have independence within the region.”

She added: “What I personally want to achieve is to have a legacy of an independent firm and brilliant people coming through.

“At the end of the day, we can all be in charge of our own destiny and it’s that wish that we can give to youngsters – that they can be owners and not necessarily just employees.”

Alluding to the major defence contracts his firm is currently working on, Wilton Engineering CEO Bill Scott OBE DL said: “We have a 10-year contract at the moment which involves a significant amount of work.

“Defence is really important for the country so it is allowing us to focus on our apprenticeships and our next leaders within the business.

“The next contract I’m currently negotiating would take us to 2060 – and when you get into it, building submarines is more difficult than building a spaceship, so you can imagine what goes in there.

“It covers literally everything Zoe (Middlesbrough College CEO and principal Zoe Lewis CBE DL) can do in her college.”

As well as more defence contracts, Zoe hoped that by 2035, the region would be celebrating a full Teesworks site, a thriving digital cluster, a health innovation hub and “huge changes in social media right across the country to protect our young people.”

She also urged employers to take on more apprentices so that the number who do goes from one in five to four in five.

She said: “That’s the future and how we will get our growth and development in our area is more investment in young people – by giving them that bit of experience they need when they come out of education.”

A variety of materials, especially metals, contributed to the increase in the price index for inputs.
Association officials noted that materials prices are likely to continue increasing, especially as a variety of threatened tariffs go into effect.
“The irony is that the tariffs’ impacts on construction costs might just price some manufacturers out of their decision to expand or add plants in the U.S.,” AGC CEO Jeffrey Shoaf said.","The price of materials and services used in nonresidential construction rose 0.5% in February, following an increase of 0.7% in January, according to a recent analysis of government data by the Associated General Contractors of America.

Association officials noted that materials prices began increasing before most of the threatened new tariffs were put in place.

“It’s a bad sign that construction costs have been rising significantly even before most of the Trump administration’s tariffs have taken effect,” Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist, said in a news release. “Now that many tariffs that hit construction materials are in effect, with more measures pending, construction costs are likely to rise much more.”

The producer price index for inputs to new nonresidential construction—a weighted average of all materials and certain services used in new construction—increased for the second month in a row, AGC reported. Meanwhile, the index for new nonresidential building construction—a measure of what contractors report they would charge to put up a specific set of buildings—dipped by 0.1% in February, following an increase of 0.3% in January. The fact that input costs are outstripping bid prices implies that contractors have not been able to pass along the cost increases enough to maintain profit margins, Simonson said.

A variety of materials, especially metals, contributed to the increase in the price index for inputs. The index for steel mill products jumped 2.7% in February. The index for copper and brass mill shapes rose by 1.8%, following a 1.3% gain in January. Aluminum mill shapes rose 1.0% in price for the month. In addition, the index for diesel fuel climbed 2.3% and the index for lumber and plywood rose 1.7%.

Prices used to calculate the indexes were collected around Feb. 11, Simonson noted. Since then, the administration has imposed new tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports, 25% on many goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on imports from China. These tariffs are in addition to a 10% tariff on China that took effect on Feb. 4 and numerous tariffs already in effect. In addition, the administration has threatened to impose additional tariffs in early April and potentially steep fees on ships delivering cargo to U.S. ports.

Association officials noted that materials prices are likely to continue increasing, especially as a variety of threatened tariffs go into effect. They said this would make the cost of construction more expensive, forcing some manufacturers to rethink plans to establish or expand facilities within the United States, undermining the intent of many of the proposed tariffs.

The long-awaited Project Willow study, which itself cost £1.5m, sets out nine options for the future of the industrial cluster in central Scotland.

Hundreds of jobs are set to be lost this year when the oil refinery there closes – and the report has identified nine “feasible” proposals which could attract private investment.

These include plastic recycling, fermenting timber into bioethanol, and hydrogen production, and the Scottish and UK governments say these schemes could create 800 jobs by 2040.

This month, the Just Transition Commission warned it could take years to close the “jobs gap” left by the refinery’s closure.

A summary of the report says the nine projects “have the potential to significantly enhance low-carbon manufacturing across the UK and create a positive future for Grangemouth”.

It adds: “However, the report also underscores the challenges of this transformation as low-carbon fuels and chemicals remain more expensive to produce than fossil alternatives.

“This will require substantial capital investment from the private sector [£3.5bn capital expenditure] and development of new supply chains.”

‘No stone unturned’

Commenting on the report, UK energy minister Michael Shanks said: “We committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth.

“This report and the £200m investment by the UK government demonstrates that commitment.”

And Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney, cited the Scottish government’s own £87m investment commitment, and said: “Grangemouth is home to over a century of industrial expertise and employs thousands of highly skilled workers, placing the site at a massive competitive advantage and creating a unique opportunity for investors.

“Everyone working at Grangemouth’s refinery – and in the wider industrial cluster – is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland’s economic and net zero future.”

One of the nine options is to use low-carbon hydrogen to produce methanol, which would be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Union leaders have suggested this as a way forward which could save jobs, with Unite saying the plant could be converted “relatively easily” over a few years to produce SAF, which the report said could commence in 2035, needing up to 270 staff and some £2.1bn.

A spokesman for the refinery’s owners Petroineos said: “The publication of the first Project Willow report is a milestone event for Grangemouth that could mark the beginning of a transformation for the whole cluster and, in time, create many more jobs and growth opportunities across a variety of related industries in Scotland.

“We look forward to continuing to support both UK and Scottish Governments as they implement the recommended policy, regulatory and fiscal changes required to unlock the opportunities identified in our report.”

Airline startet neue Verbindungen ab Flughafen Frankfurt – zwei Metropolen als Ziel

Von: Erik Scharf

Condor fliegt vom Flughafen Frankfurt aus wieder Berlin und Hamburg an. Mit modernsten Fliegern soll dabei ordentlich Kraftstoff gespart werden.

Frankfurt – In nur einer Stunde von Frankfurt nach Berlin reisen: Die Condor City-Verbindung macht es möglich. Ab März bietet die Fluggesellschaft Flüge vom Flughafen Frankfurt zum Flughafen Berlin-Brandenburg (BER) sowie zum Flughafen Hamburg (HAM) an. Dabei setzt Condor auf die neuesten Flugzeugmodelle.

Condor bezeichnet in einer Pressemitteilung diese Entwicklung als ein kleines Stück Firmengeschichte. Nach langer Zeit bietet die Airline wieder Inlandsflüge innerhalb Deutschlands an. Mit den sogenannten City-Verbindungen verbindet das Unternehmen Frankfurt mit Berlin und Hamburg. Zudem hat Condor eine Erweiterung des Streckennetzes für den Sommer 2025 angekündigt.

Erste Flüge von Flughafen Frankfurt nach Berlin und Hamburg gestartet

Bereits am 1. März startete der erste Linienflug seit Jahren von Frankfurt nach Berlin um 10.30 Uhr mit der Flugnummer DE409. Nur 15 Minuten später hob der Flug DE4179 nach Hamburg ab. Seit dem 2. März fliegt Condor zweimal täglich, morgens und abends, zwischen Frankfurt und den Städten Hamburg und Berlin.

„Mit unseren City-Verbindungen passen wir unseren Flugplan an die Bedürfnisse unserer Gäste an“, erklärt Peter Gerber, CEO von Condor. Berlin und Hamburg sind sowohl für private als auch geschäftliche Reisende attraktive Ziele. Die Flüge werden in einer Zwei-Klassen-Konfiguration angeboten: Economy und Business-Class.

Moderne Flugzeuge von Frankfurt nach Berlin und Hamburg sollen Treibstoff sparen

Condor setzt auf die neuesten Flugzeugtypen Airbus A320neo und A321neo, die mit modernsten Triebwerken von Pratt & Whitney ausgestattet sind. Diese Flugzeuge verbrauchen 20 Prozent weniger Treibstoff und werden mit Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) betrieben, einem nachhaltig hergestellten Treibstoff aus nichtfossilen Rohstoffen.

Die neuen Maschinen reduzieren laut Condor die CO₂-Emissionen um 20 Prozent und sind zudem 50 Prozent leiser. Der Kerosinverbrauch pro Passagier beträgt an Bord einer A320neo umgerechnet 1,9 Liter auf 100 Kilometern.

Matin Sarfraz reports 🗳️ There’s a new prime minister — but we’re already on our way to a new, new prime minister.","If the hints are correct, tomorrow Prime Minister Mark Carney will call an election, sending voters to the polls as early as April 28. Media outlets are already in high gear, making coverage plans and budgeting for the significant related costs. This time, the price tag will be lower; the Conservatives announced this week that media are not welcome on Pierre Poilievre’s campaign voyage.

It’s the first time in recent memory that one of Canada’s major parties has banned journalists from travelling with the leader on the campaign bus and flights. And why?

The initial reason given by Conservative campaign director Jenni Byrne was because travel costs have escalated and digital and remote access to public events have improved so much that ample coverage is available that way. Let’s dig into this a bit.

Although it may be true that the federal parties partially subsidize campaign travel costs for the media, having been on the budgeting side of the equation, I can tell you the outlets that spring to send reporters on the leaders’ buses and planes pay plenty. So much so, that many outlets have now opted out. They are forced to cover the campaign remotely, where their questions can be easily ignored, and rely on wire services for live campaign coverage.

It would be interesting to know exactly how much opening the doors to media who can afford it would cost the party. Likely, not much.

And given Poilievre’s massive fundraising success, you have to question why they couldn’t spend just a little bit of their war chest to provide voters with insight that comes from access for journalists and their pesky questions.

When pressed, Poilievre qualified Byrne’s excuse, saying he would prefer to give opportunities for local media outlets to ask questions during the campaign. Sounds good. But the reality is the number of local media outlets has shrunk so precipitously that in some places, Poilievre might not face reporters at all. A new study by the Centre for Canadian Policy Alternatives has found 2.5 million Canadians are now without a local news outlet.

And being able to make election pronouncements without having to field questions would suit Poilievre just fine. There’s a bigger truth here. Poilievre has a decidedly testy, if not combative, relationship with journalists. He is quick to anger when faced with questions he doesn’t like, and he has used his skill as a bare-knuckled Parliamentary debater to belittle reporters who annoy him.

He holds press conferences where questions are kept to a minimum and only occasionally grants one-on-one interviews with friendly right-wing commentators like Jordan Peterson and former National Post columnist Sabrina Maddeaux, who became so enamoured with the Tory agenda she tried to run for the party in the upcoming election.

This relationship with the press extends to policy priorities, too. One of his primary campaign promises is to defund the CBC. He has also mused about extending federal journalism funding to far-right outlets like Rebel Media, which was denied in the past for failing to provide enough original content.

Now, all politicians have their testy moments. Newly-minted Prime Minister Mark Carney bristled at questions over his financial assets, accusing the media of assuming “ill will” on his part. There will no doubt be more moments like this when the honeymoon period that has him rising in the polls starts to wane. We are all human.

But there seems to be a fundamental difference in personality type between the leaders. Poilievre boasts about his aggressive nature, pitching it as a selling point to deal with the current trade war started by U.S. President Donald Trump, a politician who also loathes mainstream media and is as nasty as they come.

Carney seems determined to rise above the muck. He seems, from the outside, a decent person, confident in his ability to take on adversaries by demanding respect and extending that same courtesy to others. No surprise then, that his campaign is open to the media.

Canadians will soon be asked to choose which political party and leader they think is best suited to guide the country through these troubled times. Factual, reliable information will be crucial for voters, business leaders and local governments facing difficult decisions.

There are hugely troubling signs for press freedom south of the border where Trump has called journalists “monsters,” and “horrible, horrible, dishonest people” and threatened to go after media he dislikes with the power of the government. Some of the nation’s most respected newspapers are beginning to self-censor, causing respected life-long journalists to resign in protest.

One has to wonder what would play out here under a government run by Poilievre, who struggles to contain his contempt for the media. Booting journalists off the campaign bus seems like only the first step.

🎈 The consumer carbon tax is dead. Why aren’t the Conservatives celebrating? After all, “axe the tax” has been the central slogan of Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre’s pitch to Canadians. But as Max Fawcett explains, that’s the problem — Poilievre wanted to be the one to swing the axe, and with new Prime Minister Mark Carney having beaten him to it, the Conservatives have lost a major plank of their platform. With an election coming as early as Sunday, the move has dealt yet another serious blow to what once seemed an inevitable Tory win. The Conservatives have run headlong into a political trap.

Max Fawcett writes.

Quote of the week

“We shouldn’t be subsidizing fossil fuels at a time when we’re facing an affordability crisis and a climate emergency.” — Mike Schreiner, leader of Ontario's Green Party and MPP for Guelph, regarding the “free ride” gas companies get in Ontario municipalities.

🚧 The maze of gas pipelines Enbridge owns beneath the streets, buildings and parks of Guelph, Ontario, are free of charge to the gas giant. Elsewhere, those rights are worth millions to municipalities, but not in Ontario — thanks to provincial legislation and an agreement the city signed 20 years ago. Now, with that agreement up for renewal, the city is trying to make sure it doesn’t give away those rights for free again. The city wants a provision stating that if the legislation ever changes, Guelph won’t have to wait two decades to start collecting. Toronto and Ottawa are thinking along the same lines.

🗳️ There’s a new prime minister — but we’re already on our way to a new, new prime minister. An election is expected to be called on Sunday, just before the House was set to begin its spring session. It will be the next test for newly sworn-in Prime Minister Mark Carney, who does not yet have a seat of his own in Parliament, and a test for the Liberal Party’s unprecedented rise in the polls against the Conservatives’ huge war chest. The vote is expected to take place as early as April 28, but there’s wiggle room.

Nick Murray reports

🪨 One mine’s trash could be all of our treasure. In decades past, miners in search of one metal may not have looked to extract other metals that exist in those same rocks. It may not have been worth the cost and effort — until now. With critical minerals increasingly in demand, there’s a new push to re-mine waste rock piles for what else can be extracted from them, and the benefits go beyond the minerals themselves. Removing waste rock can mitigate the dangerous impacts of acid rock drainage and other nasty environmental legacies.

Darius Snieckus reports.

✈️Emissions from flying are rising sharply. And most of the carbon being burned by planes is used to fly the wealthiest one per cent of people on the planet to far-flung destinations. The airline industry and governments answer is to promote “sustainable aviation fuel” produced from non-fossil fuel products, such as municipal waste, wood scraps or waste grease and oil, among others. Yet, because it is more expensive, airlines are buying only tiny amounts. A shame because their customers could probably afford to pay a little more to help reduce carbon emissions from travel.

Through philanthropic investment, we are accelerating the transition to a sustainable aviation sector that spares the climate and human health.

The challenge

If the aviation sector were a country, it would rank among the top 10 global emitters of greenhouse gasses, surpassing Brazil, Mexico, and the UK. Burning fossil jet fuel not only emits carbon dioxide but also releases byproducts including nitrogen oxides, water vapor, soot, and aerosols. At cruising altitude, these byproducts react with the atmosphere, amplifying their contributions to global warming.

Beyond its staggering climate impact, the aviation industry poses severe public health risks, disproportionately affecting communities of color and lower-income groups. Air pollution from air travel causes 16,000 premature deaths annually and is directly linked to heart disease, asthma, and elevated blood lead levels. For decades, industry workers, airport-adjacent communities, and military personnel have borne the brunt of harmful exhaust exposure. Decarbonizing the aviation industry is critical to safeguarding these communities.

We cannot afford to delay. As flight demand soars, unchecked fossil fuel emissions from aviation will intensify the climate crisis. Despite the urgent need, philanthropic funding for addressing aviation’s impact has been minimal. Now is the time to invest in transformative action that changes the trajectory of this high-emitting sector.

The opportunity

The aviation sector is at a critical turning point, and we have a unique opportunity to accelerate its transformation toward a net-zero future. To most effectively do so, we have gathered a community of aligned funders and are implementing a shared comprehensive philanthropic strategy for aviation. By bringing together climate philanthropy, airline industry leaders, civic society, and the scientific community, we are building a powerful coalition to achieve our shared goal of decarbonizing aviation.

One of the most promising pathways to net-zero aviation is the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which could deliver 65 percent of the CO2 reductions needed for the sector. Among SAF options, e-SAF stands out as the most viable long-term solution. Unlike biofuels, eSAF requires minimal land use and significantly reduces the public health burden on airport workers and frontline communities. We partner closely with our Carbon Dioxide Removal Program to explore the opportunity to use direct air capture technology to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere and combine it with green hydrogen to create e-SAF that can be used in jet engines today. ClimateWorks has played a pivotal role in helping advance and promote the scaling of e-SAF adoption in Europe and the United States, laying the groundwork for global implementation

Equally critical is transforming how people engage with the aviation sector. Just 1% of the global population is responsible for 50% of emissions from flying, presenting a pivotal opportunity to drive significant pollution reductions. By shifting the behavior of this small but influential group, we can create a disproportionately large impact in reducing aviation emissions, protecting both vulnerable communities and the planet. At the same time, we must prioritize the voices and needs of frontline communities disproportionately impacted by aviation emissions. We are committed to co-creating strategies alongside these communities to reduce air pollution, eliminate air toxics, and scale SAF adoption. By combining behavioral change with equitable climate solutions, we can unlock a sustainable and inclusive future for aviation.

Our approach

There is no silver bullet to solve aviation’s climate and pollution impacts, rather a combination of solutions will be required. We focus on the decarbonization levers with the highest potential to get the sector to net zero:

Scaling sustainable aviation fuel

We are driving the transition to low-carbon aviation by scaling the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Through policy wins in Europe, the U.S., and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), we’ve helped lay the foundation for global change. Our focus is on expanding SAF use in the U.S., ensuring ethical production that protects forests and farmland, and centering frontline communities.

Reducing demand for air travel

We aim to cut aviation emissions by raising awareness of flying’s climate impact, pushing industry and policymakers to act, promoting alternative modes of transport, and targeting high-emission groups such as corporate travelers and frequent flyers.

Exploring emerging opportunities

In addition to these two core focus areas, we see potential in addressing the non-CO<sub>2</sub> impacts of aviation, specifically contrail mitigation which could have near-term success without requiring drastic sectoral change. Current estimates are that 3% of contrails cause 80% of the warming, meaning interventions can be targeted based on geography. Through supporting policy intervention, we can clean up contrail hotspots, like the North Atlantic, by adjusting flight paths.

Impact

These are the outcomes we’re working to achieve:

Aviation transitions to sustainable fuel

By 2030, 10% of global aviation fuel is sustainable, with the industry on track to reach 100% by 2050. Airlines now operate on clean, low-carbon alternative fuels, setting a new standard for decarbonization.

Public awareness drives change

Corporate travelers, frequent flyers, and private jet users now widely understand the climate impact of flying. This awareness has reduced demand, creating pressure on the industry and policymakers to accelerate transformative action.

Short-haul flights are replaced by alternative modes of transport

In Europe, short-haul flights have been largely replaced by efficient trains, buses, and video conferencing. These alternatives are widely accessible, publicly embraced, and recognized as climate-smart solutions to aviation’s outsized climate impact.

Sustainable fuels scaled without harm

Biofuels are no longer a default solution, as the industry recognizes their risks to forests, farmland, and Indigenous communities. E-fuels created from excess carbon dioxide combined with green hydrogen comprise the majority of the sustainable aviation fuel supply, avoiding deforestation and displacement. E-fuels in this way scale methods to remove carbon dioxide from the air while displacing oil.

Where we work

To date, we have primarily supported action in Europe, the United States, and at the UN agency for aviation, the ICAO. However, as action on aviation expands globally, we are carefully building geographically relevant strategies in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa.

This project will produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from end-of-life wood waste & local forestry residues with the addition of green hydrogen. By 2029, BioTJet will supply sustainable aviation fuel to reduce carbon intensity in air transport, and e-bio-naphtha for road transport and bio-sourced chemistry. Axens signed a license agreement for BioTfueL technology in 2024, which includes a PRENFLO gasification technology from thyssenkrupp Uhde, a GASEL technology from Axens (Fischer-Tropsch and Upgrading) with a basic engineering completed in November 2024 and currently being within the detail engineering phase.

The aviation industry is considered as one of the hard-to-abate sectors in the green transformation, and sustainable aviation fuels are required by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, starting with a 2% quota in 2025 and aiming for 70% SAF in all EU airports from 2050. The BioTJet project is based on the E-BioTfueL concept, which combines biomass eligible to produce advanced biofuels (RED EU definition), and green or low-carbon hydrogen eligible to produce renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RED EU Definition, also called e-fuels). The technology brings proven process building blocks which have been developed and tested in a semi-industrial plant from 2010 to 2021 by the Bionext consortium consisting of Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies nouvelles, Total Energies and thyssenkrupp Uhde.

The PRENFLO gasification technology is part of thyssenkrupp's Decarbon Technologies portfolio and will contribute to the sustainable production of biomass-based synthetic products, including methanol, hydrogen, and SAF. With its origins in the Koppers-Totzek process, the PRENFLO technology has been continuously refined to meet evolving industry needs. It is known for its robustness and flexibility, capable of handling a wide range of feedstocks.

Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy: “After thoroughly examining the available and bankable technologies, we are now more convinced than ever that we have made the right choice for our project with the E-BioTfueL concept and the technology partners involved to provide cost-competitive SAF and naphtha to the market by 2030 and contribute to address climate change.”

Nadja Håkansson, CEO of thyssenkrupp Uhde: “We are proud to see how the E-BioTfueL concept – which includes our advanced PRENFLO technology – has now turned into a first commercial Biomass-to-SAF application in the European Community. The collaboration with our French partners underscores our commitment to driving the green transformation and delivering sustainable value to our customers and stakeholders.”

Quentin Debuisschert, CEO of Axens: “Axens, along with our parent company IFP Energies Nouvelles, has invested significant capital in demonstrating technologies at semi commercial scale and advancing the energy transition, particularly in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) processes. We are thrilled to be part of the BioTJet project, which is strategic for Axens and our longtime partner thyssenkrupp Uhde. The BioTJet project leverages a breakthrough technology, BioTfueL,"" underscoring our commitment to innovative solutions in the energy sector.”

Advanced Biofuels from Sustainable Feedstocks

PRENFLO is a pressurized, entrained-flow gasification technology developed and first demonstrated by thyssenkrupp Uhde in the late 1980s. It has been implemented in various large-scale projects, including the world's largest single-train, solid feedstock-based IGCC (integrated gasification combined-cycle) power plant, owned and operated by ELCOGAS, located in Puertollano, Spain, and continuously developed further to the application of 100% biomass. Thetechnology uses so-called second-generation biogenic feedstocks such as waste wood, wood chips, straw, forest residues and agricultural waste. The BioTJet project underscores thyssenkrupp Uhde's commitment to advancing clean energy technologies and supporting the global transition to sustainable sources.

He points to the Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest as a good example of balancing timber production and other natural resources.
The Chequamegon Nicolet is regularly one of the top timber producing National Forests in the Forest Service System selling roughly 120 million board feet of timber annually.
Eckstein also says while timber is a big product of the National Forest System, so is wildlife habitat, water quality, and recreation.
“These are all elements of the National Forest.","Called the “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production”, President Trump’s Executive Order calls for reducing the impact of what he calls “heavy-handed Federal policies” so that the U.S. can increase timber production and reduce wildfire risk.

The order directs the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to look at how to increase timber harvest and cut down on delivery time and supply uncertainty on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land.

This includes taking a look at how things like the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act can impact the process.

Henry Schienebeck is the Executive Director of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association.

He doesn’t know that the order will have a huge impact in this region, because it’s already one of the top timber producing regions within the Forest Service, but he does believe there’s room for improvement.

Schienebeck says the Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest has made a lot of progress towards its harvest goals because of the Good Neighbor Authority that’s allowed it to partner with the Wisconsin DNR to setup timber sales.

“We've been able to catch up on a lot of that forest management, those have been excellent tools with forest stewardship and Good Neighbor Authority to get caught up on some of the work that we're behind,” he said.

Schienebeck says there are a lot of opportunities to use natural wood in products like sustainable aviation fuel, biochar, and mass timber.

“People are starting to see the value of using wood more, real wood, for building their homes and that type of thing. I think from that aspect, we have some huge opportunity here,” said Schienebeck.

Schienebeck does think the order could be a positive thing for western states where wildfires are more common and destructive.

“We've been able to avoid that in the lake states to a great degree, and it is because we've got highly trained loggers that are out there managing the forest,” said Schienebeck. “We've got mills to absorb the wood, and we've got certification systems that are really a check and balance to make sure that we're doing the job right.”

Schienebeck stressed he doesn’t believe this will lead to mass clear cutting for forests like the state saw in the late 1800s. He says that sustainable timber harvest is good for both healthy forests and a healthy forest products industry.

“Our main focus is to make sure that we always have trees and that we always have access to them,” said Schienebeck. “It wouldn't be in our best interest to just go cut the forest and not have any trees left.”

More than timber production

Environmental groups like the Center for Biological Diversity believe speeding up the timber process will hurt critical wildlife habitat, impact water quality, and actually increase wildfire risk.

“Trump’s order will unleash the chainsaws and bulldozers on our beautiful, irreplaceable federal forests,” public lands policy director at the Center for Biological Diversity Randi Spivak in a statement. “Clearcutting these amazing national treasures will increase fire risk, drive imperiled wildlife to extinction, pollute our rivers and streams, and destroy world-class recreation sites.”

Wisconsin’s Green Fire is a conservation group which focuses on a science-based approached to managing natural resources. Ron Eckstein is part of the organization’s Public Lands and Forestry Work group.

He doesn’t believe you have to change or lessen environmental protections to harvest timber. He points to the Chequamegon Nicolet National Forest as a good example of balancing timber production and other natural resources.

The Chequamegon Nicolet is regularly one of the top timber producing National Forests in the Forest Service System selling roughly 120 million board feet of timber annually.

“They really are harvesting a lot of timber, and they've done that by following all the rules, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and the forest plan,” said Eckstein.

Eckstein also says while timber is a big product of the National Forest System, so is wildlife habitat, water quality, and recreation.

“These are all elements of the National Forest. Timber just being one of them,” said Eckstein. “If you just say, okay, timber and forget about everything else that really, really doesn't work very well.”

Eckstein also called it “inconsistent” to order an increase in timber production while cutting thousands of Forest Service staff that manage the land.

Wisconsin’s Forest Products Industry

Late last year, Wisconsin’s Green Fire published a report that looked at the health of all forests in the state, of which federal forest land makes up less than 10%.

The report details how a declining forest products industry, invasive species, and climate change are among the threats to healthy forests.

“We have a lot of timber in Wisconsin, and it can be harvested sustainably using our own information. Most of the timber is on private land, some is on public land, and landowners, whether it's private or public, landowners need a way to get the timber to market and have a market for the timber,” said Eckstein.

Schienebeck says the timber industry in the Great Lakes is “a mixed bag” right now.

The region lost some key mills in 2020/2021 that the industry is still feeling the impacts of, but there are still a lot of resources.

He says more infrastructure, both locally and across the U.S., will be needed to support the kind of timber demand the Trump administration has been calling for, but mills need guarantees that demand will last beyond this administration.

“I don't see any mill that's going to want to invest a lot of money in increasing their production without having some guarantees that the volume is going to be there into the future,” said Schienebeck.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d31afd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4928x2587+0+338/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwxpr%2Ffiles%2F202010%2Fmft_3.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 19:56:27.571278

Overnight fire Causing Major Power Outage and Flight Diversions

A fire broke out at an electrical substation in West London yesterday and has caused major power outages. Heathrow Airport announced a shutdown for passenger and staff safety. At least 1,351 flights originally arriving at or departing from the airport are now under diversion to other nearby airports.

The electrical substation is one of the major suppliers of power at Heathrow, the fire has cut off the power supply for the airport’s operations, while around 5,000 households near the area are experiencing blackouts.

Global Shock from Impacts Caused by Sudden Shutdown

As one of the major hubs connecting the UK and the world, this major disruption stirs up chaos around aviation today, with huge amounts of travellers and flights impacted.

Bristol Airport’s future development plans are certainly not welcomed by our local B&NES councillors who have voted to continue their opposition – sending a clear message that airport expansion is incompatible with Net Zero goals and is strongly rejected by local communities.

This follows the announcement of a new airport ‘masterplan’, covering the period to 2040, which highlighted Bristol Airport’s ambition to expand capacity to 15 million passengers per year, with over 14,000 extra flights, including a thousand more night flights.

By agreeing to this updated position, councillors intend that B&NES should

object to any future planning application, as the council will be a statutory consultee. In addition, B&NES will call on the government to reconsider their position on airport expansion in line with scientific advice.

Cabinet Member for Climate Emergency and Sustainable Travel, Councillor Sarah Warren, said:

“The most recent – very clear – recommendation of the independent Climate Change Committee, is to stop any further airport expansion and adopt a UK-wide capacity management framework. Without this, the UK cannot hope to achieve Net Zero goals and help prevent the worst impacts of climate change.

“We are sending a strong, message to the airport, and to the government, just as we have done before in Bath and North East Somerset: Bristol Airport is big enough.”

Chew Valley Councillor David Harding highlighted the horrendous problems the airport causes for communities in the area. He said:

“Bristol Airport is not a good neighbour. The impact is felt everywhere in the Chew Valley and across the whole area. Aside from pollution and noise, we see speeding cars, traffic jams at village pinch points, and unofficial and illegal parking in fields and outside people’s houses.

“This will only get worse as the airport’s expansion is dependent upon ever-increasing car use. The site is served by a single-track A road – the A38 – and country lanes. Mass transit is treated as an afterthought. The expansion is predicted to increase passenger journeys to 24 million per year. The majority will reach the airport by car.

“It’s not unfair to say the site at Lulsgate Bottom is a massive car park with an airport attached.”

Publow with Whitchurch Councillor, Paul May, who is also Cabinet Member for Children’s Services, added:

“Our future rests with our children. We have a duty to protect them from the long-term impacts of climate change and the immediate damage from air pollution and traffic danger.

“Communities across the district are strongly opposed to further expansion of Bristol Airport.”

The Liberal Democrat motion to full Council on Opposing Bristol Airport Expansion was adopted by 44 votes in favour to 0 against and 2 abstentions. This is a refreshed position from B&NES Councillors, who have consistently spoken out against the airport expansion – including previous motions in 2019 and 2022.

Please see below the text of the motion as adopted this evening.

Council:

Reaffirms its opposition to the expansion of Bristol Airport as previously expressed in March 2019 as part of the Climate Emergency Declaration and again in July 2022.

Notes that communities in Bath and North East Somerset, local campaign organisations and communities in neighbouring authorities also oppose the expansion of Bristol Airport.

Regrets that Bristol Airport controversially won permission to expand from 10 million to 12 million passengers a year in the face of overwhelming opposition expressed by local communities, organisations and elected politicians, and are now consulting on a further expansion to 15 million passengers a year, of which they estimate that 12 million will reach the airport by private transport, including up to 1000 increased night flights each year, and an extended runway to enable services by larger aircraft types.

Notes the government has expressed support for airport expansion (both the Chancellor and Prime Minister have expressed support for a third runway at Heathrow and the Transport Secretary has “set out a path” for the expansion of Gatwick airport) in conflict with the advice given to the government by the Climate Change Committee, who have repeatedly cautioned against airport expansion without a framework in place to manage overall national capacity.

Council believes that:

Airport expansion is incompatible with the action being taken by West of England Councils to tackle the Climate Emergency, the UK Government’s legally binding climate targets, and advice from the Government’s own Climate Change Committee.

The health and wellbeing of B&NES residents will be adversely affected, through increased air, noise and light pollution and through congestion, rogue parking and rat running through our rural villages and narrow country lanes.

“Sustainable aviation” is a meaningless phrase, regularly used as greenwash by the airport and fossil fuel industries. Sustainable Aviation Fuel is an unproven technology with no clear feedstocks which would permit deployment at a meaningful scale.

The same method was concurrently used for qualitative analysis using GC-MS. (A typical GC-MS result is shown in Supplementary Fig.","Hydrocracking polyolefins

In a typical hydrocracking process involving 4 grams of PE or PP, a conversion of over 98% can be achieved using Ru1-ZrO2 at 250 °C under 3 MPa H2 for 8 hours, yielding approximately 2.8 grams of liquid and 1.1 grams of gas, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The products are in gas and liquid phases mainly ranging from C3 to C20, and remain consistent regardless of the substrate as PE or PP (Supplementary Fig. 1). The liquid consists of approximately 70% jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons (C8-C16), while the gas primarily comprises C3-C6 LPG-range hydrocarbons (liquified-petroleum-gas, C3-C4 > 70%), and is almost free of methane and ethane (<0.007% and <0.068% mass yields, respectively, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). Notably, for the gaseous C4-C6 fraction, iso-alkanes dominate with a 93% weight fraction (Supplementary Fig. 3), even when the substrate is the less branched PE. This result implies that significant isomerization occurs over Ru1-ZrO2 during hydrocracking.

High temperatures enhance the thermodynamic driving force toward terminal C−C bond cleavage, leading to increased methane production26,37. However, they also shorten the required reaction time, which is often practical in industrial settings. Low H2 pressure is also highly desirable in real practice due to the lower equipment requirements, but it reduces competitive hydrogen adsorption on the catalyst resulting in higher methane formation rates27,28,38. Prolonged reaction times are often required for cracking the heavy hydrocarbons to get the liquid product, but it increases the likelihood of over-cracking lighter hydrocarbon products to methane. PP, which contains more methyl groups, tends to produce more methane than PE, due to terminal C−C bond cleavage33,39. To examine the product preference for jet-fuel-ranged hydrocarbons and resistance to methane formation, a proof test over Ru1-ZrO2 was conducted under conditions favorable for methane formation, i.e., PP as the substrate at 300 °C under H2 of 1–4 MPa for 8 hours (note: 2 hours is sufficient to achieve 98% PP conversion under these conditions, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4).

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, increasing the H2 pressure from 1 MPa to 2 MPa enhances the PP conversion from 92% to nearly 100% and increases the liquid yield from 65 wt% to 72 wt%. Further increasing H2 pressure from 2 MPa to 4 MPa hardly affects the conversion of PP or the yield of liquid. Nonetheless, higher H2 pressure results in greater H2 consumption (Supplementary Fig. 6), indicating that more C-C bonds are cleaved, producing short-chain hydrocarbons but they remain in the liquid phase. This is evidenced by the narrower carbon number distribution of the liquid as the H2 pressure increases (Fig. 1b). Notably, although the carbon number distribution narrows to C3-C18 with increased H2 pressure, it remains centered around C8, leading to an increased selectivity of jet-fuel-ranged hydrocarbons (C8-C16) up to 77% in the liquid, while maintaining liquid and gas yields at 75 wt% and 25 wt%, respectively. These results suggest that the over-cracking of lighter liquid hydrocarbons is suppressed, while the heavier hydrocarbons larger than C8 are selectively deconstructed. As previously reported26,27,28,37,38, the low H2 pressure and high reaction temperatures favor the formation of methane and ethane. This trend holds true in this proof test (Supplementary Table 1 lists C1-C2 values from Fig. 1b). However, Ru1-ZrO2 still keeps the methane yield below 0.2 wt% while maintaining liquid fuels (C5-C20) around 70 wt%, even under the reaction condition most greatly favoring methane formation.

The influence of H2 pressure on the composition of the liquid product is more pronounced than that on the gas product, as visually indicated by the color change of the liquid from orange to yellow to colorless with the increase of H2 pressure from 1 MPa to 4 MPa (Fig. 1c). This observation motivated us to prioritized Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectroscopy characterization for these liquid products. The absorption at 210–320 nm is present for all liquid products (Fig. 1d) but its intensity significantly decreases as the color of the liquid changes from orange to colorless. This adsorption can be attributed to the π-π* transition of aromatics40. To further confirm the formation of aromatics, the 13C−1H HSQC NMR was employed. Besides the correlation peaks assigned to -CH3, -CH2, and -CH groups (as marked in Fig. 1e), the correlation peaks at (1H: 2.0–2.5 ppm, 13C: 15–20 ppm) are observed and resulted from CHx- directly connected with aromatic rings. The presence of the signals at (1H: 6.7–8.0 ppm, 13C: 115–135 ppm)8 attributed to aromatic rings also confirmed the presence of aromatics in the liquid product (Supplementary Fig. 7). The relative concentration of aromatics in the liquid product decreases as the H2 pressure increases (Fig. 1f, plotted based on the calculation from Supplementary Fig. 8), which is consistent with the UV-Vis spectra results, indicating lower H2 pressure facilitates the formation of aromatics. These findings not only reaffirm the absence of methane even under reaction conditions favoring terminal C-C bond cleavage but also indicate the occurrence of dehydrogenation and isomerization during the hydrocracking reactions.

Identification of active site

This as-prepared Ru1-ZrO2 with 1.3 wt% Ru loading exhibits a tetragonal phase of ZrO2 with no diffraction peaks attributed to Ru in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Supplementary Fig. 9). The particle size of Ru1-ZrO2 is around 5 nm (Fig. 2a), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element mappings confirm that the absence of Ru clusters in the catalyst (Fig. 2b). The HAADF-STEM image shows bright atoms randomly doped in the lattice of ZrO2 (Fig. 2c), presumed to be Ru. Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra display a major peak corresponding to the Ru-O scattering path at ~1.5 Å in the first coordination sphere (Fig. 2d). The first-shell Ru-O coordination number (CN) is determined to be four based on EXAFS fitting (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 10). These results confirm that the Ru species in Ru1-ZrO2 is atomic Ru coordinated with four O atoms in the ZrO2 lattice. This is further supported by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 11), indicating that the Ru species in Ru1-ZrO2 are in an oxidized state rather than a metallic state.

Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2-TPR) was conducted to understand the impact of the interaction between ZrO2 and Ru on the reduction of the Ru and ZrO2 components in the catalyst. Supported 1.5 wt% Ru/ZrO2, 1.6 wt% Ru/SiO2 and as-prepared bare ZrO2 were used as references. To obtain the full TPR profiles in the range of 100–800 °C, none of these samples were pretreated in H2, ensuring that Ru remained in the oxidized state at the start of the H2-TPR measurement. A peak at 180 °C is observed for supported Ru/SiO2 and Ru/ZrO2 (Fig. 2f) and attributed to the reduction of RuO2 clusters39 to metallic Ru (confirmed by HRTEM in Supplementary Fig. 12). For as-prepared bare ZrO2, a peak around 600 °C is observed and attributed to the reduction of ZrO241. Unlike these two peaks, a significant peak around 500 °C is observed for Ru1-ZrO2. The peak is much closer in temperature to the ZrO2 reduction peak than to the RuO2 reduction peak, but its integration intensity is much higher than that of ZrO2 reduction peak. Quantitative analysis of these peaks indicates that the amount of H2 consumed by Ru1-ZrO2 is around 12 times higher than that consumed by supported Ru/SiO2, Ru/ZrO2, and ZrO2 (Supplementary Fig. 13). This result confirms the observation of HRTEM and EXAFS that no Ru clusters or nanoparticles are present in Ru1-ZrO2, and further indicates that the atomic Ru dopants render more O atoms in Ru1-ZrO2 reducible compared to as-prepared bare ZrO2. Therefore, it is confirmed that all Ru atoms were doped into the crystal of ZrO2, forming the moieties of Ru-O-Zr, where the O atoms were activated due to the doping of Ru.

None of the supported Ru/SiO2, Ru/ZrO2, and bare ZrO2 references show activity in the hydrocracking of PP (Supplementary Fig. 14). The significant difference between the active Ru1-ZrO2 and the inert references, as reflected in TPR profiles, is the prominent peak at 500 °C. We speculated that this peak-related structure, i.e., Ru-O-Zr, is relevant to the catalytic performance of Ru1-ZrO2. To verify this correlation, the Ru-O-Zr species were intentionally demolished by treating the Ru1-ZrO2 at 500 °C in a 20% H2/Ar flow of 50 mL/min for 0.5 hours (denoted as Ru1-ZrO2_500). We found that in Ru1-ZrO2_500, the disappearance of the Ru-O-Zr reduction signal in the H2-TPR profile (Fig. 2f) is accompanied by the loss of activity in PP hydrocracking, as demonstrated by the weight-balanced post-reaction solid residue (Supplementary Fig. 15) and the unchanged pressure during the reaction (Supplementary Fig. 16).

We further pursued which atomic site within the Ru-O-Zr moiety governs the internal C-C bond cleavage, so the changes in the Ru1-ZrO2 after H2 treatment at 500 °C were studied. It was found that Ru1-ZrO2_500 maintains the tetragonal phase of ZrO2 (XRD in Supplementary Fig. 17), and Ru remains atomic dopant within the ZrO2 crystal, as depicted by HRTEM (Supplementary Fig. 18) and EXAFS (Supplementary Fig. 19). However, XANES (Supplementary Fig. 20) and XPS (Supplementary Fig. 21) indicate that the oxidation states of both Ru and Zr shift toward their reduced states after H2 treatment. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and XPS analyses suggest no loss of Ru after this H2 treatment (Supplementary Table 3). The capability of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation involving H2 dissociation of the catalysts was further examined using an H2/D2 switch experiment. As shown in Fig. 2g, the integrated intensity of the HD peak on Ru1-ZrO2_500 is slightly higher than that on Ru1-ZrO2, but both of them are more than 8 times higher than that on supported Ru/SiO2 and Ru/ZrO2. This observation demonstrates that the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation capability of Ru1-ZrO2_500 is enhanced or at least maintained compared to Ru1-ZrO2. During this H2 treatment, the significant change in the Ru-O-Zr moiety is the removal of its O atom, as evidenced by the formation of H2O (H2-TPR-MS in Supplementary Fig. 22) and the decreased intensity of hydroxylic O in O 1 s XPS spectra42,43 (Fig. 2h). Therefore, we conclude that within the Ru-O-Zr moiety, it is the O atom, rather than Ru, that is the key site governing C-C bond cleavage in polyolefin hydrocracking.

Given the observation of isomerization during the hydrocracking PO, the acid sites were further studied. Pyridine-FTIR spectra (Fig. 2i) show only Lewis acid sites with a feature peak at 1444 cm−1 on the inert ZrO216. Upon doping with atomic Ru, another peak at 1540 cm−1, attributed to Brønsted acid sites16, is observed on Ru1-ZrO2. After in situ treatment of Ru1-ZrO2 at 500 °C in 20% H2/Ar (equivalent to Ru1-ZrO2_500), a significant decrease in the intensities of the FTIR peaks is observed, particularly for the peak attributed to Brønsted acid sites, indicating a dramatic decrease in the amount of acid sites. This result is further confirmed by the temperature-programmed NH3 desorption (NH3-TPD). The integrated intensity of NH3 desorption peak for Ru1-ZrO2 is 11 times higher than that for Ru1-ZrO2_500 (Supplementary Fig. 23). Moreover, the temperature for the complete NH3 desorption is observed up to 450 °C on Ru1-ZrO2, while it is only around 260 °C for Ru1-ZrO2_500. These results reveal a dramatic decrease in both the population and strength of the acid sites on Ru1-ZrO2 after H2 treatment at 500 °C. Given that both the activated atom after atomic Ru doping and the removed atom after the H2 treatment at 500 °C are the O atom of the Ru-O-Zr moiety, it is concluded that the O atom of the Ru-O-Zr moiety has a dangling H, which acts as the Brønsted acid site.

We further performed charge and chemical bonding analysis for Ru-O-Zr moiety with a dangling H on the Ru-doped ZrO2. Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis (Supplementary Fig. 24) revealed that, compared to ZrOHZr (assuming it exists), the bonding and antibonding O-H interactions in RuOHZr shifted to higher energy levels. This indicates that the O-H interaction in RuOHZr is relatively weaker, suggesting higher acidity of the OH group. Moreover, the integrated COHP values (Supplementary Table 5) show that the O-H bond distance in the RuOHZr moiety is longer than ZrOHZr and is closer to the Fermi level, further suggesting a weaker O-H interaction, i.e. a stonger acidity, in RuOHZr, which is in line with the results of NH3-TPD.

Mechanism of selective internal C-C bond cleavage

We performed the hydrocracking of n-octane, aiming to get a preliminary understanding of the way of PO hydrocracking on Ru1-ZrO2. The products from n-octane are also free of methane and ethane, predominated by iso-butane with a selectivity of 60% in the gas products (Supplementary Fig. 25a). This product distribution indicates that the isomerization followed by β-scission of the carbonium ion regime is the primary pathway in the hydrocracking of n-octane (details in Supplementary Fig. 25b). The methane-free branched products from the hydrocracking of longer-chain hydrocarbons (Supplementary Fig. 26), such as n-dodecane (C12) and squalane (C30), further verified this conclusion. With this understanding, we conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore why the products are free of methane and dominated by isomerized hydrocarbons during PP hydrocracking over Ru1-ZrO2.

During PP deconstruction, the formation of the more stable tertiary carbonium ion is favored over, primary and secondary carbonium ions44,45,46. For the production of lighter hydrocarbons, the tertiary carbonium ion forms at the terminal of the carbon chain either initially or as a result of precedent β-scission of an internal C-C bond (Fig. 3a). The β-scission triggered by the terminal tertiary carbonium ion (scissors-marked molecule in the left panel), forms one i-C4 molecule and a long-chain hydrocarbon with a secondary carbonium ion. Subsequent depolymerization from the resulting secondary carbonium ion of the residue long-chain hydrocarbon can proceed through three options: 1) isomerization (blue route), 2) direct β-scission (green route), or 3) rearrangement to form a tertiary carbonium ion (orange route). Regarding route 1), after isomerization there are two plausible C-C bond cleavage sites (marked with grey and red scissors) via β-scission, forming methane and i-C5, respectively. DFT calculations indicate that the reaction forming methane is energetically less favorable (∆E = −0.28 eV, Ea = 2.84 eV) than the other one forming i-C5 (∆E= −1.18 eV, Ea = 1.69 eV). Similarly, route 3) also has two C-C cleavage options (marked with grey and red scissors) via β-scission, and the one leading to ethane formation is less dominant than the other one forming i-C6. The reaction energy of β-scission to form propane is −0.82 eV in route 2), while it is an endothermic process to produce methane with a reaction energy of 1.20 eV.

Furthermore, reaction energy and transition state calculations (details in Supplementary Figs. 27, 28) demonstrated that route 1) isomerization (blue route) is kinetically and thermodynamically the most favorable pathway (primary pathway) among the three routes assessed. The prevalence of i-C4 and i-C5 as preferred gaseous products, stemming from route 1) indicated by DFT calculation, aligns well with the distribution of the gaseous species obtained from hydrocracking PP (Supplementary Fig. 3). In all pathways, the carbonium ion either succeeds and circularizes the hydrocracking loop to produce shorter-chain hydrocarbons or is terminated by a hydrogenation reaction.

The catalytic cycle of PO (PE or PP) hydrocracking on Ru1-ZrO2 is depicted in Fig. 3b. The PO is dehydrogenated on the atomic Ru site of the Ru-O-Zr moiety and then transferred to the Ru-neighboring O site, which is topped with a dangling H and functionalized as the C-C bond breaking site upon the doping of atomic Ru into ZrO2. On the O site, a carbonium ion forms, followed by isomerization or rearrangement and subsequent β-scission of the internal C-C bond, which is the rate-determining step. This process forms two shorter-chain hydrocarbons, one of which contains a new carbonium ion. The in situ-generated carbonium ion either undergoes a hydrogenation reaction to desorb or repeats the cycle of isomerization and β-scission. H2 dissociation competes with PO dehydrogenation over Ru and supplies surface H species for hydrogenation reaction or spillover to the Ru-neighboring O site for hydrocracking. This mechanism explains why PO dehydrogenation-induced aromatics formation is suppressed as H2 pressure increases. The atomic metal (Ru) and acid site (O) in close proximity substantially reduce mass transfer between them, resulting in high efficiency and inhibition of the side reaction of hydrogenolysis to methane.

Practice

The robustness of Ru1-ZrO2 was assessed by the cycling experiment. No decrease in liquid yield, which is maintained at around 70 wt%, was observed after 6 cycles (Fig. 4a). HRTEM and EDS mapping (Supplementary Fig. 29) revealed Ru species do not undergo aggregation after the reaction. Furthermore, EXAFS and XANES (Supplementary Fig. 30) confirmed the catalyst’s exceptional stability, with Ru remaining embedded as single atoms within the ZrO2 lattice after the reaction. In real practice, the one-pot upcycling of 100 grams of mixed post-consumer PP and PE wastes, such as lunch boxes, soft drink cups, masks, bags, pipets, packing films, over Ru1-ZrO2 at 300 °C under 3 MPa yields 85 mL of centrifuge-collected liquid (Fig. 4b). The hydrocarbon distribution (Supplementary Fig. 31) is identical to that derived from virgin polyolefins (Fig. 1b), consisting of 70% jet-, 80% gasoline- and 45% diesel-ranged fuels in the liquid (Fig. 4c), and 100% LPG in gas product (containing more than 70% C3-C4 hydrocarbons) without forming methane and ethane.

Driven by global initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and stringent environmental regulations, the demand for sustainable aviation fuel is on a rapid rise over the coming years, starting from 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45%47. The use of centrifugation to obtain 85 mL of liquid containing 70% jet-fuel-ranged hydrocarbons significantly lowers the cost of post-reaction product separation. It demonstrates the potential for scaling up the production of waste plastic-derived sustainable jet fuel. Furthermore, the absence of methane and ethane in the gas products (LPG) allows them to be directly liquified at ambient pressure, making them suitable for use in heating appliances, cooking equipment, and vehicles.

Synthesis of Ru1-ZrO2 and Ru1-ZrO2_500

Ru1-ZrO2 was prepared by the hard-template method. Typically, Zr(NO3)4•5H2O and Ru(NO)(NO3)x(OH)y were added to deionized water to form a solution. This solution was added to Carbon black powder which was used as the hard-template. The obtained mixture was dried at 80 °C for 12 hours, and then calcined in air at 500 °C for 6 hours to remove the Carbon black template. Before the hydrocracking reaction, the sample was pretreated in 20% H2/Ar with a flow rate of 50 mL/min at 275 °C (300 °C was used for pretreatment when the hydrocracking reaction temperature was 300 °C) to obtain Ru1-ZrO2. The loading of Ru in Ru1-ZrO2 used in this work was determined by ICP (Supplementary Table 3) at 1.3 wt%. The Ru1-ZrO2 catalyst was treated in 20% H2/Ar with a flow rate of 50 ml/min at 500 °C for 0.5 hours to obtain Ru1-ZrO2_500. The bare ZrO2 as the reference was prepared using the same method without loading Ru.

Hydrocracking reaction

In a typical hydrocracking reaction, PP, or PE, normal alkane (C8 and C12), or squalane (4 g), and the Ru1-ZrO2 catalyst (0.4 g) were loaded into a stainless steel autoclave batch reactor (25 mL). The reactor was then flushed with Ar under 0.4 MPa for 8 cycles, followed by 5 cycles of H2 flush with 0.5 MPa pressure above the target reaction pressure. Afterward, the reactor was pressurized with H2 to the target pressure (1–4 MPa) at room temperature. Then, the reactor was placed in its associated heater with a temperature controller and heated to target temperatures (250 °C or 300 °C) at a rate of 7.5 °C/min and maintained for target durations (2, 8 hours). Stirring with a rate of 600 rpm was engaged after the temperature reached 160 ± 5 °C. The temperature and pressure were automatically recorded once per minute during the entire reaction. At the end of the reaction, the reactor was cooled to and maintained at 10 °C for 15 minutes to equilibrate the gas and liquid product transformation before the product collection.

The hydrocracking of 100 g of post-consumer PP and PE plastic wastes with 10 g of catalysts was performed in a batch stainless steel autoclave with a volume of 1 L. The post-consumer products, such as lunch boxes, soft drink cups, masks, shopping bags, pipets, and packing films, were picked up from the trash bin and washed before the hydrocracking reaction. The procedure was the same as the mentioned above.

Product collection and analysis

Product collection and calculation

The products were collected and analyzed according to the method depicted in Supplementary Fig. 32. Gas product was charged to a gas sampling bag via the valve-connected tube on the cap of the reactor. The liquid products and insoluble solids, including the catalyst were then collected in a weighted centrifuge tube (\({M}_{T}\)), and then weighed and denoted as \({M}_{P}\). The liquid product was collected by centrifuging and stored in a vial for GC analysis later. The separated insoluble solids were kept in the centrifuge tube and then washed with n-hexane after drying at 80 °C for 24 hours (the products solved in the wash solution of n-hexane were mainly under C22 which was identical to that of centrifuging collected liquid. Only trace amounts of hydrocarbons C22-C25 was observed). The centrifuge tube with post-washed solids was dried at 80 °C in an oven for 24 hours, aiming to vaporize all the liquid, and then weighed as \({M}_{1}\).

The masses of products in different phases were calculated using the following formulas:

$${M}_{L}=\, {M}_{P}-{M}_{1}$$

(1)

$${M}_{S}=\, {M}_{1}-{M}_{T}-{M}_{C}$$

(2)

$${M}_{G}=\, {M}_{{Plastic}}-{M}_{L}-{M}_{S}$$

(3)

where \({M}_{L}\), \({M}_{S}\), \({M}_{G}\) and\(\,{M}_{{Plastic}}\) are the mass of liquid product, solid residue, gas product, and plastic substrate, respectively. The \({M}_{C}\) is the mass of the catalyst, in most cases in this study it is 0.4 g.

The yield of products (\({Y}_{i}\)) and conversion were calculated as follows:

$${Y}_{i}=\frac{{M}_{i}}{{M}_{{Plastic}}}\times 100\%$$

(4)

$${Conversion}=\left(1-\frac{{M}_{S}}{{M}_{{Plastic}}}\right)\times 100\%$$

(5)

where \(i\) is \(L\), \(S\), \(G\), representing liquid product, solid residue, and gas product, respectively. Given the mass of the H2 input and consumption was much less than that of plastic substrates, it was ignored when calculating the conversion of plastics.

Gas product analysis

The gas product collected in the gas bag was analyzed using a GC (Agilent 8890 Series) with a FID detector and a HP-PlOT-Q column. The method was established and calibrated by using a standard gas reference which involved methane of 0.1 mol%, ethane of 0.1 mol%, propane of 0.1 mol%, isobutane of 0.1 mol%, butane of 0.1 mol%, neopentane of 0.1 mol%, isopentane of 0.1 mol% and pentane of 0.1 mol%. A gastight syringe was used to inject 0.3 mL gas sample to quantify the relative ratio of C1-C6 hydrocarbons. A typical chromatogram showing the separation of species with retention time is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.

The mass yield of each component of the gas product can be calculated according to Eq. 6:

$${Y}_{{G}_{i}}=\frac{{A}_{i}}{{\sum }_{1}^{6}{A}_{i}}\times {Y}_{G}$$

(6)

where \({Y}_{{G}_{i}}\) is the yield of the gas hydrocarbon with the carbon number \(i\); \({A}_{i}\) is the chromatographic area of gas hydrocarbon with the carbon number as \(i\); \(i\) represents carbon number of 1-6; \({Y}_{G}\) is the yield of gas product obtained in equation (4).

Liquid products analysis

They were quantitatively analyzed on an Agilent 8890 gas chromatograph equipped with an Agilent HP-5 capillary column and FID. The inlet and detector temperatures were 300 °C, respectively. Typically, 1 μL of liquid product was injected into the chromatogram using a syringe. The standard n-alkanes C7-C40 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was used to establish the GC method and perform a quantitative analysis. A typical chromatogram for the liquid product and the standard mixture of n-alkanes (C7-C40) obtained from Sigma-Aldrich is shown in Supplementary Fig. 33. The same method was concurrently used for qualitative analysis using GC-MS. (A typical GC-MS result is shown in Supplementary Fig. 34).

The products for hydrocarbons based on carbon number can be calculated according to the following formula:

$${Y}_{{L}_{i}}=\frac{{A}_{i}}{{\sum }_{5}^{25}{A}_{i}}\times {Y}_{L}$$

(7)

where \({Y}_{{L}_{i}}\) is the yield of the liquid hydrocarbon with the carbon number \(i\); \({A}_{i}\) is the chromatographic area of liquid hydrocarbon with the carbon number as \(i\); \(i\) represents carbon number of 5-25; \({Y}_{L}\) is the yield of liquid product obtained in equation (4).

Mass balance examination

To calculate the mass balance, the mass yield of gas was measured independently by using the volume of the gas product combined with GC analysis as follows:

The pressure as a function of the gas volume in the reactor at 10 °C was established using a measuring bubbler. Therefore, the post-reaction gas volume can be calculated by using the pressure at the end of the reaction. Combined with the ratio of gaseous species mentioned above, the mass of each species can be calculated independently by using the formula below:

$${M}_{{G}_{i}}=\frac{\frac{{A}_{i}}{{k}_{i}}\times {W}_{i}\times {V}_{G}}{22.4}$$

(8)

Where \({A}_{i}\) is the chromatographic area of different carbon numbers; \({k}_{i}\) represents the correction factor for the respective component, which is established using 0.3 mL injection of standard gas reference mentioned above and shown in Supplementary Fig. 2; \({W}_{i}\) is the corresponding relative molecular weight; \({V}_{G}\) is the volume of the gas at the end of the reaction.

The mass balance was examined by:

$${mass\; balance}=\frac{{\sum }_{1}^{6}{M}_{{G}_{i}}+{M}_{L}+{M}_{S}}{\begin{array}{c}{M}_{{Plastic}}\\ \,\end{array}}\times 100\%$$

(9)

Where \({M}_{{G}_{i}}\), \({M}_{L}\) and \({M}_{S}\) are the mass of gas, liquid and solid residue. They are all measured independently based on the above methods. Given that the mass of the H2 input and consumption is much less than that of plastic substrates, it is ignored when calculating the mass balance.

Due to the mass loss of products during the independent collection of gas and liquid products and the error of measurements, particularly for the gas volume, the mass balance cannot meet 100% but all still keep the mismatch within 10%. The result of mass balance is shown in Supplementary Fig. 35.

In situ Pyridine-FTIR characterization

In situ Pyridine-FTIR was conducted in a vacuum cell with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer ThermoFisher iS50r equipped with an MCT detector. Ru1-ZrO2 sample was pressed to a wafer and loaded into the sample holder. Before pyridine adsorption, the Ru1-ZrO2 wafer was degassed under vacuum at 150 °C for 20 min and then cooled to room temperature. The background spectra of the samples were acquired in the vacuum before introducing pyridine vapor. The pyridine vapor was introduced into the cell by using a vacuum pump and kept until the intensity of the IR peaks did not increase. Subsequently, the cell was evacuated to remove gas-phase pyridine until the IR peak did not decrease at room temperature and then the wafer was heated to 450 °C to desorb pyridine. After the desorption, the Ru1-ZrO2 wafer was reduced at 500 °C for 30 min in 20% H2/Ar, aiming to in situ obtain Ru1-ZrO2_500. After this reduction, the wafer was cooled to room temperature, and the above procedure was repeated for pyridine adsorption/desorption. The ZrO2 was pressed to the wafer for Py-FTIR characterization as a reference. Due to the difference in transmittance and the weight of ZrO2 and Ru1-ZrO2 wafers in ex-situ measurements, the intensity of the peak at 1444 cm−1 was normalized to the spectra of ZrO2 and Ru1-ZrO2 in Fig. 2i.

H2/D2 exchange experiment

H2/D2 exchange experiment was performed at 250 °C and mass spectrometry was used to record the signal intensities. Typically, 50 mg catalyst was loaded into the reactor and 10% H2/Ar was introduced with a flow rate of 20 ml/min at 250 °C. After the stabilization of the mass spectrometry signal, the flow of 10% H2/Ar was switched to the flow of D2/Ar with a rate of 20 mL/min. The signal of M/Z = 3 (HD) was recorded throughout the process. After the testing of Ru1-ZrO2 was completed, the reactor was gradually heated to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min under the atmosphere of 20 ml/min 20% H2/Ar for in situ reduction for 0.5 hours, aiming to obtain the sample of Ru1-ZrO2_500 in situ. Subsequently, the reactor was cooled down to 250 °C to conduct the H2-D2 exchange experiment again for Ru1-ZrO2_500 catalyst.

Computational details

All DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation package (VASP 5.4.4)48,49. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with PBE exchange and correlation functional was used to account for the exchange-correlation energy49,50. The kinetic energy cutoff of the plane wave basis set was set to 400 eV. The threshold for energy convergence for each iteration was set to 10−5 eV. Geometries were assumed to be converged when forces on each atom were less than 0.05 eV/Å. Gaussian smearing of the population of partial occupancies with a width of 0.05 eV was used during iterative diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian.

The bulky ZrO2 unit cell in the tetragonal phase was first fully optimized. The optimized lattice vectors of a = b = 3.612 Å and c = 5.212 Å have a good agreement with the experiment parameters51. The most stable (101) surface of ZrO2 tetragonal phase was simulated by a 3×4×1 supercell slab model including three ZrO2 sub-layers (each includes two oxygen atomic layers and one Zr atomic layer) separated by a vacuum layer with a thickness of 15 Å along the surface normal direction to avoid spurious interactions between periodic slab models. The bottom two layers of ZrO2 were fixed, while the rest was allowed to relax during the geometry optimization. One Zr atom on the surface was replaced by Ru to create a Ru-O-Zr moiety. The lattice parameters were fixed throughout the surface calculations. Corrections for on-site Coulomb interactions by use of the DFT + U procedure were done with effective U = 4 eV for Zr. The Brillouin zone integration and k‐point sampling were restricted to the gamma point. The nudged-elastic band method with the improved tangent estimate (CI-NEB) was used to determine the minimum energy path and to locate the transition state structure for each elementary reaction step52. The transition state was confirmed by observing only one imaginary frequency corresponding to each reaction coordinate.

The alkane of C11 with the branched methyl groups was used as a model compound. The adsorption energy of the reaction intermediate was calculated as \({E}_{{ads}}\,=\,{E}_{{adsorbate}+{surface}}-\,{E}_{{adsorbate}}-\,{E}_{{clean}-{surface}}\). The activation energy (\({E}_{a}\)) of a chemical reaction was defined as the energy difference between the initial and transition states, while the reaction energy (ΔE) was defined as the energy difference between the initial and final states.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-57998-x/MediaObjects/41467_2025_57998_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-03-21 17:57:11.077852

Mendiratta said the Heathrow incident would have have a ripple effect for aviation that goes far beyond flight cancelations.
Heathrow Airport handled a record 83.9 million passengers in 2024 — up nearly 6% on the year prior — while its cargo transportation increased by 10%.
A third runway at Heathrow Airport has long been mooted, with its CEO putting pressure on the U.K. government to make a decision on the controversial expansion by the end of the year.
Meanwhile the aviation industry is pushing forward with sustainable aviation fuel deals to help meet decarbonization targets.","The closure of London's Heathrow Airport due to a nearby fire on Friday has put the focus on the aviation industry's ability to handle a crisis, according to a travel industry expert.

At the time of writing,Heathrow remained shut after a fire at an electricity substation that caused a power outage on Friday.

""The growth of the [aviation] industry is happening faster than the growth of infrastructure,"" said Anita Mendiratta, founder of consultancy AM&A, who stressed that aviation needs to become more resilient to incidents like an energy supply disruption, or to geopolitical or weather events.

The Heathrow outage is ""putting a spotlight on the need to make sure that the entire network of energy supply for any ... airport around the world has sufficient capability to address a crisis,"" Mendiratta told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Friday. ""All of this is a very dramatic learning curve.""

A back-up generator was also affected by the blaze, raising questions over the resilience of the supporting energy infrastructure, according to U.K. energy minister Ed Miliband, while Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) described Heathrow's reliance on a ""single"" power source as a ""clear planning failure"" by the airport.

In an emailed statement, Heathrow said it has multiple sources of energy. ""Our back up systems are safety systems which allow us to land aircraft and evacuate passengers safely, but they are not designed to allow us to run a full operation,"" Heathrow said.

Mendiratta said the Heathrow incident would have have a ripple effect for aviation that goes far beyond flight cancelations. She described the implications of the Heathrow incident as ""very wide,"" as the growth of aviation is outpacing the increase in supporting infrastructure, she said.

Mendiratta described the growth of aviation globally as ""massive.""

""It is extreme in terms of how it has grown far beyond even 2019 rates,"" she said. This raises questions over the industry's resilience to unplanned weather or geopolitical events and whether the surrounding infrastructure can support it.

Globally, both domestic and international air passenger traffic surpassed pre-Covid-19 levels in early 2024, according to IATA, and passenger numbers are expected to increase by an average of 3.8% annually to 2043, compared to 2023.

""Even though much of the focus of the story is very much on Heathrow and passengers, what we also need to take into account is over and above passenger traffic, over 4,000 tons of cargo go through Heathrow every single day,"" Mendiratta added.

Heathrow Airport handled a record 83.9 million passengers in 2024 — up nearly 6% on the year prior — while its cargo transportation increased by 10%.

Whether passengers can get compensation for canceled flights depends on their airlines' terms, Mendiratta said. As the Heathrow fire appears to be outside of airlines' control, such reimbursement may not be payable, according to a note issued by Citi on Friday.

Investors will consider short-term costs such as food and beverage, accommodation, alternative flights or land transport for passengers affected by cancelations, Mendiratta flagged, as well as looking at how airlines manage customer care in the long term.

""That, ultimately, is going to be the basis of customer retention, which from an investor point of view is going to be very important ... it's a significant calculation,"" she said.

A third runway at Heathrow Airport has long been mooted, with its CEO putting pressure on the U.K. government to make a decision on the controversial expansion by the end of the year. British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves said the extra runway was ""badly needed"" in a January speech.

Meanwhile the aviation industry is pushing forward with sustainable aviation fuel deals to help meet decarbonization targets.

""As we shift into the future and look at sustainable aviation, this is where infrastructure can now look at green technologies, which are vital to enable aviation to continue to grow, but grow in a healthy way,"" Mendiratta said.

The airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the corporate aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended fuel since 2021.
With the introduction of SAF mandates earlier this year, domestic sales of sustainable fuel are increasingly under threat from a lack of UK production and investment.
Farnborough Airport is uniquely positioned to advance this technology, given the smaller, more modern aircraft we operate and the significant economic value of the flights we support.
The announcement follows a series of milestones achieved by the airport in recent years.","Farnborough Airport, the birthplace of British aviation and Europe’s leading luxury airline hub, announced yesterday that it has signed a landmark deal with Hydrogen Refinery for 12.5 million litres or 10,000 tonnes per annum of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), produced locally from waste. The airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the corporate aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended fuel since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates earlier this year, domestic sales of sustainable fuel are increasingly under threat from a lack of UK production and investment.

The UK and EU have legislative obligations on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025, and how this fuel must be produced in the future. This is to ensure that over time advanced fuels can be developed to support the required growth in the production of this type of propellant, without incentivising farmers to switch from growing food to growing feedstock SAF, which today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids); however Hydrogen Refinery’s innovative technology can produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill.

Simon Geere, CEO of Farnborough Airport, commented: “The patented technology from e-fuel developer Hydrogen Refinery has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with sufficient proprietary supplies of SAF to become the first and only airport in the world to offer 20% blended fuel across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s target of 10% by 2030. Furthermore, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a key commercial enabler to kick-start domestic refining of SAF at scale, right here in the UK"".

He continued: “The transition to new refuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours that can support the higher upfront investment costs needed to make things happen. Farnborough Airport is uniquely positioned to advance this technology, given the smaller, more modern aircraft we operate and the significant economic value of the flights we support. As a local business, Hydrogen Refinery exemplifies the deep-rooted technological capabilities of companies that are part of Farnborough Airport’s aviation research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership that will generate significant local inbound investment and reinforce our ambitions to become a global sustainability showcase for airports around the world"".

The announcement follows a series of milestones achieved by the airport in recent years. In 2024, it achieved Level 4+ carbon accreditation from Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA), a distinction reserved for few airports in the UK, and one of the largest light-duty solar installations in the South East was completed, allowing it to self-produce 25% of its energy. Already in 2022, during a trial in preparation for the Farnborough International Airshow, the airport offered SAF at the same price as the traditional Jet A1, thus anticipating the adoption of the sustainable fuel by customers and setting the goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2030.",https://www.avionews.it/resources/originals/b2e917af1ec0af306e5c4114117f1022.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 12:57:18.188169

“On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel,” Airbus Canada CEO Benoît Schultz said in a news release.
Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with conventional aviation fuel (CAF), also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm.
Like all Airbus aircraft, the A220 already can operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel.","The first sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) delivery recently took place at the Airbus Canada’s A220 site, enabling teams in Mirabel, Quebec, Canada—home of Montréal–Mirabel International Airport—to use SAF for production, customer acceptance, and test flights.

Now, all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites around the world are using sustainable aviation fuel for internal operations. Additionally, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights this year, Airbus reported. The company expects to use 600,000 liters (158,503 gallons) of SAF with a 30% blend this year at the Airbus Mirabel site, resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 400 metric tons.

“On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel,” Airbus Canada CEO Benoît Schultz said in a news release. “This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress toward decarbonization by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites.

“It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF, too.”

In 2024, 18% of Airbus global fuel mix for the year was SAF, the company said. That’s more than 16 million liters of neat SAF. Alongside this, 75% of Airbus aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, representing the high priority customers are placing on decarbonization.

Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with conventional aviation fuel (CAF), also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping. Airbus Canada has the ambition to deliver SAF proof of sustainability to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025. SAF has been used in A220 aircraft delivered from the company’s A220 mobile final assembly line since 2016.

Like all Airbus aircraft, the A220 already can operate with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel. Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030.","https://img.bulktransporter.com/files/base/ebm/bulktransporter/image/2025/03/67dd7942be972796c5f78a39-saf_truck_at_airbus_canada.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-03-21 12:57:24.579976

The additional chargers help meet growing demand for electric vehicle charging infrastructure at Port Authority facilities, which support the agency’s industry-leading sustainability initiatives.
“More access to electric vehicle charging equipment helps advance our sustainability goals and reaffirms our agency’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.” With the new Revel charging station at the FHV lot adjacent to JFK Building 141, JFK now hosts a total of 46 EV fast charging ports that are operational at all times, helping to reduce charging wait times and improving traffic flow.
JFK’s 46 EV fast chargers for airport users will benefit both customers and FHV drivers seeking more fast-charging solutions.
In addition to supporting public access of EV charging infrastructure, the Port Authority and its operational partners have collaborated to incorporate more electric vehicles within airport operations as well.","The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey and Revel today announced the opening of an electric vehicle (EV) charging station at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) that more than doubles the airport’s available EV chargers. The 24 new chargers were funded and installed by Revel and Con Edison through its PowerReady program for electric vehicle infrastructure incentives helped. The new charging station is located within the airport’s for-hire vehicle (FHV) hold lot and is accessible via the Van Wyck Expressway or Belt Parkway.

The additional chargers help meet growing demand for electric vehicle charging infrastructure at Port Authority facilities, which support the agency’s industry-leading sustainability initiatives. The agency has specified plans to reach its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 through its comprehensive net-zero roadmap. That goal encompasses both the agency’s own emissions as well as those originating through the wide transportation ecosystem supporting its facilities. Traditional fast chargers will enable the transition of gas-powered to electric vehicles and contribute towards a reduction of approximately 3,720 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year.

“As we work toward a cleaner, more sustainable future, expanding access to electric vehicle charging infrastructure is a crucial step in reducing emissions,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “These fast chargers at JFK are a significant step forward in our broader efforts to support a greener transportation network.”

“The Port Authority and its private partners like Revel are leading the charge in building a net-zero future, and this latest expansion of two dozen more fast chargers at JFK is a major boost in that work,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “More access to electric vehicle charging equipment helps advance our sustainability goals and reaffirms our agency’s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.”

With the new Revel charging station at the FHV lot adjacent to JFK Building 141, JFK now hosts a total of 46 EV fast charging ports that are operational at all times, helping to reduce charging wait times and improving traffic flow. Widely available, easily accessible charging infrastructure is crucial in facilitating the shift to electric vehicles. JFK’s 46 EV fast chargers for airport users will benefit both customers and FHV drivers seeking more fast-charging solutions.

In addition to working with the Port Authority at the JFK lot, Revel will install the largest public fast-charging lot near an airport in the nation, with 48 fast charging ports outside LaGuardia Airport to support airport users, FHV drivers and the surrounding community. That lot will be located at 90-10 Ditmars Boulevard in East Elmhurst, Queens, where it is expected to open later this year.

“Reliable fast charging at New York’s airports, where rideshare drivers start and end their most valuable trips, will make or break our city’s electrification mandate,” said Frank Reig, co-founder & CEO of Revel. “We’re proud to partner with the Port Authority to bring the city’s fastest chargers directly to those drivers, first at JFK and later this year at LGA.”

“With these fast chargers and the ones coming to LaGuardia later this year, we’re taking great strides down the path towards a more sustainable and affordable city,” said NYC Taxi & Limousine Commissioner David Do. “Our airports are by far the biggest trip generators for hardworking TLC drivers. By prioritizing development of these charging hubs, the Port Authority and Revel are not only making life easier for thousands of EV drivers who need them right now, but also for the tens of thousands who will be converting to zero-emission vehicles in the coming years.”

“At Kempower, we are committed to accelerating the transition to electric mobility with our reliable and user-friendly DC fast charging solutions,” said Monil Malhotra, president of Kempower Inc., which manufactured the chargers installed by Revel. “We are proud to support the expansion of EV infrastructure at JFK Airport, ensuring that for-hire vehicle drivers and travelers have access to fast, efficient charging whenever they need it.”

“We’re proud that our PowerReady incentive program is enabling the expansion of JFK International Airport’s public fast charging network, helping to make the transition to electric vehicles more accessible for New Yorkers as well as visitors to our dynamic region,” said Raghu Sudhakara, vice president of distributed resource integration at Con Edison. “Additionally, we’re building a new substation complex in eastern Queens that will support the Port Authority’s broader electrification of the airport, helping the state meet its climate goals, as we maintain our nation-leading reliable electric service.”

Con Edison’s PowerReady incentive program supports the expansion of EV charging access by incentivizing buildout of a widespread EV charging network.

In addition to supporting public access of EV charging infrastructure, the Port Authority and its operational partners have collaborated to incorporate more electric vehicles within airport operations as well. Across the agency’s three major airports, 1,400 electric ground service vehicles and 775 electric ground service chargers are currently in use for equipment such as baggage tractors and airplane tows. Beyond EV infrastructure, the Port Authority has undertaken several other ambitious sustainability initiatives at its airports, including New York State’s largest rooftop solar array at JFK’s New Terminal One, the nation’s largest airport solar rooftop at Newark Liberty International Airport’s Terminal A parking garage, a solar array on JFK’s long-term parking Lot 9, and a solar rooftop at LaGuardia Airport. The agency is also committed to electrifying its light duty fleet by 2028 and nearly all of its ground service equipment at airports converted to electric by 2035.",https://metroairportnews.com/wp-content/uploads/54397773055_81dc9540cd_k.jpg,N,,2025-03-21 11:56:52.874194

As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem.
Looking forward, Airbus plans to continue to increase the use of SAF in its own operations, with a target of at least 30% SAF in its global fuel mix by 2030.","What do Toulouse, Hamburg, Mobile, Tianjin and Mirabel have in common? All of these Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

Thanks to this development, by the end of 2025, all Airbus customers, regardless of where they are taking delivery of their aircraft, can do so with SAF on board, free of charge. In 2024, 75% of the 766 aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend, and this is expected to increase soon, once aircraft deliveries using SAF begin at Mirabel later this year.

SAF remains a key lever for the aviation industry’s decarbonisation goals. SAF is anticipated to provide the bulk of the emissions reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimating that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions required.

In recent years, Airbus has been increasing the percentage of SAF used in its own operations to 16%, which includes business travel, delivery flights (where a plane is delivered to the home base of the purchasing airline following the transfer of title), and transportation of aircraft parts between different production sites.

To achieve this, Airbus has signed agreements with SAF providers like TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. Thanks to a partnership signed in 2024, TotalEnergies supplies more than half the SAF to meet Airbus’ needs in Europe. We have also joined forces with airlines. Volotea, which operates a Hamburg-Toulouse flight for Airbus employees as part of our internal shuttle service, has been using a 34% SAF blend on this route since 2022. And following a successful pilot in 2023, since 2024 Air France-KLM and Airbus have had a “SAF fares agreement”, with Airbus purchasing SAF options for employee business travel connecting Paris with five locations: Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich and Toulouse.

Partnerships and pilots

Looking further afield, in 2024, Airbus launched a pilot scheme with easyJet, who operate flights on the Toulouse-Bristol route, a popular route for business travel due to the proximity to Airbus’ Toulouse and Filton sites. Running between November 2024 and January 2025, the scheme saw Airbus finance 106 tonnes of SAF, the equivalent amount of fuel necessary to run flights between Toulouse and Bristol on a 30% SAF blend during the period.

In January 2025, Airbus, Wizz Air and Moeve and Charleroi Airport completed a SAF operational trial. Airbus provided technical guidance and expertise during the trial, which saw Wizz Air operate more than 50 flights using a blend of SAF and traditional jet fuel. A survey was also completed during this period, which shone a light on passenger awareness of, and attitudes towards, low-carbon aviation including SAF.

Scaling the SAF ecosystem

Even though the quantity of SAF available has increased in recent years, demand remains suppressed due to the higher cost of SAF compared to kerosene – 2.8x according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. The industry has to address this disparity and reduce the price gap with traditional fuel.

Although Airbus is not a SAF producer, there is a role it can play. As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem. In 2024, Airbus invested in SAFFA, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund. SAFFA focuses on SAF that is eligible for RefuelEU Aviation or CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) certification, although the investments can take place across different production pathways and regions. SAFFA’s first investment, in US-based Crysalis Biosciences, will help the company produce low-carbon intensity SAF and biochemicals.

In 2024, Airbus also made an investment in sustainable aviation fuels producer and technology company LanzaJet. Airbus’ investment supports LanzaJet in scaling its SAF production process which uses ethanol, known as the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway. LanzaJet recently opened a new SAF plant in Soperton, Georgia, with the capacity to produce 9 million gallons of SAF each year.

-

The first sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) delivery recently took place at the Airbus Canada’s A220 site, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for production, customer acceptance and test flights. This now means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites around the world are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

During the course of 2025, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights. This year alone, in 2025, over 600,000 litres of SAF with a 30% blend are expected to be used at the Airbus Mirabel site resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 400 metric tons.

Benoît Schultz, CEO Airbus Canada said, “On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too.”

In 2024, 18% of Airbus global fuel mix for the year was SAF. That’s more than 16 million litres of neat SAF. Alongside this, 75% of our aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, representing also the importance our customers are placing on decarbonisation.

Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with the conventional aviation fuel (CAF) also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping. Airbus Canada has the ambition to deliver SAF Proof of Sustainability (PoS) to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025. SAF has been used in A220 aircraft delivered from our A220 Mobile Final Assembly Line since 2016.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

The Airbus site in Mirabel is over 1.5 million square feet and includes, among others, a pre-final assembly line (pre-FAL), two final assembly lines (FAL), a customer response centre (CRC), a flight and integration test centre (FITC), and a brand new delivery centre.

The feasibility study, published by consultancy EY, lays out nine options for the site’s future. It cost £1.5 million to commission and follows a recent decision by the site’s owner, Petroneois, to decommission the oil refinery.

The report lays out nine possible proposals for the future industrial use of the site, selected as the most likely to attract private investment into the Grangemouth project. The nine projects include several proposals for waste recycling, such as breaking down hard-to-recycle plastics via hydrothermal upcycling, ABE biorefining, and chemical plastics recycling.

Several other proposals seek to take advantage of Scotland’s strong offshore wind sector by using low-carbon hydrogen. One proposal suggests using wind energy to create low carbon hydrogen to replace natural gas, while another suggests using low-carbon hydrogen on the site to produce methanol and convert it to sustainable aviation fuel, while a third proposal suggests producing low-carbon ammonia from hydrogen for shipping and chemical sectors.

The third category of proposals suggest using the site to create bio-feedstocks, including breaking down Scottish timber into bioethanol, setting up anaerobic digestion facilities, and converting Scottish cover crops into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel using low-carbon hydrogen.

Any industrial future of the site seeks to create jobs, with as many as 800 new jobs forecast to be created by 2040, as well as building on the industrial history of the area and the skills built up in the local population over the years the refinery has been operational. Energy minister Michael Shanks has stated that the UK and Scottish governments are committed to delivering a strong industrial future for Grangemouth, adding that they are dedicated to “leaving no stone unturned” in their mission.

The Grangemouth refinery is expected to be decommissioned in the second quarter of this year, putting the vast majority of its 475-strong workforce at risk of redundancy.

Funding the future

While the feasibility study seeks to attract private investment in the Grangemouth redevelopment, known as Project Willow, the British and Scottish governments have already committed significant funding to the site’s redevelopment as part of the government’s Plan For Change.

Last month, British Prime Minster Kier Starmer announced a £200 million funding package to unlock the full potential of the Grangemouth site, with Scottish First Minister John Swinney also announcing that a £25 million Grangemouth Just Transition Fund will be established to support businesses to bring forward investible propositions for the site over the next 12 months.

Furthermore, a £100 million Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package, delivered jointly by the Scottish government and UK government, has been announced, which will invest in local energy projects to create growth in the region and support the reskilling of workers in the local community.

The Scottish government has also said it will work together with DESNZ to deliver tailored skills support for former Grangemouth refinery workers, including the guarantee that any Grangemouth refinery staff member who would like to have skills training at a local college is supported with funding from the UK government, helping local workers into new, good jobs with local employers.

First Minister John Swinney said: “Everyone working at Grangemouth’s refinery – and in the wider industrial cluster – is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland’s economic and net zero future.

The aviation industry, a vital component of global transportation, faces a pressing challenge: how to decarbonize in the face of increasing demand for air travel. As it stands, aviation is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, which contribute significantly to carbon emissions. This reliance not only impacts the environment but also poses a threat to the industry’s long-term viability as climate change becomes an ever-looming crisis. In this context, the development of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) has emerged as a beacon of hope. SAFs are designed to provide a cleaner alternative to conventional jet fuels, significantly reducing the carbon footprint associated with air travel.

One innovative approach to producing SAFs is through solar technology, specifically solar-thermal processes that harness the sun’s energy to create fuels with minimal carbon emissions. This technology is gaining traction as researchers and companies alike seek ways to leverage renewable resources in the quest for sustainable energy solutions. The urgency of this endeavor cannot be overstated; as global temperatures rise and the impacts of climate change intensify, the aviation sector must adapt and innovate to meet both regulatory pressures and public expectations for greener operations.

Enter the groundbreaking work being done at the California Institute of Technology (2025 USNews Ranking: 6) (Caltech). Researchers there have made significant strides in developing a solar-thermal heating system capable of generating jet fuel without the carbon emissions traditionally associated with fossil fuel production. This innovative system utilizes sunlight to drive chemical reactions essential for fuel synthesis, showcasing a promising alternative to conventional methods that rely heavily on fossil fuels.

The photothermocatalytic reactor developed by the Caltech team operates solely on solar energy, incorporating a specially designed spectrally selective solar absorber that maximizes solar-thermal heating. This technology not only highlights the potential of solar energy but also reflects a broader trend in the renewable energy sector: the need for scalable, efficient solutions that can be deployed quickly and effectively.

The urgency of addressing carbon emissions in aviation is compounded by the industry’s projected growth. With more people flying than ever before, the demand for jet fuel is only set to increase. Traditional fossil fuels simply cannot meet this demand sustainably. Thus, innovative solutions such as those being developed at Caltech are not just beneficial; they are essential for ensuring the future of air travel aligns with global climate goals.

Moreover, the significance of solar-thermal technology in creating sustainable fuels cannot be overstated. As other countries and institutions explore similar avenues—like the solar syngas production initiatives in Europe—it’s clear that solar energy is poised to play a pivotal role in the transition to sustainable aviation. These advancements underscore the importance of collaborative research and innovation across the globe, as nations work together to develop the technologies that will shape a sustainable future.

So, what does this mean for the aviation industry? The breakthroughs achieved by Caltech researchers represent a critical step toward a future where air travel is not only feasible but also environmentally responsible. With the ability to produce jet fuel from renewable resources, the aviation sector can potentially reduce its carbon footprint significantly, paving the way for a more sustainable mode of transportation.

The multilayer structure of the absorber is a fascinating blend of materials—silicon, germanium, and gold, all layered atop a silver substrate—each selected for its unique properties that contribute to optimal energy capture and minimal heat loss.

Let’s break down how this reactor works, shall we? Sunlight penetrates through a quartz window, heating the solar absorber to high temperatures. This heat is then used to drive a chemical reaction known as ethylene oligomerization. Traditionally, this process would rely on fossil fuels, converting ethylene—a hydrocarbon derived from crude oil—into longer carbon chains that are essential components of jet fuel. However, what sets Caltech’s approach apart is that it accomplishes this transformation using only solar energy. The result? Liquid alkene products with carbon chains ranging from seven to 26 carbon atoms, all produced without the carbon emissions typically associated with fuel production. How cool is that?

What’s even more exciting is the reactor’s modular design, which allows for scalability. It’s built to integrate seamlessly with existing fabrication technologies and silicon solar panel infrastructure, making it a viable option for commercial applications.

A Shift Toward Accountability and Precision

As aviation embraces decarbonization, the question on many minds—corporate and individual alike—is simple: how much difference does sustainable aviation fuel really make? For years, this answer was vague. But now, a quiet leap forward is offering greater clarity.

IATA has upgraded its CO2 Connect calculator, integrating a new methodology to reflect emissions reductions made possible by sustainable aviation fuel. This move brings transparency and accuracy to the forefront—two factors crucial for stakeholders seeking verified climate impact data.

More Than a Calculator

CO2 Connect is not just a digital tool. It represents a significant cultural shift in how the industry views emissions data. Unlike many carbon calculators that rely on generalized assumptions, CO2 Connect is built on actual operational data shared by more than 60 participating airlines.

This direct data stream means that carbon figures are no longer approximations—they are reflections of real activity, from departure gate to cruising altitude. The enhanced system now considers sustainable aviation fuel use across an airline’s network and applies proportional reductions to passenger emissions.

Shared Reductions Now, Precision Later

Currently, the calculator spreads the benefit of SAF evenly across all flights in an airline’s network. This equal distribution simplifies reporting and ensures that all passengers benefit from the operator’s SAF commitment.

However, what makes this development especially compelling is what comes next. IATA plans to introduce route-specific reductions in future updates. This means emission calculations will eventually reflect the precise volume of SAF used on particular flights, giving travelers more relevant, route-level climate data.

Empowering Passengers and Companies

Travelers today are more climate-aware than ever. Corporations are making pledges aligned with science-based targets. But ambition alone is not enough—proof is essential. With CO2 Connect’s SAF integration, both individual flyers and corporate travel managers gain a clearer picture of emissions reductions.

This level of insight helps corporations evaluate the climate benefit of their SAF investments. It allows passengers to choose itineraries that align with their values. In essence, it translates intention into impact, and investment into measurable benefit.

A Standardized Method With Global Buy-In

At the core of the upgrade is the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology. This document defines how sustainable fuel usage should be calculated and reported per passenger. It brings alignment across airlines and encourages consistency across borders.

Standardization matters. Without it, data cannot be compared, scaled, or integrated into broader ESG strategies. By creating and deploying this methodology through CO2 Connect, IATA is offering more than numbers—it is offering a shared language for sustainability.

The Value of Collective Accuracy

The recent inclusion of airlines such as Air India, Air Astana, and Oman Air has brought the total number of CO2 Connect contributors to around sixty. Each airline adds a new layer of accuracy to the system. As participation grows, so does the precision of emission estimates.

This collaborative model turns a calculator into a living, evolving emissions index. It reflects the operational reality of global aviation, one data point at a time. And it does so in a way that grows more insightful with every new contributor.

Building Momentum for Broader Change

While CO2 Connect does not reduce emissions directly, it plays a catalytic role. By making emissions data more granular, traceable, and responsive to SAF usage, it encourages behavioral shifts across the industry.

For airlines, it creates an incentive to invest in SAF and declare it transparently. For consumers, it builds trust in sustainability claims. And for policymakers, it provides a robust example of voluntary alignment with best-practice reporting.

The journey to decarbonize aviation is long. But tools like this bring waypoints of progress. They make the invisible visible. And they help ensure that every drop of SAF, every operational improvement, every commitment made—counts.

Conclusion: Transparency is Taking Off

The upgraded CO2 Connect tool may seem technical, even niche. But its impact is expansive. It turns carbon math into climate meaning. It gives airlines the ability to demonstrate reductions, and travelers the ability to understand them.

In an era when sustainability risks being lost in a fog of vague metrics and overused promises, CO2 Connect stands out. It is grounded in real data, aligned with global standards, and designed for evolution. As the aviation sector climbs toward net zero, this is one tool that will help keep the path clear.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-45-6-1024x576-1.png,N,,2025-03-21 10:58:03.692142

Contrails are the streaks of cloud that trail behind high-flying aircraft. While they appear harmless, research now confirms their significant role in trapping heat in the atmosphere. These high-altitude clouds, formed in ice-supersaturated regions, reflect solar radiation but also retain Earth’s heat. This warming impact is comparable to that of aviation carbon dioxide emissions.

Unlike greenhouse gases that persist for centuries, contrails have a short lifespan. Yet their contribution to climate forcing is powerful and immediate. The urgency to act is clear. Reducing contrails offers a near-term opportunity to lower aviation’s climate impact while cleaner fuels and propulsion systems are still scaling up.

Why Contrails Matter in the Climate Equation

Aircraft engines emit not just carbon dioxide but also soot and water vapor. When these emissions enter cold, humid areas of the upper troposphere, the soot particles serve as a nucleus for ice crystal formation. These crystals develop into visible contrails. Some disperse within minutes, but others linger, creating contrail cirrus that resembles natural cirrus clouds.

The problem lies in their heat-trapping potential. Contrail cirrus behaves like insulation. It reflects some sunlight but blocks a greater amount of heat from escaping back into space. The net result is surface warming. Even though they dissipate quickly, their cumulative effect, especially on flight-intensive routes, can rival carbon emissions in warming impact.

Smart Solutions to a High-Altitude Challenge

To address contrails, the aviation sector is exploring three strategic pathways. Each presents its own mix of feasibility, effectiveness, and long-term value.

Treating Conventional Jet Fuel

Reducing the aromatic content in jet fuel lowers soot emissions. Less soot means fewer ice crystals and fewer persistent contrails. Hydrotreating fuels is a proven process, but it is energy intensive and carbon heavy. While it offers immediate contrail mitigation, it may not be a sustainable long-term solution due to its carbon cost.

Using Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is both low-carbon and low-soot. When SAF burns, it releases fewer particulates, significantly cutting contrail formation. But supply remains limited. To maximize impact, researchers suggest blending higher concentrations—up to 50 percent—and reserving this fuel for flights that are most likely to produce warming contrails. This targeted approach can be up to fifteen times more effective than uniform low-percentage blends across all flights.

Adjusting Flight Paths

Contrails form only in specific atmospheric zones. With better forecasting and AI-supported satellite data, pilots can avoid these regions by making small altitude adjustments. Early trials show promise. However, real-time implementation requires coordination with air traffic control and is most practical on low-traffic night flights across the Atlantic, where contrails tend to form and persist most frequently.

Making Policy Work for the Climate

Contrails present a different challenge than carbon dioxide. They are unpredictable, harder to track, and variable in effect. For this reason, integrating non-carbon aviation effects into policy requires bespoke frameworks. A blanket focus on carbon reduction may miss the opportunity to address contrails with high-impact, near-term action.

Policymakers could consider contrail-specific mitigation as a separate pillar. This could include incentives for targeted SAF use, funding for atmospheric modeling, and air traffic protocols that support altitude adjustments for climate optimization.

Looking at the Bigger Picture

Addressing contrails is not a distraction from carbon goals. Rather, it complements them. Both need attention. Sustainable aviation must include measures for both long-lived and short-lived climate pollutants. While carbon neutrality may take decades, reducing contrails can yield benefits in years.

Moreover, tackling contrails builds operational experience in climate-smart flying. It opens doors to intelligent routing, improved weather analytics, and strategic fuel deployment—foundations for the net-zero aviation future.

Conclusion: A Clearer Path to Climate-Friendly Skies

Contrails are no longer just a curiosity of high-altitude travel. They are a key part of aviation’s warming footprint and represent an underutilized opportunity for impact. With a blend of sustainable fuels, smarter routing, and refined policy, the aviation industry can start reducing its skyprint now.

Momentum is building. Research continues to refine the tools and models needed for contrail mitigation. As global climate goals tighten, practical and effective strategies like these deserve a place at the decision table.

By acting on contrails today, the aviation sector can offer not just lower emissions tomorrow but cooler skies right now.

We are excited to partner with Farnborough Airport to help make their sustainability vision a reality.""","Farnborough Airport has signed a landmark deal with Hydrogen Refinery for 12.5 million litres per annum of sustainable aviation fuel to be produced locally from waste.

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38 per cent blended SAF since 2021.

With SAF mandates taking effect in 2025, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly threatened by the lack of production and investment within the UK.

The UK and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates for SAF usage starting in January 2025. These regulations aim to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support growth in SAF production without encouraging the diversion of agricultural land from food production.

SAF is currently almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), but Hydrogen Refinery's technology can produce carbon-negative SAF from mixed waste products sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, chief executive at Farnborough Airport, said: ""We are excited to be forging an alliance with Hydrogen Refinery. Their technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF to become the first airport to offer a 20 per cent blend across its entire supply by 2028, ahead of the UK Government's target of 10 per cent by 2030. This aligns with our ambitions to be an incubator for sustainable technologies and support domestic SAF refining at scale.

""Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller, modern aircraft we handle and the economic value of the flights we support. Hydrogen Refinery exemplifies the technological capabilities of companies within Farnborough Airport’s aeronautical research heritage, reinforcing our ambitions to become a global sustainability showcase for airports.""

The project, privately funded and operated by leading waste-to-value infrastructure developer Nexus W2V, is poised to deliver significant economic and environmental benefits to Northwest Indiana and the greater Chicago area, including increased American domestic production of natural gas from food waste.

“Today marks a pivotal moment for Indiana as we solidify our position as a national leader in domestic energy production and waste management,” said State Sen. Mike Bohacek (R-Michiana Shores). “The Kingsbury Bioenergy Complex is not just a facility; it demonstrates our commitment to energy independence, job creation and a more sustainable future for all Hoosiers.”

The facility is part of a $140 million planned investment by W2V and will process 200 tons of organic waste daily, such as food scraps and processing byproducts, to convert them into renewable natural gas. This will help minimize costs and waste, as more than 40% of food produced in the U.S. (nearly 915 pounds per person) is discarded, costing Americans an average of $1,500 per person annually to collect and landfill. By diverting this waste from landfills, the facility will significantly reduce this inefficiency, create American-made energy and jobs, and contribute to a more sustainable waste management ecosystem.

“We are pleased to see growth in the energy sector and opportunities for jobs and development at Kingsbury Industrial Park,” said local resident and La Porte County Council President Adam Koronka.

The Kingsbury Bioenergy Complex will be a major economic engine for Northwest Indiana. At peak construction, it will generate 50-60 well-paying jobs, followed by dozens of long-term positions once operations begin. By investing in local talent and infrastructure, Nexus W2V aims to actively contribute to the region economically while creating a more efficient solution for organic waste in and around the area.

“The Kingsbury Bioenergy Complex represents an incredible opportunity to make a lasting impact on the environment and create a more circular economy. We’re thrilled to partner with Indiana on this landmark project,” said Roshan Vani, CEO of Nexus W2V. “This is a decisive step toward a future where waste is transformed into a valuable resource.”

The project is projected to avoid 4 million tons of carbon over 20 years—and its natural gas production will be equivalent to powering 45,700 homes. The site will process approximately 2 million tons of organic waste in its lifetime, increasing the lifespan of existing landfills and producing sustainable soil products to support agricultural and environmental health. The facility also addresses today’s critical environmental challenges of providing an alternative to traditional waste disposal methods for large cities in the region and generating multiple revenue streams for the local community from waste transformation.

The project's strategic location capitalizes on the region's unique advantages. The complex is well positioned to serve local and regional waste management needs across multiple interstates, has access to the rail network, and is in close proximity to Chicago's robust food production industry, giving waste haulers an environmentally responsible alternative to traditional landfill disposal.

“Indiana continues to lead the nation in attracting forward-thinking investments in energy and waste management solutions,” said State Rep. Jim Pressel (R-Rolling Prairie). “With our strong infrastructure, skilled workforce, and commitment to business-friendly policies, we are the perfect location for projects like the Kingsbury Bioenergy Complex. As a bonus, Indiana is setting an example for the rest of the country on how to balance economic growth with efficiency.”

The facility recently broke ground and is scheduled for completion in late 2026.

Finnair and DB Schenker have initiated their sustainability collaboration by signing an agreement for DB Schenker to purchase nearly 400 tons of scope 3 CO2e reductions, equalling approximately 120 tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from Finnair.

Both companies are committed to increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to air cargo transport.

Finnair has set a science-based target to reduce its carbon emissions intensity (CO2e/RTK) by 34.5% by 2033 from a 2023 baseline.

The target has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Like others in the industry, Finnair is aiming towards net-zero emissions by 2050.

Gabriela Hiitola, senior vice president, Finnair Cargo says: “Our toolkit for reaching the target comprises investing in sustainable aviation fuels beyond regulatory requirements, further improving operational efficiency, optimizing our network, and investing in new aircraft technology.

“This agreement with DB Schenker marks an important milestone in our decarbonization efforts and we are thrilled to partner with such a pioneering company, placing key focus on this important matter.

“Air freight industry needs to address the climate challenge together, and partnering with like-minded stakeholders within the value chain is essential”, .

By co-funding SAF with Finnair, DB Schenker receives a verified scope 3 emissions reduction certificate, proving its contribution to decreasing air cargo-related emissions.

All Airbus Facilities Now on SAF

This achievement means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites worldwide are now operating with SAF for internal operations.

This global integration of SAF underscores Airbus’ dedication to embedding sustainable practices throughout its manufacturing processes.

Furthermore, the manufacturer has announced that by 2025, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights. This will significantly expand the accessibility of greener fuel options.

Mirabel SAF Consumption

The impact of this shift is already tangible. In 2025 alone, the Airbus Mirabel site anticipates using over 600,000 liters of a 30 percent SAF blend. This substantial volume is projected to result in a reduction of approximately 400 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada, highlighted the significance of this milestone. “On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonization by 2050.”

“It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too.”

The numbers speak for themselves. In 2024, 18 percent of Airbus’s global fuel mix was SAF, translating to over 16 million liters of neat SAF. Additionally, 75 percent of Airbus aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, demonstrating the growing importance of decarbonization to customers.

Blended SAF

The management of SAF at the Mirabel site adheres to the mass balance principle. Once delivered, the SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel (CAF), also known as Jet-A1, within the site’s fuel farm.

This dilution process is conducted according to established standards and auditable bookkeeping, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Airbus Canada is aiming to provide SAF Proof of Sustainability (PoS) to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025, further solidifying their commitment to sustainable practices.

Notably, the A220 has been operating with SAF from the A220 Mobile Final Assembly Line since 2016.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is currently certified to operate with up to 50 percent SAF.

Looking Ahead

Looking ahead, Airbus has set an ambitious goal for all its aircraft to be capable of running on 100 percent SAF by 2030, marking a significant step towards a fully sustainable aviation future.

The Airbus site in Mirabel is a sprawling facility spanning over 1.5 million square feet. It encompasses a pre-final assembly line, two final assembly lines, a customer response center, a flight and integration test center, and a brand-new delivery center.

This state-of-the-art facility is home to over 3,500 Airbus employees, all contributing to the company’s mission of innovation and sustainability.

By embracing SAF and implementing sustainable practices across its operations, Airbus is setting a new standard for the aviation industry.

The recent SAF delivery at the Mirabel site furthers the manufacturer’s commitment to a greener future for air travel.

Produced through the electrolysis of water using electricity from renewable energy sources like solar and wind, renewable hydrogen offers a clean alternative to fossil fuels and is a crucial component in the clean energy transition.

Renewable hydrogen is also critical to decarbonise certain industries where electricity from renewables won’t be enough. These areas are typically defined as hard-to-abate sectors and include things like aviation, maritime, steel and alumina industries.

Take aeroplanes for example. If you want to power an aeroplane with electricity, the sheer amount and size of the batteries that would be required for a long-distance flight would add so much weight to the plane it would be commercially unviable and a safety hazard.

Renewable hydrogen can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a solution to the aviation decarbonisation challenge. Down the road, the hope is it will be a lynch pin to create electrofuels (e-fuels). E-fuels are synthetic fuels in gas or liquid form made from renewable energy sources.

The issue is renewable hydrogen is currently expensive to produce, and the cost is one factor that is stalling projects and wide-spread market adoption in Australia.

With current technology, it costs $6-$9 to make 1 kilogram (kg) of renewable hydrogen. The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) knows the cost needs to be brought down for hydrogen to be sold at a competitive price. A drop in the cost to produce renewable hydrogen is one method of accelerating the clean energy source to be widely adopted across the market and drive down emissions.

There are also other opportunities to improve project economics and therefore lower the potential sales price of renewable hydrogen as technology moves forward. One of these potential revenue streams is pure oxygen.

In certain projects, the use of pure oxygen could help to make renewable hydrogen more commercially viable in the years to come.

Pure oxygen

Electrolysis is a process that makes renewable hydrogen. This is a process where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen through an electrolyser with the use of electricity from renewable energy sources. It’s completely emissions free.

Oxygen is a byproduct of this process. For every 1kg of renewable hydrogen there is 8kg of oxygen left behind.

Many industries can use the byproduct such as the medical field or to help in other emissions reductions through applications such as wastewater treatment.

ARENA is supporting projects to explore ways to use pure oxygen as a byproduct to help drive renewable hydrogen’s commercial viability. The oxygen can also help meet emissions reduction targets through its application in other industries. It’s a win-win for industryand the Australian public as we move forward to a net zero future.

Pure Oxygen and use for wastewater treatment

Last year, ARENA committed $3 million in funding to Barwon Water for the Green Oxygen for Wastewater Treatment project.

The project aims to use pure oxygen from Viva Energy’s renewable hydrogen production plant in Geelong in the treatment of wastewater at Barwon Water’s Northern Water Plant.

ARENA supplied $34 million to Viva Energy to build ‘Australia’s first commercially scaled and publicly accessible hydrogen refuelling station.’

A circular economy will result from the collaboration where pure, clean oxygen is fed to Barwon Water’s treatment plant and wastewater is treated through oxygenation. The clean water will then be available for Viva Energy to use in the production of renewable hydrogen for its fuelling station.

Australia has over 1200 wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which contribute more than 2.95 million tonnes of CO2 in Australia. The project seeks to not only make renewable hydrogen more commercially viable through use of its byproduct, but it also serves a further emissions reduction opportunity.

Wastewater treatment remains one of the largest and most challenging sources of emissions in the water utilities sector, according to the Australian Water Association (AWA).

Science behind oxygenation and wastewater treatment

Wastewater treatment is a critical process to remove contaminants from water to make it safe for discharge or reuse. Oxygenation is a key step in this treatment.

When added into water, oxygen supports the growth of beneficial microorganisms. These microorganisms break down organic matter and other pollutants, effectively cleaning the water.

Traditionally, wastewater treatment plants use air, which is only about 20% oxygen. To pump the air through the wastewater, it requires energy. According to Barwon Water, this process takes up 50-70% of the energy used in the process.

Oxygen has a 90% purity and would enhance the activity of the microorganisms, allowing them to break down pollutants faster and more efficiently. This process would drastically reduce energy use and lower emissions for wastewater treatment.

Oxygen use at Barwon Water will not only improve the efficiency of the treatment but also provide a valuable use for the oxygen that would otherwise go to waste.

Real world impact

The project will be in two stages.

In the first stage, Barwon Water will complete a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study to determine the technical and economic feasibility of the concept.

If successful, the project will move to the second stage, which involves a two-year demonstration of the use of oxygen sourced from Viva Energy’s electrolyser, at the Northern Water Plant.

The collaboration between ARENA and Barwon Water is a shining example of how innovative thinking and collaboration can drive positive change. By harnessing the power of renewable hydrogen and improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment, this project is paving the way for a more sustainable future.

As technology continues to advance, the potential for similar projects to be implemented across Australia and beyond is substantial.

The lessons learned from the project could inspire other regions to adopt similar approaches, furthering the global transition to a cleaner, greener future.

Expanding the vision

Integration of renewable hydrogen production with other industrial processes, can create a more interconnected and efficient energy system.

Industries that require large amounts of oxygen, such as steel manufacturing or chemical production, could benefit from the surplus oxygen generated during electrolysis. This would not only improve the efficiency of these industries but also reduce their environmental impact and commercial viability.

The success of the Barwon Water and Viva Energy project could serve as a model for other regions and countries looking to enhance their sustainability efforts.",https://arena.gov.au/assets/2025/03/AdobeStock_215987645-scaled-e1742522489398.jpeg,N,,2025-03-20 22:57:16.523836

The measure unanimously passed out of an Illinois Senate committee on Thursday.","After months of community engagement, the Illinois House and Senate are endorsing a bill that would ban carbon sequestration near the Mahomet Aquifer.

This comes after the Senate put a proposed ban on hold last fall to better study the technology and its environmental risks. Carbon capture technology involves injecting climate warming CO2 deep underground.

Advocates say the ban would protect the aquifer from possible leaks that could lead to contamination of a major water source for much of Central Illinois.

A year ago, Illinois placed a two-year pause on carbon sequestration.

Much of Republican State Sen. Sally Turner's district is served by the Mahomet Aquifer. She's said she's open to carbon capture, but not near the aquifer.

“The biggest thing for me is it's a sole sourced aquifer. It's the water for over a million people. I think that it's really important that we make sure and safeguard that area,” said Turner, adding that protecting the aquifer, so far, has been bipartisan effort.

""Everybody has a source of drinking water wherever they are throughout the state,"" Turner said. ""How would this affect me if it happened to me in my area? So, I think that's how they all look at it. And don't get me wrong, we all want jobs. We all want economic development. We just need to put this process in the right place.”

Even with the bipartisan support, Turner said she and chief sponsor Sen. Paul Faraci, D-Champaign, are ready for further discussion with opponents.

“If there's something that needs to be tweaked to assist in another avenue that would help all the way around, I think Sen. Fauci is willing to look at that,” Turner said. “But we haven't heard what those things are they're looking for. So, we're waiting to see what those things are.”

Andrew Rehn is director of climate policy at the Prairie Rivers Network, a Champaign-based environmental group. Rehn said polluting the aquifer is not worth the risk, citing carbon capture leaks at ADM last year.

“While policy decisions often involve how much risk do we want to take for said economic benefit, for the Mahomet Aquifer, the tolerance has got to be zero,” Rehn said. “And that means that any number you come up with on how much risk you want to take is not appropriate in the Mahomet Aquifer.”

Rehn isn’t opposed to carbon sequestration as a practice, but thinks it should be done someplace else.

“We're taking our aquifer, our sole source of drinking water, and we're proposing to do an experiment under that aquifer doesn't make sense,” Rehn said. “Let's do this somewhere else. Let's not do it under the aquifer. Let's not induce those risks, whatever those risks might be. Let's make sure the risk is zero for a sole source of drinking water.”

Republican State Sen. Chris Balkema who represents parts of Bloomington-Normal is not a sponsor of the bill, but said the issue deeply affects those he represents.

Balkema said he, too, is worried about the possible leaks, but also acknowledges the technology's potential. In his district, companies are working to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

“We have to grow jobs in Illinois,” Balkema said. “We have to find ways for these companies to produce sustainable aviation fuel, and we gotta do all of the above, protecting the environment and the water source, while not losing out to companies outside of Illinois.”

Balkema said he is ready to discuss the issue further on the Senate floor when it heads there April 1.

Brazil central bank raises target rate to 14.25pc

Sao Paulo, 20 March (Argus) — Brazil's central bank raised its target interest rate by 1 percentage point to 14.25pc amid accelerating inflation in a decelerating — but still heated — economy. The hike in the target rate, announced Wednesday, was the fifth in a row from a cyclical low of 10.5pc at the end of September last year, partly prompted by accelerating depreciation of the currency, the real, to the US dollar. Brazil's annualized inflation hit 5.06pc in February and is poised to keep accelerating. The bank's Focus economic report increased its inflation forecast to 5.7pc for the end-of-year 2025 from 5.5pc in January, when the bank's policy-making committee last met. Brazil's current government has an inflation ceiling goal of 3pc with tolerance of 1.5 percentage point above or below. The bank has recently changed the way it tracks the inflation goal. Instead of tracking inflation on a calendar year basis, it now monitors the goal on a rolling 12-month basis. The bank cited heated economic activity and a strong labor market as factors that have contributed to rising inflation. But the bank forecasts ""modest GDP growth"" for Brazil of almost 2pc in 2025, down from 3.4pc growth last year. Further tightening will also be linked to global economic uncertainty prompted by US president Donald Trump's aggressive trade and other policies and the monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve , according to the bank. Brazil's target interest rate is expected to keep rising at the bank's next meeting in 6-7 May, albeit to ""a lesser extent"" as the contributing factors are set to moderate, according to the committee.

TotalEnergies confirmed the planned 400,000 t/yr HVO and HVO jet fuel (SAF) plant, near Paris, will not start in 2025 as previously outlined. Instead, a first phase of 210,000t of SAF output is slated to begin operations ""early in 2026."" TotalEnergies said there will then be a second phase of 75,000t, which will start at an unspecified point in 2027, giving 285,000 t/yr. If all production is SAF this would be equivalent to around 6,155 b/d. The CGT union said its members at Grandpuits downed tools for 24 hours yesterday, 19 March, as a result of the company's announcement.

UK study sets out Grangemouth's post-refining future

Edinburgh, 19 March (Argus) — A government-funded study has identified nine potential low-carbon and renewable options for the Grangemouth site in Scotland following the planned closure of its 150,000 b/d refinery in the second quarter this year. The nine possible projects outlined in the Project Willow study centre around waste, bio-feedstocks and industries supporting the development of offshore wind. They could benefit each other through synergies and create up to 800 direct jobs, but their success ""will require significant contributions from both the public and private sector"", with an initial £3.5bn ($4.5bn) in capital investments needed, the study said. The £1.5mn report, paid for by the UK and Scottish governments, was commissioned by Grangemouth refinery operator Petroineos, which announced in November 2023 that it was going to close the plant and convert it into a fuel import terminal. The UK and Scottish governments have since set aside £25mn and £200mn for Grangemouth, along with other initiatives such as Scotland's £100mn Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package. The study's 'waste' pathway comprises a hydrothermal plastic recycling project, a dissolution plastic recycling facility and a bio-refining project relying on bacterial fermentation (ABE). Under the 'bio-feedstock' pathway, the study envisages a second-generation bioethanol plant on Scottish timber feedstock and an anaerobic digestion facility using organic waste to produce biomethane. Second-generation bioethanol refers to ethanol made from non-edible resources such as biomass. This pathway also suggests a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, with production made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). UK trade union Unite has been supportive of this option , but Petroineos deemed it unviable ""under current regulatory conditions"". The third pathway — called conduit for offshore wind — is mostly focused on hydrogen. It includes fuel switching, producing jet from e-methanol and methanol as well as producing low-carbon ammonia for the shipping and chemicals industry. The second-generation ethanol plant and the HEFA facility, as well as the e-methanol and e-ammonia projects, would have a longer 2030-40 timeline, against a 2028-30 timeline for the other projects. The projects would benefit from existing infrastructure such as Grangemouth's port, which includes container, bulk and liquid fuel terminals. ""There are also opportunities to reuse existing tank storage, ethanol facilities, and other ancillary assets at the site,"" the study said. Unite has criticised the study's project timelines, pointing out most would start years after the refinery had closed, by which time jobs would have been lost. Many of the projects ""could be fast tracked and implemented now"", including converting the refinery to SAF production, the union said. ""Project Willow was created by Petroineos as a fig leaf to justify its act of industrial vandalism of shutting the refinery and axing jobs. It asked the wrong questions and then failed to provide the answers that Grangemouth refinery workers need,"" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. ""There are projects like SAF production which can be swiftly enacted to protect jobs and those opportunities must not be lost. This would pave the way for the UK to become a world leader in green aviation."" By Caroline Varin Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

LowLands signs biomethanol deals with shipping firms

London, 18 March (Argus) — Dutch renewable methanol producer LowLands has signed several bio- and low carbon-methanol supply agreements with shipping firms, its chief executive Gijs Bakker said. The value of these agreements surpasses €1bn and is ""rising fast"", Bakker said. The supply will come from LowLands' 120,000 t/yr biomethanol facility in Moerdijk, Netherlands, which will use waste wood and municipal waste as feedstock. Bakker highlighted that the location at Moerdijk will offer ""logistical advantages"" to clients in Rotterdam and Antwerp. He said that the product price is very competitive compared with e-methanol, with a discount rate of 40-50pc. Production at the plant was initially scheduled to begin in 2024, but has been delayed until end of 2027 or early 2028, because of ""war and its consequences on utility pricing"", LowLands told Argus . ""[Northwest Europe] has excellent infrastructure for collecting bio-wastes"", Bakker said. ""This makes [it] a preferred location for biomethanol production units."" He noted that the slower-than-expected development of green hydrogen capacity means biomethanol from biogenic carbon will remain competitive for longer. International offtake agreements for renewable methanol are on the rise with the January rollout of the FuelEU maritime regulation, which could increase demand for biomethanol in shipping. Ship operators traveling to, out of, and within EU territorial waters must reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity on a lifecycle basis by 2pc. The cuts will reach 6pc from 2030 and gradually reach 80pc by 2050. Shipping firm Maersk has signed several letters of intent for procurement of biomethanol and e-methanol from producers including Norway's Equinor , Switzerland's Proman and Dutch-based chemical company OCI Global , and has an agreement with Chinese wind turbine manufacturer Goldwind for 500,000 t/yr from 2024. Maersk sees biomethanol and e-methanol as likely the most competitive and scalable pathways to decarbonisation this decade.

Now, researchers working on the Kopernikus P2X project have succeeded for the first time in coupling—at an industrial 220-kilowatt scale—the highly efficient co-electrolysis process with fuel synthesis.
Co-electrolysis makes power-to-liquid more efficient For the production of synthetic kerosene at KIT's Energy Lab, a multi-stage process distributed to modular facilities is used.
Up to 85% of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.
""This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.""","Fuels like kerosene can be produced in a climate-friendly way from CO2, water and green electricity using power-to-liquid processes. Researchers from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) have already demonstrated this with systems in actual operation.

Now, researchers working on the Kopernikus P2X project have succeeded for the first time in coupling—at an industrial 220-kilowatt scale—the highly efficient co-electrolysis process with fuel synthesis.

In order to achieve its climate targets, Europe needs green alternatives for applications that do not easily lend themselves to electrification. ""The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,"" says Professor Roland Dittmeyer from KIT's Institute for Micro Process Engineering (IMVT).

""Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable.""

Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus P2X project and heads the corresponding research activities at KIT. The project has now reached an important technological milestone on the way to sustainable aviation fuel: For the first time in the world, the innovative, highly efficient water vapor/CO2 co-electrolysis technology from industrial partner Sunfire was coupled directly with a synthesis process at an industry-relevant scale (220 kilowatts of electrolysis output).

Co-electrolysis makes power-to-liquid more efficient

For the production of synthetic kerosene at KIT's Energy Lab, a multi-stage process distributed to modular facilities is used. First, syngas—a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide—is produced from CO2 and water.

In principle, there are several ways to generate syngas. The new configuration uses a co-electrolysis module with an output of 220 kilowatts from industry partner Sunfire, which simplifies this process step and, above all, boosts its efficiency.

""Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step. Up to 85% of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.

""In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,"" says Hubertus Richter, Senior Engineer R&D Project Management & Process Engineering at Sunfire.

""This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.""

For the coupled operation of co-electrolysis and fuel synthesis, the syngas needs to be brought to reaction pressure. This job is done by a compressor with safety devices the researchers added to the process chain. In a microstructured reactor, the syngas is then converted to long-chain hydrocarbons—known as syncrude—using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These hydrocarbons can be used directly to produce fuels such as kerosene or other chemical products.

Scientists at KIT developed this reactor technology, which is already being commercialized by INERATEC, a KIT spin-off. In the future, it is planned to use the heat released as vapor during synthesis for the co-electrolysis. This would further reduce the energy demand of the entire process and demonstrate that the product preparation to finally obtain kerosene is feasible at this scale.

By combining these process steps, it is possible to fully utilize the carbon dioxide provided and achieve the highest possible energy conversion efficiency, as this process chain allows efficient recycling of material flows in addition to the energy flows.

The next step: A ton of kerosene per day

Researchers at KIT successfully tested the integration of co-electrolysis in campaign operation under real conditions, producing up to 100 liters of syncrude per day. Coupled operation marks an important milestone in the second funding phase of the Kopernikus P2X project. The facility is now being expanded for a capacity of up to 300 liters syncrude per day.

In the third and final funding phase, the research team has INERATEC additionally build a larger Fischer-Tropsch production facility in the Höchst Industrial Park near Frankfurt. ""For the first time, ton-scale production will be realized there,"" says Dittmeyer.

The product, which will eventually be processed into kerosene, will be used by aircraft engine manufacturers and research partners for testing. Accompanying analyses will ensure that the fuel meets the strict aviation standards.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/boosting-the-efficienc.jpg,N,,2025-03-20 18:00:27.934027

In 2022, Farnborough trialled selling SAF at the same price as Jet A1 fuel for two weeks. However, new UK and EU mandates are putting pressure on domestic SAF sales.

“Hydrogen Refinery’s patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20 per cent blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s own target of 10% by 2030,” said Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport. “What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the UK.”

Geere explains how the financial position of Farnborough Airport is a crucial factor when it comes to supporting the development of SAF fuelling technologies, and how its frequent traffic of small modern aircraft is ideal.

“We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling,” commented Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery. “Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF. This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill. We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.

Alongside this new agreement, Farnborough Airport has a history of sustainability initiatives, achieving Level 4+ Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) status in 2024, and installing enough light-weight solar panels to generate 25 per cent of its own power.

The project, located in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques region of France, aims to establish the nation's first commercial e-biofuel plant, capable of producing 110,000 tonnes of e-fuels annually from 2029.

The BioTJet facility will leverage wood waste and forestry residues as feedstock, converting them into cleaner jet fuel through a process enhanced by clean hydrogen. This innovative approach addresses the pressing need for sustainable alternatives to traditional jet fuel, which contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.

The core technology selected by Elyse Energy, BioTfueL, has undergone rigorous testing at a semi-industrial plant between 2010 and 2021, validated by the Bionext consortium, a collaboration of industry leaders including Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies Nouvelles, Total Energies, and thyssenkrupp Uhde. In 2024, Axens secured a license agreement for the BioTfueL technology, which incorporates thyssenkrupp Uhde's PRENFLO gasification and Axens' GASEL technologies.

A key feature of the BioTJet process is the integration of clean hydrogen, which significantly improves efficiency and reduces emissions. The wood waste is initially subjected to high temperatures to produce syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The addition of clean hydrogen enhances the syngas quality, making it more suitable for subsequent fuel synthesis.

Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy, emphasized the strategic importance of this technology in providing “cost-competitive” e-fuels. The BioTJet plant is projected to produce 75,000 tonnes of SAF and 35,000 tonnes of naphtha, which will serve both road transport and chemical sectors, diversifying its impact on reducing carbon footprints.

The project has already achieved a significant milestone with the completion of basic engineering in November 2024. Currently, the BioTJet project is progressing through the detailed engineering phase, demonstrating a commitment to timely execution and operational readiness.

This development aligns with the European Union's ambitious ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which mandates a progressive increase in SAF usage within the aviation sector. The regulation requires that SAF constitute 2% of European aviation fuel supplies by 2025, escalating to 70% by 2050.

Despite SAF's potential to significantly reduce aviation emissions, its current adoption remains limited. As of 2024, SAF production accounts for only 0.53% of global jet fuel consumption, primarily due to high production costs and feedstock constraints. The BioTJet project, with its focus on utilizing readily available wood waste and integrating clean hydrogen, aims to address these challenges and accelerate the commercial viability of SAF.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-20 14:58:03.940289

Because of that, customers of commercial airlines will still have residual Scope 3 emissions and will need a way to address them.
• SAF is more expensive to produce than traditional jet fuel, and airlines alone cannot bear the cost.
• The refining capacity of sustainable aviation fuel is currently limited, due in part to the up-front capital investment required to expand or build new facilities.
Even so, their investments have demonstrated demand and helped accelerate supply in the sustainable aviation fuel industry.","SBTi’s recently published Corporate Net-zero Standard v2.0 is a positive step forward for “insets,” which are emission reductions within a company’s value chain. World Energy applauds this development because it provides “hard-to-abate” sectors like aviation, steel, and chemicals with a way to mitigate emissions when they can’t be avoided. With the draft guidance, SBTi recognizes that companies in these industries, and companies whose supply chains include these industries, may have no other option to address their emissions because “direct traceability is not possible or because persistent barriers prevent mitigation at the source.”

They specifically cite sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc) and the use of book & claim as an example of a valid option for companies to address their value-chain emissions. With SAFc, the fuel’s environmental attributes are separated from the fuel itself and are tracked using a book & claim chain of custody model. This allows aviation customers to claim the environmental attributes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without purchasing physical fuel.

For example, a SAFc inset purchase enables an airline (Scope 1) and an aviation customer (Scope 3) to claim the environmental benefits of the SAF against their direct (airlines) and indirect (customers) emissions, regardless of where the fuel is being combusted. Ideally, the physical fuel is delivered to an airport as close to the production facility as possible, which helps minimize both logistical costs and emissions.

One point in the draft is concerning, however. It suggests SBTi’s recognition of insets may be “time-limited,” without citing a rationale. We believe insets will have an important role to play for a long time to come for these reasons:

• Individual airlines will not achieve 100% decarbonization by 2050 according to EIA, ATAG and other credible sources, though some might. Because of that, customers of commercial airlines will still have residual Scope 3 emissions and will need a way to address them. With SAFc, corporates can still address these emissions through voluntary actions.

• SAF is more expensive to produce than traditional jet fuel, and airlines alone cannot bear the cost. However, Scope 3 customers have the motivation and the means to help. This cost collaboration allows airlines to purchase the fuel itself more affordably while also enabling corporates to achieve their net-zero goals through voluntary actions.

• The refining capacity of sustainable aviation fuel is currently limited, due in part to the up-front capital investment required to expand or build new facilities. Long-term SAFc contracts bring companies with high credit ratings into the financial mix and signal long-term demand. This gives investors confidence that a SAF refinery can count on customers for its product well into the future. And, in the long run, the price of SAF will drop as supply increases.

Corporations with ambitious emissions reduction goals have been using insets like SAFc as indirect mitigation tools, but they haven’t had a standardized way for those reductions to be recognized. Even so, their investments have demonstrated demand and helped accelerate supply in the sustainable aviation fuel industry. If finalized in this form, companies will have added confidence that their Scope 3 emissions reductions will be viable and recognized, which will encourage a new wave of corporations to become involved in the market.

Moving towards physical procurement as soon as practical is a good thing, but an arbitrary expiration date for indirect mitigation it will eliminate a tool for corporates to decarbonize “hard-to-abate” sectors and will also signal to investors that voluntary offtake agreements aren’t bankable.

The comment period on this draft guidance runs until June 1 and World Energy looks forward to constructive engagement with SBTi to build out pragmatic mitigation solutions.",https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/email/artdeco/logos/96/linkedin-bug-color.png,N,,2025-03-20 18:01:09.297120

Turkish lira at all-time low against dollar

London, 19 March (Argus) — Turkey's lira currency fell to record lows against the US dollar today, after the arrest of Istanbul's mayor provoked concern about instability. The depreciation could cause imports of dollar-denominated commodities to become more expensive, although reaction was mixed across markets. The lira went as low at 40/$1 in early trading, from below 37/$1 on Tuesday 18 March, before easing to around 38/$1 later in the day. The lira has been slowly depreciating against the dollar for many years, but the sharp fall today came after Ekrem Imamoglu, one of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rivals, was held on suspicion of corruption and aiding a terrorist organisation. Turkey is a significant importer of natural gas, crude and LPG, as well as coal and petcoke, although demand for many commodities will be muted currently because of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan. Early indications from the coal and petcoke markets were that all import trades had halted as the lira hit the record low. In polymers markets the focus is on whether demand recovers after Ramadan ends on 30 March. But a trading source in Turkey said the fall is not enough for ""massive changes"" to imports of oil products. The OECD forecasts headline inflation in Turkey at 31.4pc this year, the highest among its members, easing to 17.3pc in 2026. The IMF has forecast Turkey's economy will grow by 2.6pc this year, after an expansion of 2.7pc in 2024.

English and Welsh roads hit by lack of spending: Survey

London, 19 March (Argus) — More than half of the local road network in England and Wales has less than 15 years of structural life left because of insufficient allocation of government funding to local authorities, according to the latest Annual Local Authority Road Maintenance (ALARM) survey. The survey, compiled annually by UK industry body Asphalt Industry Association (AIA), found that 52pc, or around 106,000 miles, of the English and Welsh road network managed by local authorities had just 15 years life remaining, and that nearly a third of these roads — around 34,600 miles — may only have up to five years life left. The survey found that in the next 12 months, 24,400 miles, or 12pc, of the network is likely to need some form of maintenance and that just 1.5pc of the local road network was resurfaced over the last year. Although there has been over £20bn ($26bn) spent on carriageway maintenance in England and Wales over the last decade, ""due to the short-term nature of the allocation of funding, it has resulted in no quantifiable uplift to the condition and resilience of the network,"" AIA Chair David Giles said. He added there needs to be a complete change in mindset away from short-term to longer term funding commitments, and he asked the UK government to set a minimum five-year funding horizon and substantially increase investments for local roads maintenance work. UK bitumen consumption has been steadily falling in recent years, with another 10.5 decline registered in 2024, hitting its lowest levels since 2016, according to UK government's department for energy security and net zero (DESNZ) data. The consumption drop coincided with a 20.3pc jump to 449,000t in UK production of the heavy oil product used mainly in road paving as well as general construction, combining to sharply reduce the country's bitumen import requirements. The ALARM survey also found that there had been no improvements in as much as 94pc of the England and Wales local network over the last year. To maintain their network, the survey showed that in England and Wales, local authorities would have needed an extra £7.4m each in 2024 and £16.81bn in total, as a one-off cash injection, to bring their networks up to their ""ideal"" conditions.

Danish firm to set up Kalundborg bitumen terminal

London, 19 March (Argus) — Danish firm Bitumen Danmark will build a new bitumen terminal at Kalundborg, Denmark, with an initial capacity of 10,000-15,000t. The storage facility is scheduled for completion by late 2026 when it could start receiving winter-fill cargoes during the 2026/27 winter ahead of supply into local truck markets when the next paving and general construction season starts in spring 2027. The secured terminal, which could be expanded at a later point, will have deep water access that will enable the firm to take delivery of cargoes carried in bitumen tankers from a wide variety of locations across the Nordics, northwest Europe and the Mediterranean. In 2024, Denmark received around 123,000t of bitumen in cargo shipments, according to Vortexa, with the majority of the tankers delivering into Danish terminals at Aarhus, Nyborg and Koge. Sweden was the biggest single source last year, supplying just over half the total, with just over a third from the Netherlands. Bitumen Danmark supplies bitumen products into the road asphalt and roofing felt sectors in the Nordic region. It is majority owned by German firm BVH Group, a leading bitumen buyer and asphalt products supplier in Germany and parts of central Europe.

UK study sets out Grangemouth's post-refining future

Edinburgh, 19 March (Argus) — A government-funded study has identified nine potential low-carbon and renewable options for the Grangemouth site in Scotland following the planned closure of its 150,000 b/d refinery in the second quarter this year. The nine possible projects outlined in the Project Willow study centre around waste, bio-feedstocks and industries supporting the development of offshore wind. They could benefit each other through synergies and create up to 800 direct jobs, but their success ""will require significant contributions from both the public and private sector"", with an initial £3.5bn ($4.5bn) in capital investments needed, the study said. The £1.5mn report, paid for by the UK and Scottish governments, was commissioned by Grangemouth refinery operator Petroineos, which announced in November 2023 that it was going to close the plant and convert it into a fuel import terminal. The UK and Scottish governments have since set aside £25mn and £200mn for Grangemouth, along with other initiatives such as Scotland's £100mn Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal package. The study's 'waste' pathway comprises a hydrothermal plastic recycling project, a dissolution plastic recycling facility and a bio-refining project relying on bacterial fermentation (ABE). Under the 'bio-feedstock' pathway, the study envisages a second-generation bioethanol plant on Scottish timber feedstock and an anaerobic digestion facility using organic waste to produce biomethane. Second-generation bioethanol refers to ethanol made from non-edible resources such as biomass. This pathway also suggests a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant, with production made from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). UK trade union Unite has been supportive of this option , but Petroineos deemed it unviable ""under current regulatory conditions"". The third pathway — called conduit for offshore wind — is mostly focused on hydrogen. It includes fuel switching, producing jet from e-methanol and methanol as well as producing low-carbon ammonia for the shipping and chemicals industry. The second-generation ethanol plant and the HEFA facility, as well as the e-methanol and e-ammonia projects, would have a longer 2030-40 timeline, against a 2028-30 timeline for the other projects. The projects would benefit from existing infrastructure such as Grangemouth's port, which includes container, bulk and liquid fuel terminals. ""There are also opportunities to reuse existing tank storage, ethanol facilities, and other ancillary assets at the site,"" the study said. Unite has criticised the study's project timelines, pointing out most would start years after the refinery had closed, by which time jobs would have been lost. Many of the projects ""could be fast tracked and implemented now"", including converting the refinery to SAF production, the union said. ""Project Willow was created by Petroineos as a fig leaf to justify its act of industrial vandalism of shutting the refinery and axing jobs. It asked the wrong questions and then failed to provide the answers that Grangemouth refinery workers need,"" Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said. ""There are projects like SAF production which can be swiftly enacted to protect jobs and those opportunities must not be lost. This would pave the way for the UK to become a world leader in green aviation."" By Caroline Varin Send comments and request more information at feedback@argusmedia.com Copyright © 2025.

The report comes after the UK government promised a £200m investment for Project Willow last month.
The capital investment required for each of the nine projects varies significantly, from as little as £15m for the anaerobic digestion project, to up to £2.1bn for the hydrogen-powered methanol production project.
Wait for jobs to go on EY estimates that Project Willow could create up to 1,100 long-term jobs at Grangemouth by 2040.
Unite’s Scottish secretary Derek Thomson said: “The options for the future of the Grangemouth refinery need to be fast-tracked to preserve jobs and skills on the site.","GRANGEMOUTH could host recycling and bio-feedstock production facilities after the site’s oil refinery closes this year, according to proposals published in a report yesterday.

Consultancy EY’s report, commissioned by the Scottish and UK governments for £1.5m (US$1.95m), is the first to provide a detailed picture of Project Willow, the transition plan for the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland, which will close later this year with the loss of at least 400 jobs.

EY’s report made nine project proposals, including: hydrothermal recycling to break down hard-to-recycle plastics; dissolution plastic recycling to return plastics to virgin-like status; converting used cooking oil and other waste into alcohols; timber-to-ethanol production; anaerobic digestion for fuel production from animal waste and sewage; SAF production from hydrogenated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) cover crops; hydrogen production to power industrial plants, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and ammonia factories.

The report was produced for the Grangemouth refinery’s owner Petroineos, who announced last year that the refinery would close in the second quarter of 2025 due to ongoing losses from their refining operation.

The report comes after the UK government promised a £200m investment for Project Willow last month.

UK government energy minister Michael Shanks said: “We committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth.

“We will build on Grangemouth’s expertise and industrial heritage to attract investors [and] secure a long-term clean energy future.”

The UK and Scottish governments are now trying to attract private sector investment. Prime minister Keir Starmer previously said he aims to attract £600m from the private sector.

Time and money

EY’s proposals are dependent on the government accepting the report’s recommendations, including energy market reform to reduce renewable energy costs, and an exemption to the cap on SAF feedstocks derived from HEFA, which was included in the government’s SAF mandate last year.

The capital investment required for each of the nine projects varies significantly, from as little as £15m for the anaerobic digestion project, to up to £2.1bn for the hydrogen-powered methanol production project. The anaerobic digestion project would have the earliest start date of all nine, becoming operational by 2028. The methanol plant would not be operational until 2035.

EY estimates all projects would contribute to total UK emissions reductions of just 0.4% compared to 1990 levels. However, individual sectors could benefit from more significant carbon savings, such as shipping emissions which could be reduced by more than 5% with low-carbon ammonia produced at Grangemouth.

EY estimates that Project Willow could create up to 1,100 long-term jobs at Grangemouth by 2040. However, it will be years before most of the expected operational jobs arrive, with most of the first construction jobs not expected until 2027.

According to the report, the number of jobs on the site would only exceed 400 – the number of jobs that will be lost when the refinery closes this year – by 2032, and this assumes all nine projects get the go-ahead. Unite the Union has argued that Petroineos’s existing refinery facilities could be converted to a SAF factory and bring operation much nearer. Unite’s Scottish secretary Derek Thomson said: “The options for the future of the Grangemouth refinery need to be fast-tracked to preserve jobs and skills on the site.

“The workers need to see that the political will exists for a decent future for Grangemouth.”

The Scottish government set aside £25m (US$32.4m) last month to expedite the projects identified in yesterday’s report from EY. The UK government has also promised a “training guarantee” for all refinery staff who want skills training at a local college to help them move into new jobs with local employers.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/18934/grangemouth-credit-treasuregalore-shutterstock_1250322649-16-9.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-03-20 12:57:29.198983

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates taking effect at the start of this year, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly being put at risk by the lack of production and investment within the UK.

The UK and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025 and also the way that SAF must be produced in the future. This is to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support the required growth in SAF production without incentivising farmers to switch from growing food to growing SAF feedstocks.

SAF today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids), however Hydrogen Refinery’s ground-breaking technology is able to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented: “We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery. Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s own target of 10% by 2030.

“What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the UK.”

He added: “The transition to new fuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen. Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller-modern aircraft which we handle and the significant economic value of the flights we support.

“As a local company, Hydrogen Refinery exemplify the deep-rooted technological capabilities of the companies which form part of Farnborough Airport’s aeronautical research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership which will generate significant local inward investment and will reinforce our ambitions to become a Global Sustainability Showcase for Airports around the world.”

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, commented: “We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling. Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The airport ranks among the largest single-site suppliers of SAF, selling over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021. However, the lack of investment and production in the UK threatens SAF sales. This decrease in production comes after the introduction of SAF mandates at the start of 2025.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented:

We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuel developer Hydrogen Refinery. Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s target of 10% by 2030.

The UK and EU have mandated legislation requiring compliance from January 2025, also outlining how SAF will be produced in the future. These mandates are in place to support the development of advanced fuels to support the required growth in SAF.

Waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids) produces almost all SAF. However, Hydrogen Refinery’s technology focuses on producing carbon-negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, said:

We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling. Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF.

Farnborough’s sustainable stance

The deal with Hydrogen Refinery follows a series of successful milestones achieved by Farnborough Airport. In 2024, the Airport Carbon Accreditation Scheme awarded the airport a Level 4+ carbon accreditation status. This makes it one of five UK airports, and the only business aviation airport, to achieve such recognition. The airport also completed one of the largest lightweight solar installations, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its power.

In 2022, before the Farnborough Airshow, the airport became the first to price SAF equal to Jet A1, promoting its adoption. In the same year, Farnborough Airport committed to achieving Net Zero by 2030 or sooner, setting a leading aviation target.

This new deal adds to the list of partnerships Farnborough has made in 2025.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1024px-Farnborough_Airport_-_Red_Arrows_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_1982981.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&ssl=1,N,,2025-03-20 12:57:42.303557

Announcing the green milestone on March 20, 2025, Airbus said its Mirabel A220 site recently welcomed the first tanker truck filled with SAF to power internal operations.

Joining their colleagues around the world, the Airbus A220 teams in Canada will now be able to use SAF for production, customer acceptance and test flights.

“On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too,” Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada said.

According to Airbus, 75% of the planemaker’s aircraft were delivered with SAF in 2024, representing the importance that its customers are also placing on decarbonisation.

While in 2025, Airbus plans that all commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights.

“Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with the conventional aviation fuel (CAF) also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping,” a spokesperson for Airbus explained.

What is Project SkyPower?

Project SkyPower is a CEO-led initiative with a bold mission: to bring the first large-scale e-SAF plants to final investment decision (FID) by the end of 2025. E-SAF, produced from clean electricity, will be a game-changer for the aviation sector, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional jet fuels. With over 50 member organizations from across the European aviation and energy value chain, Project SkyPower is uniting stakeholders to tackle one of the most pressing challenges – turbocharging and scaling this SAF pathway.

Why e-SAF matters

The aviation industry is responsible for a significant portion of global carbon emissions, and e-SAF represents a critical pathway to reducing its environmental impact. However, scaling e-SAF production is no small feat. Currently, no large-scale e-SAF project has reached FID, and the industry faces numerous barriers, from perceived regulatory uncertainty to technological, market and financial risks.

In this episode, Maximilian Held breaks down the complexities of e-SAF production, the challenges of aligning diverse stakeholders, and the innovative solutions Project SkyPower is championing. From promoting regulatory certainty to stimulating long-term offtake agreements and developing risk-sharing models, the project is focused on overcoming these hurdles.

The road ahead

The next one to two years are critical. With the ReFuelEU Aviation e-SAF mandate set to take effect in 2030, and construction timelines of three to four years, the clock is ticking to bring e-SAF plants to FID. Maximilian explains how Project SkyPower’s 10-point action plan is designed to accelerate progress, with five high-priority actions that could make or break the success of e-SAF in Europe.

But the vision doesn’t stop there. By 2050, the global e-SAF market could be worth over €350 billion. Europe has the opportunity to position itself as a global leader in sustainable fuel production technology and services. This is not just about reducing emissions – it’s about unlocking a massive economic opportunity and driving innovation in the energy sector.

This follows the recent publication of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology which includes specific accounting rules and practices on how to include SAF in per-passenger CO2 data. Initially, CO2 Connect will apply equal per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. In future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added.

“Corporations and individual travelers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s senior vice president commercial products and services.

Her views were greeted by loud applause from the audience of ERA members.

Liegeois acknowledged the industry’s concerns, emphasizing the early stage of SAF implementation and the need to allow new regulations time to mature. He pointed to existing funding mechanisms designed to support SAF uptake and reiterated the Commission’s commitment to addressing the price gap between conventional and synthetic fuels.

Looking ahead, the Commission plans to unveil a sustainable transport investment plan later this year, outlining an industrial strategy to bolster SAF production and facilitate offtake agreements. While a market for SAF certificates is not currently planned, further consultation remains a possibility. The Commission also reiterated the importance of global solutions for aviation emissions and ongoing work on non-CO2 emissions monitoring.",https://www.laranews.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250320_105310-1-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-03-20 10:57:08.099779

His comments come at a time when industry is reviewing its decarbonization goals. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is ramping up too slowly, battery performance is stagnating and Airbus has postponed its ZEROe project, citing a lack of readiness of the hydrogen ecosystem. While the feeling is growing that 2050 targets will be missed, Brunini’s remarks signal a need for renewed stability in the goals aviation is pursuing.

“Let’s not give up on hydrogen,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of the Clean Aviation Annual Forum held March 18-19 here in Brussels. The latest version of the Destination 2050 roadmap devised by industry—including ACI—takes into account Airbus’ delay, he noted. The roadmap’s reliance on hydrogen as a contributor to aviation’s sustainability in the next two decades has thus decreased.

SAF thus has a strengthened leading role in Destination 2050. “Nevertheless, we need hydrogen,” Brunini said. “SAF will not do it alone. We also need new-technology aircraft to reach net zero. We should not stop because of a 5-10 years delay.”

Brunini is also the CEO of airport operator SEA Milan Airports. At Milan Malpensa airport, hydrogen needs would total 100-300 metric tons per day, and the top 10 airports in Europe would need to invest a combined €16 billion ($17.4 billion), he said. For safety reasons, trucks cannot carry hydrogen to airports so pipelines, storage facilities and liquefiers will be required, he said.

“We must work on the first bricks now, let’s not relax, otherwise we will fall into a vicious circle and airframers will blame a lagging infrastructure again,” he said. “Hydrogen will be for short- to medium-range aircraft only, yet it is part of the solution.” As a first step, airports should encourage ground vehicles to use hydrogen so they contribute to creating a critical mass in hydrogen needs, he added.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-03-20 06:56:32.588000

Founded in 1995 by Bob and Kelly King on Maui, Pacific Biodiesel created the first retail biodiesel pump in the U.S. and remains the longest-operating biodiesel producer in the country. Today, it is Hawaiʻi’s only commercial producer of liquid biofuels, generating nearly 6 million gallons of biodiesel annually at its Hawaiʻi Island refinery—all of which is used within the state.

Lt. Governor Sylvia Luke presented the official proclamation to Pacific Biodiesel President Bob King and Director of Operations Jenna Long during a ceremony at the State Capitol last week.

March 18 is also observed nationwide as “National Biodiesel Day,” in tribute to diesel engine inventor Rudolph Diesel, who originally designed his engine to run on renewable plant oils such as peanut oil.

Pacific Biodiesel’s founder, Bob King, played a key role in advancing the biodiesel industry by developing the first commercial-scale technology to recycle used cooking oil into clean-burning biofuel. The company’s first plant, launched at the Central Maui landfill in 1995, laid the foundation for an industry that produced over 2 billion gallons of biodiesel in the U.S. last year.

Many energy transition projects in infancy; expected completion closer to 2030

India to be big exporter of green ammonia to South Korea, Japan, northwest Europe

Vopak to continue pursuing joint ventures to develop value chains

Initiatives include green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier, expanding value chains, and repurposing existing infrastructure to support sustainable feedstocks, according to Vopak president of Asia and Middle East Chris Robblee.

ACCELERATING ENERGY TRANSITION

Vopak is focusing on several key areas to support the global shift toward sustainable energy.

Recently, the company completed its first bio-bunker fuel supply operation in Fujairah in the UAE, the fruits of its infrastructure development for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“For us, new energy is about ensuring we have assets ready for sustainable feedstocks and future products like biofuels and SAF,” Robblee said.

Furthermore, Vopak views ammonia as the most efficient hydrogen transport solution and is actively investing in related projects.

Ammonia is liquid that is a carrier for hydrogen (which is gas), and is easier to store and transport than hydrogen.

“Hydrogen can move in different ways, but ammonia is the most efficient in our view,” said Robblee.

The company is also leveraging its experience in handling hazardous products to expand its carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives, seeing it as a crucial decarbonization pathway.

Recognizing the shift from molecules to electrons, Vopak is entering the battery storage sector to support the changing energy landscape.

INVESTMENT PROGRESS

While Vopak has committed $1 billion to energy transition projects by 2030, only a fraction has been spent so far, as many projects are still in early development stages.

The company has spent a little less than $100 million on projects since it made the pledge in 2022, Vopak CEO Dick Richelle was quoted by newswire agency Reuters in November 2024.

Robblee emphasized the development of energy transition projects will be completed closer to 2030, with the pace of implementation much slower compared with its industrial and gas terminal projects.

Vopak has a capex target of €2 billion for industrial and gas terminals by 2030.

“The thought always was, it’s going to come closer to the 2030 date than our growth spending on industrial and gas terminals. And it’s just because a lot of the projects were in their infancy.

“The big infrastructure projects that we work on take years to develop and then years to get going.”

Ongoing projects include working through Vopak’s Tokyo office to import ammonia for co-firing with coal for power generation.

Japan and South Korea are becoming leading importers of green ammonia as they work to decarbonize newer coal facilities or thermal power plants, Robblee said.

“They have the proven technology that you’re able to co-combust ammonia with … coal,” he added.

“There are a lot of exciting projects in India and the Middle East that we see that flow coming to the East [northeast Asia], as well as the US.”

India is a particular focus for storage and export of green hydrogen and ammonia.

In November 2023, India’s Odisha state approved several green hydrogen and ammonia projects, including an ammonia storage tank project at Gopalpur operated by Aegis Vopak (AVTL), Vopak’s joint venture with India’s Aegis. This facility is designed to store 80,000 tonnes of liquid ammonia.

AVTL, in November 2024, announced it has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) worth Indian rupees (Rs) 35 billion ($405 million) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

A final decision for the IPO is expected in the first half of 2025.

Vopak is also repurposing existing infrastructure in Asia to support sustainable feedstocks.

In 2024, the company repurposed part of its Sebarok terminal in Singapore, commissioning 40,000 tonnes of capacity for blending biofuels into marine fuels.

The Sebarok terminal is earmarked as a sustainable multi-fuels hub, reinforcing Singapore’s status as a leading bunkering center.

VALUE CHAINS STILL IN INFANCY

A major challenge for Vopak in new energy markets is that value chains are still new.

“I think what you’ll see, which is quite normal, is a lot of these value chains aren’t built yet,” he said.

However, Robblee said the company is confident it can safely handle the products of the future.

“We have the capabilities to contribute, to ensure that we give our people our best knowledge to build the assets in a safe and secure manner, in an efficient and [sustainable] manner.”

Vopak also aims to continue working with different partners to develop its energy transition projects.

“We are very accustomed to joint ventures. Across Asia and the Middle East, almost all our business is structured this way.”

For example, Vopak and France’s Air Liquide, in March 2024, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore the development and operation of infrastructure for ammonia import, cracking, and hydrogen distribution in Singapore.

“I think the only difference is, and we’re quite open to it. Maybe the partners that we had in the past aren’t the same partners that we [will have] in the future. And so, we’re looking at that today,” Robblee added.

As of 19 March, Swedavia’s Annual and Sustainability Report for 2024 is available on the company’s website. The past year saw increased international travel, new airline routes at Arlanda, and a stronger operating profit, alongside continued investments in the transition to fossil-free aviation. Passenger volume rose by over one per cent compared to 2023, driven by sustained demand for international travel.

Details on Swedavia’s sustainable efforts in 2024

The growth in travel and higher commercial revenues enabled Swedavia to report a positive operating income for the first time since the pandemic, marking a key milestone in the company’s recovery. The net revenue increased by SEK 462 million compared to the previous year, while operating income improved by SEK 344 million. Cash flow from operating activities also grew by SEK 305 million, strengthening Swedavia’s financial position.

At Stockholm Arlanda Airport, the final stage of the new Marketplace will be completed in the first quarter of 2025, with the last tenants moving in. This, along with the new security control, finalises the modernisation of Terminal 5, which began just before the pandemic. The modernisation significantly improves passenger flows and satisfaction. The new Marketplace also allows for increased profit margins in commercial operations, which will help maintain competitive airport charges.

In 2024, around 40 new routes were added, including 18 entirely new destinations. Notable new services included Air Canada’s direct routes to Toronto and Montreal, and ANA’s new service between Arlanda and Tokyo Haneda, launching in early 2025. Swedavia continues to strengthen its international connectivity.

Domestic air traffic faced challenges, notably with BRA’s closure of its domestic traffic at Bromma Stockholm Airport. Instead, BRA signed a cooperation agreement with SAS, consolidating domestic traffic at Arlanda. This move is crucial for maintaining connectivity across Sweden.

Swedavia also achieved a major milestone, with four of its airports now certified at the highest level by the Airport Carbon Accreditation system.

According to Viva Energy’s general manager for aviation, Nick Adams, the partnership will allow Viva to “expand its ability to supply SAF-blended jet fuel across Australia utilising its infrastructure assets, while exploring regional SAF delivery, storage and handling, and direct into-wing dispensing”.

“It is clear that SAF is going to play a bigger role for commercial airlines in this country as they move towards a more sustainable future,” he said.

“Through this collaboration – and drawing on the strengths of Viva Energy’s national distribution network and experience supplying high-quality fuels and aviation operations – we will be working with Virgin Australia to establish the supply chains that will be critical to the future of the aviation industry.

“Viva Energy is also delighted to be helping a key partner like Virgin Australia in its sustainability journey.”

Other airlines including Qantas and Air New Zealand are making moves towards greater use of SAF, while the Federal Government last month invested $10.4 million into two projects in Queensland through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

This included $2.4 million for Viva to demonstrate SAF use and storage at Brisbane Airport, in which the company will recondition a fuel tank at the Pinkenba Terminal for a commercial supply of blended SAF, with the resulting findings to be shared with other Australian airports to ready their infrastructure for domestic SAF.

The 2023 Boeing/CSIRO SAF Roadmap identified Australia as in a “prime position” to develop a domestic SAF industry.

According to Max Temminghoff, the roadmap’s author and senior manager at the CSIRO, Australia is in a good position to develop a domestic SAF industry but needs to address key challenges such as feedstock availability, supply chain issues, and international standards and regulations.",https://res.cloudinary.com/momentum-media-group-pty-ltd/images/f_auto/v1742447495/Australian%20Aviation/Virgin_Australia_and_Viva_Energy_2_noshp8/Virgin_Australia_and_Viva_Energy_2_noshp8.gif?_i=AA,N,,2025-03-20 05:56:21.373258
