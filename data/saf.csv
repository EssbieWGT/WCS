(RFD-TV)— The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the U.N. body regulating global shipping, is pushing for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with benchmarks set for 2030 and 2040. That’s creating new demand for low-carbon fuels, and ethanol may be well-positioned. Corn growers are also looking to the national adoption of E15 sales as another way to boost sales and the economy.

Ethanol Finds Footing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Ankit Chandra of the U.S. Grains & BioProducts Council (USGBC) points out that America already has 18 billion gallons of ethanol production capacity, record exports of nearly 2 billion gallons last year, and the infrastructure of ports, rail, and barges to deliver supply chains today.

The global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market is forecast to surge from $2.06 billion in 2025 to $25.62 billion by 2030, a compound annual growth rate of nearly 65 percent. Meanwhile, marine biofuels used in shipping were valued at $3.94 billion in 2024 and are projected to almost double by 2034.

For U.S. farmers, this could mean expanded demand for corn ethanol, soybean oil, and biomass as feedstocks for SAF and marine fuels. Success, however, depends on carbon certification standards, compliance with IMO and SAF rules, engine approvals, and investments in conversion and logistics.

Farm-Level Takeaway: Ethanol producers face a widening opportunity window as aviation and marine fuel markets expand, with the potential to add billions in demand if policy and certification align.

Could Year-Round E15 Bring in the Big Bucks?

According to a new study for the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), unrestricted sales of the corn-based biofuel could have a $25 billion economic impact while also helping to create a home for increased corn production.

The nation currently exports nearly $4 billion in suitable feedstocks, including canola (rapeseed) and tallow, with other promising sources like sugar, sorghum, and various waste products offering significant potential for domestic conversion into clean fuels.
It builds on support already provided through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, which has already allocated $250 million to low-carbon liquid fuels research and development.
The Program will offer competitive grants to private sector companies to encourage the establishment of onshore production facilities.
By investing in this sector, Australia is not only taking a critical step toward its own net-zero goals but is also aiming to become an indispensable part of global clean energy supply chains.","In a landmark move to accelerate the nation’s transition to a low-carbon economy, the Australian government on September 17 announced a significant investment of AU$1.1 billion ($731.84 million) into the domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels. The funding, which will be distributed through a new 10-year competitive grants scheme called the Clean Fuels Program, aims to stimulate onshore investment and build robust supply chains for fuels such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The announcement positions Australia to become a key player in the global net-zero transformation, a market that the government believes could be worth up to $36 billion to the Australian economy. The investment is specifically targeted at reducing emissions in 'hard-to-abate' sectors like aviation, heavy-duty freight, and mining, which are difficult to electrify.

Australia is uniquely positioned to lead in this emerging industry, thanks to its extensive agricultural sector and a growing supply of affordable and reliable renewable energy. The nation currently exports nearly $4 billion in suitable feedstocks, including canola (rapeseed) and tallow, with other promising sources like sugar, sorghum, and various waste products offering significant potential for domestic conversion into clean fuels.

This new production-linked incentive is not an isolated policy but rather a strategic expansion of previous government commitments. It builds on support already provided through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund, which has already allocated $250 million to low-carbon liquid fuels research and development. The new program will also require grant recipients to adhere to the community benefit principles outlined in the Future Made in Australia Act, ensuring that new projects deliver tangible benefits to local communities.

The Program will offer competitive grants to private sector companies to encourage the establishment of onshore production facilities. The government has confirmed that the detailed design and eligibility criteria for the program are currently being developed through a public consultation process and are expected to be finalized during the current financial year, which ends on June 30, 2026. This process will pave the way for applications to open in the 2026-27 financial year.

Aviation safety remains equally prominent on IATA’s agenda, with specific concerns about Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference affecting aircraft navigation near conflict zones.
Decisions made during the Montreal assembly will influence global aviation policy through 2028.
The assembly’s outcomes will determine whether the aviation industry can accelerate progress toward its 2050 net-zero emissions commitment or face additional regulatory constraints from individual governments acting independently.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) will present an ambitious nine-point agenda at next week’s global aviation summit, demanding accelerated sustainable fuel production and coordinated action on climate targets that could reshape the industry’s environmental trajectory.

The 42nd Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) convenes Monday in Montreal for 11 days, bringing together representatives from 193 member states to establish worldwide aviation policy for the next three years. IATA has submitted 14 working papers covering diverse areas including sustainability, safety, operations, and digitization.

Willie Walsh, IATA Director General, emphasized the urgency of environmental commitments ahead of the assembly. “It is critical that we secure stronger support for SAF production and CORSIA as key enablers of aviation’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050,” Walsh stated.

The association’s primary concern centers on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, which remains critically insufficient despite growing demand. Current projections show SAF production will double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, yet this represents merely 0.7% of airline fuel needs.

IATA’s sustainability push includes strengthening the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), established in 2016 as the sole global economic measure addressing aviation emissions. The scheme expects to generate up to $17 billion in climate finance by 2035, yet implementation challenges persist across participating nations.

The organization demands governments resist creating additional aviation taxes that undermine CORSIA’s effectiveness. Multiple jurisdictions continue implementing national and regional taxation schemes that conflict with the unified global approach, creating regulatory fragmentation that complicates industry compliance efforts.

Aviation safety remains equally prominent on IATA’s agenda, with specific concerns about Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference affecting aircraft navigation near conflict zones. The association seeks enhanced coordination between military and civil aviation authorities to provide airlines with timely risk assessments.

Radio frequency spectrum protection emerges as another critical priority, particularly regarding the 4.2-4.4 gigahertz band essential for radio altimeters. Telecommunications industry expansion of 5G services has created safety risks near airports, requiring costly mitigation measures and aircraft retrofits that face supply chain delays.

IATA proposes raising commercial airline pilot age limits from 65 to 67 for multi-pilot international flights, maintaining existing safety safeguards including the requirement for at least one pilot under 65. This change reflects longer, healthier careers while addressing industry workforce challenges.

Consumer protection regulations present another area of concern, with IATA arguing that patchwork implementations across jurisdictions confuse travelers and create compliance burdens. The association seeks alignment with established global standards rather than conflicting national approaches.

The assembly occurs amid broader industry transformation pressures, including post-pandemic recovery challenges and accelerating environmental regulations. Airlines face increasing pressure from governments, investors, and consumers to demonstrate measurable progress on sustainability commitments.

The gathering brings together more than 2,000 participants to shape aviation’s future across safety, security, sustainability, economic development, and digital innovation. Decisions made during the Montreal assembly will influence global aviation policy through 2028.

IATA represents 350 airlines comprising over 80% of global air traffic, giving the organization significant influence over industry standards and regulatory development. The association’s submissions to ICAO typically carry substantial weight in final policy determinations.

MUMBAI: The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will take up 14 working papers submitted by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) at its 42nd Assembly in Montreal this month. These papers cover aviation safety, sustainability, and efficiency, with a strong focus on boosting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, reaffirming CORSIA as the sole global climate measure, safeguarding critical radio frequencies amid 5G rollouts, and addressing issues such as accident reporting, pilot retirement age, and aviation taxation. ""It is critical that we secure stronger support for SAF production and CORSIA as key enablers of aviation’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Equally, we need agreement to follow the principles and provisions of the Chicago Convention to avoid patchworks of debilitating tax measures and passenger rights regulations. And we must shore up safety with timely accident reports, mitigations for GNSS interference, and preservation of critical radio-frequency spectrum,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. The ICAO Assembly, held every three years, is a pivotal event where global standards for aviation are set. These standards, developed with input from airline operators and ICAO Member States, are essential for ensuring safe, efficient, and sustainable aviation operations worldwide. Among the key topics IATA will present involve Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Production. IATA urged countries (States) to support the creation of a functioning SAF market and to provide economic incentives for fuel producers. IATA also called for reaffirmation of CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) as the sole economic measure for managing aviation’s climate impact. “CORSIA is expected to generate up to $17 billion in climate finance by 2035. However, states continue to create or augment aviation taxes and schemes (national and regional) that undercut CORSIA’s credibility, and which do little or nothing to further sustainability. Moreover, only Guyana has issued CORSIA Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) which generate climate finance and enable airlines to fulfil their CORSIA obligations,” said IATA in a press statement. It asked states to make available sufficient CORSIA EEUs for airlines to be able to fulfil their CORSIA obligations. On the subject of Aviation Corporate Tax, IATA will advocate against adopting source-based corporate taxation, which could lead to administrative burdens and potential double taxation. It supports the continuation of residency-based taxation for airlines. With regards to consumer protection, IATA sought alignment with ICAO’s Core Principles to avoid conflicting regulations and ensure shared accountability for traveller disruptions. The working paper on flight safety will bring attention to the 5G and 6G spectrum rollouts planned by the telecom industry. These rollouts are demanding greater allocations of radio frequency spectrum, said IATA, adding that aviation requires spectrum for many purposes, including the critical 4.2-4.4 GHz band for radio altimeters. “Some configurations for 5G rollouts (particularly in the US, Australia, and Canada) have created unacceptable risks to aviation safety in the vicinity of airports, which required mitigation measures (reconfiguration of 5G antenna as airlines retrofit with interference-proof avionics). Due to supply chain challenges and the time needed to develop and test global standards, retrofit timelines are not going to be met,” it said. IATA will ask states to protect safety-critical frequencies used by aviation from interference and strengthen coordination among telecoms and aviation regulators to ensure the safety of flight, follow best practices of successful implementations, and agree on realistic timelines for any retrofits. The airlines' trade body will also continue to stress for timely completion of accident investigation reports to enhance aviation safety, better coordination to mitigate risks from GNSS jamming and spoofing near conflict zones, and realistic timelines for aircraft mandates to avoid delays in safety benefits. On the subject of pilot age limit, IATA said it supports raising the retirement age for multi-pilot international operations to 67, with appropriate medical oversight.

Case study: Supporting low-carbon hydrogen in Korea

Approtium is the largest independent hydrogen producer and supplier in Korea, managing approximately 60km of hydrogen pipeline infrastructure and a fleet of 250 tube trailers – trucks that transport hydrogen gas – to deliver its products to customers across the nation.

Through its specialised pipeline infrastructure, Approtium efficiently and reliably provides hydrogen to a wide network of connected companies, distributed across major industrial complexes in the highly industrialised Ulsan region.

Using tube trailers, it also supplies high-quality hydrogen to customers with high-precision manufacturing processes, such as semiconductor manufacturing, which require ultra-high purity hydrogen products.

Additionally, Approtium captures the carbon dioxide produced from its hydrogen production plants via carbon capture systems to produce liquefied carbon dioxide, which is then distributed to clients for use in a variety of ways, including at critical stages within semiconductor manufacturing, to produce dry ice, and in shipbuilding processes.

The South Korean government aims for one third of the country’s energy to be sourced from low-carbon hydrogen by 2050.

To achieve this goal, (including meeting the predicted future demand that will arise from domestic energy consumption) alongside an increase in local production of hydrogen, the country is expected to become a net importer of low-carbon hydrogen.

Increasing the distribution of low carbon-hydrogen will help drive its adoption and support South Korea’s energy transition, particularly in industrial processes and power generation, which cannot be decarbonised through renewable electricity alone.

EGNOS achieves this by using over 40 ground stations across Europe to monitor GPS signals.
The updated signals are then transmitted via geostationary satellites back to users on Earth, enabling improved precision and confidence in the navigation data.
Saving time, fuel and emissions EGNOS not only improves safety, but also helps airlines reduce costs and minimise their environmental impact.
Supporting helicopter rescue missions Beyond commercial aviation, EGNOS plays a vital role in emergency medical services.","The Wright brothers made history with the first powered flight in 1903, since then, aviation has undergone remarkable transformations, becoming safer, more efficient, and more accessible

One of the latest advancements leading this evolution is satellite navigation, specifically, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, or EGNOS.

What is EGNOS?

EGNOS is Europe’s satellite-based augmentation system, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of GPS signals. While GPS alone provides positioning accuracy within about five metres, EGNOS improves that to one to two metres, while also delivering vital information about signal integrity.

This is especially important in aviation, where even slight inaccuracies can pose serious safety risks. EGNOS achieves this by using over 40 ground stations across Europe to monitor GPS signals. These stations send data to control centres, which calculate corrections and integrity information. The updated signals are then transmitted via geostationary satellites back to users on Earth, enabling improved precision and confidence in the navigation data.

The LPV-200 revolutionised aviation.

One of the most significant contributions of EGNOS to aviation is the LPV-200 service, which stands for “Localizer Performance with Vertical Guidance.” This service allows pilots to perform precision landings similar to Category I Instrument Landing System (CAT I ILS) procedures, which are traditionally reliant on expensive ground-based infrastructure.

LPV-200, however, uses satellite data instead of ground installations, making it far more accessible and cost-effective, especially for smaller airports that may lack the resources for ILS systems. With a decision height of 200 feet, LPV-200 gives pilots the ability to land safely even in limited visibility conditions.

More than 500 airports across Europe now benefit from EGNOS-enabled LPV approaches, which not only enhance safety but also improve operational flexibility.

Saving time, fuel and emissions

EGNOS not only improves safety, but also helps airlines reduce costs and minimise their environmental impact. LPV procedures enable aircraft to land at alternative airports with fewer diversions or holding patterns, resulting in shorter flight times, lower fuel consumption, and reduced CO₂ emissions. This makes flying more efficient for airlines and more sustainable for the planet.

Supporting helicopter rescue missions

Beyond commercial aviation, EGNOS plays a vital role in emergency medical services. Helicopters are essential for reaching patients in remote or hard-to-access areas, but poor weather and low visibility have historically limited their operations. EGNOS enables satellite-guided routes to be established, allowing helicopters to land safely at hospitals, mountain rescue zones, or offshore platforms, even under challenging conditions.

This capability is transforming air rescue operations across Europe, supporting faster and safer emergency responses when every second counts.

The move is part of Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab initiative, aligning with the airline’s decarbonization goals and efforts to reduce emissions across its regional network.

The MAEVE Jet, as envisioned, will carry 76 to 100 passengers in a single-aisle, five-abreast configuration. Maeve Aerospace advertises that its hybrid-electric powerplant, combined with an optimized wing design, could yield cost savings of up to 40% when using conventional jet fuel, and by as much as 95% when using Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

A Look At The MAEVE Jet

The MAEVE Jet, also known as the MJ 500, is a new regional jet concept being developed by European manufacturer Maeve Aerospace. It's meant to seat between 76 and 100 seats, which places it in direct competition with the Embraer E175. Maeve has been progressively evolving the concept for years, and it's likely that this could be close to the final configuration.

The major innovation with Maeve's new aircraft is the hybrid-electric powerplant. Thrust will come from two open-rotor engines, and according to Maeve, this will save airlines tremendous amounts of fuel and money. Open rotor technology has been considered for numerous aircraft projects in the past (most recently with the successor to the Airbus A320neo), while several companies are working on electric or hybrid electric powerplants for smaller aircraft like air taxis.

This is the first serious effort to combine open rotor technology with hybrid electric propulsion on an aircraft this size. While the design has not been frozen and Maeve is still looking for additional partners, this is one of the most serious efforts for a clean-sheet aircraft in today's market. The investment from Delta is perhaps Maeve's most significant announcement to date.

The MJ 500's Place In The Market (And What It Means For Delta)

While competition between Airbus and Boeing is as intense as ever, there's a noticeable lack of new developments in the market for regional airliners. Bombardier has fully exited the commercial aircraft market, while Mitsubishi is no longer producing the CRJ. De Havilland is still building a new facility to assemble the Dash 8, and Embraer's E175-E2 is currently on hold as it is not scope-compliant in the US. This is also the case for the larger E190-E2 and E195-E2 models.

As such, the only major smaller regional airliners in production are the Embraer E175, ATR42-600, and ATR72-600. All of these are prior-generation aircraft, and while they remain in production, they're hardly efficient by today's standards. Delta Air Lines is, of course, a major operator of the E175 and essentially has no other choice if it expands its Delta Connection fleet or decides to replace older aircraft.

The Maeve MJ 500 not only promises innovative technology, but it also taps into a market that is lacking innovation and investment. With an advertised three-class (first/business, extra legroom economy, economy) capacity of 76 seats and a 34-tonne Maximum Takeoff Weight, the aircraft is clearly developed with US feeder airlines in mind. Such carriers are the world's largest operators of regional aircraft.

Broader Marker Prospects For The MJ 500

The MJ 500 has significant promise, but reservations remain about startup manufacturers that may struggle to maintain consistent funding. The airliner industry is capital-intensive and requires scale, which is why there are so few manufacturers. Maeve has already partnered with Mitsubishi and is reportedly looking to find more partners, which would boost its long-term chances of survival.

With a five-abreast layout, the MJ 500's design is clearly intended to support future growth. The only five-abreast airliner in production today is the far larger Airbus A220, while the Embraer E2, a four-abreast airliner, may have reached its limit in its E195-E2 variant, which matches the A220 in capacity. By going five-abreast, this aircraft will be easier to stretch into a larger version.

With a 100 passenger single class layout, the MJ 500 is advertised to have a range of 950 nautical miles (1,759 kilometers), and a range of 1,450 nautical miles (2,685 kilometers) when configured for US flying. These numbers are limited, but should still be acceptable for regional missions. As a whole, the MJ 500 is a promising aircraft, and its success will most likely depend on whether its manufacturer can survive and support it.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/maeve_hero.png?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-19 11:56:16.276528

On 18 September, the Albanese government announced a new emissions reduction target of 62 - 70% by 2035.

Ambitious as it may seem, the government reckons it is achievable. There is a multi-pronged plan in place including a $5bn Net Zero Fund and $2bn allocated to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC). There’s even a $50m budget to get sport clubs to decarbonise their operations.

As part of its plan, the government has also announced a $1.1bn push to incentivise the production of low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) in Australia. The CEFC, Australia’s state-backed investor, estimates this to be a $36bn opportunity in which the country possesses a hefty comparative advantage.

Billion-dollar idea

From Canberra’s perspective, there is an inherent and urgent appeal to increasing LCLF production. Over 80% of its liquid fuel demand is serviced from overseas. In addition, these fuels account for 32% of Australia’s emissions and half of the country’s energy use.

The government’s new Clean Fuels Program is a grant financing package spread over the next decade. It offers support to domestic LCLF players producing sustainable aviation fuel and low-carbon diesel. The use-case for these fuels is concentrated in hard-to-electrify transport segments such as aviation and shipping.

According to the government’s statement, the first production of ‘drop-in’ LCLF – which can be used in today’s engines – is expected by 2029.

Beneficiaries

Beneficiaries of the scheme will include companies such as HAMR Energy – a LCLF producer currently finalising a $10m series A funding round.

“This is a major boost for LCLF production in Australia, putting in place the incentives so project proponents like HAMR Energy can rapidly scale the industry”, says co-founder David Stribley.

Earlier in the year, when CEFC published a LCLF market study – it found evidence of a first mover advantage on offer. Much of the thesis rests on the country’s agro-industrial base and the supply of feedstock.

“We have MoUs for our feedstock - locally-sourced forestry residues which will provide an additional income source for that industry; we have strong demand for offtake from shipping and aviation companies; and now there is Federal funding in place that will be catalyst for LCLF production”, Stribley adds.

Licella, another LCLF company also welcomed the government’s financing package. The company’s proposed biorefinery in Queensland received $8m in funding support from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.

“Our technology is efficient, highly scalable, and combines low-cost production with access to abundant, low-carbon feedstocks. This gives Australia a genuine competitive advantage in producing the next generation of sustainable fuels”, says Dr. Len Humphreys, Licella’s chief executive.

Foreign clean fuel producers have also welcomed Canberra’s announcement. LanzaJet, which is aiming to deliver the country’s first ethanol-to-SAF plant in Queensland is one such company. Jimmy Samartzis, the company’s chief executive, commended Australia’s leaders for their ‘demonstrated vision and pragmatism’.

Missing piece

While the new funding is supply-side support, the demand-side of the equation is equally critical to the financial viability of LCLF businesses. HAMR Energy’s Stribley says progress on that front is being made.

“With significant supply-side support, the missing piece of the puzzle is on the demand-side. Globally this is already underway, with the International Maritime Organisation set to introduce a carbon price and international markets adopting SAF mandates”, Stribley notes.

The ability of LCLF companies to deploy their solutions at scale will depend on not only the underlying economics of their businesses but also investor conviction in their plans.

As these companies move up the financing ladder, at some point institutional financiers might fancy a seat at the table.

A significant milestone has been reached at Portland International Airport (PDX), where Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with Shell and the Port of Portland, successfully completed its first commercial-scale delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This marks a promising step forward in the evolution of greener air travel.

What Comes with This First Delivery?

The delivery encompassed over 400,000 gallons of blended SAF integrated into PDX’s fuel system. The fuel, a blend of conventional jet fuel and neat SAF supplied by Shell, was mixed at Zenith Terminal in Portland. The neat SAF originates from waste-derived feedstock produced in the United States, showcasing how innovative waste resources are powering the skies sustainably.

Transportation of the blended fuel to Portland International Airport involved multiple stages, including barge, truck, and pipeline movement, demonstrating a complex but coordinated logistics effort supporting this eco-friendly aviation initiative.

How Does Sustainable Aviation Fuel Impact Travel and Transfers?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel offers a notable reduction—over 80%—in carbon emissions compared with traditional jet fuel throughout its lifecycle. Although SAF technology is still advancing and production capacity is limited, initiatives like Delta’s delivery at PDX reflect a future where airports and airlines can support greener skies. For travelers, these developments could influence the carbon footprint of their flights and the overall sustainability of airport operations, including services such as taxi and transfer fleets that might also shift towards eco-conscious solutions over time.

Delta’s Role and Collaborative Strategy

This delivery is part of Delta’s larger plan to expand SAF availability and infrastructure in various airport hubs. Prior to Portland, Delta facilitated commercial SAF deliveries at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) and Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW). A broad coalition of partners, including local and federal stakeholders, collaborates to foster a sustainable SAF market and delivery system through the Port of Portland.

Furthermore, Delta actively supports government incentives aimed at encouraging SAF production and making it competitively priced. Significant incentives introduced in 2022, including tax credits for SAF blenders and clean fuel production, have helped propel the industry forward and are extended through 2029, hinting at robust future growth.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

SAF is an alternative jet fuel derived from renewable resources such as waste oils and plants. It is designed to substitute part of the fossil-based jet fuel in aircraft engines with minimal or no modification needed to existing infrastructure or planes. The ecological benefits are clear—it can slash carbon emissions by more than 80% over traditional fuels.

Aspect Details Fuel Source Waste-derived feedstock, plants, used cooking oils Carbon Emission Reduction More than 80% lifecycle reduction compared to conventional jet fuel Current Limitations Low production volume, high cost, emerging technology Engine Compatibility Compatible with existing aircraft engines and airport fuel delivery systems

Challenges Ahead

While SAF presents a game-changing opportunity for reducing aviation’s environmental impact, production volumes remain small and insufficient to meet the global demand of the airline industry. High costs, evolving technologies, and scaling delivery infrastructure are still hurdles to overcome. However, airline industry leaders and governments continue to focus on overcoming these challenges through collaborative frameworks and financial incentives.

Link to Taxi and Transfer Services

Airports are complex transport ecosystems—not just about flights but also about the ground services that connect passengers to and from their destinations. Sustainable aviation fuel’s progressive adoption aligns with a broader move toward greener transportation modes, including taxis and transfers. Companies and platforms, such as GetTransfer.com, support travelers by offering transparent access to vehicles with details about the type, ratings, and pricing—helping passengers choose rides that match their eco-conscious values and exact travel needs.

The plan reduces emissions and fuels green growth across the aviation and energy sectors.

Korea’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate signals a decisive shift in the country’s climate action strategy. From 2027, airlines flying internationally from Korean airports must use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This firm policy underscores Korea’s ambition to reduce aviation emissions while embracing global clean energy goals. Crucially, the mandate will stimulate new investment and technological growth in the energy sector.

Airlines will start by blending at least 1 per cent SAF with standard jet fuel. By 2030, the requirement will rise to 3–5 per cent and further increase to 7–10 per cent by 2035. These targets ensure a steady and manageable transition across the aviation industry.

SAF uses waste materials, used cooking oil, and renewable resources. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with traditional jet fuel. Therefore, it offers a vital solution for the aviation industry’s long-term sustainability. In addition, the policy supports international targets such as the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s climate commitments and the European Union’s ReFuelEU initiative.

Government officials emphasised that the rule will boost local demand for SAF. As a result, refiners, chemical firms, and energy companies are preparing to scale production and expand supply networks. To accelerate progress, the government will also deliver subsidies, tax relief, and certification systems that guarantee SAF quality and track pricing fairly.

Furthermore, airlines, refiners, and research institutions have allied. Together, they plan to expand production capacity and ensure a reliable supply. By shifting to SAF, Korea will reduce emissions, cut reliance on imported fuel, and unlock new business opportunities.",https://theelectricityhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AVIATION-FUEL.png,N,,2025-09-19 12:57:24.556210

The report outlined meticulous details on the need for SAF across the global aviation sector, and detailed India’s production potential and readiness for this green fuel.

The report suggested that, “The aviation industry has shown steady growth and resilience, becoming a key driver of global connectivity and economic development. However, rising concerns over climate change have placed increasing pressure on the sector to decarbonise”.

The report said that without effective mitigation, aviation emissions are projected to rise significantly and comprise a larger share of global emissions by 2050. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) has introduced the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to limit emissions to 85% of 2019 levels, while the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

The report said that SAF has emerged as the most viable near, mid and long-term solution to decarbonise the aviation sector, and is projected to contribute 53-66% of total sectoral emission reductions.

India’s prowess in SAF production- A potential gamechanger

India’s aviation sector is projected to lead global growth in air passenger traffic, with an annual expected growth by 11%-13% until 2030.

The report said, “As a result, demand for SAF is expected to rise in parallel, driven by proposed blending mandates (1% by 2027 and 2% by 2028, reaching upto 5% by 2030 for international travel), airline sustainability commitments, and corporate net-zero goals”.

The report said that India’s robust sugar industry has the ability to produce 350 to 400 Cr liters of SAF via surplus ethanol from the 1G route alone, by 2040. “The sector holds the potential to meet over ~50% of India’s total SAF demand by 2040. In the near term, the report projects that the sugar sector can easily support 125 to 150 Cr liters of SAF production in 2030 without any disruptions in the ongoing sugar supply or ongoing ethanol blending,” the report outlined.

Commenting on the report, Deepak Ballani, DG of Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) said that “India has a unique opportunity to lead the global transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with the ISMA–Deloitte Report charting a clear roadmap to not only meet our CORSIA commitments but also realise the Government of India’s vision of making the nation a SAF export hub. These findings are reinforced by the ICAO ACT–SAF Capacity-Building Report for India, which identifies Alcohol-to-Jet as the most viable pathway for our long-term SAF demand, with sugarcane-based feedstock offering the most scalable and lowest-carbon solution”.

He further added that the report underlines the readiness of India’s biofuel industry to lead the next wave of global decarbonisation. “We have the feedstock, aggregation systems, and technology in place. With an enabling ecosystem—akin to the Ethanol Blending Programme—we can rapidly scale SAF production, adoption, and consumption, all at once. This transformation is not just about cleaner skies; it is about empowering our farmers to fuel the future of global aviation while fulfilling our Viksit Bharat and Atmanirbhar Bharat goals,” he said.

However, the report highlights some key recommendations that can effectively support the scale-up of SAF production and use in India.

There is a need for a coherent and phased policy framework which is essential for unlocking the full potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in India. The report said, that “One of the most effective ways to create market demand is through mandatory blending targets beyond CORSIA. By providing long-term certainty to both producers and end-users, such mandates can guide investment decisions and align SAF deployment with national decarbonization goals. Amongst other recommendations are- (i). Offering time-bound financial support such as tax incentives, viability gap funding, or capital subsidies could help improve early-stage project viability. (ii). Considering a Price Cap Mechanism and Long-Term Offtake Agreements (iii). Streamlining Regulatory Approvals, and (iv).

Joshua NevettPolitical reporter

The UK government's climate change advisory panel has said it has not yet been asked to formally assess how plans to expand Heathrow airport would impact on carbon emissions targets.

The Climate Change Committee (CCC) told the BBC it would give a view on plans to build a third runway at Heathrow if advice was requested.

The government said the expansion must not breach the UK's legally binding target of lowering emissions to net zero by 2050.

The CCC is required by law to assess whether the target will be met and it has repeatedly cautioned against airport expansion.

The government said it was assessing initial proposals on Heathrow expansion and would engage with the committee during the process.

Ministers can ask the CCC for ad-hoc advice on specific policy issues but is under no legal duty to follow it.

Lord Deben, a former CCC chairman, said there was ""limited space for aviation growth"" without emissions reductions.

""If they give planning permission for expansion of Heathrow that inevitably means there will be less opportunity for other airports in Britain,"" Lord Deben said.

""This must be a sensible, logical decision and the CCC must be involved in giving advice.""

Greenpeace UK said there was an obvious need for independent experts at the committee ""to assess the real risks and costs of any expansion"".

""Any attempt to side-step them would show a complete lack of confidence in Labour's stated position regarding the tests a new runway needs to pass, and more importantly, miss the legal requirement for UK carbon reductions,"" Dr Douglas Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said.

The CCC also told the BBC it had not been asked to provide advice on any future expansion of Gatwick Airport.

A decision on a proposed second runway at Gatwick is expected in the coming weeks after Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was ""minded to approve"" the expansion in February.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the Labour government was backing plans for a third runway at Heathrow in January this year.

Reeves said Heathrow expansion, delayed for decades over environmental concerns, would ""make Britain the world's best connected place to do business"" and boost economic growth.

At the time, the government said the expansion ""must be delivered in line with the UK's legal, environmental and climate obligations"".

The expansion of Heathrow has long been opposed by green groups and it is expected to face resistance and probably legal challenges, not least because of its environmental impact.

In July, the CEO of Heathrow Airport, Thomas Woldbye, insisted the expansion proposal was in line with the aviation industry's target to be net zero by 2050.

But he acknowledged that planning permission would not be granted by the government unless legal limits of emissions were adhered to.

The government wants to review planning guidelines that will shape its decisions to expand Heathrow, Gatwick and other major airports.

Giving evidence to MPs this week, the CCC's chief economist, Dr James Richardson, said it wasn't too late to influence the review, which has not been launched yet.

But Labour MP Barry Gardiner said he was seriously worried the CCC was ""acquiescing in what the government is planning for aviation"".

He questioned why the government had not sought the CCC's advice before announcing its support for Heathrow's expansion.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/162b/live/5d579690-9493-11f0-ba65-8fdb5f152e03.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:57:10.994902

To hear from Kansas farmers and farm leaders about their concerns going into fall harvest, watch the video below.","“Gotta #FeedThe9.”

Remember that phrase from a little over a decade ago? “Feed the 9” was a rallying cry from agribusinesses and the agricultural marketing community referencing that the world’s population was going to be at or over 9 billion souls by 2050.

That's so many mouths to feed. A growing middle class that was demanding higher-quality proteins called for a growing demand for feed grains to feed those livestock. So, of course U.S. farmers were encouraged to ramp up production efficiency through seed technology, crop inputs and equipment. And there was a need to get as many people farming as possible, because farmers were less than 2% of the total U.S. population, and they were needed to feed not just the U.S. but also the world.

I remember sitting in great big halls at farm meetings, listening to futurists and market experts talk about the growing demand from China for U.S. grain and beef. But those same speakers also cautioned that this was a strategy that could come back to bite us if relations between our two nations ever turned frosty.

I recall a conversation with one agribusiness professional who had lived through the 1970s and 1980s, who told me that this felt, to them, an awful lot like “Earl Butz 2.0.” In simple terms, farmers took on a lot of debt to buy land and equipment, then planted fencerow to fencerow to feed the world grain demand. That led to overproduction and commodity prices tanking, which in turn led to trouble servicing that debt and, eventually, farm failures.

A decade ago, listening to that agribusiness professional, I remember being skeptical. “Surely we would have learned from that, and the guard rails wouldn’t let that happen again,” I thought to myself. After all, our commodity checkoffs have been building relationships for 60 years or so to create a broader export market for our goods beyond just one country. Lenders were more cautious about operating loans. And no elected or appointed officials would want to repeat that disaster on their watches through trade policy. Right?

Well, it’s 2025. And from conversations with farmers at the Kansas State Fair, I’m seeing similarities that cause me to pause. Input costs are rising above the cost of production. We’re fighting inflation and looking down the barrel of a possible recession. We’ve got a situation where China isn’t taking any U.S. new-crop soybeans — yet. And those trade issues are starting to affect our sorghum and corn export markets as well.

A Kansas soybean farmer taking their new crop to the elevator this fall harvest has to decide: Are they going to sell just enough to service their immediate loan obligations and store the rest in the short term in the hopes of price increases that may or may not cover the storage and real interest costs? Or will they sell it all at once, making about 40 cents a bushel after they cover their costs of production? Even if cash prices for new crops rally upward in the coming months, it may not be enough for some farmers to break even. Watch more from our Farm Futures ""Ag Marketing IQ in Depth"" series from July 29.

If China was still purchasing U.S. soybeans, though? According to the American Soybean Association and other experts, historically, that would have raised cash prices $2 to $3 per bushel over current prices (as of Sept. 17, $9.44 to $10.08 per bushel), with profits on a 50-bushel-per-acre yield of about $100 to $200 per acre. That would have reduced price volatility so that farmers could plan for 2026 with some predictability. It also, in general, would have supported farmland values and made a better environment for input suppliers.

But the reality is that China may not come back to purchasing U.S. soybeans anytime soon. The country may be happy with Brazil’s soybeans, with which it has replaced ours. And the trade war may go on for longer than farmers would like.

Our bright spot is that with cattle prices where they are, farmers who can walk their crop off the farm in the form of a pen of cattle, rather than drive it off in a grain wagon, may have an opportunity. Farmers who know their cost of production to the penny and learned from the mistakes of past generations may be in a position to capitalize on opportunities as they come along. And, if we can get year-round E15 finally approved and the sustainable aviation fuel industry up and running, that can support domestic demand for grains. There are opportunities that we have in 2025 that we didn’t have in 1980.

Will the U.S. “Feed the 9” though? Should Kansas farmers focus on that in 2026 and beyond? Or should they plan for reduced market demand and see Brazil and other nations fill that rallying cry? That’s up to each of you, my friends, to decide for your farms.

The world’s governments gather in Montreal at the end of September to focus on the development of global aviation at the 42nd ICAO Assembly. Turning targets, promises, and pledges of support for the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into actual SAF production should be top of mind.

Through ICAO, governments have agreed to decarbonize aviation by 2050—the epoch-defining Long-Term Global Aspirational Goal (LTAG). They also recognize the importance of SAF in achieving this and set an interim goal for SAF to enable a 5% reduction in international aviation’s carbon intensity by 2030.

Despite these commitments, SAF production is not on a trajectory to meet either of these goals. SAF production today satisfies just 0.7% of aviation’s fuel needs. And the ICAO Assembly is a golden opportunity for a critical re-set of efforts to make SAF the decarbonization driver we need it to be.

For SAF production to be possible, there has to be enough material (feedstock) available. SAF can be made from many things and in many ways, including used cooking oil, municipal waste, and agricultural residues. There is also the potential for e-SAF—SAF made by turning electrical power into liquid fuel. And whatever feedstock is used, it must be sustainable and not encroach on land or water resources needed to feed people.

The situation is encouraging. There will be enough feedstock, but it will only be available to aviation with some fundamental changes in how the SAF industry is developing. While this is no small task, the good news is that this can be influenced positively by government policy.

So, what should states focus on at the Assembly?

First, a functioning market for SAF is essential. Right now, there is far too little production of SAF and that production may not be in the physical location where the airline needs it. We can lower that barrier by adopting a book-and-claim system. If an airline can buy SAF where it is available and claim its sustainability benefits separately from the physical delivery, while verifying that there is no double-counting, then we can create a global market for SAF with infinitely more possibilities for it to be used to reduce aviation’s carbon emissions.

IATA has developed a SAF Registry to do the needed tracking. And to ensure that there is no bias in the system we have created a neutral third party to manage the Registry known as the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO). A registry cannot instantly deliver a global SAF market on its own, but with the support of governments, it can constitute foundational and indispensable market infrastructure.

Second, we need governments to update their policies when unintended consequences prevent progress. For example, mandates have had the perverse effect of driving up SAF prices when the policy objective must be to lower costs. Fuel suppliers have increased their margins on jet fuel to cover themselves for any risks related to the SAF mandates they face. As a result, Europe has become the most expensive place in the world to buy SAF with prices that are five times higher than conventional fuel. That’s monopolistic pricing behavior which it must be the duty of policy makers to prevent.

When creating new markets—energy markets in this case—the initial focus should be on developing the technology needed. Incentives are essential, to stimulate R&D, investments, production, reduce costs, and build a resilient SAF ecosystem. Mandates used too early in the process will only protect incumbents and raise their profits.

And lastly, we ask governments to look at the bigger picture when they consider their SAF policy options. SAF is a renewable fuel, part of total renewable energy production, which in turn is part of the whole energy complex. In essence, we need support to be redirected from fossil energy to renewable energies, providing low-emitting fuels to every sector, including SAF to air transportation. No sector and industry can solve their decarbonization on their own. It has to be a part of a national (regional, global) energy transition, and policy makers need to want it as much as we do.

Why sometimes they appear to not want it as much as we do is a bit of a mystery, given the gains it can bring to their economy. The energy transition can increase energy independence, create jobs, improve the agricultural sector, help preserve biodiversity, and strengthen local communities. The energy transition is a unique policy instrument for economic development across all sectors, everywhere.

There is momentum. Although still at low levels, SAF production did double in 2024 and will do so again in 2025. There are at least 160 SAF production projects that could become operational by 2030. And the list of airline agreements to purchase SAF is at 170 and rising. If governments can focus on supporting a functioning SAF market, correct mistakes when they happen, and align efforts with the big-picture possibilities of SAF, it is still possible to reach our common net zero by 2050 goal. That’s the message we’ll be taking to the ICAO Assembly.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/22c99a2b9add47b29703266f1383da18/marie-owens-thomsen---close.jpg,N,,2025-09-19 11:57:20.884004

Abstract

The global energy transition is pushing the development of advanced biofuels to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the aviation industry. This study thoroughly evaluates the potential of the Colombian crude palm oil (CPO) sector to support sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Extensive primary data from 53 palm oil mills and 269 palm plantations were examined. The methodology included a carbon footprint analysis of SAF produced from Colombian CPO through the HEFA pathway, an economic aspects analysis, a review of renewable fuel standards, and an assessment of market access for low-CO2-emitting feedstocks. The results show that the carbon footprint of the Colombian palm oil-SAF is 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF, which is significantly lower than the 89.2 g CO2eq MJ−1 reference value for traditional jet fuel. This figure considers current direct Land Use-Change (DLUC) emissions and existing methane capture practices within the Colombian palm oil agro-industry. A sensitivity analysis indicated that this SAF’s carbon footprint could decrease to negative values of −4.58 g CO2eq MJ−1 if all surveyed palm oil mills implement methane capture. Conversely, excluding DLUC emissions from the assessment raised the values to 47.46 g CO2eq MJ−1, highlighting Colombia’s favorable DLUC profile as a major factor in its low overall CPO carbon footprint. These findings also emphasize that methane capture is a key low-carbon practice for reducing the environmental impact of sustainable fuel production, as outlined by the CORSIA methodology. Based on the economic analysis, investing in Colombian CPO-based SAF production is a financially sound decision. However, the project’s profitability is highly susceptible to the volatility of SAF sales prices and raw material costs, underscoring the need for meticulous risk management. Overall, these results demonstrate the strong potential of Colombian palm oil for producing sustainable aviation fuels that comply with CORSIA requirements.

1. Introduction

The past decade has witnessed a boom in the production of advanced biofuels, a consequence of the global energy transition aimed at mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuels. Global CO2eq emissions in 2022 were reported at 57.4 billion tons, with the energy sector accounting for 36% of this total [1]. Within the energy sector, air transport was responsible for 2.5% of total GHG emissions [2]. Given the anticipated growth in global flight demand in 2023 relative to 2019 [3], the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has advocated for the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF offers a significantly reduced carbon footprint compared to traditional fossil fuels [4]. This is because SAF contributes to mitigating GHG emissions since it is produced from renewable energy feedstocks.

SAF utilizes renewable and sustainable feedstocks, such as biomass, organic waste, used cooking oils, vegetable oils, and other waste-derived feedstocks [5]. SAF is projected to contribute to a reduction of at least 65% of the GHG emissions required within the global aviation sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Owing to the use of biomass as a feedstock, SAF has a lower carbon footprint than the reference fossil fuel [7]; the carbon dioxide released during combustion is roughly equivalent to the quantity sequestered by plants during photosynthesis in the production of the biomass [8]. Consequently, fuels derived from biomass possess a net-zero carbon emissions profile, rendering SAF usage effectively carbon neutral [9]. Furthermore, SAF can be blended with conventional jet fuel or used as a drop-in replacement in existing aircraft engines without requiring significant infrastructure modifications. This compatibility stems from its physicochemical properties, similar to petroleum-derived jet fuels, and its seamless integration with existing infrastructure [10].

SAF production reported about 600 million liters worldwide in 2023 [6]. Although production in 2024 was expected to triple that quantity [6], only 1300 million liters was achieved in 2024 [11]. Although it is estimated that SAF consumption will continue to grow, there is a significant concern about the availability of raw materials for this market [12]. Similarly, it is crucial for all actors in the supply chain to promote investments, policies, and regulations that encourage large-scale production and reduce associated costs, which is essential for increasing the production of SAF [6]. With the right support, UFAS can play a crucial role in a more sustainable aviation industry transition and contribute significantly to carbon emission reduction [13].

The routes to obtain SAF are classified according to the conversion process and the feedstock type used, whether waste, by-product, or co-product [4,5]. Table 1 shows the most promising technological routes for SAF production, where one of the main routes is hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). HEFA is a mature, commercially available technology [13] that involves lipid hydroprocessing feedstocks, such as vegetable oils and their respective free fatty acids, animal fats and oils, waste oils, and used cooking oils (UCO). The process involves several catalytic reactions in the presence of hydrogen that generate hydrocarbon chains as main products, along with by-products such as propane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water [14,15]. Fischer-Tropsch is another of the most promising conversion routes, which involves biomass gasification to obtain synthesis gases and ultimately a liquid biofuel [5,14,16].

Currently, the technology available at an industrial scale is the HEFA pathway for producing SAF. In contrast, medium-term technology may involve the transformation of waste biomass to SAF through gasification, Fischer-Tropsch, or pyrolysis [17]. A general overview of these two technologies applicable to the palm oil sector is shown in Figure 1. The GHG emissions generated can vary depending on the route, process, or feedstock used to produce SAF [18]. Therefore, life cycle analysis methodology is essential to determine if the SAF used can reduce the offsetting obligations of aircraft operators under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) program [7]. In the CORSIA program, the system limits range from feedstock cultivation to the combustion of SAF, with 1 MJ burned in the aircraft engine considered as a functional unit (g CO2eq/MJ).

Crude palm oil (CPO) is a vegetable oil with the potential to produce SAF. Although worldwide, the main market for CPO is the food segment (84%), about 16% of its consumption is to produce biofuels [19,20]. Therefore, CPO has a great opportunity to access new markets in the biofuel segment, as long as it contributes to GHG emissions reduction associated with the use of fossil fuels. The routes applicable in the palm oil sector include the HEFA route using CPO as a feedstock and the Fischer-Tropsch route utilizing palm biomass as a feedstock.

In Colombia, by 2024, a total of 7.8 million tons of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) were processed, yielding 1.72 million tons of crude palm oil (CPO) [20]. Although CPO is the primary product of the oil palm sector, it accounts for only 18% to 25% of the total FFB processed at the mill. Meanwhile, the biomass generated during CPO extraction contributes to about 45% of the total FFB processed. Thus, this biomass serves as a significant resource for developing products such as bioenergy, biomaterials, and biofuels [21,22].

Therefore, the country’s palm oil sector is crucial for satisfying part of the food and biomass demand required by the market to decarbonize the economy [23]. In Colombia, the palm oil sector has demonstrated significant progress in environmental performance, evidenced by the signing of Zero Deforestation Agreement, implementation of landscape management tools, the efforts in implementation of measurement and reduction in its water footprint, the application of sustainability standards (ISCC, RSPO, APS Colombia), the generation of renewable energy from biomass, and the adoption of strategies to reduce GHG emissions [20,24].

Previous studies have identified that fertilization, direct land-use change (DLUC), diesel consumption, and palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment contribute most significantly to GHG emissions in the CPO production chain [22,25]. These emissions can be mitigated through effective low-carbon practices, such as the efficient use of chemical fertilizers, crop expansion into suitable and available areas, optimization of diesel consumption, and capture and utilization of biogas generated in the POME treatment system. It is estimated that, by applying these practices, the sector possesses the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 55%. Notably, the most substantial impact on GHG emission reduction is achieved through biogas (methane) capture, contributing a 35% reduction relative to the chain’s total emissions. In quantitative terms, if all methane generated in the POME treatment systems of the Colombian palm oil sector were captured, an estimated reduction of approximately 1.4 million tons of CO2 equivalent could be achieved [26].

To contribute to global climate change mitigation, several countries have established specific GHG emission reduction targets. Colombia, for instance, has proposed a 51% reduction in its national GHG emissions, based on projected emissions for 2030 as a reference scenario, as outlined in Colombia’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Update [27]. Considering this, the country’s palm oil sector holds significant potential to contribute to the national emissions reduction. This contribution can be achieved particularly through the capture of methane emissions generated in the POME treatment systems and their subsequent utilization in bioenergy generation, thereby supporting the nation’s energy transition and decarbonization efforts.

This study primarily aims to: (i) assess the carbon footprint of the Colombian SAF production chain, building upon CPO carbon footprint data previously established by the authors as a national average derived from primary data collected in the field; (ii) review the regulatory landscape for renewable fuels concerning their carbon intensity; and (iii) identify strategic opportunities for market access that prioritize low-CO2-emission raw materials. This document systematically describes the calculation methodology, data acquisition sources, outcomes of the mass and energy balance, the GHG balance of the SAF production chain, the evaluation of relevant regulations, and the identified market access opportunities.

2. Materials and Methods

This section presents the study’s methodological approach, divided into four parts. Section 2.1 Briefly describe the geographical conditions of the study area and the characteristics of the palm oil sector. Section 2.2 explains the carbon footprint of SAF production from Colombian CPO, based on CPO carbon footprint data from a previous study by the authors, which used primary data collected in the field to establish a national average [22]. Section 2.3 provides a general overview of the economic aspects of SAF production using Colombian palm oil as a feedstock. Section 2.4 reviews current regulations for renewable fuels, especially regarding their carbon intensity. Section 2.5 explores opportunities for Colombian palm oil to access markets focused on CO2 emissions reduction.

2.1. Study Area

Colombia’s climate is mainly shaped by its equatorial position, the Andes Mountain Range, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). These elements create a mostly uniform tropical climate where temperature differences are influenced by altitude, resulting in distinct thermal zones (pisos térmicos)—the warm, temperate, cold, and very cold levels. The country’s climate regions are varied, including a tropical climate in areas like the Amazon rainforest and the Pacific coast, a monsoon tropical climate with a short dry season along the southern Pacific and Caribbean coasts, and a tropical savanna climate with alternating wet and dry seasons in the Atlantic lowlands and the Eastern Plains. Annual rainfall varies greatly across the country, from as little as 267 mm in the arid Guajira Peninsula to over 9000 mm in the extremely wet Chocó department [28].

Colombia has a total land area of 114 million hectares. Of this, the agricultural frontier, or the potential area for cultivation, is 43 million hectares, which represents 34% of the country’s total land [29]. In 2021, only 5.3 million hectares were registered as cultivated, which is a mere 13.5% of the total agricultural potential. National agricultural production in Colombia is favored by the country’s climate and biophysical conditions [28], which permit the cultivation of a variety of products, including cereals, fruits, legumes, tubers, vegetables, and tropical crops like oil palm.

In 2024, the cultivated area for oil palm in Colombia was 609 thousand hectares. This resulted in the processing of 7.8 million tons of fresh fruit bunches (FFB), yielding 1.72 million tons of crude palm oil (CPO) [30]. In the sector, 32% of CPO production is certified according to sustainability standards [20].

2.2. Carbon Footprint of SAF Production

The carbon footprint of SAF production is estimated to follow the life cycle steps described in Figure 2. First, the carbon footprint of Colombian CPO production, as raw material to produce SAF, is calculated. This includes the cultivation stage, FFB transportation, CPO extraction, and direct LUC associated with the establishment of palm crops. Second, the carbon footprint of the biofuel production process is estimated, including CPO transportation, SAF transformation, and SAF burning in the engine.

2.2.1. Carbon Footprint of Colombian CPO

For this study, we utilized a previously established database developed by the same authors [22], which was created to assess the carbon footprint of the CPO production chain in Colombia. The dataset was compiled directly from palm plantations and palm oil mills across the country. The life cycle assessment (LCA) inventory for the present study was generated from that collected data, incorporating the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines, Ecoinvent emission factors (SimaPro 9 software, Ecoinvent v3 database), and national/international bibliographic and technical resources from the sector. The GHG emissions considered in the assessment included methane (CH4) from anaerobic POME degradation, carbon dioxide (CO2) from the CPO production chain, and nitrous oxide (N2O) associated with soil management and chemical fertilization. In addition, direct LUC linked to palm cultivation was incorporated. The functional unit for the analysis was defined as grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule of fuel produced (g CO2eq MJ−1).

2.2.2. SAF Carbon Footprint from Colombian CPO, as Feedstock

The carbon footprint of SAF production is estimated following the CORSIA program methodology. This program aims to reduce GHG emissions by at least 10% compared to fossil fuel jet (89 g CO2eq MJ−1) [7]. The input and output inventories for the HEFA route process are used to calculate emissions. A functional unit of 1 megajoule of energy (1 MJ) is established since biofuel energy is the primary product of the evaluated production chain. The impact is expressed in units of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq). Figure 3 shows the system’s limits evaluated to obtain SAF in this study.

Biofuel production via the HEFA route involves processes analogous to petroleum refining, specifically hydroprocessing and distillation. HEFA requires a hydrogen-rich environment, along with high temperatures and pressures (315–370 °C and 41–101 bar), as well as catalysts to facilitate chemical reactions and the formation of desired molecules [32]. In the HEFA process, the double bonds of fatty acids are saturated with hydrogen. The triglycerides are then catalytically separated into propane and fatty acids. Subsequently, the oxygen in the fatty acids is removed through two main reactions: hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), where oxygen is replaced by hydrogen, producing water (H2O), or decarboxylation (CDO), where oxygen is removed as carbon dioxide (CO2). HDO requires higher hydrogen consumption but avoids CO2 emissions; in contrast, CDO generates CO2 and methane, which reduces the liquid fuel yield. In both cases, the reactions are controlled by selecting catalysts and adjusting operating conditions. A third reaction, decarbonylation, can produce carbon monoxide and water. Vegetable oils with high levels of saturated fatty acids are particularly suitable for the HEFA route as they demand less hydrogen, thereby optimizing the process [33,34].

2.2.3. Data Source

CPO Production Chain Data

This section provides a summary of the data sources used to calculate the carbon footprint of the Colombian CPO production chain, as detailed comprehensively in a previous study by the authors [22]. The primary data used in the Colombian CPO carbon footprint were collected through field visits. This included information from 53 palm oil mills (POM), which collectively represented 85% of the national CPO production in 2021. Likewise, data on palm cultivation were gathered from 269 plantations, accounting for 36% of the national FFB production in 2021 [22]. The geographical distribution of these participating mills and plantations across Colombia’s four palm-growing regions (north, central, eastern, and southwestern) is depicted in Figure 4 (adapted from [22]).

(a)

Plantation management

Data collected from the plantations include inputs related to chemical fertilizers, organic fertilizers, agrochemicals, and fossil fuel consumption (transport and energy). Emissions from fertilization include fertilizer production and the direct and indirect N2O emissions resulting from fertilizer application. Data was individually calculated for each participating plantation. However, to extrapolate emissions across all oil palm-growing areas, the average GHG emissions from these plantations were assumed to represent the total FFB produced per region in 2021. These regional values were then aggregated to determine the national GHG emissions for the oil palm sector. The nursery stage was not considered in the study [22].

(b)

Land-use change (LUC)

Direct LUC dynamics were analyzed at a 1:100,000 scale for Colombia’s Northern, Central, and Eastern regions, covering the period 2007 to 2020, acknowledging that Colombian palm oil cultivation is not linked to primary forest deforestation [20,35,36]. Satellite images from the LandSat program for the 2007 reference year were utilized. The Southwestern region (Tumaco) and the Urabá (Northern region) lacked sufficient cloud-free satellite images for LUC reporting. The oil palm cultivated area in 2020 was determined using the Catastro Palmero [37] layer. Table 2 (adapted from [22]) shows the percentage of areas converted to oil palm in each palm region from 2007 to 2020. Following the IPCC guidelines, this study’s LUC calculations account for terrestrial carbon fluxes resulting from land conversion. These calculations utilized a 25-year plantation lifetime and included carbon stock values from below- and above-ground palm biomass [38].

It is important to note that this study is not based on the “unused land approach” principle nor on the “low LUC risk” approach of the CORSIA methodology. The LUC dynamics during the study period show that oil palm cultivation mainly took place on land that was already used for agriculture. This confirms that the areas converted to oil palm included lands already in production, such as existing oil palm plantations, indicating replanting and management on established agricultural lands. Additionally, the shift in pasture and herbaceous vegetation reflects a move from livestock or other crops to oil palms. Regarding the areas labeled as fragmented forests, it is noteworthy that this category is particularly significant because it aligns with the “CORINE Land Cover methodology adapted for Colombia.” These areas are not primary forests but small, isolated forest patches. The analysis of these fragmented forests distinguishes between those surrounded by pastures and crops and those with secondary vegetation, which are presumed to be areas where pastures or crops were abandoned, allowing natural vegetation to recover. These findings show that the expansion of Colombia’s palm oil sector has mainly focused on intensifying land already used for agriculture, aligning with international sustainability standards.

Palm oil mill

Palm kernel oil and palm kernel meal are included in this study. Fiber and shell are utilized in the boiler as fuel to generate steam. This study does not account for CO2 emissions from the combustion of this biomass in the boilers, as biomass is considered a biogenic source [25]. A methane production rate of 0.36 m3 CH4 kg−1 chemical oxygen demand (COD) removed was assumed. For POMs equipped with anaerobic digestion ponds for biogas capture, biogas leakage was not considered in the original assessment [22]. For this study, a methane leakage factor of 5% was assumed for the covered anaerobic lagoons, consistent with data from [39,40,41].

SAF Production Data

The novelty of the present study lies in the assessment of the carbon footprint of Colombian palm oil-based SAF production. This includes detailed calculations for SAF production, which rely on data from technical literature concerning the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process. For this assessment, the CPO transport to the HEFA plant is estimated to be 50 km. Furthermore, the following key considerations were made: (i) GHG emissions associated with biofuels vary depending on the technical characteristics of the production process and the raw material supply conditions. (ii) The carbon footprint assessment encompasses processes from cultivation through the conversion of CPO into biofuel. (iii) GHG emissions from transport and conversion processes are attributed to using electricity, thermal energy, and chemical products derived from fossil sources. (iv) The produced SAF is allocated emissions based on an energy-based approach.

Consistent with international standards, the CORSIA program’s Equation (1) is used for calculating SAF emissions [31].

L S f = C O R E L C A + I L U C L C A

(1)

LSf = GHG emissions from SAF production (g CO2eq MJ−1); CORE LCA = data on CPO production as feedstock (FFB cultivation, FFB harvesting and collection, CPO extraction), feedstock transportation to processing and fuel production facilities, feedstock to fuel conversion processes, fuel transportation, and distribution to the blending point, fuel combustion in an aircraft engine = 0; ILUC LCA = induced land-use change due to raw material production.

According to Equation (1), a key component of CORSIA involves the treatment of Induced Land Use Change (ILUC), which refers to GHG emissions resulting from indirect land-use changes [31]. CORSIA adopts a consequential approach for ILUC emissions, which are then added to the core lifecycle GHG emissions (calculated using an attributional approach) to derive the total lifecycle GHG emissions (LSf) for a given SAF pathway. ILUC values for an eligible raw material are not measured directly by the operator/supplier; instead, they are derived from two distinct global economic models: GTAP-BIO and GLOBIOM. These models simulate the indirect land-use effects caused by increased demand for biofuel feedstocks. When calculating ILUC values for new pathways, if the results from these two models differ by 8.9 g CO2eq MJ−1 or less, the average value is used. If the difference is greater, the lower value plus an adjustment factor of 4.45 g CO2eq MJ−1 is applied [31].

CORSIA provides a default CORE LCA value for palm oil HEFA with methane capture set at 37.4 g CO2eq MJ−1, while without methane capture, it is 60.0 g CO2eq MJ−1 [31]. Additionally, the CORSIA default ILUC LCA value for eligible fuels produced via the HEFA conversion process is 39.1 CO2eq MJ−1 [42]. Aircraft operators seeking to claim emission reductions from using CORSIA-eligible fuels can use either actual life cycle emissions or these default values for their calculations. It is crucial to note that both the default CORE LCA and ILUC values for palm oil HEFA have been established by CORSIA mainly for leading biofuel-producing and aviation fuel-consuming regions, including the USA, EU, Brazil, and Malaysia/Indonesia. As a result, other countries do not fall within this framework and lack CORSIA-specific default values, which affects their classification as eligible SAF feedstock producers [31]. Therefore, they cannot apply Equation (1) to determine GHG emissions from SAF production (LSf).

According to CORSIA’s regulations, biofuel feedstock and its associated land use type are classified as ineligible if the combined emissions from direct land use change (DLUC) and the core life cycle analysis (CORE LCA) fail to meet the established sustainability threshold (DLUC + CORE LCA) [9]. This criterion ensures that the total GHG impact of a fuel source is below a predetermined limit (10% reduction) to be considered viable for the CORSIA program. It is also important to note that under CORSIA guidelines, and independent of the ILUC value established by ICAO for SAF feedstocks, the DLUC of these feedstocks is a mandatory component of the assessment.

Since Colombia’s palm oil lacks an established ILUC value; we estimated the DLUC according to CORSIA’s methodology, as it was shown in CPO Production Chain Data Section. This step is crucial for establishing a carbon footprint value for Colombian palm oil, which can then be used to benchmark against data from other producing countries. In the sensitivity analysis section, we present several scenarios to account for the uncertainty surrounding the ILUC value for Colombian palm oil. These scenarios are based on a range of assumptions to provide a more robust analysis.

Sensitivity Analysis

To assess the robustness of the calculated carbon footprint of SAF production and evaluate the influence of critical parameters, a sensitivity analysis was performed. This analysis specifically examined the impact of GHG emissions across the entire palm oil production chain under several distinct scenarios, focusing on (i) LUC impact, comparing scenarios that either incorporate or exclude the direct LUC impact associated with oil palm cultivation. (ii) ILUC impact of Colombian palm oil by comparing three scenarios. The first scenario assumes the same ILUC value as Malaysian palm oil, while the other two consider a lower ILUC value for Colombian palm oil, set at 20% and 30% of the Malaysian value, respectively. (iii) Closed pond treatment to meet the required emission savings by the CORSIA methodology. This comprehensive comparison allowed for a clear understanding of the individual and combined contributions of these factors to the overall environmental performance.

2.3. Analysis of Economic Aspects

A technical and economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of producing SAF from palm oil in Colombia. The study examined two different scenarios, each with a capacity of 400,000 tons per year. The first scenario considers building a new, standalone plant, while the second involves converting an existing refinery. The financial assessment for both scenarios included capital expenditure (CAPEX), operating expenses (OPEX), the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and the Net Present Value (NPV). Additionally, an analysis was carried out to measure how changes in sale prices, feedstock costs, and energy prices could affect the project’s overall profitability.

2.4. Regulation for Renewable Fuels in Line with CO2 Emissions

A systematic bibliographic review was conducted to identify and analyze current regulatory frameworks to evaluate renewable fuels. This review encompassed European, U.S., and Colombian regulations, alongside relevant international standards applicable to the aviation sector.

2.5. Opportunities to Access Markets for CO2 Emission Reductions

To assess market access opportunities related to CO2 emission reductions, this study analyzes the business potential for SAF production from Colombian palm oil.

3. Results

Building upon the CPO carbon footprint data established in a previous study by the authors [22], the novel findings of the present work are detailed as follows: (i) the GHG balance associated with palm oil-derived SAF production; (ii) a general overview of the economic aspects of SAF production; (iii) an analysis of relevant renewable fuel regulatory frameworks; and (vi) an evaluation of market access potential for fuels that contribute to GHG emission reduction.

3.1. Emissions Balance

3.1.1. Balance of Colombian CPO Emissions

The carbon footprint of CPO is reported to be 4.81 g CO2eq MJ−1. This value is determined through emission allocation based on the energy content of the co-products: CPO, palm kernel oil, and palm kernel meal. Figure 5 shows the carbon footprint and GHG emissions in the CPO production chain for 2021. This information is adapted from a prior study by the authors [22] in which the carbon footprint was calculated using economic allocation of the co-products 182 kg CO2eq t−1 CPO.

The primary contributors to these GHG emissions were methane (CH4) from POME treatment and the application of chemical fertilizers. A significant finding from the previous study was that direct LUC related to national oil palm cultivation between 2007 and 2020 primarily involved transitions from existing agricultural lands, specifically palm-to-palm (55.3%), pasture-to-palm (18.5%), and grassland-to-palm (11.3%). While 7.2% of LUC during this period involved fragmented forest conversion, this represented a negligible 0.7% of Colombia’s total deforestation attributed to oil palm, as reported by Satelligence [36]. This finding is corroborated by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM), which indicates that approximately 99% of oil palm plantations in Colombia are deforestation-free [43]. The Colombian palm oil sector has adopted Zero Deforestation and Non-Replacement of High Conservation Value (HCV) Areas as one of the ten Principles of Sustainable Palm Oil in Colombia, as outlined in the Colombian Palm Oil Sector Sustainability Strategy [20].

Some additional findings that stand out from the previous study [22] are (i) the Southwestern region reported the highest GHG emissions due to the LUC was primarily palm-to-palm, maintaining a carbon sequestration ratio of 113 t C ha−1 between 2007 and 2021. It is important to note that the Southwestern region represented only 4.4% of Colombia’s total CPO output in 2021. (ii) The Eastern region exhibited lower emissions associated with FFB and CPO production, accompanied by a substantial increase in carbon sequestration within its plantations. Also, this region showed a low footprint attributed to a higher adoption rate of biogas capture in POME treatment systems, effectively reducing methane emissions. (iii) Biogas capture in POME treatment is a critical factor in reducing emissions. For 2021, seven of the 53 analyzed mills had reduced CH4 emissions through biogas capture and flaring (five using it for electricity). Demonstrating a strong commitment to environmental performance, the Colombian palm oil sector is projected to achieve a substantial 25% reduction in CH4 emissions from its 2021 baseline, as methane capture systems are implemented in twelve more processing plants between 2021 and 2024.

3.1.2. Emissions Balance of SAF Produced from Colombian CPO

The HEFA process inventories are based on information from technical and scientific literature; consequently, they may not accurately reflect industrial performance.

Figure 6 shows the emission balance of the palm oil-derived SAF production plant using HEFA technology, including bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel (RD) as byproducts of the process. The process is described in two main stages, each with a distinct impact on carbon emissions. This assessment utilizes carbon footprint data for Colombian CPO as reported by Ramírez-contreras et al. (2024) [22] described in Section 3.1.1. and accounts for an average transport distance of 50 km to the HEFA conversion facility. For the HEFA process, the primary emission contributors are the consumption of natural gas and hydrogen, which are required for both process operations and chemical transformations.

Emission allocation among the resulting biofuels was performed using the following key parameters: a feedstock factor of 0.71 t SAF t−1 CPO (own calculations), a lower calorific value of SAF at 43 MJ kg−1 [13], and an energy allocation factor of 0.8 MJ SAF MJ−1 CPO (own calculation). The first stage, the HEFA conversion unit, integrates several inputs. The most significant of these, in terms of emissions, are natural gas (12.23 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF) and CPO (5.79 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF). These raw materials, along with hydrogen, energy, and transportation, are processed to generate a load of 20.01 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF before moving to the next phase. The second stage is the fractionation unit, where the output stream from the HEFA unit is processed and emissions are assigned. As a result, the palm oil-derived SAF produced exhibited a carbon footprint of 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF. This value thoroughly includes the direct LUC emissions associated with Colombian palm cultivation. This value is markedly lower than that of fossil aviation fuel (89.2 g CO2eq MJ−1) and also significantly lower than the SAF footprints reported by Prussi et al. (2021) [4] for Malaysian and Indonesian CPO-derived SAF (37.4 g CO2eq MJ−1 with biogas capture and 60.0 g CO2eq MJ−1 without biogas capture). This analysis illustrates that the selection of raw materials and energy sources is crucial for determining the final product’s emission profile, highlighting the importance of natural gas and CPO in the overall carbon footprint of the process. While hydrogen is a key input in the HEFA route for producing hydrocarbons [13], the variability of its impact on the total SAF emissions directly depends on the hydrogen source, the technology used for its production, and its transportation [44,45]. This reinforces the idea that to achieve truly sustainable SAF production, it is essential to use hydrogen from low or zero-carbon emission sources.

3.1.3. Sensitivity Analysis

To achieve the objectives of the sensitivity analysis, three scenarios were assessed against a defined reference scenario. The reference scenario represents the carbon footprint of SAF produced from Colombian palm oil. This scenario is based on primary data from the Colombian palm oil sector in 2021, collected by the authors during field visits for a previous study [22]. Notably, in 2021, among the 53 surveyed palm oil mills (POM), only 6 reported methane capture through closed lagoons. Scenario 1 enhances the reference scenario’s data by assuming that methane capture is implemented across all surveyed POM. Scenario 2 is based on the reference scenario’s data but excludes all direct LUC emissions. Scenario 3 combines the conditions of Scenario 2 (i.e., without direct LUC emissions) with the inclusion of methane capture from all surveyed POM.

Figure 7 illustrates the combined results for the three HEFA-derived products—SAF, renewable diesel, and bionaphtha—across the reference scenario and the three assessed scenarios. Notably, for the reference scenario, 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1 is the reported carbon footprint values for the HEFA process products This value is assigned to SAF and its co-products, such as bio-naphtha and renewable diesel. These values incorporate the DLUC associated with Colombian crude palm oil production and methane emissions reported by the surveyed palm oil mills (POMs) (6 POMs with closed ponds and 47 POMs with open ponds). Assuming methane capture for all POMs, as reported in Scenario 1, results in a carbon footprint −4.58 g CO2eq MJ−1 for HEFA products. This outcome is crucial as it highlights that the DLUC emissions from palm oil cultivation in Colombia are favorable, supporting CPO’s potential eligibility as a feedstock for sustainable fuel production.

Conversely, when evaluating the results without considering the DLUC from palm cultivation, the HEFA products exhibit GHG emission values 47.46 g CO2eq MJ−1. Comparing this data with that reported in the reference scenario confirms the significant contribution of DLUC to the carbon footprint. Emissions values in Scenario 3 demonstrate a decrease compared to Scenario 2, indicating that methane capture is also a key low-carbon practice for mitigating the environmental impact of sustainable fuel production, as specified by the CORSIA methodology [31].

According to CORSIA methodologies [9], when a calculation for DLUC yields a negative value—indicating an enhancement in carbon stocks such as soil organic carbon sequestration or biomass sequestration in agricultural plantations, this contribution is subject to verification under the same criteria as CORSIA Emissions Units. Methodologies for accounting for these negative DLUC sources must be submitted to and approved by the CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme Evaluation Group. The calculation is performed using only these approved methodologies, even if the negative DLUC value is ultimately lower than the ILUC value assigned by CORSIA.

For the palm oil sector, CORSIA’s methodology addresses the treatment of Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) lagoons and their associated impact on GHG emissions [31]. Specifically, methane (CH4) emissions arising from the anaerobic degradation of organic matter in POME ponds are a key consideration. The default methane emission factor for open POME ponds is established at 155 gCH4 m3 of POME [31]. CORSIA emphasizes that for palm oil production, implementing methane capture and utilization systems (e.g., covered lagoons or digesters) can lead to a significant reduction in these emissions. This distinction is reflected in CORSIA’s default LCA values for palm oil HEFA; (i) HEFA with methane capture has an average value of 37.4 g CO2eq MJ−1, whereas (ii) HEFA without methane capture has an average value of 60.0 g CO2eq MJ−1 [31]. Therefore, the CORSIA methodology formally recognizes closed lagoons as a technology that effectively reduces methane emissions from POME, directly influencing the carbon footprint calculation (as part of the core LCA) associated with palm oil production.

3.2. Analysis of Economic Aspects

This study compares two main business models for SAF production in Colombia, each with a distinct investment and profitability profile. For the raw material, a distribution was considered in which CPO constitutes 80% of the total. UCO accounts for 5%, while POME-oil and other fats make up the remaining 15%. The associated prices for these raw materials were established as follows: CPO: $1066 USD/ton, UCO: $1115 USD/ton, and POME-oil and other fats: $1018 USD/ton. It is important to note that the CPO price corresponds to the 2021 average national price. For their part, the prices of UCO and POME-oil were based on a reference price from October 2021, from which $180 USD/ton was deducted for freight and export costs. For the calculation model, it was assumed that all these prices would remain fixed throughout all years of the analysis.

The first scenario, building a new, independent plant, requires a total CAPEX estimated at $431.3 million USD. Despite the substantial investment, the economic projection is favorable, with an IRR of 16.9% and an NPV of $90.3 million USD. The investment payback period is projected to be 4 years. In contrast, the conversion of an existing refinery proves to be a more capital-efficient model. The required CAPEX is only $223.1 million USD, which is nearly half the cost of a new plant. This scenario’s profitability is significantly higher, with an IRR of 35.7% and an NPV of $276.2 million USD. The payback period is reduced to 3 years, making it the most attractive financial option.

The project’s profitability is highly sensitive to fluctuations in SAF sale prices and the costs of raw materials and energy. The study focuses on analyzing the impact of these variables on the IRR for the new plant scenario. For SAF prices, a ±2% variation in the sale prices of palm SAF and Class II fuels has a direct impact on the IRR. For instance, a 2% increase in prices could raise the IRR to 17.9%, while a 2% decrease could reduce it to 14.5%. The cost of raw materials constitutes a significant portion (70%) of total costs. The prices of CPO and used cooking oil (UCO) have a critical influence. A −2% decrease in these prices could increase the IRR to 21.8%, whereas a +5% increase in UCO prices could reduce it to 13.3%. Although natural gas and electricity costs represent smaller percentages of total costs (4% and 3%, respectively), they also affect the project’s viability. A 100% increase in natural gas or electricity costs could reduce the IRR to 16.1% and 17.8%, respectively. This economic analysis demonstrates that investing in SAF production from palm oil in Colombia is a sound decision, especially under the refinery conversion scenario. However, the project’s profitability is intrinsically linked to market price volatility, highlighting the need for careful risk management.

Our findings align with the study by Gómez et al. (2023) [46], which indicated that implementing SAF production in Colombia is feasible, though it involves some challenges that need to be addressed. The study used the PESTEL framework (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) to assess the country’s SAF development. It showed that although SAF is currently more costly than fossil fuels, its transaction cost depends on key factors such as the availability and price of raw materials, logistics, technology maturity, and regulatory environment. The study identified several viable technologies with production costs below $1 USD per liter, including HEFA, gasification with Fischer-Tropsch (FT), alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) conversion, and co-hydroprocessing in conventional refineries. Co-processing was highlighted as an appealing short-term option, given that Ecopetrol’s Cartagena refinery already has the necessary infrastructure for efficient production. Furthermore, Colombia’s lower carbon tax on aviation fuel (around $5 USD per ton) compared to countries like the Netherlands ($45 USD per ton) could offer a significant competitive advantage in SAF deployment. The report emphasizes that an initial phase with unregulated prices could motivate market supply [46].

3.3. Analysis of Regulations for Renewable Fuels

ICAO’s role and the CORSIA scheme

Under the guidance of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the aviation industry has prioritized the adoption of SAF to mitigate its environmental impact. To this end, ICAO has established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), implemented as a key regulatory mechanism to reduce carbon emissions from international flights and contribute to global climate change mitigation efforts [47]. It is anticipated that the CORSIA scheme, in conjunction with SAF utilization, could facilitate a 65% reduction in GHG emissions within the aviation industry. However, the successful adoption of CORSIA by ICAO member airlines is a priority for meeting market expectations and requires robust national-level initiatives that foster SAF production and adoption within individual member states’ air operations. This is particularly critical given the rapid growth in the sector; in 2022, the aviation industry’s emissions were estimated at 800 megatons (Mt) CO2, encompassing domestic and international flights, with a projected increase to over 1000 Mt CO2 annually by 2025 [48].

Global policy frameworks and mandates

The overarching policy initiatives align with respective jurisdictional frameworks, such as the RED II for the EU and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for the United States (U.S.). The “ReFuelEU Aviation” agreement, published by the European Union in 2023, establishes a significant, phased mandate for SAF incorporation into aviation operations. This mandate targets a progression from 2% SAF supply in 2025 to 70% by 2050, complemented by synthetic fuel blends [49]. In parallel, the U.S. has launched a fiscal policy and subsidy program specifically aimed at scaling up SAF production to 3 billion gallons by 2030, operating within the federal incentive framework [50]. Furthermore, state-level initiatives in the U.S. provide further incentives for SAF and drop-in renewable diesel fuel development. In Asia, Japan has notably proposed a 10% SAF mandate for aircraft operations by 2030 [51], while the Civil Aviation Administration of China has initiated a pilot program for SAF supply in aircraft operated by three national airlines [52].

In an analysis of regulatory frameworks for biofuel production, the USA. Clean Fuels Production Tax Credit (45Z), enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act, represents a significant policy shift [53]. Unlike previous programs that targeted fuel blenders, this credit directly incentivizes producers of low-carbon intensity (CI) transportation fuels, including biodiesel, renewable diesel, and SAF. The amount of the credit is tied to the fuel’s lifecycle GHG emissions, as determined by a CI score. To calculate this score, producers are mandated to use the 45ZCF-GREET model, with CORSIA methodologies also permissible for SAF [53]. This credit not only promotes decarbonization in the transport sector but also signals a strategic alignment with agricultural policy. The guidance from the U.S. Treasury proposes incorporating the benefits of climate-smart agricultural practices into the CI calculation, which could further lower a fuel’s score and financially reward farmers adopting these sustainable methods. Overall, the 45Z credit is a key mechanism for the U.S. to drive a cleaner energy transition while fostering domestic agricultural innovation.

Sustainability criteria and certification

The European Commission has formally acknowledged 15 biofuel certification schemes, including the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC-EU) and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB RED EU). Furthermore, the CORSIA program explicitly recognizes these two entities as authorized agents for certifying SAF under the ISCC CORSIA and RSB ICAO CORSIA schemes. This dual recognition across different regulatory frameworks underscores their critical role in ensuring the sustainability and traceability of biofuels in the global market.

Both CORSIA and REDII stipulate that only direct LUC occurring post-1 January 2008, are considered [9,54]. Furthermore, they mandate that feedstocks must be derived from land not designated as high-carbon stock, protected, or of high biodiversity value. Accurate calculations of LUC emissions are also a prerequisite for compliance. In the context of biofuel regulations, the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) initially classified palm oil as a feedstock with a high risk of direct LUC, linking its production to the conversion of carbon-rich lands, such as forests and peatlands [54,55]. Consequently, the directive mandated a progressive phase-out of biofuels derived from high-LUC-risk feedstocks, with a complete cessation planned by 2030 [56]. This policy has been further reinforced by RED III, which consolidates the disincentive framework for crop-based biofuels [57]. In line with the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, RED III explicitly prohibits the use of crop-based oils, including palm oil and soy, for SAF production while prioritizing advanced and low-risk biofuels, such as used cooking oil and animal fats [49].

With the recent implementation of RED III, which entered into force in 2023, the European Union has significantly raised its renewable energy ambitions, increasing the binding overall target from RED II’s 32% to at least 42.5% by 2030 [57]. This heightened ambition in RED III translates to even stricter sustainability criteria and a greater push for genuinely low-carbon biofuels. While the core principles of DLUC assessment and productivity enhancement remain, RED III emphasizes preventing deforestation and peatland conversion.

CORSIA includes an exemption for feedstocks designated as low-risk for land-use change (Low-risk-LUC), provided they originate from cultivation practices that demonstrate enhanced productivity. Examples of these practices include improved irrigation techniques, intercropping, and mechanical enhancements. When this type of certification is obtained, the ILUC factor is assigned a null value (0), thereby reflecting its non-competitive stance against food crop cultivation [9]. It is imperative to note that the eligibility cut-off date for this modality is 1 January 2016, which makes practices implemented before this date ineligible for certification. The ILUC LCA value is established by ICAO on a country-by-country basis, corresponding to the feedstock’s country of origin. For instance, while the ILUC LCA value for Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil is 39.1 [9], ICAO has not yet defined this value for Colombian palm oil.

The CORSIA methodology for SAF production assesses a raw material’s sustainability based on its environmental performance rather than on its inherent classification as “good” or “bad” [9]. The methodology includes detailed procedures to calculate the life cycle emissions of any eligible feedstock, including those with low LUC risk, such as waste, residues, and by-products, and those from yield-increasing approaches. Consequently, the key determinant of sustainability is the environmental performance of the entire supply chain and its contribution to reducing GHG emissions from global aviation, not the raw material itself. This approach provides a neutral, science-based method for evaluating the sustainability of any eligible feedstock, regardless of its origin.

Colombia’s role in sustainable palm oil certification

It is important to recognize that within Colombia’s distinctive agricultural landscape, a raw material might be considered low-risk for direct LUC if its cultivation employed productivity-boosting methods different from conventional practices or if it was grown on previously degraded or underused land. So far, the Colombian palm oil industry has shown a strong commitment to sustainability schemes, with 26.3% of its CPO production certified by recognized programs like ISCC, RSPO, and the Rainforest Alliance in 2021 [20]. This dedication has opened new opportunities, such as certifying raw material production under the ISCC CORSIA scheme using the “yield increase approach”. This method is described as a land management practice that allows feedstock producers to boost the amount of crops they grow within a fixed land area, without expanding the cultivated land [9]. It is achieved through better agricultural practices, intercropping, sequential cropping, or reducing post-harvest losses. In this context, it is remarkable that two Colombian companies, Gremca S.A. and Alianza del Humea S.A.S., have already obtained this certification. Gremca S.A. became the first palm oil company worldwide to do so, proving its ability to produce palm oil that meets the strict international standards for SAF manufacturing, as guided by the ICAO’s CORSIA program [58]. Later, Alianza del Humea S.A.S. became the second palm oil company globally to receive the same certification [59].

Beyond its attainment of CORSIA certification, the Colombian company Gremca S.A. has become the first palm oil producer in the world to achieve “deforestation-free” certification under the ISCC-EUDR standard [60]. This achievement marks a milestone for the palm oil industry, demonstrating the viability of sustainable production practices and positioning Colombia as a leader in responsible agriculture [60,61]. The ISCC-EUDR certification is especially important for accessing the European market, as it meets the requirements of the EU’s Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which aims to ensure that products imported into the EU are not linked to recent deforestation.

Based on the sustainability certifications achieved by Colombian palm oil companies, the possibility is strengthened that palm oil can be used as a sustainable raw material not only for SAF production but also for any other product that requires demonstrating the sustainable sourcing of its raw materials. Oil palm in Colombia has the potential to gain access to regulated markets due to efforts to expand oil palm cultivation in available areas, areas without high carbon stocks or high biodiversity [25,62,63]. Furthermore, renewal is moving towards oil palm interspecific O × G hybrids, which have proven to have higher productivity compared to the commercial Elaeis guineensis cultivar.

3.4. Analysis of Market Access Opportunities

Worldwide, air travel and tourism contributed 10.3% to the 2019 Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the Latin America and Caribbean region, this contribution was significantly higher, at approximately 22.1%, highlighting the indispensable role of air transport in fostering regional and international connectivity [12]. In Colombia, air tourism accounts for over 85% of domestic travel [12], suggesting a substantial market opportunity for SAF adoption by airlines. While airlines are actively pursuing increased SAF integration to achieve carbon emission reduction and sustainability objectives, current market dynamics are characterized by limited production volumes and the cost-competitiveness of traditional fossil fuels [11].

Colombia faces a critical challenge: boosting SAF and renewable diesel production. This is essential to meet domestic biofuel demand, lessen reliance on imports, and strengthen the national economy. Developing SAF would contribute to strengthening the agriculture sector, create jobs, and support an economy centered on environmental services [64]. Colombia has a strong potential for SAF production, with an estimated production of at least 100 million gallons by 2035 and 450 million gallons by 2050 [64]. In the country, the palm oil sector has significant potential as a raw material supplier for SAF and RD production, due to its competitive advantages, namely: (i) a demonstrated commitment to sustainability, evidenced by the sector’s adoption of sustainable agricultural methodologies and dedication to forest conservation; (ii) a strategic geographic positioning within Latin America, facilitating regional SAF distribution; (iii) a low carbon footprint, with Colombian palm oil production exhibiting a significantly reduced carbon intensity (182 kg CO2eq t−1 CPO) compared to international counterparts (5 t CO2eq t−1 CPO); (iv) ample land resources suitable for oil palm cultivation; and (v) superior per-hectare productivity relative to alternative oilseed crops [20]. Furthermore, the sector’s adherence to a non-deforestation policy, corroborated by recent satellite monitoring data indicating 99% deforestation-free palm oil cultivation [36], is pivotal for biofuel sustainability certification, particularly concerning feedstock origin.

While the domestic utilization of SAF and renewable diesel offers potential for national economic enhancement, the export of SAF to European and United States markets represents a particularly significant strategic opportunity. In Europe, the incorporation of biofuel blends into conventional fossil fuels constitutes a central regulatory strategy for reducing GHG emissions and promoting renewable energy adoption. Specifically, Directive (EU) 2018/2001 mandates that Member States ensure a minimum 14% share of renewable energy across all transport modalities by 2030 [55].

In the United States, a memorandum of understanding among federal agencies, including the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Department of Agriculture (USDA), has been established to formulate a holistic strategy. This strategy aims at cost reduction, sustainability enhancement, and the expansion of SAF production and deployment. This framework sets targets, including a minimum 50% reduction in life-cycle GHG emissions compared to conventional fuels, a domestic SAF production goal of 3 billion gallons per annum by 2030, and 35 billion gallons to satisfy 100% domestic demand by 2050 [50]. Consequently, a projected increase in global SAF demand is anticipated. Furthermore, CORSIA, implemented by IATA to promote SAF utilization in global aviation operations, plays a crucial role in incentivizing the production and adoption of these biofuels for GHG emission reduction within the aviation sector [9].

4. Discussion

The results of this study demonstrate the sustainability of the national crude palm oil (CPO) production chain. To further improve the CPO’s carbon footprint, it is essential to implement low-carbon practices tailored to each crop and each POM around the country. However, a holistic approach to decarbonizing SAF production transcends mere feedstock considerations; it demands integrating strategies based on the circular bioeconomy models across the entire lifecycle value chain.

For instance, in the HEFA process, natural gas and hydrogen utilization represent significant sources of GHG emissions. A potential mitigation strategy involves the robust integration of biorefinery systems within the palm oil sector. This could entail replacing natural gas with biogas obtained directly from POME treatment systems. Moreover, green hydrogen could be produced using surplus energy or biomass generated during CPO extraction. These strategies would not only enhance the GHG emissions performance of SAF produced from Colombian palm oil but would also reinforce the sustainability of the palm oil sector within the framework of the global energy transition.

To enable the advancement of SAF within Colombia and secure its access to international markets, the adoption of rigorous sustainability certification standards across the CPO supply chain is indispensable. Regulatory frameworks such as CORSIA and RED II, and increasingly RED III, serve as crucial instruments for validating economic, social, and environmental sustainability, thereby substantiating the legitimacy of raw material sourcing. Nevertheless, the commercial viability of biofuels derived from vegetable oils or biomass necessitate enhanced public engagement, technological innovation, strategic policy interventions, and infrastructural development to bolster production capacities effectively.

Beyond sustainability and policy considerations, the identification and evaluation of technologies for transforming raw materials into SAF are crucial for achieving demonstrable GHG emission reductions, as evidenced by carbon savings relative to reference fossil fuels [65]. The demonstrated sustainability in the Colombian CPO production chain, supported by certification mechanisms and the availability of suitable land (over 3 million hectares) for palm cultivation [66], strategically positions the country for developing a biofuel production strategy.

Water use is a key element for the sustainability of the palm oil sector. In Colombia, with its diverse climate and topography and facing an increase in intense drought and rainfall due to climate change, the palm oil sector has adopted and innovated efficient irrigation systems [20]. These systems are designed to adapt to the particular conditions of different palm-growing regions, aiming to mitigate adverse effects on crops. The sector, in collaboration with Cenipalma, supports key projects like the Palm Water Security Project and the Strategy for Sector Involvement in Watershed Management to improve water governance [20]. This management is based on Colombia’s hierarchical hydrographic structure, which facilitates coordinated planning for water conservation.

The Colombian palm oil sector’s sustainability strategy is built upon three key pillars. First, the “Sustainable Origin Colombia” pillar highlights the country’s unique attributes, with 32% of its crude palm oil production and cultivated area already certified under sustainability standards, including its own APSColombia certification. Second, the Environmental Performance pillar underscores a strong commitment to zero deforestation, confirmed by real-time satellite monitoring showing 99% of crops are deforestation-free. The sector is also implementing low-carbon practices, such as leveraging biomass for composting and biogas capture, which presents significant potential for advanced biofuel markets. Finally, the Social Performance pillar focuses on community development, evidenced by an 86% formal employment rate, fair wages, and a gender equity policy that has increased direct female employment by 17.5% [20,30].

This unique standing allows Colombia to distinguish itself from other prominent producers such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Furthermore, Colombia benefits from a strong national network of universities and specialized research centers that actively foster the generation of innovative solutions and facilitate the crucial technical-economic feasibility assessment of advanced biofuel production.

5. Conclusions

This research comprehensively evaluated Colombia’s crude palm oil (CPO)-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production chain. Our analysis focused on a detailed carbon footprint assessment, a review of renewable fuel regulations concerning carbon intensity, economic aspects and an exploration of market access opportunities for low-CO2 emission raw materials.

Carbon footprint assessment

Extending the carbon footprint analysis to fuel production, SAF processed via the HEFA pathway from Colombian CPO yielded a value of 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF, which includes direct LUC emissions. This value represents a substantial reduction compared to the fossil aviation fuel reference standard of 89.2 g CO2eq MJ−1. Furthermore, it demonstrates a lower carbon intensity than SAF produced from CPO in Malaysia and Indonesia (37.4 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF with biogas capture and 60.0 g CO2eq MJ−1 SAF without biogas capture). A sensitivity analysis underscored the critical drivers of this low carbon intensity. While the baseline SAF carbon footprint is 16.11 g CO2eq MJ−1, reflecting current DLUC emissions and existing methane capture practices, comprehensive methane capture across all surveyed mills could reduce the values to negative −4.58 g CO2eq MJ−1.

Conversely, excluding DLUC emissions from the assessment significantly increased the carbon footprint to 474.6 g CO2eq MJ−1, thereby highlighting Colombia’s favorable DLUC profile as a major factor in its remarkably low overall CPO carbon footprint. This analysis confirms that both effective direct LUC management and robust methane capture are paramount for achieving exceptionally low carbon intensities in Colombian CPO-derived SAF, a practice critical for reducing the environmental impact of sustainable fuel production as outlined by the CORSIA methodology.

Market opportunities and strategic leadership

The presented research demonstrates that Colombia has a significant and promising role to play in the global market for SAF. By leveraging its abundant agricultural resources, particularly oil palm, and its commitment to robust sustainability certification schemes like ISCC and RSB, the country is well-positioned to become a key player in the decarbonization of the aviation industry. The successful certifications of Colombian companies, such as Gremca S.A. and Alianza del Humea S.A.S., under both CORSIA and the new ISCC-EUDR deforestation-free standard, underscore the viability of a sustainable and traceable supply chain. Colombia’s proactive approach to sustainability and its demonstrated capacity to meet stringent international standards position it as a vital contributor to a cleaner energy transition in aviation.

Currently, as an initial option, the conversion of an existing refinery is the most financially viable short-term option for producing SAF from palm oil in Colombia, with a 35.7% IRR and a 3-year investment payback period. This model outperforms building a new plant, which highlights the importance of capital efficiency and market volatility management. However, to fully realize this potential, a broader strategic vision is needed. Future research should explore a number of critical areas to strengthen the understanding of SAF production in Colombia. This could include economic optimization studies, expansion of feedstock analysis, and assessment of alternative technologies.

Challenges and outlook

The overarching challenge for Colombia now lies in scaling up SAF and renewable diesel production to meet domestic biofuel demand, reduce import dependence, and strengthen the national economy. However, it is vital to recognize that achieving economic viability for biofuels derived from vegetable oils and biomass requires broader public adoption, continuous innovation, supportive policy incentives, and substantial infrastructure development to augment production capacity.

Abstract

The deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) is central to decarbonizing aviation. However, diverse regulatory frameworks create complexity for SAF market deployment. Differing greenhouse gas (GHG)-reduction thresholds, feedstock eligibility rules and certification systems increase the compliance burden, especially for those operating across regional and international markets. This paper compares an example of regional approach (European) with the international ICAO sustainability certification. The comparison focuses on chain-of-custody models, substantiality principles, GHG accounting methodologies and approaches to ILUC. It highlights the need for harmonized GHG calculation rules, mutual recognition of certification schemes and interoperable traceability systems. Aligning these elements is critical for reducing administrative barriers, supporting market integration and enabling scalable SAF deployment. The analysis aims to assist policymakers, certifiers and producers in developing coordinated and transparent regulatory strategies.

1. Introduction

The decarbonization of the aviation sector is becoming a central priority for the industry [1] and many regions, such the European Union, the UK [2], India and Brasil [3], among others [4], are setting specific sector strategies to meet climate neutrality targets by 2050 [5]. At the European level, the EU Green Deal, together with sector-specific legislation such as the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation [6] and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), aims to operationalize the deployment of SAFs within the broader context of energy and transport decarbonization.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are considered one of the key enablers of this transition, as they offer a significant reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional jet fuels (Jet A1) [7]. Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are non-conventional aviation fuels derived from non-fossil sources. While the term SAF is widely used, other designations such as sustainable alternative fuel, renewable jet fuel or bio jet fuel are often used interchangeably.

SAFs are produced from a variety of renewable resources [8], including waste oils, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste and even renewable electricity combined with captured CO2, depending on the production pathway (Figure 1). SAFs are considered ”drop-in” fuels, meaning they can be blended with fossil Jet A or Jet A-1 and used without modifications to existing aircraft engines or fuelling infrastructure. The environmental benefit of SAF arises primarily from its potential to reduce net CO2 emissions, depending on the feedstock and production process, as well as its ability to displace fossil fuels [9].

To be used in commercial aviation, an SAF must pass rigorous technical, safety and performance evaluations. This process is governed by ASTM International [10], particularly through the ASTM D4054 and ASTM D7566 standards. ASTM D4054 outlines the protocol for evaluating and certifying new jet fuel formulations, including laboratory tests, rig tests, engine tests and fleet evaluation. If a candidate fuel meets all necessary performance criteria, it is then considered for inclusion under ASTM D7566, the specification for aviation turbine fuels containing synthesized hydrocarbons. Once listed in ASTM D7566, the SAF is recognized as safe for use when blended with fossil jet fuel up to a certified limit—typically 50%, although this may vary depending on the specific pathway. Certified fuels under ASTM D7566 are deemed equivalent to Jet A or Jet A-1 and are thus fully fungible with existing fuel supply chains. This harmonized certification framework is critical not only for ensuring the safety and reliability of aviation operations but also for enabling the commercialization of SAF technologies by allowing them to integrate seamlessly into global fuel-distribution systems.

Currently approved conversion pathways for SAF are defined by three key elements:

the specific conversion process;

the applicable ASTM annex or equivalent standard;

a technical description of the pathway and its associated feedstocks or synthesis routes.

The first category includes Fischer–Tropsch (FT) pathways, such as Gasification FT and CO2 FT. These thermochemical processes convert carbon-rich materials—like biomass, coal or captured CO2—into syngas, which is subsequently processed into synthetic paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK). Certified under Annex A1 of ASTM D7566, these fuels are approved for blending up to 50% with conventional Jet-A due to their excellent performance characteristics.

The Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway, covered by Annex A2, is the most commercially established SAF technology. It uses renewable lipids (e.g., vegetable oils, used cooking oil, and animal fats), converting them to SPK via hydrogenation and deoxygenation [11]. HEFA-SPK currently represents the dominant share of SAF production globally.

The Synthesized Iso-Paraffins (SIP) pathway, certified under Annex A3, involves hydroprocessing of fermented sugars. Although technically viable, SIP-SPK is limited to a 10% blend ratio due to its lack of aromatic hydrocarbons, which are essential for compatibility with older aircraft fuel systems.

FT-SKA, listed in Annex A4, is a variant of the FT process that includes the production of synthetic aromatics via alkylation. This enables the fuel to meet aromatic content currently required by Jet A1 specifications [12].

Annex A5 includes multiple Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ-SPK) fuels, produced from alcohols such as ethanol, isobutanol or isobutene through dehydration, oligomerization and hydroprocessing. The ATJ platform offers feedstock flexibility but faces limitations due to the complexity of upgrading and the cost of bio-alcohol production.

Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet (CHJ), certified under Annex A6, employs hydrothermal liquefaction to convert wet biomass or oils into an intermediate oil, which is then upgraded catalytically to jet fuel. This method enables the use of high-moisture feedstocks with minimal preprocessing.

The HC-HEFA-SPK route (Annex A7) expands the traditional HEFA platform by using hydrocarbon-based esters and fatty acids, while ATJ-SKA (Annex A8) integrates alcohol synthesis with aromatic production to meet full-specification jet fuel requirements, addressing the aromatic deficiency of standard ATJ-SPK.

In addition to these standalone pathways, ASTM D1655 permits the co-processing of renewable feedstocks—such as esters, FT intermediates or HEFA precursors—within conventional petroleum refineries [13]. These co-processing options offer a cost-effective and scalable interim solution by leveraging existing refinery assets [14]. However, they require rigorous traceability to ensure that the biogenic portion is properly quantified and recognized in sustainability programs such as CORSIA.

Apart from the quality aspects, to be classified as sustainable, aviation fuels must meet a set of established criteria, including significant life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and the exclusion of feedstocks sourced from land with high carbon stock or biodiversity value. The sustainability of SAFs is strongly influenced by the feedstock utilized for their production, as reported by [15] in a recent review, the large-scale biomass cultivation may lead to indirect land-use change, increased water demand and potential negative impacts on biodiversity. Crucial is the proper design of the whole SAF supply chain; Mohammadi et al. [16] highlighted that integrating decentralized processing with optimized logistics creates a resilient, low-emission biomass supply chain that balances economic efficiency with environmental sustainability. The need to carefully consider the SAF supply chain has also been stressed by Liang et al. [17]: the review highlights that SAF production depends on coordinated management of feedstock sourcing, conversion technology, transportation logistics and airport demand to balance cost, emissions and reliability. The study of Liang et al. concluded that integrating advanced modeling, decentralized processing and supportive policies are essential elements for SAF to become a sustainably scalable alternative to fossil jet fuel.

To address this complexity, sustainability frameworks for alternative fuels have been developed over recent decades for road applications and subsequently extended to other transport modes. In the USA, the biofuel certification framework relies on voluntary, third-party verification systems to ensure that biofuels meet high standards of quality, environmental protection and social responsibility. Programs like BQ-9000, which accredits biodiesel producers and marketers based on ASTM D6751 standards, emphasize rigorous quality control across storage, blending and distribution. Meanwhile, international schemes such as the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) can be used to verify sustainability, traceability and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions across complex supply chains. Independent audits and adherence to detailed benchmarks provide transparency, signal responsible production to consumers and foster a market that rewards sustainable biofuels, thereby strengthening the growth of a low-carbon energy sector.

In Brazil, the RenovaBio policy serves as the primary framework for biofuel certification, aimed at promoting renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [18]. Managed by the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP), the program certifies production units through an efficiency assessment conducted by accredited firms using the RenovaCalc tool. Certified producers receive a Certificate of Efficient Production of Biofuels, which enables them to issue decarbonization credits (CBIOs). These credits are traded on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange, creating a market mechanism that compels fossil fuel distributors to meet national emission-reduction targets. By assigning energy-environmental efficiency ratings and facilitating a financial market for low-carbon fuels, RenovaBio supports the decarbonization of Brazil’s energy matrix while aligning domestic production with international sustainability standards, such as Bonsucro.

Another relevant example of regional setup is Japan. The country mandates sustainability certification for biomass fuels within its Feed-in Tariff (FIT) system to guarantee that renewable electricity generation is based on environmentally and socially responsible practices. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) recognizes certification schemes such as the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) Japan FIT and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) Japan FIT, which verify compliance with criteria including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity protection and prevention of deforestation. These schemes require producers and traders to meet sustainability standards, maintain a chain of custody that ensures traceability from origin to power generation and undergo independent verification. Once certified, biomass fuels become eligible for FIT incentives, such as subsidies, thereby enabling producers to access Japan’s renewable energy support system while promoting responsible production and sustainable market practices.

As a relevant example of the regional level allowing to investigate the details of these complex processes, the European Union approach, as described in the Renewable Energy Directive and its recasts [19], has paved the way. As of today, sustainability frameworks are implemented through Sustainability Certification Schemes (SCSs), both at the European as well as at the international scale.

A robust sustainability certification system is essential to ensure that SAFs deliver genuine climate benefits, avoid unintended environmental and social impacts and are accounted for consistently across regulatory frameworks [20]. In the European context, sustainability certification is governed by the RED and its associated delegated acts [21,22], which establish strict criteria for GHG savings, feedstock eligibility and traceability. Parallel to this, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has developed the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which includes a global sustainability framework for SAF eligibility and offsetting purposes [23].

Although both frameworks share a commitment to sustainability, they differ in scope, criteria and implementation. These divergences have practical implications for SAF producers operating in both EU and international markets, especially in terms of compliance pathways, certification strategies and investment decisions.

This paper provides a comparative analysis of a regional approach (i.e., European) and ICAO sustainability certification systems applicable to SAFs, with a particular focus on certification schemes, chain of custody models and greenhouse gas accounting methodologies. The goal of this work is to support SAF producers and policymakers in navigating this complex regulatory landscape and to identify areas for potential harmonization or alignment.

2. Chain of Custody and Traceability

A critical component of sustainability certification systems is the ability to trace the origin and characteristics of sustainable fuels throughout the supply chain. This is accomplished through Chain of Custody (CoC) models, which define how sustainability information is transmitted along the production and distribution process (Figure 2).

Three main CoC models are used across schemes: Identity Preservation (IP), Segregation (SG) and Mass Balance (MB).

2.1. Identity Preservation (IP)

Identity Preservation is the most stringent CoC model. It ensures that certified products remain entirely segregated from non-certified materials throughout the entire supply chain. Each batch is uniquely traceable back to a specific production site and feedstock lot. While this model guarantees the highest level of traceability and consumer confidence, it is operationally complex and rarely used in fuel supply chains due to cost and logistical constraints.

2.2. Segregation (SG)

Segregation allows certified materials to be pooled with other certified materials, but only if they are certified to the same standard. No mixing with non-certified materials is permitted. This approach ensures that certified output can be confidently attributed to sustainable input, while offering greater flexibility. Documentation under SG must ensure traceability of batches and compliance with certification thresholds.

2.3. Mass Balance (MB)

The Mass Balance approach is the most widely used CoC model in SAF certification. It allows certified and non-certified materials to be physically mixed at any stage in the supply chain, provided that:

the quantities of certified inputs and outputs are reconciled over a defined time period (e.g., monthly or quarterly);

the sustainability characteristics (e.g., GHG emissions savings, feedstock type) are tracked and recorded administratively;

certified output does not exceed the volume or energy content of certified input.

Mass Balance offers a pragmatic solution that supports scalability while maintaining environmental integrity. It is explicitly recognized under Article 30 of RED III [19] and is accepted in the CORSIA framework. Some certification schemes allow for additional constraints (e.g., geographic scope or processing step-level tracking) to enhance assurance.

2.4. Book and Claim

The “Book and Claim” system is a chain of custody model designed to enable the decoupling of physical product delivery from sustainability claims, offering flexibility in how sustainable products, such as SAF, are marketed and consumed. In this system, SAF producers generate certificates (or “claims”) for the sustainability attributes of a given volume of SAF, which are then sold separately from the physical fuel. The actual SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel and enters the general supply chain without being directly allocated to any specific buyer. Instead, airlines or other end users purchase these certificates to claim the environmental benefits of SAF usage, even if the physical fuel is not used in their own operations.

According to various sources (e.g., [24]), this approach enables greater scalability and market access for SAF, especially in cases where logistical or infrastructure constraints prevent physical delivery to certain locations. It also supports early investment and demand signals for SAF production, by allowing buyers in hard-to-reach regions or with lower volumes to contribute to the decarbonization of aviation. Importantly, the environmental integrity of the Book and Claim system relies on robust traceability mechanisms, independent third-party verification and registries that prevent double-counting and ensure transparency in the transaction of sustainability attributes.

When a “Book and Claim” model aligns with international principles for credible chain of custody systems, it can be considered as a complementary mechanism to physical chain of custody models (such as Mass Balance or segregation). As a relevant example, Brazil embraces the Book and Claim accounting system, enabling fuel decarbonization through verified emissions credits even if the physical SAF is not consumed at the point of sale [25].

While CORSIA does not specifically touch on the Book and Claim issue, ICAO considers the adoption of such approaches, noting that chain-of-custody tools like Book and Claim or Mass Balance systems can unlock efficiency and broader uptake by enabling sustainability claims to travel independently of fuel flows [26]. Likewise, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) has already registered its first Book and Claim Unit (BCU) for co-processed SAFs [27].

At the EU level, Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation) obliges the European Commission to evaluate whether additional measures should complement the weighted average approach used by aviation fuel suppliers when providing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at EU airports. Among the options under consideration is a tradability system, such as a “Book and Claim” mechanism, for aircraft operators and/or fuel suppliers, designed to facilitate SAF supply and uptake. As of today, a final decision about the implementation of such measures has not yet been made public.

2.5. Relevance for SAF Certification

Under ReFuelEU Aviation, all SAF volumes counted toward compliance targets must be certified using traceable CoC systems. Most SAFs in the EU market today are certified using Mass Balance, reflecting the need to integrate SAFs into existing infrastructure and blend them with fossil jet fuel (Jet A-1) before distribution [6].

While ICAO allows SAF producers to use any CoC model approved by the certification scheme, it places significant emphasis on documentation, volume reconciliation and the integrity of sustainability claims. Potential needs for dual compliance with both EU and CORSIA systems often requires producers to ensure that their CoC model can satisfy the more stringent of the two frameworks.

As the SAF market matures, there is increasing interest in harmonizing CoC requirements to facilitate trade, reduce audit burden and ensure interoperability between voluntary schemes. Until then, careful design of CoC systems remains a strategic priority for producers and auditors alike.

3. Sustainability-Certification Frameworks

3.1. The EU Sustainability Framework

The European Union’s regulatory approach to sustainability certification of alternative fuels is governed by the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), currently in its third revision (RED III) [19]. RED III establishes mandatory sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) criteria for biofuels, bioliquids, biomass fuels, renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) and recycled carbon fuels (RCFs). Fulfilment of these criteria is essential for eligibility toward renewable energy targets and access to market incentives.

To operationalize certification, the EU recognizes a series of voluntary Sustainability Certification Schemes (SCSs), such as ISCC EU and RSB EU RED, under Article 30 of the Directive [28]. These schemes must demonstrate conformity with specific EU-recognized principles and verification protocols and they serve as third-party mechanisms to ensure compliance across the fuel-production chain. The schemes check that the fuel producer respects the sustainability criteria set under the EU context, in particular that:

the production of feedstock for these fuels does not take place on land with high biodiversity;

the land with a high amount of carbon has not been converted for such feedstock production;

the biofuel, bioliquid and biomass fuel production leads to sufficient greenhouse gas emissions savings.

To qualify as sustainable, an SAF must demonstrate at least a 70% GHG reduction compared to the fossil comparator baseline of 94 gCO2eq/MJ [21]. Compliance is assessed through harmonized life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies, as set out in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1185. Certification bodies verify this reduction through detailed data reporting, including input quantities, energy use, emissions factors and transport distances.

In the RED III, there is a clear differentiation of feedstock categories. Only advanced biofuels—derived from feedstocks listed in Annex IX Part A—along with RCFs and RFNBOs, qualify toward the aviation blending mandates specified in the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation [6]. Biofuels originating from food or feed crops are explicitly excluded from eligibility as part of the EU’s strategy to avoid indirect land-use change (ILUC) impacts.

The background of the ILUC concept is related to the possibility that biofuel production may trigger the need for additional land to cover the feed and food demand, indirectly pushing for a change in the current use of land with potential related CO2 emissions. To address the issue of ILUC in the Clean Energy for All Europeans package, the revised renewable energy directive introduces a risk-based approach: it sets limits on high ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels with a significant expansion in land with high carbon stock. These limits will affect the amount of the fuels that Member States can count towards their national targets when calculating the overall national share of renewables and the share of renewables in transport. The directive also introduces an exemption from these limits for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels certified as low ILUC risk. For the implementation of this approach, as required by the directive, the Commission adopted the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/807. It has to be highlighted that, conversely from other approaches (i.e., CORSIA), ILUC is not calculated under REDII.

Differently from biogenic feedstock-derived SAFs, Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) have different sustainability criteria to meet. RFNBOs (also referred to as Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels, e-fuels or synthetic fuels) are central to the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation [6], which mandates a progressive incorporation of SAFs, starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 70% by 2050. A specific sub-target for synthetic fuels (i.e., RFNBOs) sets minimum blend shares of 0.7% in 2030 and 1.2% in 2032. This underlines the EU’s commitment to promoting synthetic fuels that can reduce dependency on crop-based biofuels and scale SAF supply through electrification pathways.

The current EU framework, complemented by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1184, sets strict conditions for the electricity used in RFNBO production. This includes the core principles of:

Additionality —electricity must originate from newly built renewable energy installations, to avoid harmful renewable energy displacement effects;

Temporal correlation—electricity consumption and generation must align within the same month (until 2029) and on an hourly basis thereafter;

Geographical correlation—electricity must be produced within the same bidding zone as the RFNBO facility.

Multiple sourcing scenarios are recognized to determine when electricity qualifies as “fully renewable”:

Direct connection to a renewable installation with no grid draw;

Grid-based sourcing in zones exceeding 90% renewable electricity share;

Use of grid electricity with emission intensity < 18 gCO2eq/MJ, combined with Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), cancelled Guarantees of Origin (GoOs) and correlation requirements;

Electricity-mitigating redispatch of renewable capacity (with operator verification).

Importantly, storage installations cannot be counted as renewable generators. Although renewable electricity sources do not require certification themselves, the RFNBO producer must provide robust documentation demonstrating full compliance with these conditions during certification audits.

RFNBOs are also subject to a minimum 70% GHG savings threshold, calculated using harmonized life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies [21]. To meet this, producers must not only track the energy source, but also account for transport emissions, and process energy use and carbon inputs.

Regarding carbon sources, the CO2 used for RFNBO synthesis can originate from:

Industrial waste streams, if subject to carbon pricing (e.g., EU ETS);

Biogenic sources, such as emissions from biofuel fermentation;

Atmospheric capture or geological sources, including geothermal CO2.

Fossil-based CO2 may be used only until 2035 and must not be intentionally generated for the sole purpose of fuel production. Fuels derived from intentionally generated fossil CO2 are not classified as RFNBOs.

Closely related to RFNBOs are Recycled Carbon Fuels (RCFs), also regulated under the same Delegated Acts. While RCFs originate from non-renewable waste streams and do not contribute to the EU-wide renewable energy share, they may count toward national transport targets if they achieve >70% GHG savings and are derived from unavoidable industrial by-products. To qualify, these waste gases must not be intentionally diverted for fuel production.

Together, RFNBOs and RCFs constitute the synthetic fuel categories positioned to complement bio-based SAFs in achieving the EU’s aviation decarbonization and climate neutrality goals.

Beyond environmental performance, RED III also enforces social and traceability criteria (e.g., [29]). Economic operators must demonstrate:

Legal land use and no conversion of high-carbon or high-biodiversity areas.

Respect for human rights and labor standards.

Compliance with applicable laws in feedstock origin regions.

Transparent documentation from point of origin to final fuel production.

Traceability is implemented through mandatory chain of custody systems, among these, Mass Balance is the predominant model used in fuel certification due to its practicality. RED III mandates that the Mass Balance system be robust, documented and subject to third-party audits, which include on-site inspections, record verification and risk-based sampling [29].

Certification bodies approved under voluntary schemes must follow detailed auditing protocols, ensure auditor competence and apply sanctions for non-compliance. Audits cover not only conversion facilities but also upstream operators including farms, collection points, warehouses and transport operators.

The EU’s multi-level certification architecture is designed to ensure credibility, transparency and environmental integrity and is continuously updated to reflect evolving sustainability science and geopolitical priorities. For SAF producers, understanding and implementing RED III-compliant systems is a prerequisite for participation in the EU renewable fuels market.

To facilitate harmonized implementation, the European Commission maintains a registry of recognized certification schemes, which must be renewed every five years [30]. These schemes must demonstrate transparency, reliability, auditor competence and full traceability of certified volumes.

3.2. The ICAO CORSIA Framework

At the international level, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is the primary instrument guiding sustainability criteria for aviation fuels [23].

The framework defines three main categories of fuels:

CORSIA Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs)—renewable or waste-derived fuels meeting the full set of sustainability criteria.

CORSIA Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAFs)—fossil-derived fuels that meet GHG criteria and some sustainability safeguards.

CORSIA Eligible Fuels (CEFs)—the umbrella term encompassing both SAFs and LCAFs.

CORSIA establishes sustainability criteria that alternative fuels must meet to be recognized as CORSIA Eligible Fuels (CEFs). These criteria include both environmental and social safeguards. In particular, for a fuel to qualify as a CORSIA Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), it must achieve at least 10% GHG emissions savings compared to the baseline fossil jet fuel and must not be produced from biomass sourced from land with high carbon stock or high biodiversity [23].

While GHG thresholds under CORSIA are initially lower than those in the EU RED III, the framework is designed to be progressively strengthened. From 2027 onward, participation in CORSIA becomes mandatory for most ICAO Member States and the sustainability criteria include additional social and environmental dimensions, such as labor rights, water use and biodiversity [23].

A distinguishing feature of the CORSIA sustainability framework is its explicit inclusion of indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions in life cycle assessment (LCA) calculations. ILUC refers to the displacement of existing land use—typically food or feed production—caused by the expansion of land dedicated to biofuel feedstock cultivation. ICAO provides predetermined ILUC emission factors for eligible fuel-production pathways, based on global economic modelling tools such as GTAP-BIO [31] and GLOBIOM [32].

In addition, CORSIA permits a zero ILUC factor for SAFs produced using low-ILUC-risk feedstocks or practices. These include:

Use of agricultural, industrial or municipal waste and residues.

Cultivation of energy crops on degraded, marginal or unused land.

Implementation of yield-increasing practices that avoid land expansion.

By integrating ILUC considerations into its fuel accounting, CORSIA aims to avoid unintended negative consequences of SAF expansion and ensure that life cycle GHG savings are robust and verifiable. However, growing concerns are expressed by stakeholders, with respect to this quantitavie approach to ILUC [33].

Beyond greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, the CORSIA sustainability-certification framework mandates compliance with a broader set of sustainability criteria. These criteria are verified during the certification of fuel producers and their supply chain operators, to ensure that Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are eligible.

CORSIA requires that SAF producers demonstrate adherence to social, environmental and economic safeguards, including but not limited to protection of biodiversity, soil and water resources, food security, land-use rights and respect for human and labor rights. These aspects align with the definitions and structure set forth by ISO 13065 “Sustainability criteria for bioenergy” [34], which CORSIA references to structure its sustainability framework.

Accordingly, sustainability is organized into three hierarchical components (Table 1):

Sustainability themes, which refer to broad areas of concern, such as water quality and availability.

Sustainability objectives, which specify the desired outcome within each theme, e.g., fuel production should maintain or enhance water quality and availability.

Sustainability indicators, which define measurable or observable criteria, such as the implementation of practices that ensure efficient water use and prevent the depletion of surface or groundwater resources beyond natural replenishment rates.

The ICAO’s CORSIA framework defines 14 sustainability themes that must be addressed for a fuel to be considered a CORSIA Eligible Fuel (CEF) (Figure 3). These themes are grouped into three main categories: carbon reduction, environmental and socio-economic. Each theme is supported by a specific principle ensuring that fuel production contributes to climate mitigation, environmental protection and social responsibility. These themes provide a comprehensive framework that ensures that CORSIA Eligible Fuels are not only effective in reducing aviation-related emissions but also contribute to broader goals of environmental protection and social equity.

Compliance with these sustainability elements is assessed through third-party audits carried out by CORSIA-approved Sustainability Certification Schemes (SCSs).

Certification under CORSIA is performed by schemes approved by ICAO, which assess fuel batches for compliance with sustainability, traceability and GHG performance criteria. These schemes must adhere to ICAO’s guidance on life cycle assessment (LCA), which specifies the use of a well-to-wake boundary for emissions accounting [35]. As of today, three schemes are approved: ISCC CORSIA [36], RSB [37] and ClassNK [38].

This structured and standards-based approach enables CORSIA to promote not only climate mitigation but also holistic sustainability in the global deployment of alternative aviation fuels.

3.3. Comparison of EU and ICAO Requirements

The European Union (EU) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through its CORSIA framework have both established systems to certify the sustainability of alternative aviation fuels. While they share the overarching goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from aviation by promoting sustainable fuels, their approaches differ in structure, scope, criteria and implementation mechanisms (Table 2). These differences have significant implications for fuel producers seeking recognition under both regimes.

3.3.1. Regulatory Scope and Legal Structure

The EU sustainability framework for fuels is anchored in binding legislation through the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), supported by delegated and implementing acts that specify methodological details and compliance requirements. This legislative architecture applies to all EU Member States and is deeply embedded within the broader EU climate and energy policy (e.g., ReFuelEU Aviation).

In contrast, CORSIA operates as an international market-based mechanism under the auspices of ICAO, agreed upon by its Member States. Its legal character is less binding and relies on voluntary commitments transitioning to mandatory participation over time (phased implementation through 2027–2035). CORSIA defines eligibility rules for fuels used to offset international aviation emissions but does not directly regulate blending obligations or national targets.

3.3.2. GHG Accounting and Emissions Thresholds

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) accounting is a crucial step in assessing the sustainability of SAF production. A recently published global bibliometric analysis by Li et al. [39] on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) highlighted how the field has become a key framework for greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting and climate policy. The authors show that LCA research has grown almost exponentially since 2000, with strong focus on quantifying carbon footprints, global warming potential and other GHG metrics as core indicators of environmental performance. Keyword trend analysis reveals an increasing emphasis on carbon footprint, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change as central themes, reflecting a shift from purely methodological debates to application-driven studies that inform low-carbon strategies across sectors. Specifically about SAF, the study by Zhang et al. [40] expands the discussion of life cycle assessment (LCA) and GHG accounting by applying these methods specifically to bioenergy and aviation fuel pathways. It emphasizes that accurate greenhouse gas inventories require cradle-to-grave system boundaries, inclusion of upstream land-use change emissions and careful allocation of co-products to avoid underestimating climate impacts. The study shows how feedstock variability, transport distances and conversion efficiencies drive most of the carbon footprint and compares alternative supply chain configurations to reveal opportunities for lowering emissions through optimized logistics and renewable energy inputs. It also highlights that harmonized datasets and transparent uncertainty treatment are critical for ensuring comparability of SAF GHG results across regions and technologies, reinforcing earlier bibliometric findings that data quality and methodological consistency remain key barriers to reliable, policy-relevant LCA.

This studies highlight the need for a harmonized accounting methodology and clear thresholds for defining sustainability elements. As anticipated, both EU and ICAO frameworks defined specific GHG accounting methodologies; RED III mandates a minimum of 70% GHG savings compared to a fossil fuel comparator of 94 gCO2eq/MJ for all fuels eligible under the aviation blending mandate. The GHG performance is calculated using harmonized life cycle assessment (LCA) rules laid out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1185. These rules specify inputs, emissions factors, transport stages and co-processing methods in a consistent format applicable across Member States.

CORSIA, by contrast, requires a lower threshold: a minimum of 10% GHG savings compared to conventional jet fuel (89 gCO2eq/MJ) but it includes ILUC. The GHG calculations under CORSIA follow a “well-to-wake” boundary and rely on default or actual values, based on ICAO-approved methodologies [35].

3.3.3. Feedstock Eligibility and Fuel Classification

Under RED III, only fuels produced from specific feedstock categories are eligible for compliance, particularly advanced biofuels (Annex IX Part A). Conventional biofuels from food or feed crops are excluded from aviation targets. RFNBOs must meet strict conditions related to electricity sourcing (e.g., additionality, temporal/geographical correlation), while RCFs must be derived from unavoidable industrial waste streams.

CORSIA adopts a broader definition of eligible fuels. It allows the use of a wider range of feedstocks, provided they meet sustainability criteria related to land use, carbon stock and social safeguards. The following are CORSIA Eligible Fuels (CEFs): SAFs and Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAFs), each with specific sustainability elements.

A practical example of illustrating the implication of the differences among the international and regional approaches is the use of food crops. Produced on extensive areas and with high agricultural mechanization, in many regions, these feedstocks fully aligned with the HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) conversion pathway and they are compatible with coprocessing in existing refineries. Certified under ASTM D7566 and supported by traceability frameworks, vegetable oils offer a robust, scalable short-term feedstock for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). However, while these are fully compatible with the ICAO scheme, they cannot be used to produce SAF for the EU market.

3.3.4. Treatment of Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC)

One of the most notable differences lies in how the two systems address indirect land-use change (ILUC). CORSIA explicitly incorporates ILUC into its LCA framework using model-based default values from GTAP-BIO and GLOBIOM. It also recognizes “low-ILUC-risk” practices that qualify for a zero ILUC factor, such as use of waste/residues or production on degraded land.

By contrast, ILUC is not quantified in RED III’s GHG calculations. Instead, the EU uses a risk-based regulatory approach. High-ILUC-risk fuels (e.g., derived from palm) are not allowed against aviation targets, while low-ILUC-risk biofuels, demonstrated through improved agricultural practices, are exempt from these restrictions.

In the EU context, there are specific provisions to exclude high-risk feedstock, such as palm oil. While this is not the case in CORSIA, it is worth noticing that the default ILCU value implies the potential risk of this feedstock, resulting in a fairly high value: 39.1 gCO2e/MJfuel.

This distinction underscores a philosophical divergence: CORSIA quantifies ILUC, whereas the EU controls it via supply-side restrictions and delegated regulation (e.g., EU 2019/807). It is worth noticing that the International Maritime Organization (IMO) decided to adopt, for its marine fuels LCA guidelines [41], a risk-based approach.

3.3.5. Sustainability Criteria and Social Safeguards

Both systems go beyond GHG performance to include social and environmental sustainability. RED III requires compliance with a wide range of sustainability principles, including protection of high-carbon-stock lands, legal land use, respect for human rights and traceability throughout the supply chain.

CORSIA similarly mandates sustainability safeguards, grouping them into broad themes such as water, land, labor and social development. These themes are operationalized through objectives and measurable indicators. These requirements must be verified through approved Sustainability Certification Schemes (SCSs), which independently assess compliance. For example, in relation to human and labor rights, CORSIA requires that all production respects workers’ rights and ensures fair treatment. Under the theme of land-use rights, producers must respect both formal and informal land tenure, including indigenous and customary rights. Similarly, water-use rights must be safeguarded, with certification confirming that local and indigenous communities’ prior or customary access to water is upheld. Beyond resource rights, CORSIA integrates broader social objectives: production activities should support local and social development by improving socio-economic conditions in regions affected by poverty, while also safeguarding food security by ensuring that biofuel production in food-insecure areas does not undermine, and ideally enhances, local food availability. Together, these safeguards covering human, environmental and social dimensions establish a comprehensive sustainability framework, ensuring that aviation fuels under CORSIA contribute to emissions reductions without causing unintended negative impacts.

3.4. Data-Reporting Systems

The European Union has established the Union Database (UDB) [42], a centralized digital platform designed to monitor the life cycle and sustainability of biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs). The UDB records transactions across the supply chain to prevent double counting, supports the implementation of Mass Balance chain of custody systems and enables verification of compliance with the sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction requirements under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). All certified parties, including economic operators, voluntary schemes and certification bodies, are mandated to submit data, thereby ensuring traceability across national borders and throughout the supply chain.

In parallel, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has developed the CORSIA Central Registry [43], which is used to track emissions, offsetting obligations and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) usage by aircraft operators. The registry collects data through the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) process, as submitted by national authorities. This includes details on the volume and characteristics of CORSIA-eligible fuels used by airlines. However, unlike the EU UDB, the CORSIA Registry does not record transaction-level data across the supply chain. Its primary function is emissions accounting and monitoring SAF uptake, rather than ensuring supply chain traceability.

While the EU UDB offers granular, transaction-level data for both fuels and feedstocks to support robust traceability and sustainability verification, the CORSIA Registry focuses more on aggregated emissions data and SAF deployment by operators, with limited emphasis on supply chain-level reporting.

4. Policy Implications

The evolving landscape of sustainability certification for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) presents both regulatory challenges and market opportunities for producers operating regionally (e.g., European Union) and internationally [44].

One of the key challenges faced by SAF producers is navigating divergent sustainability criteria and certification requirements. The EU imposes stringent greenhouse gas (GHG)-reduction thresholds (≥70% for RFNBOs and RCFs) and feedstock restrictions (excluding food and feed crops) [19], whereas CORSIA has lower entry thresholds, ILUC calculation and a broader feedstock eligibility [23]. This dual system may require producers to pursue separate certification pathways, duplicating administrative efforts and increasing compliance costs. The interplay between regional and international initiatives creates a complex environment for operators.

Additionally, the differences in audit cycles, recognition procedures and accepted methodologies for GHG calculations increase the uncertainty and resource burden for SAF producers, particularly for small and emerging players who may lack the institutional capacity to manage multi-scheme compliance.

A move toward harmonization—such as mutual recognition of schemes, alignment of GHG calculation principles or interoperability of digital traceability systems—would reduce duplication and foster greater scalability of SAF deployment. Without convergence, regulatory fragmentation risks undermining the climate credibility, economic efficiency and global trade of sustainable aviation fuels.

4.1. Opportunities and Strategic Levers

Despite the regulatory fragmentation, SAF producers can capitalize on early compliance and dual certification as a market differentiator. Producers who align proactively with both RED III and CORSIA standards are better positioned to access public support mechanisms (e.g., mandates, subsidies, blending quotas, etc.) and to participate in carbon credit schemes and international fuel trade.

The progressive incorporation targets under ReFuelEU Aviation, starting from 2% in 2025 and reaching 70% in 2050, offer a long-term market signal that encourages investment in certified SAF-production capacity [6]. Meanwhile, the evolving stringency of CORSIA post-2027 may close the gap with RED III, enabling certification schemes to converge over time.

The deployment of harmonized digital traceability systems, also presents an opportunity to streamline compliance across jurisdictions, reduce audit costs and enhance transparency for end users and regulators alike.

4.2. Recommendations for Harmonization

To reduce regulatory friction and promote global SAF deployment, several harmonization measures should be considered:

Establish common baseline sustainability criteria for SAFs across regional and CORSIA frameworks, particularly for GHG reduction thresholds, land-use safeguards and social principles.

Promote mutual recognition of certification schemes that demonstrate equivalence in verification, auditing and traceability standards.

Align standardised methodologies for life cycle GHG emissions accounting, including default values and treatment of co-products, etc.

Support digital integration of chain-of-custody systems via interoperable registries and secure, auditable data infrastructure.

Facilitate capacity building for small producers to ensure inclusive access to certification and market participation.

By pursuing regulatory alignment and fostering technical interoperability, both the EU and ICAO can accelerate the deployment of SAFs in line with climate targets, while safeguarding environmental integrity and market transparency.

5. Conclusions

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) play a vital role in achieving decarbonization targets in the aviation sector, both within the European Union and at the global level. Ensuring that SAFs deliver verifiable environmental benefits requires robust and transparent sustainability-certification frameworks. This paper has reviewed and compared two relevant systems currently in place: the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), as an example of a regional scheme, and ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

As the SAF market is rapidly evolving, the sustainability certification is a foundational pillar for participating in and benefiting from this transformation. While both frameworks share the common objective and several important methodological approaches, from an SAF producer perspective there are significant operative differences, for instance in their stringency and implementation mechanisms. RED III imposes more rigorous greenhouse gas (GHG) thresholds and restricts feedstock eligibility, while CORSIA allows for broader inclusion with lower initial GHG requirements. These divergences pose challenges for SAF producers, especially those seeking access to both regulatory markets.

A central focus of this analysis has been the role of certification schemes and chain-of-custody models in ensuring compliance. Most SAF producers currently adopt Mass Balance due to its practicality and compatibility with blended fuel infrastructure, though future developments may drive increased use of more granular tracking systems. Book and Claim is currently under discussion, as it potentially facilitates logistics, allowing for a wider adoption of SAF.

Looking forward, greater harmonization between regional and ICAO frameworks is essential to streamline certification efforts, lower administrative barriers and foster cross-border SAF trade. Aligning GHG accounting methods, sustainability safeguards and digital traceability systems would not only benefit producers but also strengthen consumer confidence and policy coherence.

The policy and market momentum behind SAFs is accelerating. Aligning certification requirements and providing consistent regulatory signals will be instrumental in ensuring that SAF deployment meets both climate goals and sustainability standards, while enabling producers to operate competitively at a global scale.

The ten-year Cleaner Fuels Program will support onshore production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, which can replace fossil fuels in existing engines. The first large-scale output is expected by 2029.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion (US$2.6bn) in feedstocks such as canola and tallow that could be refined locally. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates a mature domestic industry could reach $36 billion (US$23.7bn) by 2050. It also projects that switching to cleaner fuels could avoid about 230 million tonnes of emissions by mid-century – equivalent to the annual output of 86 million cars.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the investment was not only about climate but also about reshaping the economy. “This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia,” he said. “From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.”

Climate and Energy Minister Chris Bowen argued that domestic production offered a pathway to reduce emissions in sectors where electrification remains difficult, such as aviation, shipping and heavy construction. Agriculture Minister Julie Collins said the move would provide new markets for farmers and strengthen regional economies, while Acting Infrastructure Minister Murray Watt pointed to the potential for job growth in transport and logistics.",https://www.mobilityplaza.org/media/cache/640/bundles/app/images/42613/68cd3bc046c49.png,N,,2025-09-19 11:57:43.774302

Regulatory Push: Government Mandates, Incentives and Net-Zero Targets

The aviation industry is under constant pressure, with regulators, investors, and passengers demanding stronger mandates to drive adoption beyond early adopters for a greener way to fly. Government and regulatory bodies are establishing region-specific frameworks to support SAF deployment, each tailored to local feedstock availability, energy policies, and decarbonization priorities.

Aviation Carbon Footprint Reduction: Four Emission Control Scenarios by 2040

Over the next 15 years, SAF will be the primary enabler of carbon footprint reduction in aviation, helping airlines meet near and mid-term net-zero milestones. Airlines are expected to steadily increase SAF utilization from today’s less than 1% of global jet fuel demand to double-digit blending levels by the late 2030s, driven by regulatory mandates in regions such as the EU, U.S., and parts of Asia.

Infrastructure and Supply Chain Hurdles: Saf Production is One Thing, While Distribution at Thousands of Airports Is Another.

Solving the infrastructure and distribution challenges as SAF needs to be produced at refineries, transported, and blended within existing supply chains requires new logistical capabilities and standardized quality control on a global scale. The SAF supply chain will prioritize the development of multimodal transportation networks, including pipelines, shipping routes, and road transportation, out of which pipelines & trucks will facilitate ~70% of SAF transportations globally, till 2040.

Saf Technology Breakthroughs: Multiple Pathways (Hefa, Achtj, Ft, Ptl) are Maturing.

A combination of technologies, operational measures, and market-based mechanisms is expected to shape the pathway to net-zero aviation by 2050. These will deliver the most significant contribution, accounting for 60-65% of total emissions reductions. Looking ahead, SAF through pathways like HEFA, Fischer-Tropsch, Alcohol-to-Jet, and Power-to-Liquid will significantly support aviation’s decarbonization, making it the key factor of sustainable air transport.

Global and Regional Addressable Market: North America Leads With ~40% Share In 2025, With Europe and Asia Catching Up.

According to MarketsandMarkets, the Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market size is estimated at USD 2.06 billion in 2025. It is projected to reach USD 25.62 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 65.5%. In terms of volume, the market is projected to grow from 0.30 billion gallons in 2025 to 3.68 billion gallons by 2030.

What’s Holding Saf Back And Expected Moves by 2030?

Availability of aviation biofuel feedstock: Waste oils, fats, residues, and algae are promising, but finite.

Industry partnership and deals: Long-term green aviation fuel production plans and airline deals are the key.

Reducing the SAF vs. Jet Fuel price gap: SAF is still 3–5x more expensive than fossil jet fuel.

In the end, SAF won’t solve the emissions problem of aviation alone. It represents one of the most critical pillars of aviation’s transition toward a net-zero future. It provides the sector with a viable, scalable, and immediate solution to decarbonization while maintaining the performance, reliability, and energy density required for global air transport. SAF, such as biojet fuel, alcohol-to-jet fuel, power-to-liquid jet fuel, will remain the most practical alternative aviation fuel lever for the next decades.

CGF, a wholly owned subsidiary of CATAGEN, will use patented modular reactor technology to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using off-grid renewable/low carbon electricity sources – meaning fuel can continue to be produced consistently, and is flexible and resilient to any fluctuations in grid connectivity.

Marking the launch of CGF, Catagen announced new strategic partnerships with Ryanair and Shell Aviation for offtake agreements of SAF production and use.

CGF production systems will be manufactured off-site and can be deployed close to renewable electricity assets or close to airports where fuel is needed and with minimal disruption to operations.

Steven Fitzgerald, Ryanair director of sustainability and finance, said: ""Progressing towards our sustainability goals depends on securing scalable and affordable SAF.

""CATAGEN’s decentralised SAF model allows production to be brought closer to demand, enabling faster deployment and reducing the bottlenecks that slow down traditional SAF projects.

""We see this as a critical pathway to reducing our emissions while continuing to deliver affordable travel.”

Ken McHutcheon, supply and operations manager at Shell Aviation Ireland, said: ""Shell Aviation is committed to scaling sustainable aviation fuel, but the industry needs both volume and speed.

""CATAGEN’s decentralised, modular approach provides a new way of producing SAF that can complement centralised facilities, shorten timelines, and provide more flexible access to fuel.

""This model has the potential to reduce reliance on imported SAF, increase energy independence, unlock new markets and accelerate the industry’s journey to net zero.”

Mel Courtney, chief executive at ClimaHtech Green Flight, added: ""The UK has a mandate to have 10% of flights using SAF by 2030, with the EU having a 70 per cent target by 2050.

""On current supply, these targets are ambitious, with the International Air Transport Association currently estimating demand surpassing 360 million tonnes by 2050, up from 1 million tonnes that were available in 2024.

“To reach these targets, we need technologies that can be scaled up alongside the development of surrounding infrastructures around airports. In the UK, challenges around energy security have been made clear, hence the push from government to increase our use of renewables in the grid.

""Our approach to SAF should match this approach and be accessible to the market where it is needed to be deployed.”

This project, launched in collaboration with Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), underscores the sector’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Aviation carriers, including Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, are spearheading the project with an initial commitment of $150 million, highlighting the crucial role these airlines play in pushing the boundaries of sustainable travel. SAF’s potential to significantly lower aviation emissions presents an opportunity for industry-wide sustainability advancements.

Efforts like the oneworld BEV Fund have surfaced previously, but this represents a pivotal moment because of the level of airline industry involvement. In past projects, investments in SAF often fell short of industry needs, limiting any considerable scaling benefits. However, with prominent airlines endorsing this venture, there’s a marked shift in how the industry is addressing these ecological challenges.

What Role Do Airlines Play in This Venture?

Airlines are central to the oneworld BEV Fund with multiple companies engaging as key investors. Aside from Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, airlines such as IAG, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines are also contributing. The focus is not solely on monetary assistance; it involves supporting technological advancements for SAF, aiming to make these fuels more accessible and cost-efficient. The initiative reflects a strategic alignment in the aviation industry toward greater ecological responsibility.

How Does SAF Contribute to Emission Reductions?

SAF is primarily made from sustainable resources like waste oils, aiming to drastically cut aviation’s greenhouse gas emissions. Producing SAF addresses the emission issue, though significant scalability challenges exist. High production costs and limited feedstock availability have historically hindered progress. With this new fund, there is hope that addressing these hurdles could lead to broader adoption and improve the ecological footprint of the aviation sector.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts doubling SAF production by 2025, yet it would make up only a small fraction of total airline fuel use. A persistent gap remains, highlighting the necessity for ventures like the oneworld BEV Fund to accelerate SAF’s market presence.

The strategic allocation of resources to solve SAF production issues represents a tactical step by oneworld and its partners. The fund aims to foster innovation, allowing for lifecycle analyses to ensure SAF’s environmental impact is minimized. Multi-year visions align with addressing these systemic challenges, focusing on long-term industry transformation.

An aviation rarity touched down in the Norway's second city of Bergen earlier this month.

Alia had flown 100 miles (160km) in 55 minutes on battery power alone.

Built by US aerospace company Beta Technologies, the electric plane is designed for cargo operations - carrying up to 560kg (half a tonne) loads.

The flight had simulated a planned cargo route between the coastal cities of Stavanger and Bergen, and for the next few months test-flights will be carried out, as part of the country's move towards establishing low-emission aviation.

At the helm was pilot Jeremy Degagne, ""If you do the drive, it's four and a half hours. And we did the flight in 52 minutes.""

""It is an important milestone for Norway as an international test arena,"" says Karianne Helland Strand, a director at Norwegian airport operator, Avinor.

The test-flights in Norway follow a whirlwind European tour, which kicked off in Ireland, and saw Alia debut at the Farnborough and Paris Air Shows, as well as making stops in Germany and Denmark.

Alia can fly up to 400km (250 miles) on a single charge, and refuel in less than 40 minutes by plugging-in, just like an electric car.

The same fixed-wing model can be configured for medical transport or passenger travel with up to five seats, and this June it undertook the first electric demonstration flight carrying passengers into New York's JFK airport.

Beta, which counts Amazon as an investor and UPS as a customer, hopes to get US certification for its plane this year.

""I'm convinced that the next major breakthrough in aerospace will come on the back of electric propulsion,"" says Beta's chief revenue officer Shawn Hall, who's a former fighter pilot.

""We're now able to significantly lower the operating cost and it's environmentally beneficial from a carbon perspective.""

Alia is one of the most advanced projects, among dozens of firms exploring electric propulsion in aviation.

It would be one way of reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint - which currently accounts for 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

However, the Pipistrel Velis Electro remains the only electric plane to receive full certification from European authorities, despite clearing that hurdle five years ago.

With a range of 185km and 50 minutes of flight time, the Slovenian-built Pipistrel is limited to training and not for shuttling passengers from A to B.

But successes like that have been overshadowed by a string of failures in electric aviation.

Even aviation giant Airbus has backed away from the market. In January it announced that development of its CityAirbus electric aircraft would be put on hold.

Range remains the major limitation to electric flight. Even the best lithium ion batteries are bulky and heavy, with much lower energy density than jet fuel.

They have ""not improved significantly"" over the past two decades, reckons Guy Gratton, an aviation expert and professor at Cranfield University.

For electric flight to take-off, a ""revolution"" in battery chemistry is needed, he says.

Given those limitations, some are looking at alternative technology.

Just as hybrid cars were a stepping stone towards electric vehicles; plane-makers are now also experimenting with hybrid technology.

Among the aviation start-ups trying to get electric passenger planes off the ground, is Heart Aerospace.

It recently shifted its entire operations from Sweden to the US, which its management said would help it focus ""resources"" and be closer to clients, including the airlines Mesa and United.

The firm has developed a 30-seater, prototype plane, the X1, which the BBC saw before it was shipped to the United States.

If all goes to plan during upcoming test-flights, it will become the largest battery-powered plane to fly. ""It has about two tons of batteries in it,"" explained chief technology officer Benjamin Stabler.

For its real-world operations, though, Heart is adopting a fundamentally different design: a hybrid plane, powered by batteries, but carrying fuel as backup.

""You don't need as [many] batteries,"" argues Mr Stabler, which makes it lighter and cheaper, and also allows for more paying passengers.

""For a normal route, it would fly all-electric from takeoff to landing,"" he explained.

""If you want to go a longer distance, or if there's a diversion, you can switch over to the turbines.""

The aircraft could travel 200km in electric-only flight. With the hybrid technology, which is scheduled for test-flights in 2026, it could fly 400km with 30 passengers, or up to 800km with 25, the firm claims.

""Public transport flying, quite rightly, requires a significant amount of energy reserve,"" says Prof Grattan.

""So hybridisation and the use of conventional fuels to carry safety reserves makes good sense,"" adds the professor, who has previously advocated this approach.

It's still not clear what the future of aviation will look like.

Greener fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) have attracted investment, along with hydrogen-based systems.

All will have to prove their commercial viability and safety, and much work needs to be done.

""This is a really challenging thing to do, electrifying aviation and removing the carbon,"" said Mr Stabler.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99c1/live/f825df80-8d7f-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 20:56:07.863309

The EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system that was launched in 2005.
The European Commission in 2023 amended the EU ETS Directive to help accelerate the use of SAF by granting free EU ETS allowances for use of the fuel.
Starting in 2024, 20 million EU ETS allowances, worth approximately €1.5 billion, are set aside to support SAF uptake.

The EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system that was launched in 2005. The system requires polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, helping bring overall emissions down while generating revenue to finance a transition to green energy. The program covers emissions from electricity and heat generation, industrial manufacturing, aviation and maritime transport.

The European Commission in 2023 amended the EU ETS Directive to help accelerate the use of SAF by granting free EU ETS allowances for use of the fuel. Starting in 2024, 20 million EU ETS allowances, worth approximately €1.5 billion, are set aside to support SAF uptake.

For 2024, the support amounts to approximately 1.3 million allowances, which are worth approximately €100 million, distributed between 53 operators.

According to the European Commission, the support system covers all or part of the price difference between fossil kerosene and the eligible SAF used by individual commercial aircraft operators on their flights covered by effective carbon pricing through the EU ETS. This support comes on top of the EU ETS incentive for using SAF, as operators are not required to surrender allowances for the use of these fuels – an advantage worth around €25 million in 2024. Taken together, the ETS incentive for use of SAF in 2024 amounts to around €125 million (€100 million from ETS allowances and €25 million from ETS zero rating of sustainable fuels). In addition, the EU ETS finances the Innovation Fund to support innovative clean tech projects, including in the aviation sector, to further reduce its climate impact.

The companies joined Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers MP, Federal Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen MP, Kara Cook MP, Member for Bonner and representatives from the Australian Workers Union, Bioenergy Australia and the National Farmers’ Federation at Ampol’s Lytton Refinery in Queensland for the Sept. 17 announcement.

The new program aims to stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of lower-carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, according to the Australian government. Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks such as canola, sorghum, sugar and waste.

“Today, around 70% of Australia’s canola is exported unprocessed, with much of it used overseas for renewable fuel production,” said Jesse Scott, head of Agri-Energy for GrainCorp. “We want to bring that value-add home and turn our canola into renewable fuels, to ensure there’s a future made in Australia.

“This project is about using Australia’s strengths in agriculture to fuel a new energy industry – one that helps to cut emissions while driving investment in the regions. As the energy transition gains pace, GrainCorp is proud to be part of this momentum and to help position Australian agriculture as a key player in the solution.”

A global agribusiness, GrainCorp operates the largest grain storage and handling network on the east coast of Australia, operating more than 150 regional receival sites and 20 million tonnes of storage capacity. GrainCorp also operates seven bulk port terminals with up to 15 million tonnes of elevation capacity.

In July 2024, GrainCorp, IFM and Ampol signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the establishment of an integrated renewable fuels supply chain in Australia. This collaboration combines GrainCorp’s feedstock and supply chain capabilities, Ampol’s refining and distribution infrastructure, and IFM’s long-term investment expertise to accelerate the transition to low-carbon liquid fuels.

Under the MOU, Ampol and IFM are assessing the feasibility for a renewable fuels facility with capacity to produce over 750 million liters annually at Ampol’s Lytton Refinery in Brisbane. At the same time, GrainCorp is exploring the feasibility of building a new canola processing facility to supply Australian canola oil to the future plant.

The partners have actively championed supply and demand policy mechanisms to stimulate and foster a robust domestic market for LCLF, which will see the establishment of a new Australian industry and support local jobs.

“Australia has a compelling advantage in infrastructure, technical expertise and availability of raw materials necessary to develop a domestic renewable fuels capability,” said Matt Halliday, managing director for Ampol. “To take advantage of the opportunity in front of us in standing up a domestic renewable fuels industry requires the right government policy and support, so today’s announcement is very much welcomed and an important step forward.”",https://www.world-grain.com/ext/resources/2025/06/16/Biofuels_SCHARFSINN86---STOCK.ADOBE.COM_e.jpg?height=635&t=1750078921&width=1200,N,,2025-09-18 17:56:29.619243

An interview with Robert Chad, Area Manager who oversees France, Belgium, The Netherlands & Southern Europe (Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Malta), and all our member airlines in these markets *.

·How has the policy focus evolved in your markets since the pandemic?

Many of the markets witnessed a strong resurgence, which was often referred to as “Travel Revenge”. This is a testimony that people view travel as an essential part of their life. We have seen diverse responses in terms of policy making, fromabusive increased airport charges, and imposed noise restrictions (of whichAmsterdam and Brussels are the most emblematic), to efforts in support ofSustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and everything in between. In France, we are witnessing a full spectrum of policies affecting aviation. This includes a 200 million EUR support for Sustainable Aviation Fuel projects, but also the flight ban on routes that can be operated by rail in less than 2h30 (a symbolic measure with little environmental benefit), as well as a significant tax hike. 2025 has also seen a drastic increase of the Solidarity Tax, which further questions the consistency of the government’s approach towards aviation, which is referred to as a “sector of excellence” for the country. But then again, all this is not surprising considering France has boasted five (!) different Transport ministers since the COVID19 pandemic… and we may have a sixth one in the coming days. To that extent, at the end of 2024, we issued and shared a Policy Briefto illustrate the importance of aviation and the necessary steps for the government to take.

·Sustainable Aviation Fuels represent the main solution for the industry to deliver its Fly Net Zero 2050 commitment. What update can you provide, notably on the required sufficient availability and ‘affordable’ pricing, as well as the book and claim system?

All governments in my cluster are now fully aware of this, but responses differ. Some countries have a clear roadmap to reach the 2050 goal, while others are only now setting up decarbonization roundtables to discuss the way forward, and some have neither of these advances in place. From our discussions with policymakers, there is a clear acknowledgement of the need of a Book and Claim system, however some raise the concern of the challenge to effectively control and track the environmental benefit across the process. We need to come up with an optimal solution, as SAF will not be available in all airports, at least not in the coming years. At our last AGM in Delhi, the pricing distortion point was clearly addressed. Many of our members had to pay unreasonable SAF compliance fees due to the current market conditions.

·As of late, we have been witnessing increasing aviation bashing and greenwashing measures from Governments. What actions have you or will you put in place to counter this trend?

The political ‘panic’ response to pressure aviation is risky and can have disastrous effects on the sector and the economy in general. IATA published late last year a series of Value of Aviation reports, which highlight the criticality of the sector for connectivity, economies, and societies. In France, we went one step further by sharing thePolicy Brief with all the Parliament Members to ensure these policymakers acquire a full understanding of the importance of their decisions with regards to our industry.

Airlines are committed to addressing their environmental footprint. This includes “noise”, which is now clear to all policymakers. Unfortunately, after the flight capping at Amsterdam, others such as Brussels have considered following suit, often without applying the necessaryBalanced Approach. Governments should look at the sector with ‘unbiased’ fresh eyes, fully understanding the value and benefits of aviation, the connectivity it provides, and keep in mind that the industry supports 15 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This would facilitate smarter policymaking, stability and consistency.

·Italy represents a best practice when it comes to accessibility, notably with the ‘One Click Away’ project. How can we ensure other countries follow in its footsteps?

This topic is particularly important to me. People deserve to and must travel in a dignified way. This journey starts at the flight search and booking process. Not one stakeholder in all my cluster disagrees with this affirmation. Authorities must serve as ‘sponsors’ -like Italy with ENAC- enabling and facilitating change through platforms and initiatives. We are making advancement in France, and engaged other countries to follow. Airlines are supportive, and many of them have expanded the ‘One Click Away’ initiative to all their websites! From our side, we are engaging all stakeholders (airlines, authorities, airports, associations of disabled persons, association of travel agents, airports …) to explain the concept and facilitate adoption, and IATA played an active role in theINCLAVI (INCLusive AVIation) project which just concluded.

The global avionics industry is undergoing a sweeping transformation, fueled by rapid advances in technology, surging demand for air travel, and aggressive modernization programs across both commercial and military aviation.

Analysts see no slowdown in sight. According to the Business Research Company, the global avionics market is expected to reach about USD 90.5 billion in 2025, up from USD 84.35 billion in 2024, marking a compound annual growth rate of 7.3%.

By 2029, the avionics market is projected to climb to USD 120.72 billion, sustaining a CAGR of 7.5%. The growth underscores the pivotal role of advanced avionics in boosting aircraft performance, efficiency, and safety.

Drivers Behind the Boom

At the heart of this expansion are several converging trends. Technology is leading the way, as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, predictive maintenance, and data analytics reshape how avionics systems function. These tools enable real-time monitoring, smarter decision-making, and more reliable operations.

Airlines and defense organizations are also investing heavily in modernizing their fleets, both to meet strict regulatory standards and to wring more efficiency from fuel consumption. In North America especially, the combination of defense spending and large-scale fleet upgrades has made modernization a defining growth engine.

The global rebound in air traffic is another critical factor, particularly in Asia-Pacific, where surging passenger volumes are driving demand for new aircraft. Military programs add yet another layer of momentum, as governments worldwide ramp up defense capabilities with next-generation avionics, including advanced flight management, communication, and surveillance systems.

Regional Perspectives

North America continues to dominate the market thanks to its robust defense sector and extensive fleet renewal efforts in commercial aviation.

Asia-Pacific, however, is emerging as the fastest-growing region, propelled by strong economic development and soaring demand for both civil and military aircraft.

Europe, meanwhile, is steadily expanding its market share through a combination of regulatory pushes for safety and efficiency and active modernization of its aviation fleets.

Technology Defining the Future

The avionics landscape of tomorrow is being shaped by a series of groundbreaking technologies. Autonomous flight systems are advancing rapidly, promising to reduce human error while improving efficiency and safety.

The rise of electric and hybrid-electric propulsion is also forcing the development of specialized avionics to manage these emerging platforms. With increased connectivity in the cockpit and beyond, cybersecurity has become a top priority, as safeguarding avionics systems against evolving threats is essential to maintaining operational integrity.

At the same time, augmented and virtual reality are finding their way into flight decks and training programs, giving pilots sharper situational awareness and more immersive instruction.

Challenges on the Horizon

Yet even with such a promising outlook, the industry must navigate persistent challenges. Supply chain disruptions continue to affect the timely delivery of critical components.

Regulatory compliance demands constant investment in research and development, as evolving standards require avionics providers to adapt quickly. Integration, too, poses hurdles: marrying new technologies with legacy aircraft systems can be costly and technically complex.

Still, the trajectory remains strong. The global avionics sector is not only growing, it’s redefining the very nature of aviation. With AI, autonomous operations, and electric propulsion pushing the boundaries, the industry is on course for a new era that promises to transform how aircraft fly, how militaries defend, and how passengers experience the skies.

According to IATA leaders Willie Walsh and Mary Owens Thomsen, SAF could account for up to two-thirds of the required emissions reductions. However, current fuel production levels remain far below what is needed.

“We are disappointed by the pace of SAF production,” emphasized IATA Director General Willie Walsh. “At present, the target of 5% SAF usage by 2030 is unlikely to be met. Focus must be placed on stimulating production, because the shortage is not on the demand side, but on the supply side. Airlines have committed to purchasing fuel, showing that demand exists, but production is lagging.”

The situation in Europe and the UK is particularly concerning, where mandates to include 2% SAF in fuel blends have driven up jet fuel prices but have not significantly increased production.

“The money that could be spent on purchasing SAF is effectively boosting fuel suppliers’ profits — this is unacceptable,” Walsh noted.

IATA Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist Mary Owens Thomsen added that there is a significant gap between the expected returns from traditional oil companies and renewable energy projects.

“In the US, some SAF projects have yielded margins over 20%, whereas renewable energy projects generally achieve about 5%. Government support should focus on renewable energy to scale up production of low-carbon fuels, including SAF,” she said.

IATA emphasizes that aviation must have priority access to feedstocks for SAF production. Walsh pointed out that electrification or hybrid technologies only cover short-haul routes, while around 80% of emissions come from flights over 1,500 kilometers. Even the most efficient modern aircraft still rely on liquid fuel, and their operational lifespan can reach 20–25 years.

Thomsen stressed that there is no shortage of feedstock for SAF production — the main obstacles are technological maturity and commercial readiness. “Without accelerating technology deployment through incentives, even available feedstocks will not translate into the necessary production capacity,” she explained.

Regarding potential adjustments to the net-zero targets amid political instability and climate skepticism, Walsh noted that despite challenges and high transition costs, the industry remains committed to its long-term goals. “The technical feasibility of SAF is resolved; now the focus must be on making it commercially viable for the industry,” he said.

Overall, IATA experts urge governments to actively incentivize SAF production, direct support toward renewable energy rather than the traditional oil sector, and ensure fair access for aviation to feedstocks.

Only by taking these measures can the aviation industry implement its carbon reduction strategy and ensure a sustainable future for air transport.",https://www.uzdaily.uz/media/filer_public/f0/b5/f0b5c215-1876-4b97-b92f-39c75bd7f0d9/ask_9907.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 12:57:06.306235

Parallel regulatory shifts are emerging at the regional level. The EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities now includes aviation, introducing metrics like the Global Replacement Ratio to curb fleet growth New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Meanwhile, the UK is exploring a principles-based green taxonomy to incentivize investments in hard-to-abate sectors New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. These frameworks signal a broader trend: regulators are increasingly tying financial incentives to environmental performance, creating both risks and opportunities for airlines and investors.

Investment Opportunities: Decoding the Sustainable Aviation Ecosystem

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains the cornerstone of the industry's decarbonization strategy. With the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF is a critical lever for compliance with regulatory mandates Global emissions deal a priority for airlines at UN aviation assembly |[ 1 ]. Yet, its adoption remains nascent, with less than 1% of global jet fuel currently in use despite 73% of airlines having formal uptake plans New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. This gap underscores a significant investment opportunity.

Public and private funding mechanisms are accelerating SAF's scalability. Governments, including the U.S. and EU, are deploying grants, tax credits, and subsidies through programs like the Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Meanwhile, venture capital and private equity firms are stepping in to bridge the innovation gap. Breakthrough Energy Ventures, founded by Bill Gates, has invested in SAF startups such as LanzaTech and Fulcrum BioEnergy, while energy giants like

and are forming strategic partnerships to secure long-term SAF supply chains New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ].

The ICAO's newly launched Finvest Hub further amplifies these efforts by connecting decarbonization projects—particularly SAF production and clean energy infrastructure—with global investors New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. This platform highlights the importance of international collaboration, especially for developing nations, in achieving the industry's 2050 net-zero goals.

Strategic Imperatives for Investors

For investors, the transition to sustainable aviation presents a dual opportunity: mitigating regulatory risks while capitalizing on high-growth sectors. The economic implications of inaction are stark. Studies indicate that airlines could face operational losses if SAF costs are not passed on to passengers, underscoring the need for diversified investment strategies New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Conversely, early adopters of SAF and clean technologies stand to gain first-mover advantages in a market projected to expand exponentially.

However, the path is not without challenges. SAF's current high costs and limited infrastructure require sustained capital inflows and policy support. Investors must also navigate geopolitical uncertainties, such as the EU's stringent emission caps and the UK's evolving regulatory framework New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Diversifying portfolios across SAF producers, clean energy infrastructure, and carbon offset platforms can help mitigate these risks.

Conclusion: A Call for Collaborative Action

As the aviation industry gears up for the 2025 UN Assembly, the imperative to invest in sustainable aviation has never been clearer. Regulatory frameworks are tightening, technological innovations are maturing, and financial mechanisms are aligning to support a low-carbon future. For investors, the challenge lies in balancing short-term costs with long-term gains while navigating a rapidly evolving landscape.

The coming year will be decisive. With ICAO's Finvest Hub, the EU Taxonomy, and private-sector partnerships driving momentum, the time to act is now. By channeling capital into sustainable aviation, investors can not only future-proof their portfolios but also play a pivotal role in reshaping the industry's environmental legacy.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1758165806383.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-18 11:56:21.306039

According to Microsoft, the new 5 year agreement “will deliver sustainable AI infrastructure for all of Europe,” to help meet “the exponentially growing demand for efficient, scalable and sustainable AI compute power.”

Microsoft launched a series of “moonshot” sustainability goals in 2020, including commitments to become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030, as well as to protect more land than it uses by that date. The company’s carbon footprint has grown since 2020, however, driven largely by significant growth in data centers to meet increasing demand for AI computing power, and earlier this year, Microsoft’s Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa acknowledged that the rapid growth of AI has created challenges for the company’s sustainability goals.

In addition to investing heavily in carbon removal solutions, Microsoft has unveiled a series of measures to help address its value chain emissions footprint, including introducing a policy for some of its key suppliers to use 100% carbon-free electricity, and launching a new supplier decarbonization team focused on tackling emissions from cloud and AI operations.

Jon Tinter, President of Business Development and Ventures for Microsoft, said:

“We are incredibly excited for what this means for our customers, in Norway and across Europe, providing the latest and most advanced AI services from Microsoft. It is inspiring to see how Nscale and Aker are building cutting edge, sustainable AI infrastructure, and adding this facility to our comprehensive Microsoft cloud offering in Europe demonstrates our unwavering commitment to customers on the continent.”

The new agreement follows the establishment in July 2025 of a new joint venture between Nscale and Aker to launch “Stargate Norway,” a major AI infrastructure project in Norway, targeting a 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs by the end of 2026, to be powered by renewable energy, and designed to provide secure, scalable, and energy-efficient infrastructure for AI workloads across Europe.

According to the companies, the location of the project was chosen for its abundant hydropower and low local electricity demand, in addition to attributes including the cool climate, and the area’s established industrial infrastructure.

The contract, valued at approximately $6.2 billion, will be delivered in staged deployments beginning in 2026.

Øyvind Eriksen, President & CEO of Aker said:

“This agreement with Microsoft – a long-standing partner to Aker – is a milestone for the joint venture with Nscale and for Norway’s role in enabling sovereign AI infrastructure.

The first production of ‘drop-in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

“Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks like canola, sorghum, sugar and waste,” the government said in a statement.

“Thanks to our advanced farming practices and access to cheap and reliable renewable energy, Australia is in an enviable position to produce cleaner, low carbon liquid fuels that jets, ships, construction machines and heavy trucks need to reach net zero.”

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

The new production-linked incentive builds on the government’s support through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

Viable propulsion

In December last year, Stralis successfully completed a hydrogen-electric powered propeller spin test on Clyde, a registered six-seat Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft at Brisbane Airport.

The process used high-temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cells fuelled by green hydrogen and according to Steffen Geries, Chief Operating Officer at Stralis, it is completely emissions-free.

“Hydrogen electric propulsion uses green hydrogen, produced from renewable sources, which combines with oxygen in a fuel cell to create electricity for an electric motor, with water vapour and heat as the only by-products,” Geries said.

On the back of the successful ground testing, the company is now scaling the technology across multiple aircraft platforms.

“The first larger application will be a 15-seat retrofitted Beechcraft aircraft called B1900D-HE, designed to achieve an 800 km range, but our flagship product will be a 50-seat aircraft for regional aviation, capable of a 3000 km range,” Geries said.

“At this scale, hydrogen-electric propulsion offers its strongest performance and economic advantage – significantly undercutting the operating costs of conventional fossil-fuel aircraft in the same category.”

In the longer term, Stralis sees the potential to scale to even larger aircraft, as electric motors become more powerful and fuel cell systems continue to improve. With ongoing advancements, hydrogen-electric propulsion could extend well beyond the regional market, Geries said.

Importantly, the underlying technology isn’t limited to aviation. HT-PEM fuel cells are well-suited for any application that requires high specific power and is sensitive to weight and volume constraints.

“That includes marine vessels, heavy-duty trucking, portable power systems, and other mobility sectors where clean, lightweight and high-output energy is essential.”

Onboard storage

To get to this point, the engineering team has had to overcome one of the toughest challenges in hydrogen aviation: storage.

“Hydrogen in its gaseous form requires substantial volume, which is an issue for aircraft where space and weight are tightly constrained,” Geries said. “We’ve overcome this by storing the hydrogen on board as a cryogenic liquid at -254°C. This significantly improves energy density by volume and enables longer range capability.”

Liquid hydrogen also offers several advantages over battery-electric flight, he added.

“Where batteries add substantial weight and suffer from limited energy density and long charging times, liquid hydrogen is lighter and supports faster turnaround times. Refuelling is performed by pumping liquid hydrogen into onboard cryogenic tanks.”",https://createdigital.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Stralis.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 08:57:30.183255

The resumed increase in sustainability as a CEO priority comes despite an ESG backlash in the headlines, and as executives increasingly view sustainability from a business value perspective.
The study found, for example, that in 2025, 54% of CEOs linked sustainability to business value, up from only 34% in 2018.
The survey also found a shift in focus for B2B buyers from the sustainability of a supplier’s operations to the sustainability of the supplier’s product offering.
The consumer survey identified cost as the primary barrier to adopting more sustainable practices.","After dropping down the priority list for CEOs, sustainability has once again resumed growing in importance for corporate leaders, who now speak less about sustainability, but increasingly tie it to business value, as consumers and B2B buyers reward businesses for providing sustainable products and services, according to a new survey released by global management consultancy Bain & Company.

Among the key trends highlighted by the report is the importance placed by business to business (B2B) buyers on sustainability factors, with half of those surveyed reporting that they currently spend more with sustainable suppliers, and half also planning to drop suppliers that don’t meet sustainability criteria over the next three years.

While last year’s survey found a decline in CEOs’ prioritization in sustainability relative to other topics as companies shifted from a “hype” phase of setting sustainability commitments to the more difficult process of starting initiatives to reach those goals, the new report indicated that the importance of sustainability for CEOs has bottomed out, and increased for the first time in three years.

The resumed increase in sustainability as a CEO priority comes despite an ESG backlash in the headlines, and as executives increasingly view sustainability from a business value perspective. According to Bain’s analysis of more than 35,000 statements made by CEOs over the past several years, there has been a clear shift in business leaders views of sustainability, from a compliance and moral lens, to one focused on aligning sustainability with core business risks and operational factors. The study found, for example, that in 2025, 54% of CEOs linked sustainability to business value, up from only 34% in 2018.

Despite finding that CEOs are speaking less overall about sustainability, the report also found, however, that companies are ramping their sustainability efforts, with 10% of companies increasing their Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) ambitions, for example, compared with only 4% scaling back, and two thirds of companies on track to achieve their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions targets.

Among the 750 B2B companies surveyed for the report, Bain found that the large majority expect sustainability to have a positive impact on their business over the next three years, and that this belief is particularly strong among companies with year-over-year revenue growth greater than that of their peers, with 90% of these companies agreeing, compared with 60% of other respondents.

As B2B companies increasingly see business value in sustainability, their buying behavior is following suit, according to the survey, which found that 49% of companies are already buying more from their more sustainable suppliers, up from 39% last year, and 68% plan to do so over the next three years. Additionally, 26% of respondents are leaving suppliers that don’t meet their sustainability criteria – while this has declined from last year, 49% expect to do so by 2028, according to the survey.

Additionally, the survey found that more than 80% of B2B buyers paid a premium for their most recent purchase of a sustainable product, and that a third are currently willing to pay more than 5% extra for more sustainable products, while 60% expect to do so in three years.

The survey also found a shift in focus for B2B buyers from the sustainability of a supplier’s operations to the sustainability of the supplier’s product offering. The survey found that buyers expect “sustainability of offers” to increase to become the second top purchasing criteria – behind only “quality” – over the next three years, up from fourth place currently, while “sustainability of suppliers’ operations” is expected to remain unchanged in fifth place.

The report also included a survey of more than 14,000 consumers across 8 countries, finding that 79% reported being concerned about environmental sustainability, a slight decline from the prior year. While the large majority remain concerned about sustainability, the survey found that consumers are adopting a wide range of sustainable practices, including 49% reporting lower energy use, 46% recycling, 41% using reusable products, and 38% buying fewer disposable items. Overall, 32% of respondents reported adopting six or more sustainable habits daily, with 70% wanting to adopt more.

The consumer survey identified cost as the primary barrier to adopting more sustainable practices. In the U.S., for example, while consumers reporting that that they are willing to pay up to a 13% premium for sustainable products, Bain cited New York University data finding that there is a 28% average premium for sustainable products.

In the report, Jean-Charles van den Branden, Leader of Bain’s Global Sustainability practice, and François Faelli, Global Head of Capabilities at Bain said:

“For sustainability, 2025 is the year CEOs turned down the volume—and accelerated action. Sustainability remains a priority. Customers and consumers demand it. Risk and disruption make it essential.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bain.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 08:57:35.360257

Led by cornerstone investors Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, and joined by International Airlines Group (IAG), Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, the fund signals a major step toward transforming the aviation industry’s fuel supply chain. The initiative marks one of the most significant collective investments in SAF to date, addressing two critical industry challenges: limited availability and high production costs.

Climate Innovation Takes Flight

BEV will act as the fund’s investment manager, bringing its deep technical expertise, rigorous evaluation processes, and a track record of nurturing climate tech startups. The goal: to identify and scale SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions, compete with fossil-based jet fuels on cost, and work seamlessly with today’s aviation infrastructure. “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to addressing the sector’s environmental impact and represents a major commercial opportunity. The oneworld BEV Fund is built to scale breakthrough SAF technologies with staying power,” said Eric Toone, Chief Technology Officer at Breakthrough Energy and Managing Partner at BEV.

Why SAF Matters Now

Air travel currently accounts for about 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, but demand for aviation is expected to rise in the coming decades. SAF—fuels made from renewable or waste sources—can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. However, SAF still accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel use, and the sector has struggled to attract the scale of investment needed to grow. That’s where this fund steps in. The oneworld BEV Fund will prioritize innovations that are not only cleaner but also cost-effective and scalable, helping to build a diverse and resilient supply chain for aviation fuel in the decades to come.

Collective Action Across Alliances

What’s particularly notable is the cross-alliance collaboration. While oneworld member airlines lead the effort, Singapore Airlines, a Star Alliance member, has also invested in the fund—showcasing an industry-wide recognition of the need for climate action. “Reducing the carbon emissions of jet fuel demands collective action,” said Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer at Singapore Airlines. “This investment demonstrates our strong support for driving innovation in next-generation fuels.”

According to Robert Isom, CEO of American Airlines and Chairman of oneworld, the airline and oneworld partners are making a business decision to accelerate the development of novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices by investing in the SAF technologies of the future.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2023/12/775dcf0a-adobestock_410592669-2100-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-18 08:57:40.508313

American Airlines CEO and oneworld Chairman Robert Isom said:

“We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.”

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

According to a recent report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), however, while SAF production is anticipated to double in 2025, it will still account for just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption. Efforts to meaningfully increase the production of SAF face barriers including high initial costs and feedstock challenges.

In its announcement of the new fund, oneworld highlighted some of the challenges facing the first generation of SAF, including insufficient investment to date to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, as well as concerns around lifecycle environmental impact, adding that the partners in the new fund will focus on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

Sustainable aviation future","New funding under the EU Emissions Trading System supports 53 airlines in their transition to sustainable aviation fuels

The European Union has taken the following steps toward greener air travel by allocating approximately €100 million in emissions allowances to support airlines that used Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in 2024.

This move is part of a bigger effort to accelerate the aviation sector’s shift away from fossil fuels and reduce its overall climate impact.

The funding comes from the EU’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the bloc’s flagship carbon market mechanism, and is aimed at closing the cost gap between traditional fossil-based jet fuel and SAF. SAF is a low-carbon alternative that can be integrated with existing aircraft technology and infrastructure, offering significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions throughout its lifecycle.

New support mechanism for airlines

Under the latest amendment to the EU ETS Directive, a new dedicated support system has been introduced to promote the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuels . Starting in 2024, the EU set aside 20 million emissions allowances, valued at roughly €1.5 billion, for commercial airlines that use SAF on their flights, subject to carbon pricing under the ETS.

For the first year of the scheme, around 1.3 million allowances, equivalent to approximately €100 million at current carbon prices, were distributed among 53 commercial aircraft operators across the EU. These allowances help offset the additional cost of SAF compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a more financially viable option for airlines.

More benefits for SAF users

Airlines using Sustainable Aviation Fuels under the ETS framework benefit in two ways. First, they receive free allowances to help cover the price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene. Second, emissions from SAF are “zero-rated” under the EU ETS, meaning that airlines do not need to surrender carbon allowances for the emissions associated with the use of SAF.

In 2024, the value of this zero-rating is estimated at around €25 million, adding to the €100 million worth of free allowances granted. Combined, the total incentive for SAF usage under the EU ETS this year reaches approximately €125 million.

This financial boost is designed to encourage more operators to switch to Sustainable Aviation Fuels and to increase overall demand, which could eventually help lower prices through economies of scale and supply chain development.

In addition to direct support through allowances, the EU ETS continues to fund the Innovation Fund, which backs cutting-edge clean technology projects, including those in aviation. This multi-pronged approach aims to drive both immediate adoption of SAF and long-term technological change within the industry.

To maintain transparency and ensure accountability, the European Commission has also published a list of all 53 operators that received allowances, along with the quantities allocated to each. This transparency is intended to build trust in the support system and demonstrate the EU’s commitment to fair and effective climate action.

A new report from the London School of Economics warns that an overwhelming majority of corporate climate transition plans lack credibility, with companies continuing to defer meaningful emissions reductions. The study analyzed disclosures from 2,000 publicly traded firms worth $87 trillion and found that only 2% had shifted capital away from high-carbon assets. Moreover, 22% failed basic climate tests, like emissions reporting. While a whopping 95% of companies acknowledge climate change, only 10% demonstrate actual integration into business operations. The report also highlights a growing gap between policy commitments and implementation, with many firms relying on unproven technologies or excluding scope 3 emissions, which are absolutely critical in measuring the carbon impact of a company’s supply chains.

New report uncovers environmental destruction from Chinese gold mines in DRC

A new report from peace group PAX accuses Chinese miners of illegally extracting gold in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), devastating both the natural environment and communities. Backed by Congolese cooperatives and local governments, semi-industrial operations have scarred over 155 miles of waterways, destroyed farmland, and polluted ecosystems with mercury and cyanide. Industrial mining has been damaging the environment in the DRC since the rise in global demand for critical minerals, and this report reveals that existing protections are proving ineffective. Congolese communities are facing health crises, water shortages, and displacement, with devastating reports of children drowning in abandoned mining pits. Researchers warn that the operations are greatly worsening poverty and violence in the region. China, a top gold consumer, denies sanctioning illegal activity by its nationals.

Airlines invest in $150M sustainable aviation fuel fund

Alaska and American Airlines have invested in a $150 million fund managed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, aiming to accelerate next-generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Also supported by oneworld alliance members, including IAG, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, the fund seeks to scale alternatives to fossil jet fuel and slowly cut aviation’s 3% share of global emissions. Current SAF supply represents less than 1% of jet fuel production, and costs remain high. Breakthrough Energy is targeting innovative fuels such as engineered algae and hydrogen-based options to drive down costs and unlock large-scale commercial adoption. The biggest challenge lies in scaling production fast enough to meet demand while overcoming cost barriers that keep SAF uncompetitive with conventional jet fuel.

Trump’s push to scrap quarterly reports gains surprising support from ESG investors

Trump’s call to replace quarterly earnings reports with semi-annual updates has drawn unexpected support from sustainability-focused investors. Advocates argue that quarterly reporting promotes short-termism and distracts management from long-term issues such as climate risks. Many European investors believe that reducing the frequency of reporting cycles could strengthen sustainability strategies without compromising transparency, provided that proper safeguards are in place. Critics, however, warn that the need for such safeguards is exactly why the U.S. may not see the same benefits as the EU, Britain, New Zealand, and Australia. U.S. disclosure rules lack equivalents for profit warnings and continuous updates, raising risks for both investors and sustainability.

Changing the fuel specifications for Jet-A/Jet-A1 could possibly be achieved sooner and with less expense than increasing SAF production. Any changes in Jet-A/Jet-A1 specification could be done independently of increasing SAF availability and could be done so as not to interfere with increased SAF usage and should also be considered in this Policy Analysis.

There has been a renewed focus on CORSIA recently after SAF production took center stage from 2021 when aviation’s 2050 goal was agreed to and the quality of some offsetting programs were questioned.
But IATA is putting CORSIA front and center at the ICAO Assembly, with Walsh describing it as the most important issue to be addressed.
IATA wants ICAO states to reaffirm their commitment to making CORSIA the only economic measure to manage aviation’s climate impact and to make available sufficient CORSIA EEUs for airlines to be able to fulfill their CORSIA obligations.
In all, ICAO has accepted 14 working papers from IATA for consideration at the assembly.","IATA’s top executives, including Director General Willie Walsh, have outlined the key issues they will raise at the forthcoming 42nd ICAO Assembly in Montreal, with aviation sustainability at the top of their list.

In a pre-brief for media on Sept. 17, Walsh said it was “critical” to secure stronger support for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and for the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (CORSIA) agreement that was established at the 39th ICAO Assembly in 2016. These were “key enablers” of aviation’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, Walsh said.

Growing the availability of SAF and making it more affordable have become major goals of IATA in the post-pandemic years, but they also seem increasingly out of reach. Walsh said the problem was “one of supply, not demand,” and he was concerned progress in growing production was not sufficient. Government mandates make fuel companies more profitable rather than putting money into SAF production, a situation Walsh said was “unacceptable.”

IATA will ask ICAO to support its efforts to create a functioning SAF market, step up economic incentives for fuel producers for SAF production, and make policy interventions to address anomalies.

There has been a renewed focus on CORSIA recently after SAF production took center stage from 2021 when aviation’s 2050 goal was agreed to and the quality of some offsetting programs were questioned. But IATA is putting CORSIA front and center at the ICAO Assembly, with Walsh describing it as the most important issue to be addressed. He said the global, market-based measure to address carbon emissions was a “fantastic action” taken in 2016 and needed to be reinforced.

The problem is that states continue to create or augment national and regional aviation taxes and schemes that undercut CORSIA’s credibility. Moreover, only one state, Guyana, has issued CORSIA eligible emissions units (EEUs) which generate climate finance and enable airlines to fulfill their CORSIA obligations.

IATA wants ICAO states to reaffirm their commitment to making CORSIA the only economic measure to manage aviation’s climate impact and to make available sufficient CORSIA EEUs for airlines to be able to fulfill their CORSIA obligations.

IATA SVP sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said offsets were a key lever to achieving net zero. CORSIA offsets are related to certified CO2 emissions reduction projects, mostly in developing countries, and airlines directly help finance those projects.

“It’s a really beneficial program for everybody involved and connects obviously with a global carbon market,” Owens Thomsen said. “Together, we’re building the global climate finance infrastructure by promoting and engaging in this program. But the problem is that there are administrative requirements under the Paris agreement that countries are obliged to do. We need to take these credits off the Paris agreements register and make them available for airlines under ICAO’s CORSIA.”

Additionally, states can opt to sell these credits to airlines, to other countries or to keep them, while airlines are obliged to buy them. “This is all very problematic, and we’re trying to make it easier for the states to release these credits in our favor by hook and by crook,” Owens Thomsen said.

Other issues that IATA will raise at the assembly, which runs from Sept. 23 through Oct. 3, include ignoring a potential revision to how an airline’s corporate tax dues are assessed that would upend the long-applied system of basing those taxes on the airline’s resident base.

There are also some safety-based issues that IATA wants addressed, including reinforcing ICAO Annex 13 that requires a final accident report to be filed within a year of the occurrence. Walsh said that in the case of accidents that occurred between 2018 and 2023, about 43% had yet to file a report. “It’s very important to share those reports to ensure these accidents are not repeated,” Walsh said. “It’s very important that states fulfill their obligations under Annex 13.”

IATA will also ask the assembly to increase the maximum pilot age rule for multi-pilot international operations from 65 to 67, while maintaining the requirement that pilots over 60 have medical examinations every six months. He said this was based on evidence and data that it would not bring any safety risks. The pilots’ union ALPA opposes such a move.

For the industry as a whole and for DHL Group in particular, the next decisive step is to advance the electrification of heavy-duty transport and to make aviation cleaner using modern fleets and sustainable aviation fuels.""

The global postal industry's sustainability measures and objectives

Since 2008, postal companies - key players in the global transport and logistics sector - have been working together on sustainability through the introduction of the Environmental Measurement and Monitoring System (EMMS), followed in 2019 by the Sustainability Measurement and Management System (SMMS). These postal operators have reduced their total annual CO2 emissions by one third and have pledged to cut emissions by 50% by 2030.

The sustainable use of resources has long been a priority for the postal sector in its efforts to minimize environmental impact. The industry is focusing on two key areas: ensuring that postal facilities are increasingly run on renewable electricity, and progressively replacing its global fleet of 600,000 vehicles with alternative vehicles powered by cleaner fuels.

In addition, postal operators are working to cut CO2 emissions in the last mile by expanding the use of delivery vehicles with alternative drive systems. Increasingly, the industry is also focusing on heavy goods transport, where decarbonization is critical to reducing environmental impact. Across the sector, more electric vans and trucks are being added to fleets, while alternative fuels are being tested for air freight. Postal companies are also optimizing truck loading and route planning to further shrink their environmental footprint.

Another key focus is reducing the 1.57 million metric tons of Scope 2 emissions produced annually by postal buildings. Expanding the use of renewable energy will be essential to achieving the industry's 2030 climate targets. A number of postal operators are already making use of solar power, with plans to significantly increase this in the coming years.

Sustainability at DHL Group

DHL Group is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from 40 million metric tons of CO2e (as of 2021) to less than 29 million by 2030, based on the Science-Based Targets initiative. This will be achieved through various measures, such as gradually increasing the proportion of sustainable fuels (e.g., sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used across the aircraft fleet or biogas for CNG trucks), further electrification of the delivery and road transport fleet, CO2-neutral building design, and emission-reduced product offerings.

The company also made great strides last year: in 2024, the DHL Group used 74 kilotons of sustainable aviation fuel across its own fleet. This corresponds to a blending ratio of 3.5% in its aircraft - the highest proportion across all airlines worldwide. This year, the Group has increased the number of electric delivery vehicles to 35,000 in its German mail and parcel business alone, making it the largest e-fleet in Europe. 40,000 specially installed charging stations ensure that 95% of the electricity used for charging is green, and 450 CNG (biogas) trucks are used for road transport between parcel centers. Photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and building automation are used at 160 newly built delivery depots, and 195 buildings are equipped with photovoltaics - with a technically available output of approximately 22 MWp.

The scheme is intended to reduce the price disparity between conventional fossil-based kerosene and SAF, which remains significantly more expensive.

By offering free allowances, the EU is providing operators with a cost offset for each tonne of SAF uplifted on flights subject to ETS carbon pricing.

The Commission noted that this measure builds on existing incentives. Airlines already benefit from not having to surrender allowances for SAF use, an advantage worth an additional €25 million this year.

Combined, the direct allocation of allowances and the zero-rating of SAF under the ETS amount to around €125 million in support for 2024.

A long-term framework

This distribution marks the first application of a broader SAF support mechanism introduced in the recent revision of the EU ETS Directive.

The legislation set aside 20 million allowances – valued at around €1.5 billion at current carbon market prices – to be allocated over the coming years.

Officials hope the framework will give airlines greater confidence to invest in SAF contracts, while also stimulating production across the bloc.

The uptake of SAF currently represents less than 1% of aviation fuel consumption in Europe, despite being one of the few viable near-term solutions for reducing sectoral emissions.

Broader climate investment

Beyond the SAF allocation, the EU ETS also channels revenues into the Innovation Fund, which finances a range of clean technology projects, including in aviation.

The Commission underlined that the SAF incentive sits into this broader effort to decarbonise transport and ensure the sector contributes to Europe’s climate neutrality goals.

Industry implications

While the €100 million allocation offers welcome relief to operators facing high fuel costs, industry leaders stress that long-term SAF affordability will depend on scaling up supply.

The EU’s mechanism is therefore seen as a transitional tool, supporting early adopters while helping build a market for sustainable fuels at a commercial scale.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/09/18/Flight-Emissions-1536x864-1.png,N,,2025-09-18 04:56:08.737373

Rooftop solar: A quick solution stuck in limbo Rooftop solar is among the fastest ways to scale up renewable energy.
These restrictions have discouraged public adoption of rooftop solar, slowing down Indonesia’s progress toward its renewable energy goals.
All this demonstrates that Indonesia has both the capacity and resources to advance renewable energy — so why does it still lean so heavily on imports?
Strengthening multilateral cooperation The biggest challenge in Indonesia’s energy transition is financing.","The year 2025 begins with persistent global geopolitical tensions. The war between Ukraine and Russia drags on, conflict in the Middle East is heating up, and the United States-China trade war continues. All of this could send shockwaves through the global energy market — including in Indonesia.

Indonesia still relies heavily on imported crude oil and natural gas. In 2024, Indonesia spent US$36.28 billion on imported crude oil and natural gas — leaving it highly vulnerable to sudden price hikes caused by war or trade tariffs.

When war broke out in Ukraine in 2022, oil shot past US$100 a barrel — and Indonesia’s subsidy budget ballooned.

These geopolitical tensions should serve as a wake-up call to hasten the transition to renewable energy. Beyond reducing emissions, expanding domestic renewables would cut import dependence and bolster national energy security.

Ironically, Indonesia’s recent diplomacy with the United States (US) has deepened its reliance on imported energy, with President Prabowo Subianto approving US$15 billion (Rp244 trillion) in crude oil and LPG imports in exchange for lower trade tariffs.

These global shocks further expose Indonesia’s deep dependence on imported fossil fuels, making the shift to renewables not just a climate necessity but a strategic imperative for energy security and economic resilience.

Rooftop solar: A quick solution stuck in limbo

Rooftop solar is among the fastest ways to scale up renewable energy. To spur adoption, the government has introduced regulations such as the 2021 rooftop solar grid rule, the 2024 reform and quota regulation, and the 2024 local content rule for solar projects.

However, these regulations have drawn sharp criticism. The 2021 regulation capped the capacity of rooftop solar that could connect to PLN, the state electricity company. Meanwhile, the 2024 quota regulation abolished the net-metering scheme, which had allowed households to offset electricity bills by feeding excess power back into the grid.

These restrictions have discouraged public adoption of rooftop solar, slowing down Indonesia’s progress toward its renewable energy goals.

Australia offers a strong example: it leads the world in rooftop solar adoption through federal subsidies under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme, complemented by state-level rebates and interest-free loan programs.

As a result, rooftop solar installation costs can be reduced to 70% of market prices, making solar panels affordable for households and small businesses.

Expanding large-scale renewables and infrastructure

Beyond rooftop solar, Indonesia must accelerate large-scale projects like the Cirata Floating Solar Plant, and expand electricity infrastructure for transport and industry.

This is critical given that industry (45.94%) and transport (36.11%) — both account for the bulk of national energy consumption — are still heavily dependent on coal, natural gas, and oil.

Expanding the national grid and building electric vehicle (EV) charging networks are critical for enabling a smooth transition to clean, electricity-based industry and transport.

Scaling up renewable fuel production

Not all sectors can readily switch to electricity; aviation, maritime, and heavy industry will continue to remain reliant on chemical fuels.

Indonesia must also scale up renewable fuel production — including green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, bioethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and biodiesel — ensuring they are produced using renewable electricity and sustainable feedstocks, while avoiding deforestation by prioritising waste-based sources.

PLN has begun developing a hydrogen supply chain for industry and fuel-cell vehicles — one of its largest initiatives is the Garuda Green Hydrogen (GH2), a partnership with Saudi energy giant ACWA Power, set to operate in 2026. The hydrogen will be converted into ammonia to support Indonesia’s domestic fertiliser industry.

Other hydrogen projects underway include Gresik Green Hydrogen (ACWA Power and Pupuk Indonesia), Jambi Green Hydrogen (Sembcorp and Transgasindo), Kujang Green Ammonia (Pupuk Indonesia and Fortescue Future Industries), and East Sumba Solar/Fuel Cell (HDF Energy). All projects are scheduled to begin operations between 2026 and 2027.

Indonesia has also begun producing sustainable aviation fuels. State-owned oil company Pertamina’s Cilacap Refinery started output of Bioavtur J2.4 in 2021 — a 2.4% palm oil-based blend with fossil jet fuel — with a capacity of 9,000 barrels per day. The technology was developed by Pertamina Research and Technology Innovation (RTI) and Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) since 2010.

Pertamina is also developing new facilities to produce sustainable fuels — including gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel from used cooking oil — at its refineries in Cilacap, Plaju, and Sungai Gerong.

All this demonstrates that Indonesia has both the capacity and resources to advance renewable energy — so why does it still lean so heavily on imports?

Strengthening multilateral cooperation

The biggest challenge in Indonesia’s energy transition is financing. To address this, Indonesia must strengthen multilateral cooperation, particularly with its Asia-Pacific neighbours, including ASEAN members and Australia.

Incentives like tax holidays can draw in foreign investors, while streamlined licensing reforms will ease the flow of foreign capital.

Funding could also be mobilised through partnerships with global institutions such as the Quad coalition (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the World Bank.

Indonesia has also agreed to export 3.4 GW of clean electricity to Singapore until 2035, backed by US$30-50 billion in solar investments, plus another US$2.7 billion for solar panel and battery manufacturing.

The program is projected to generate US$4-6 billion in annual foreign exchange revenue.

Pertamina has also supplied SAF to Virgin Australia during the Bali International Air Show on September 18-19, 2024.

By prioritising three key actions — accelerating electrification, advancing renewable fuels, and strengthening multilateral cooperation — Indonesia has a major opportunity to fast-track its energy transition.

Stronger energy security would not only protect Indonesia from global shocks but also lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth in the decades to come.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/686256/original/file-20250819-56-cgbipo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C793%2C9504%2C4752&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-18 02:56:12.376722

The clearest way to boost crop demand is to expand access to higher ethanol blends, especially E15.
That’s why we need Congress to pass the Nationwide Fuel Retailer and Consumer Choice Act this fall, which would finally put E15 fuel regulations on a level playing field with E10.
We agree, and recommended these steps in a recent letter to the president: • Eliminate E15 Misfueling Mitigation Plan requirements.
• Establish a presumption of E15 compatibility for all fuel dispensers, underground storage tank systems, and hanging hardware installed after 1998.","Across America’s heartland, corn farmers have begun to bring in a record harvest—only to face some of the lowest prices in years. They’ve done their job; now Washington needs to do its part. Outdated federal rules—like obsolete pump labeling and unnecessary equipment certifications—are suppressing demand for ethanol and, by extension, undercutting a new market opportunity for our nation’s farmers.

The clearest way to boost crop demand is to expand access to higher ethanol blends, especially E15. Nationwide, year-round E15 availability could create demand for over 2 billion bushels of corn and sorghum, while saving consumers 10–30 cents per gallon at the pump. That’s why we need Congress to pass the Nationwide Fuel Retailer and Consumer Choice Act this fall, which would finally put E15 fuel regulations on a level playing field with E10.

But the need for legislative action goes beyond that. In August, a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the Ethanol for America Act. This bill would require the EPA to finalize a long-stalled rule—first proposed in January 2021—to modernize E15 labeling and equipment standards. Originally proposed at the end of the first Trump administration, the rule sat idle under President Biden. It includes commonsense steps: updating or removing E15 pump labels, allowing flexibility in underground storage tank requirements and ensuring future fuel infrastructure is compatible with higher ethanol blends.

Finalizing this rule should be an easy win—and we urge policymakers and the administration to get the job done as soon as possible. In 2024, President Trump said gas stations should be able to “use the existing pumps” for E15. We agree, and recommended these steps in a recent letter to the president:

• Eliminate E15 Misfueling Mitigation Plan requirements.

• Establish a presumption of E15 compatibility for all fuel dispensers, underground storage tank systems, and hanging hardware installed after 1998.

“A local Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) industry has the potential to create significant economic benefit for regional Australia, enhance our domestic fuel security and support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector,” said Fiona Messent, Qantas’ chief sustainability officer.","“As demand for air travel grows, and more goods are moved by road and rail, it’s essential we invest in future fuels that allow us to facilitate this increasing demand while meeting our net-zero targets,” said Acting Transport and Infrastructure Minister Murray Watt.

“Low carbon fuels have the potential to be a $36 billion industry here in Australia, and we have the opportunity to lead the way on the production of these new fuels.

“We have the renewable feedstocks, access to clean energy and a strong agriculture base, all of which will allow us to develop this new industry, create new jobs and power how Australians move for decades to come.”

Government figures show that Australia currently exports around $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow, with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimating a domestic low-carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050 and deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2-e in cumulative emissions reduction.

According to Treasurer Jim Chalmers, the economic benefits of low-carbon fuels are about “making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation”.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net zero supply chains. This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia,” he said.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

The aviation industry has welcomed the announcement, with companies such as Jet Zero Australia, Airbus, and Qantas all offering their support.

“As a company focused on bringing the regions to the runway with SAF, we are extremely excited about this new funding support and what it means for our most advanced project, Project Ulysses,” said Jet Zero CEO Ed Mason.

“We have seen voices supporting SAF broaden to include Defence and agricultural bodies such as the National Farmers Federation, Canegrowers and Grains Australia.”

Stephen Forshaw, Airbus chief representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, said the government should also now look at demand-side policies, including a SAF blending mandate.

“We know Australia has the feedstock. The industry has been waiting for the right policy signals from the Government, and this very significant supply-side support package amounts to take-off clearance for producers and those who are weighing the opportunity to produce here,” he said.

“We welcome the Government engaging in an industry consultation process to determine how the scheme should be implemented, and hope this can be done quickly. We think SAF before 2029 is achievable, indeed needed, with the right will and sense of urgency.

“Australia will win from this policy. The creation of thousands of new jobs in regional Australia, and the improvement of our fuel security position as a nation are key reasons why this policy is good for the country.”

Qantas, which also backs SAF projects in concert with Airbus and has so far committed around $100 million, says it “looks forward to continued collaboration with Government and industry as part of further consultation processes”.

“A local Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) industry has the potential to create significant economic benefit for regional Australia, enhance our domestic fuel security and support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector,” said Fiona Messent, Qantas’ chief sustainability officer.

“Qantas invests in a number of local SAF initiatives and projects, enabled by our $400 million Climate Fund, with this announcement another step toward establishing a thriving SAF industry in Australia and seizing Australia’s unique low carbon liquid fuels opportunity.”

Virgin Australia has also welcomed the news, with chief corporate affairs and sustainability officer Christian Bennett saying the move “recognises the critical role that sustainable aviation fuel can play in aviation’s decarbonisation journey”.

“As the policy landscape further develops, our focus remains squarely on least cost decarbonisation and ensuring that sustainable fuels, which are currently around 3-5 times more expensive than

conventional jet fuel, are accessible and affordable for airlines and, ultimately, the travelling public,” he said.

“As we continue our own sustainability journey, including our partnership with Qatar Airways and Renewable Developments Australia to establish a SAF production facility in Far North Queensland, we’re committed to working collaboratively with government and industry to establish viable, cost- effective pathways to decarbonisation.”

Maeve Aerospace Chief Technology Officer Martin Nuesseler said the partnership will help tailor the aircraft for U.S. operations.","Delta Air Lines has announced a partnership with Netherlands-based Maeve Aerospace to accelerate the development of its hybrid electric MAEVE Jet for regional routes. The airline said the aircraft design will help reduce fuel consumption and emissions by as much as 40 percent when operating on conventional jet fuel. It said that further reductions may be possible when using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The collaboration marks Delta’s fifth partnership within its Sustainable Skies Lab, part of the carrier’s broader strategy to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

“Delta is proud to collaborate with Maeve to help shape the next chapter of regional aviation and accelerate progress toward a more sustainable future of flight,” Kristen Bojko, Delta’s vice president of fleet, said.

Maeve Aerospace Chief Technology Officer Martin Nuesseler said the partnership will help tailor the aircraft for U.S. operations.

“It’s a privilege to have Delta as a partner in the development of groundbreaking technologies and processes,” he said

The agreement also extends Delta’s work on ground operations, including its partnership with Green Taxi Aerospace to develop electric taxiing technology aimed at reducing fuel burn and emissions during airport operations.

This announcement comes the same day as oneworld partners including American Airlines announced an SAF investment fund, as well as a European Commission announcement that would allocate about €100 million worth of EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) allowances to help 53 airlines bridge the cost gap when purchasing SAF.

It also accelerated the retrofit of so-called ‘scimitar’ winglets to its Boeing 737-800NG fleet, modifications that reduce fuel use as well as aircraft noise. It is targeting 409 such installations by 2026.

Elsewhere, in January of this year, Ryanair commenced the procurement of a 2% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend at airports across the EU and UK.

‘Align with global efforts’

‘Ryanair is committed to ensuring that the Group’s operations align with global efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change,’ the company said in the report. ‘To facilitate this, the Group developed a comprehensive Climate Transition Plan that outlines the Group’s approach to reducing carbon emissions through fleet renewal and new technologies, promoting the scaling and use of SAF, and prioritising action on climate change across our business.’

Also in the 2025 financial year, Ryanair extended its funding partnership with Trinity College Dublin’s Sustainable Aviation Research Centre to 2030, with an additional €2.5 million commitment. The partnership supports research into SAF, zero-carbon propulsion, and non-CO₂ emissions.

During the year, Ryanair retained ESG ratings of A from MSCI, A- from CDP, and continued to rank first among global large-cap airlines by Sustainalytics. In addition, its near-term emissions reduction targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and are classified as being in line with a 1.5ºC trajectory.

Pathway to Net Zero

Looking ahead, Ryanair noted that its board has ultimate oversight and responsibility over its climate transition plan, adding that its Pathway to Net Zero strategy remains a pillar of its overall strategy.

‘The Group recognises that transition risk costs will arise,’ it added. ‘The Group has a strong history in maintaining a young, fuel-efficient fleet. Any breakthrough in new technology engines will be procured as part of ongoing fleet renewal and is not expected to be outside the normal course of fleet renewal.

‘Additionally, while SAFs currently trade at a premium of 3x – 4x compared to the cost of normal jet kerosene, the long-term outlook is for price convergence.’

Elsewhere, in terms of safety, Ryanair launched a new five-year Safety Strategy in December of last year, focusing on managing growth across the Group’s airlines, integrating the Boeing 737 MAX-10 into operations, and aligning with new EU cybersecurity regulations.

The fund has raised an initial $150 million through contributions from American, Alaska, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, IAG and Singapore Airlines.

American and Alaska describe themselves on 17 September as “cornerstone investors” and new partners with Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a fund founded by Bill Gates and other billionaires in 2016 to support less-pollutive energy technologies.

The fund will support next-generation SAF production, as well as growth of “alternative fuel markets” and supply chains to meet the airline sector’s projected long-term demand, according to the Oneworld carriers.

American chief executive Robert Isom says that establishing the SAF fund with Breakthrough Energy Ventures is a “business decision”, framing the adoption of alternative fuels as a route to cutting operational costs and reaching larger scale.

”We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come,” Isom says.

Ben Minicucci, Alaska’s CEO, says that Breakthrough Energy Ventures will provide “scientific, technical and commercial expertise” to make strategic decisions that will “create the market for next-generation fuels”.

The fund will seek to support early-growth companies that could potentially discover more-efficient and cost-effective SAF production methods, and help those companies deliver scalable products.

An array of start-ups are exploring innovative production pathways, such as making SAF from used cooking oils and municipal waste.

Current SAF technology has so far yielded lacklustre industry uptake, with such fuel making up a tiny fraction of global jet fuel burn. Industry consensus is that SAF remains expensive and in short supply, with global airline executives expressing desire for greater access to it.

SAF also comes along with land-use concerns, especially if feedstock such as corn is used as jet fuel rather than feeding populations. Highly touted climate benefits are also questionable, as it burns cleaner than conventional jet fuel but still releases carbon dioxide into Earth’s upper atmosphere.

But with Airbus and Boeing unlikely to launch more-efficient, next-generation commercial aircraft platforms before the mid-2030s, SAF remains the airline sector’s most immediate hope for curbing air pollution.

Notably, Alaska Air Group has a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the industry-wide target of 2050.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/6/6/2/112662_shutterstock_1439488982_576586.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 16:56:10.907936

Delta’s Sustainability Push According to Delta, Maeve is the airline’s fifth “revolutionary fleet” partner helping it study new airframes, fuel reduction strategies, and alternative fuels such as SAF.
The system is being optimized for regional aircraft, “though the vision extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline,” Delta said.","In a bid to reduce fuel consumption, Delta Air Lines is supporting the development of a hybrid-electric regional airliner.

The airline—which, like much of the aviation industry, aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050—on Wednesday revealed it partnered with Dutch developer Maeve Aerospace to help make the company’s Maeve Jet 500 commercially viable for regional missions. Maeve claims the design will reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 40 percent using conventional fuel. Those savings could be even higher, up to 95 percent, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

In a news release, Delta described the hybrid-electric concept as a “first-of-its-kind interpretation of a regional aircraft that brings the economics and comfort of a narrowbody aircraft to short-haul operations.”

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the bold, forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta,” said Kristen Bojko, Delta’s vice president of fleet.

The exclusive partnership with Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab cements the carrier as Maeve’s North American global airline partner. It comes just days after SkyWest, one of its regional affiliates, took an equity stake in Maeve in exchange for exclusive launch customer rights.

Delta also contracts with Republic Airways—which in June agreed to take delivery of Beta Technologies’ all-electric CX300—and is the sole owner of regional carrier Endeavor Air. Endeavor’s fleet comprises CRJ-700 and CRJ-900 aircraft from MHI RJ, which is also supporting the Maeve Jet’s development.

The Dutch company’s design approximates the CRJ-900, which can accommodate up to 90 passengers, cruise at Mach 0.82, and cover 1,550 nm. By comparison, the Maeve Jet is designed for up to 100 passengers, with a Mach 0.75 cruise speed and range of 1,450 nm with 76 passengers. At full capacity, its range declines to about 950 nm—still robust enough for trips between Chicago and Los Angeles.

The model uses a five-abreast seating configuration—atypical for a regional jet—that can be reconfigured for multiple classes. It is expected to consume about 5.5 gallons of fuel per seat on 500 nm trips. Compared to existing jets, Maeve says it will achieve 20 percent lower operating costs on those missions.

These capabilities are enabled by a few key features. Propulsion comes from a pair of rear fuselage-mounted hybrid-electric powerplants from Pratt & Whitney Canada. The engines are coupled with a swirl reduction system that enables a smaller rotor diameter and reduced cabin noise.

Moving the propulsion system to the tail allows Maeve to use a low-wing configuration. The wing itself features a high aspect ratio, which per Maeve significantly reduces fuel and is “optimised for short range missions and better take off field performance compared to current jets.”

Beyond Delta and SkyWest, the developer has an agreement with Japan Air Lines to further support the Maeve Jet’s development and study its operational requirements in Japan.

Delta’s Sustainability Push

According to Delta, Maeve is the airline’s fifth “revolutionary fleet” partner helping it study new airframes, fuel reduction strategies, and alternative fuels such as SAF.

In March, for example, it partnered with blended-wing body (BWB) aircraft developer JetZero to study a design it believes will be 50 percent more fuel efficient than existing midrange aircraft. Competitor United Airlines has also invested in JetZero and could order up to 200 BWB aircraft.

Delta is exploring electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi services in New York and Los Angeles in partnership with Joby Aviation. United and Southwest Airlines have similar partnerships with air taxi developer Archer Aviation.

The carrier works closely with manufacturing titans Airbus and Boeing. It has been a key partner in the former’s ZeroE hydrogen commercial aircraft project since 2022 and this year partnered with its UpNext innovation lab.

Airbus, in exchange, supports the Sustainable Skies Lab and is backing Delta’s Minnesota SAF hub. Delta is also part of the coalition supporting NASA and Boeing’s X-66 Sustainable Technology Demonstrator. Boeing in April proposed a simple, thin-wing design for the X-66, which was originally intended to feature a transonic truss-braced wing.

The Sustainable Skies Lab on Wednesday also partnered with Texas-based Green Taxi Solutions to develop taxiing technology for electric aircraft. The goal is to reduce fuel use, operating costs, taxi time, and emissions. The system is being optimized for regional aircraft, “though the vision extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline,” Delta said.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/maeve_hero.png,N,,2025-09-17 15:56:40.640570

Start with curiosity Curiosity begins with active listening.
When someone challenges our ideas, it’s easy to see it as a personal attack, which causes us to react emotionally to defend ourselves.
It’s hard to change opinions and win arguments if you’re not genuinely interested in finding a solution.
Curiosity can spark discussion when we aim to change opinions and win arguments.","Much of the FBI Academy training focused on immersing new agents, like myself, in controlled exercises where failure was expected. Our responses to these failures helped develop the mental skills necessary to recover when facing the unknown. During these exercises, we often lost critical resources that we relied on to succeed or reach our goals.

I learned to develop skills that would help me navigate through change and chaos. Leaders need these same skills because they face similar real-world challenges — the failure of established procedures or the emergence of innovative competitors that require leaders to be flexible and strategic.

Often, this requires re-examining long-held opinions about how to do business and interact with people. Mental agility isn’t just about being quick-minded — it’s about being able to pivot and stay resilient; in other words, to learn continuously about our environment. The best way to know more about our environment is to be curious.

Curiosity is crucial for changing opinions because it promotes open-minded exploration and reduces defensiveness. When we’re curious, we’re more willing to ask questions, seek new information and listen actively instead of judging or dismissing.

We live in a time where disagreements can feel like a battle for moral high ground. Curiosity is a vital tool that transforms a challenge from a threat into an opportunity for learning and growth. Curiosity allows us to adapt our behavior and change our strategy based on new feedback. It also helps us to make sound strategic decisions quickly in rapidly changing conditions.

1. Start with curiosity

Curiosity begins with active listening. In the book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen R. Covey emphasizes the importance of listening as a crucial skill when trying to influence others.

Genuinely listen to and acknowledge the other person’s perspective. Repeat what you believe they said. This prevents confusion and demonstrates that you understand their viewpoint, which can lower their defenses and create a more open environment. Test their arguments by asking questions, but not in a confrontational way. If you need to challenge each other, focus on a battle of ideas, not egos.

Approach the conversation with a calm mindset. Show vulnerability if needed — this actually makes you more relatable and softens the other person’s stance. Start by agreeing with something in their viewpoint, even if you don’t agree with the entire position. This fosters a sense of connection and makes them more receptive to new ideas. It’s not about backing down or sacrificing your stance. It’s about building enough trust for someone even to consider changing theirs.

Rather than arguing with them, ask thoughtful questions that encourage introspection and help them see inconsistencies or reconsider their stance over time.

My tip: Use the word “because” when giving reasons, as studies show people are more persuaded when a rationale is provided, even if it’s a simple one.

2. Use stories

People seldom respond only to facts. Beliefs are connected to identity, emotion and a need for internal harmony. We hold on to familiar viewpoints because they help us feel safe and connected to our communities. That’s why confrontation often fails: when someone feels judged, they stop listening.

Stories serve two purposes. First, they grab your audience’s attention and evoke empathy. When you need to connect emotionally and make your message relatable, stories help simplify complex ideas and build a connection with your audience.

Second, stories encourage people to become curious about your values and mindset. Use a story to engage your audience and help them understand the impact of your perspective.

To persuade others, you need to address their feelings, communicate your reasons clearly and demonstrate that you’re worth listening to.

My tip: Storytelling works best when it creates emotional engagement. But avoid using stories to hide facts you’re unsure of — this could backfire if the facts are scrutinized.

3. Stick to facts, not emotions

One of the biggest obstacles to reaching an agreement in arguments is letting our emotions take control. When someone challenges our ideas, it’s easy to see it as a personal attack, which causes us to react emotionally to defend ourselves. At the same time, our emotions can also block our judgment and make it harder to understand the other person’s perspective.

This is when it’s crucial to stick to facts because we tend to think that we know more about an issue than we actually do. The illusion of explanatory depth (IOED) is the belief that we understand more about the world than we actually do. It’s often not until someone asks us to explain a concept that we realize our limited understanding of it.

Ask the other person where they obtained their information so you can verify the accuracy of their opinion. Ask them to explain how the policy they were advocating would function. Then, ask them to trace, step by step, from start to finish, the causal path from the policy to the effects it was supposed to produce. People who are asked to provide explanations often soften their views because they are less certain in their support or opposition to the policy.

It’s hard to change opinions and win arguments if you’re not genuinely interested in finding a solution. Agree on what a successful resolution looks like, and stay focused on that goal. When you know your ideal outcome, you’re more likely to work toward finding the best answer.

My tip: Facts are most effective when the evidence is strong and the audience values logic and clarity.

Curiosity can spark discussion when we aim to change opinions and win arguments. This approach works best when we provide reasons alongside questions, share stories to foster emotional connection and rely on facts while asking others to explain their reasoning. It reveals gaps in understanding and helps soften rigid opinions.

With international travel rebounding post-pandemic and carbon emissions rising, the urgency to decarbonize has never been greater. At the 2023 ICAO Assembly, member states reached a landmark agreement to reduce aviation's carbon intensity by 5% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, primarily through the accelerated adoption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and other low-carbon technologiesICAO agrees a global framework and emissions goal[ 1 ]. This framework, known as CAAF/3, has transformed SAF from a niche innovation into a central pillar of the industry's energy transition. For investors, the implications are clear: the next decade will demand unprecedented investment in SAF infrastructure, policy alignment, and technological scaling.

The Global Framework and Its Investment Imperatives

The CAAF/3 agreement outlines four “building blocks” for decarbonization: policy and planning, regulatory frameworks, implementation support, and financingICAO CAAF/3 framework[ 2 ]. Central to this is the creation of the ICAO Finvest Hub, a platform designed to connect decarbonization projects with public and private capital, particularly for developing nationsICAO Finvest Hub[ 3 ]. This initiative underscores the recognition that SAF infrastructure cannot be built by market forces alone. Governments and multilateral institutions must bridge the gap between aspirational targets and tangible progress.

The urgency is further amplified by the stark mismatch between current SAF production and projected demand. According to the CleanBridge Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel 2025 report, only 22 SAF plants are operational globally, with a pipeline of 144 projects. Yet, as of June 2025, only seven of these projects have reached final investment decision (FID), and just one new project secured FID in the past six monthsOnly 1 In 20 SAF Projects Is Moving Forward Globally[ 4 ]. This glacial pace of development highlights the critical need for policy intervention and financial innovation.

Regional Hotspots and Strategic Investment Opportunities

The United States and the Middle East are emerging as pivotal regions for SAF infrastructure. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has catalyzed a wave of public-private partnerships. The Biden-Harris administration recently allocated $291 million in grants under the Fueling Aviation's Sustainable Transition (FAST) program, including $16.8 million to

Similarly, Infinium's Project Roadrunner in Texas, backed by $935 million in debt financing, aims to produce 23,000 tons of e-SAF annuallyUS scales up SAF with major developments[ 6 ]. These projects are part of a broader U.S. to leverage its 40% share of global biofuel production to dominate the SAF marketSupply and Development Pipeline GSAF2025[ 7 ].

The Middle East, meanwhile, is leveraging its solar energy abundance and low-cost feedstock to position itself as a global SAF hub.

However, progress remains uneven. While the UAE and Saudi Arabia have made strides, regulatory frameworks and domestic demand for SAF are still nascent, creating both risks and opportunities for investors willing to engage earlyGlobal aviation to cut 5% emissions by 2030 via SAF: ICAO[ 9 ].

Europe, though ahead in regulatory maturity, faces its own challenges. The ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates a 2% SAF blend by 2025, but existing production capacity is insufficient to meet this targetFunding and Investment Ecosystem GSAF2025 | CleanBridge[ 10 ]. Neste, the world's largest SAF producer, is expanding its facilities in Finland, but the continent's reliance on imported feedstock and the lack of harmonized cross-border infrastructure remain hurdlesNeste’s SAF production[ 11 ].

Financing the Transition: Mechanisms and Market Dynamics

The SAF investment ecosystem is increasingly diverse, blending public grants, private equity, and innovative financial instruments. In the U.S., the IRA's tax credits for SAF producers have attracted venture capital firms like Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which is backing advanced biofuel technologiesBreakthrough Energy Ventures and SAF[ 12 ]. Green bonds and sustainability-linked loans are also gaining traction, with projects like LanzaJet's Ethanol-to-Jet facility in Georgia illustrating how environmental performance metrics can attract capitalLanzaJet’s Ethanol-to-Jet facility[ 13 ].

However, the sector's reliance on subsidies raises questions about long-term viability. As noted by

, SAF demand is projected to outpace supply by 2030, necessitating strategic financing to close the gapWith SAF demand on track to outpace supply, strategic financing of new capacity can close the gap[ 14 ]. This is where the ICAO Finvest Hub and similar platforms could play a transformative role, particularly in developing economies where access to capital remains a barrierICAO Finvest Hub[ 15 ].

Challenges and the Path Forward

Despite the momentum, several challenges persist. First, the slow pace of project execution—only 5% of global SAF projects reaching FID—reflects the sector's dependence on policy certainty and feedstock availabilityOnly 1 In 20 SAF Projects Is Moving Forward Globally[ 16 ]. Second, airlines' demand for SAF far exceeds current production, creating a “chicken-and-egg” dilemma where producers hesitate to scale without guaranteed off-take agreementsSustainable Aviation Fuels Need a Faster Takeoff | BCG[ 17 ]. Third, the lack of standardized accounting systems for SAF credits complicates cross-border participation, particularly for smaller operatorsICAO CAAF/3 framework[ 18 ].

To overcome these hurdles, governments must accelerate regulatory clarity and expand incentives. For investors, the key lies in diversifying portfolios across regions and technologies. While bio-SAF remains the most commercially viable option today, e-SAF (synthetic fuels produced via green hydrogen) and waste-to-fuel technologies represent high-growth opportunities, albeit with higher capital intensitySAF Investment Trends - netzeroinsights.com[ 19 ].

Conclusion

The decarbonization of aviation is no longer a distant aspiration but an urgent imperative. The CAAF/3 framework has set the stage for a global transition, but its success hinges on the ability of investors, policymakers, and industry leaders to collaborate. For those willing to navigate the complexities of this nascent market, the rewards are substantial: not only in financial returns but in shaping a sustainable future for global mobility. As the sector moves from promise to practice, the next five years will determine whether aviation can truly take off into a cleaner era.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1758131281864.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-17 14:56:33.782507

ClimaHtech Green Flight, a wholly owned subsidiary of CATAGEN, will produce SAF using patented modular reactor technology powered by off-grid renewable and low-carbon electricity. This decentralised approach means production can continue even during grid disruptions, offering greater resilience and flexibility.

Unlike traditional SAF projects that rely on large centralised facilities, ClimaHtech’s modular production units are designed to be manufactured off-site and quickly deployed close to renewable energy sources or directly at airports. This allows fuel to be made where it’s needed most, with minimal infrastructure delays.

Each unit will use an industrial waste stream and renewable power to produce up to 1 million litres of SAF annually. The fuel offers a more than 90% reduction in emissions from production to flight, compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

As part of the launch, CATAGEN announced strategic partnerships with Ryanair and Shell Aviation, who have signed offtake agreements to support the production and use of this next-generation sustainable fuel.

Steven Fitzgerald, Ryanair director of sustainability & finance, explained: “Progressing towards our sustainability goals depends on securing scalable and affordable SAF.

""CATAGEN’s decentralised SAF model allows production to be brought closer to demand, enabling faster deployment and reducing the bottlenecks that slow down traditional SAF projects. We see this as a critical pathway to reducing our emissions while continuing to deliver affordable travel.”

Ken McHutcheon, supply & operations manager, Shell Aviation Ireland, continued: “Shell Aviation is committed to scaling sustainable aviation fuel, but the industry needs both volume and speed. CATAGEN’s decentralised, modular approach provides a new way of producing SAF that can complement centralised facilities, shorten timelines, and provide more flexible access to fuel. This model has the potential to reduce reliance on imported SAF, increase energy independence, unlock new markets and accelerate the industry’s journey to net zero.”

Mel Courtney, CEO ClimaHtech Green Flight, added: “The UK has a mandate to have 10% of flights using SAF by 2030, with the EU having a 70% target by 2050. On current supply, these targets are ambitious, with the International Air Transport Association currently estimating demand surpassing 360 million tonnes by 2050, up from 1 million tonnes that were available in 2024.

“To reach these targets, we need technologies that can be scaled up alongside the development of surrounding infrastructures around airports. In the UK, challenges around energy security have been made clear, hence the push from government to increase our use of renewables in the grid. Our approach to SAF should match this approach and be accessible to the market where it is needed to be deployed.

“The launch of ClimaHtech Green Flight is the next step in our plan to decarbonise the aviation industry.”

CATAGEN was the first company to submit a SAF sample to the EU SAF Clearing House in 2024 and is progressing through fast-track certification on the ASTM D7566 Annex A1 approved pathway. The company’s pre-production units, supported by the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, are already operational.

CATAGEN’s first-of-a-kind (FOAK) SAF production system will reach commercial operation in a short time horizon, producing 1 million litres of SAF per year. With these offtake partnerships in place, CATAGEN is now positioned to scale a network of decentralised production units worldwide, offering production sites up to 10 million litres.","https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmM4OGM4MjFkLTY3NzYtNGQ2NS05NjAyLWE3MDUzYjQwMGQyMzpjMmE4NjgyOS1iZTM4LTRjNDQtYjM2OC1mOTIwMTQzNTI0YWU=.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=",N,,2025-09-17 13:56:14.825241

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has called on governments to use the 42nd Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which begins in Montreal on 23 September, to deliver concrete support for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and to safeguard the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as the industry’s agreed global climate framework.

IATA said ICAO has accepted 14 working papers from the airline association for the Assembly, which will set the organisation’s work programme for the next three years. While the submissions cover a wide range of safety, regulatory, and operational topics, IATA made clear that accelerating decarbonization is its overriding priority.

Walsh: “SAF is absolutely critical” to net zero targets

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, expressed urgency in addressing the SAF cost and supply gap during a press briefing ahead of the Assembly.

“SAF is absolutely critical to the industry achieving its net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050,” he said “We’re disappointed at the progress made in relation to production. It’s not where we need it to be … the problem, as we see it, is one of supply and not one of demand.”

IATA warned that current SAF mandates in the EU and UK have raised costs without significantly increasing production, and urged states to instead support the creation of a functioning SAF market through direct incentives for fuel producers and timely policy interventions to remove market anomalies.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP Sustainability and Chief Economist, said policy support is vital to close the return-on-investment gap between renewable and fossil energy.

“This is not a shortfall of demand — there’s a shortfall of expected returns in renewable energy… oil companies might earn 20% returns, renewable energy might earn 5%. We need policymakers to help us bridge that 15-point gap,” she said.

Owens Thomsen noted that under the US Inflation Reduction Act, some SAF projects have reached profit margins above 20%, showing that “it’s entirely possible if the right policies are in place.”

Reaffirming CORSIA’s role in a sustainable future for aviation

IATA is also pressing governments to recommit to CORSIA as the sole global economic measure to manage aviation’s carbon emissions. The scheme, adopted at ICAO’s 39th Assembly in 2016, could generate up to $17 billion in climate finance by 2035—but its credibility is being undermined, IATA warned, by the spread of overlapping national and regional aviation taxes.

“CORSIA was a fantastic achievement, but we need to see that agreement turned into practice,” Walsh said. “As of today, only one country, Guyana, has made available to the industry what we call CORSIA Eligible Units… these are critical to enable the industry to fulfil its obligations.”

Owens Thomsen emphasised that these certified offset units are “the gold standard” in carbon markets and deliver socio-economic co-benefits in developing countries, but that states are slow to release them due to administrative burdens and competing claims under the Paris Agreement.

“States have optionality, but airlines have an obligation to buy them,” she said. “That is very problematic.”

Other IATA priorities for the ICAO Assembly

Beyond SAF and CORSIA, IATA is also pushing for progress on several other regulatory and safety priorities, including:

Airline Taxation: urging states to reject a proposed shift to source-based corporate taxation under the UN’s Model Tax Treaty, which IATA argues could create significant administrative burdens and risk double taxation

Consumer Protection: calling for alignment with ICAO’s Core Principles to avoid what IATA describes as a growing patchwork of national passenger rights rules

Radio Spectrum: protecting aviation-critical frequencies, such as the 4.2–4.4 GHz band for radio altimeters, from 5G/6G interference

Accident Investigations: ensuring timely publication of final reports under ICAO Annex 13 (only 57% of 2018–2023 accidents currently have public final reports)

GNSS Interference: coordinating military and civil authorities to mitigate rising jamming and spoofing incidents

Aircraft Mandates: creating a mechanism to set realistic implementation timelines for ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs)

Pilot Age Limits: raising the retirement age for multi-pilot international operations from 65 to 67, while maintaining safety safeguards

Walsh said the Montreal meeting is a pivotal opportunity to align governments on common global standards.

“Everybody wants flying to be safe, efficient and more sustainable,” he said. “The coming weeks in Montreal are essential to set the agenda, but even more important is the following three years of work to achieve what is agreed.”",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/United-SAF-subsidy-sustainable-aviation-fuel.jpeg,N,,2025-09-17 13:56:19.370320

The mandate was officially enforced on 1 January 2025, and requires fuel suppliers to ensure a minimum of 2% of their jet fuel is sustainable. This will rise to 22% by 2040 in an effort to reduce harmful emissions released into the atmosphere.

Initially introduced by the Conservative administration in 2022; the Labour government reaffirmed the previous party’s commitment to the mandate upon its coming to power in 2024, introducing its own Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM), which aims to reduce the risks of transitioning to SAF production for new companies.

As we reach the latter end of 2025, the question now is: how far has the industry come during the first nine months of the mandate?

Independent Efforts

With the mandate now fully in place, the first nine months of 2025 have seen a number of new initiatives launched by the UK government, as well as a few solutions offered by airports and bodies themselves.

In January, London Stansted Airport, in collaboration with Cambridge Cleantech, announced that it would begin exploring opportunities for its own production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the East of England.

Announced at a roundtable event attended by speakers from a range of organisations including Jet2, SSE, LanzaTech and Innovate UK; Stansted’s efforts to produce its own SAF would leverage the East of England’s existing infrastructure, with the region forecasted to contribute 10.2 billion GBP in economic value and create over 60,000 green jobs by 2050.

March saw Farnborough Airport (FAB) announce intentions to produce & provide roughly 10,000 tonnes of SAF from local waste sources each year, 12.5 million litres per annum.

One of the world’s first airports to offer SAF for a price equivalent to that of Jet A1 fuel in 2022; FAB intends to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products either sourced locally or from larger landfill sites, instead of using waste cooking oil or hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA).

Elsewhere, The International Air Transport Association (IATA) launched its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matchmaker platform, which aims to facilitate SAF procurement between both airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with appropriate offers.

The platform seeks to develop long-term relationships and partnerships between airlines and producers by connecting the two parties via a dedicated source and without unnecessary fees.

Government Initiatives

In May the Government set out brand-new measures to accelerate the support of SAF, pledging an additional 400,000 GBP in funding to accelerate both its production and delivery to market, as well as the introduction of the aforementioned RCM scheme.

In July, Aviation Minister Mike Kane named 17 companies to share 63 million GBP to scale UK SAF production under the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), which has to date pledged 198 million GBP for the scaling of cleaner aviation technologies across the country.

Companies receiving the funding include OXCCU Tech, which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport as well as LanzaJet, which is set to build a commercial-scale plant in Teesside.

With other countries such as Budapest and the United States undergoing final preparations to begin utilising sustainable aviation fuel, it’s clear to see that the UK is making steady strides toward the full adoption of SAF across the country – with airports and independent bodies leading the charge.

“I have a son with asthma,” said National City resident Marguerita Moreno in public comments at Monday’s meeting.
Ethanol is one of the fuels that would be delivered at the proposed National City transfer station.
Alvarez spokesperson Chris Jonsmyr said Alvarez had not taken a position on the fuel transfer station.
“The [planning] commissioners did the right thing.” “I’m happy,” said National City resident Carmen Arroyo.","The National City Planning Commission on Monday voted 4-1 to reject a controversial fuel depot on the city’s west side that would have brought a steady stream of oil tanker rail cars and big rig trucks to an industrial neighborhood abutting homes, churches and an elementary school.

Before a packed and vocal audience of residents, environmental activists and community leaders, planning commissioners said the proposal to build a biofuels transfer station on derelict railroad property less than a mile from City Hall would endanger residents’ health and perpetuate what they called a “cycle” of unwise development decisions in the city.

“National City is not a dumping ground,” said Planning Commissioner Randi Castle-Salgado after casting a no vote on the project. “This is part of the environmental racism here…We can’t stand for this anymore.”

The Planning Commission’s rejection of the project came despite vocal support from a local construction workers union, which said the transfer station would bring badly needed jobs to an economically struggling city.

Debate over the project highlighted a widening divide both in San Diego and throughout California between proponents of economic development and environmental advocates who say California’s longstanding commitment to environmental causes is weakening.

For more than two years, Texas-based energy and logistics company USD Clean Fuels has sought to build a 7.5-acre fuel depot in National City that would transfer ethanol and other biologically derived fuels from long-haul rail cars to big rig trucks for local delivery.

Company representatives said at Monday’s Planning Commission meeting that, though the transfer station would service up to 72 delivery trucks per day around the clock, it actually would reduce overall truck traffic in the San Diego region by making it possible to bring biofuels to the region by rail.

Currently, biofuels, including ethanol, biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel, are refined in the Los Angeles-area and brought to San Diego by truck. USD representatives said the transfer station would eliminate long-haul truck trips by shifting biofuels to more environmentally friendly trains.

USD Chief Administrative Officer Bill Frerking said Monday that the project was “for the benefit of the environment in National City and the greater San Diego area” because it would reduce overall diesel emissions and make it easier for local consumers to use biofuels.

“Cleaner air is associated with cleaner fuels,” he said.

Opponents of the project vehemently disagreed.

“I have a son with asthma,” said National City resident Marguerita Moreno in public comments at Monday’s meeting. “Our health is more important than money.”

“We are low income and that’s why you’re trying to take advantage of us,” said resident Marguerita Garcia to USD representatives.

Frerking and other USD representatives at Monday’s meeting declined to comment on the Planning Commission vote.

In a statement emailed Tuesday, a company spokesperson said, “We appreciated the opportunity to present to the commissioners and hear their comments and questions about the project, as well as the community comments. USD Clean Fuels will continue to follow all applicable state and local processes as it evaluates next steps for the project. We remain committed to making a positive contribution to the National City community by working with our customers, regulators, and prospective neighbors to find a path forward that advances the goals of cleaner air through eliminating millions of truck miles delivering those fuels today.”

If USD appeals the Planning Commission rejection, National City Councilmembers will take up the proposal at a future meeting, likely next month. Councilmembers could vote to ratify the Commission’s decision or overturn it and allow the project to move forward.

Debate over the project on Monday highlighted shifting terrain in California’s longstanding tug-of-war between economic development and environmental advocacy.

At a time when costs in the state are rising and working-class voters, including in South San Diego County, are reevaluating their political loyalties, projects like the National City transfer station that might once have been uniformly opposed now draw a less predictable mix of allies and opponents.

In the audience at Monday’s meeting were roughly a dozen unionized construction workers holding signs supporting the project, which they said would bring unionized jobs to National City and lower consumer costs by making fuel transportation more efficient.

“Our members are highly skilled, well trained and ready to deliver the quality construction this project requires,” said Kelvin Barrios, director of governmental affairs for Local 89 of the Laborers’ International Union of North America. “This means good-paying local jobs, while also contributing to cleaner fuels and cleaner air for our local families and communities.”

Barrios said USD had agreed to hire only construction companies that employ union workers.

The Planning Commision vote on the fuel depot came as state lawmakers in Sacramento capped a contentious legislative session that tempered or even reversed parts of California’s long pro-environment track record.

Lawmakers, including Democrats from San Diego County, approved rolling back parts of California’s landmark Environmental Quality Act, made it easier to drill for oil in parts of the San Joaquin Valley and loosened restrictions on high-density housing construction near transit centers.

One of the bills approved by legislators was authored by South San Diego County Assemblymember David Alvarez, whose district includes National City. Alvarez’s bill, now awaiting a signature from Gov. Gavin Newsom, would increase the amount of ethanol allowed in California gasoline.

Ethanol is one of the fuels that would be delivered at the proposed National City transfer station.

Alvarez spokesperson Chris Jonsmyr said Alvarez had not taken a position on the fuel transfer station. “This is for local experts and the community to decide,” Jonsmyr said.

Environmentalists and residents on Monday celebrated the Planning Commission vote.

“The community has made it loud and clear they do not want this dangerous project in their neighborhood poisoning the lungs of their children,” said Jose Franco Garcia, executive director of Environmental Health Coalition, a local environmental group that worked to rally opposition to the transfer station. “The [planning] commissioners did the right thing.”

“I’m happy,” said National City resident Carmen Arroyo. “The people [on the Planning Commission] helped us and heard us…We are having no more of these kinds of projects in National City.”",https://voiceofsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/vito-di-stefano-9-17-24-9.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:56:19.288561

– Ms. Lee Wen Fen, chief sustainability officer, Singapore Airlines

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. Airlines and manufacturers continue to invest in modern aircraft, engines and operational efficiencies. Demand for air travel is expected to rise in the coming decades, and SAF, which today can reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is a crucial tool for mitigating the industry’s environmental impact. While SAF can significantly decrease the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft engines, the first-generation SAF in production today has come with challenges. The SAF industry has not yet attracted the investment required to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, and lifecycle environmental impact is a concern. oneworld and its partners are focused on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

Delta’s regional focus extends to partnership with Green Taxi to explore electric taxiing solution

Delta is also partnering with Green Taxi Aerospace through its Sustainable Skies Lab to develop electric aircraft taxiing technology that aims to reduce fuel use, operating costs, taxi time and carbon emissions. Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab is contributing decades of airline operating experience to help Green Taxi optimize its electric taxiing system at airports for regional aircraft, though the vision extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline. The Green Taxi partnership is another example of Delta’s approach to impact what it can control today while innovating future technologies like scaling sustainable aviation fuel and revolutionary fleet development.",https://news.delta.com/sites/default/files/styles/twitter_share_1200/public/2025-09/maeve_hero.png?itok=KXjiOB8d,N,,2025-09-17 10:56:46.221418

oneworld BEV Fund aims to identify, enable and scale lower carbon jet fuel of the future to support consumer demand, economic development, jobs and technology innovation

FORT WORTH, Texas — oneworld Alliance and member airlines, in partnership with Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), today announced the launch of a new investment fund designed to address the limited availability and high cost of today’s Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). The fund, led by cornerstone investors American Airlines and Alaska Airlines, seeks to accelerate the global development of long-term aviation fuel solutions that are cost effective, scalable and have lower emissions than conventional fuels.

The oneworld® BEV Fund will:

Invest in novel, next-generation Sustainable Aviation Fuel technologies.

Support the growth of alternative fuel markets to meet the long-term needs of the global aviation industry.

Create economic value for investors and regions around the world.

Drive technology innovation.

Develop a diverse and resilient SAF supply chain to meet future demand.

“By investing in the SAF technologies of the future, American and our oneworld partners are making a business decision to accelerate the development of novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices than current technologies can achieve,” said Robert Isom, American Airlines CEO and chairman of oneworld. “We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.”

“Alaska Airlines is excited to work alongside oneworld carriers to invest in innovative and cost-competitive SAF technology to drive the long-term energy transformation for our industry,” said Ben Minicucci, chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group. “In Breakthrough Energy Ventures, we have a partner with the scientific, technical and commercial expertise to make effective investment decisions that will create the market for next-generation fuels and power our industry in the years ahead.”

“Investing in SAF with Breakthrough Energy Ventures is part of oneworld’s strategy to create a future of aviation that solves problems at scale and serves the needs of the greater aviation community,” said Nat Pieper, chief executive officer of oneworld. ""At oneworld, our member airlines are united in their long-term mission to address carbon emissions and invest in technologies that can improve speed to market of innovative fuels across the globe. By working together, we’ll be better positioned to create long-term solutions for the energy transformation of an industry that is vital to global economic growth.”

oneworld BEV Fund aims to identify, enable and scale lower carbon jet fuel of the future to support consumer demand, economic development, jobs and technology innovation

DALLAS/FORT WORTH, Texas, Sept. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- oneworld alliance and member airlines, in partnership with Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), today announced the launch of a new investment fund designed to address the limited availability and high cost of today's Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). The fund, led by cornerstone investors Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, seeks to accelerate the global development of long-term aviation fuel solutions that are cost effective, scalable, and have lower emissions than conventional fuels.

The oneworld BEV Fund will:

invest in novel, next-generation Sustainable Aviation Fuel technologies

support the growth of alternative fuel markets to meet the long-term needs of the global aviation industry

create economic value for investors and regions around the world

drive technology innovation

develop a diverse and resilient SAF supply chain to meet future demand

""By investing in the SAF technologies of the future, American and our oneworld partners are making a business decision to accelerate the development of novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices than current technologies can achieve,"" said Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines and chairman of oneworld. ""We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.""

""Alaska Airlines is excited to work alongside oneworld carriers to invest in innovative and cost-competitive SAF technology to drive the long-term energy transformation for our industry,"" said Ben Minicucci, chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group. ""In Breakthrough Energy Ventures, we have a partner with the scientific, technical and commercial expertise to make effective investment decisions that will create the market for next-generation fuels and power our industry in the years ahead.""

""Investing in SAF with Breakthrough Energy Ventures is part of oneworld's strategy to create a future of aviation that solves problems at scale and serves the needs of the greater aviation community,"" said Nat Pieper, chief executive officer of oneworld. ""At oneworld, our member airlines are united in their long-term mission to address carbon emissions and invest in technologies that can improve speed to market of innovative fuels across the globe. By working together, we'll be better positioned to create long-term solutions for the energy transformation of an industry that is vital to global economic growth.""

BEV, Breakthrough Energy Venture's capital fund founded by Bill Gates, will serve as the fund's investment manager, bringing deep technical expertise, a rigorous diligence model, and extensive experience supporting the growth of early-stage climate technology companies. By leveraging its resources to support the energy transformation of one of the most challenging sectors for climate mitigation, BEV aims to advance fuel technologies that offer the greatest potential for tackling the sector's emissions and securing long-term commercial success.

""Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to addressing the sector's environmental impact and represents a major commercial opportunity,"" said Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy and managing partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. ""The oneworld BEV Fund is built to identify and scale breakthrough SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions for jet fuel, compete with fossil-based fuels on cost, and integrate seamlessly with today's aviation infrastructure. These are complex systems-level challenges that will take time to solve, and the fund is built with the long-term vision and staying power to help bring solutions to market.""

The fund is also supported by oneworld alliance member airlines International Airlines Group (IAG), Cathay Pacific, and Japan Airlines. Recognizing the power of collective action, oneworld and Breakthrough Energy Ventures made an early decision to welcome non-alliance investors, including Singapore Airlines, which shares the alliance's commitment to accelerating industry-wide progress in SAF.

""Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the most viable pathway for the aviation industry to progress to reach net zero. With our oneworld partners we have actively supported collective efforts on sustainability and today's announcement further highlights the potential of collaboration, demonstrating how leading airlines can come together with the goal to accelerate action. To unlock SAF's full potential, we are calling for supportive policy frameworks that help attract investment and enable the infrastructure needed to kickstart production.""

- Mr. Luis Gallego, chief executive officer, IAG

""As an airline with significant long-haul operations, scaling innovation to make SAF more accessible and cost-competitive is critical to Cathay Pacific's future. This investment reflects our belief that only through collective action – across geographies and industries – can we build a resilient and scalable SAF ecosystem that delivers meaningful environmental progress and supports the future of our industry. And with Asia continuing to play a pivotal role in the global SAF ecosystem, we're proud to help lead this momentum from the region.""

- Mr. Ronald Lam, chief executive officer, Cathay Group

""Relationships and connections with countries and regions around the world through air transportation are necessary for an island nation like Japan, thus we believe we have a mission to tackle the environmental impact of air transportation. Working towards this common mission for oneworld, we look forward to promoting technology and the use of SAF together with the member airlines, anticipating expansion into the Asian region in the future.""

- Ms. TOTTORI Mitsuko, president and representative director, Group CEO, Japan Airlines

""Our investment in this fund demonstrates Singapore Airlines' strong support for developing and commercialising next generation Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Reducing the carbon emissions of jet fuel demands collective action across the entire aviation ecosystem, and such initiatives will drive innovation towards meaningful progress in this crucial energy transformation.""

- Ms. Lee Wen Fen, chief sustainability officer, Singapore Airlines

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. Airlines and manufacturers continue to invest in modern aircraft, engines and operational efficiencies. Demand for air travel is expected to rise in the coming decades, and SAF, which today can reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is a crucial tool for mitigating the industry's environmental impact. While SAF can significantly decrease the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft engines, the first-generation SAF in production today has come with challenges. The SAF industry has not yet attracted the investment required to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, and lifecycle environmental impact is a concern. oneworld and its partners are focused on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

The CFRs stipulate that commercial fuel producers (gasoline, diesel fuel) must use a certain share of ""biofuels""---that is, ethanol, bio-diesel or similar non-fossil-fuel derived energetic chemicals in their final fuel product.
According to a 2023 report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, ""the cost to lower income households represents a larger share of their disposable income compared to higher income households.
The CFRs were also---in theory---designed to stimulate Canada's lower-carbon fuel industry to satisfy domestic demand by fuel producers.
Instead, these producers are now looking to U.S. imports to comply with the CFRs, while Canadian lower-carbon fuel producers languish and fade away.","To state the obvious, poorly-devised government policies can not only fail to provide benefits but can actually do more harm than good.

For example, the federal government's so-called ""Clean Fuel Regulations"" (or CFRs) meant to promote the use of low-carbon emitting ""biofuels"" produced in Canada. The CFRs, which were enacted by the Trudeau government, went into effect in July 2023. The result? Higher domestic biofuel prices and increased dependence on the importation of biofuels from the United States.

Here's how it works. The CFRs stipulate that commercial fuel producers (gasoline, diesel fuel) must use a certain share of ""biofuels""---that is, ethanol, bio-diesel or similar non-fossil-fuel derived energetic chemicals in their final fuel product. Unfortunately, Canada's biofuel producers are having trouble meeting this demand. According to a recent report, ""Canada's low carbon fuel industry is struggling,"" which has led to an ""influx of low-cost imports"" into Canada, undermining the viability of domestic biofuel producers. As a result, ""many biofuels projects---mostly renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel---have been paused or cancelled.""

Adding insult to injury, the CFRs are also economically costly to consumers. According to a 2023 report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, ""the cost to lower income households represents a larger share of their disposable income compared to higher income households. At the national level, in 2030, the cost of the Clean Fuel Regulations to households ranges from 0.62 per cent of disposable income (or $231) for lower income households to 0.35 per cent of disposable income (or $1,008) for higher income households.""

Moreover, ""Relative to disposable income, the cost of the Clean Fuel Regulations to the average household in 2030 is the highest in Saskatchewan (0.87 per cent, or $1,117), Alberta (0.80 per cent, or $1,157) and Newfoundland and Labrador (0.80 per cent, or $850), reflecting the higher fossil fuel intensity of their economies. Meanwhile, relative to disposable income, the cost of the Clean Fuel Regulations to the average household in 2030 is the lowest in British Columbia (0.28 per cent, or $384).""

So, let's review. A government mandate for the use of lower-carbon fuels has not only hurt fuel consumers, it has perversely driven sourcing of said lower-carbon fuels away from Canadian producers to lower-cost higher-volume U.S. producers. All this to the deficit of the Canadian economy, and the benefit of the American economy. That's two perverse impacts in one piece of legislation.

Remember, the intended beneficiaries of most climate policies are usually portrayed as lower-income folks who will purportedly suffer the most from future climate change. The CFRs whack these people the hardest in their already-strained wallets. The CFRs were also---in theory---designed to stimulate Canada's lower-carbon fuel industry to satisfy domestic demand by fuel producers. Instead, these producers are now looking to U.S. imports to comply with the CFRs, while Canadian lower-carbon fuel producers languish and fade away.

Poorly-devised government policies can do more harm than good. Clearly, Prime Minister Carney and his government should scrap these wrongheaded regulations and let gasoline and diesel producers produce fuel---responsibly, but as cheaply as possible---to meet market demand, for the benefit of Canadians and their families. A radical concept, I know.",https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2025-09/couple-bills-1440-2210151871.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:56:36.387481

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. Airlines and manufacturers continue to invest in modern aircraft, engines and operational efficiencies. Demand for air travel is expected to rise in the coming decades, and SAF, which today can reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is a crucial tool for mitigating the industry's environmental impact. While SAF can significantly decrease the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft engines, the first-generation SAF in production today has come with challenges. The SAF industry has not yet attracted the investment required to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, and lifecycle environmental impact is a concern. oneworld and its partners are focused on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

The funding package is designed to spur private investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel, positioning Australia to become a major player in the global biofuels market.

“Australia has an enviable opportunity to produce cleaner and low-carbon liquid fuels for jets, vessels, construction machines, and heavy trucks to achieve net zero,” the government said in a statement, citing the nation’s advanced farming techniques and access to affordable renewable energy.

Finance Minister Jim Chalmers described the initiative as a down payment on a “completely new industry in Australia.” He added: “It’s about making Australians, and our economy, big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation.”

Australia, already one of the world’s largest producers of biofuel feedstocks such as sugarcane, canola, and sorghum, exports much of its production while importing the bulk of its gasoline. Canola, in particular, has become a critical feedstock for Europe’s biodiesel industry.

Farmers have long lobbied for government backing, arguing that without support, a domestic biofuels industry would struggle to take off.

“This isn’t just about cleaner fuels,” said Su McCluskey, interim CEO of the National Farmers’ Federation. “It’s also about creating jobs and diversifying farm businesses.”

The government’s commitment comes as global demand for sustainable fuels accelerates, driven by both climate targets and efforts by industries such as aviation and shipping to cut emissions.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/nxjj3srn/alternative-energy-with-bio-technology-2025-01-09-17-51-03-utc.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134025643206830000,N,,2025-09-17 07:56:32.209857

“Airlines that act early will gain access to scalable, compliant volumes of SAF—ensuring not just regulatory alignment, but a pathway to net zero.”","Houston: As European aviation leaders push for urgent progress towards net-zero targets, U.S.-based Syzygy Plasmonics has released its NovaSAF™ Pricing Framework, showing that its manure-based biogas-to-SAF pathway can meet both EU sustainability mandates and airline price expectations, reports PR Newswire.

Independent assessor Peterson Solutions has confirmed that the company’s NovaSAF1 facility is on track to receive dual ISCC EU certification for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO). The recognition underscores the company’s innovative approach of combining manure-derived biogas with renewable electricity.

“We’re proving that SAF can meet the toughest sustainability standards while reaching cost levels that make sense for airlines,” said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. “Our goal is to make sustainable flight the new standard, not the exception.”

Traditionally, airlines have struggled with SAF scarcity and high costs. Syzygy’s model leverages modular hub-and-spoke production, where smaller facilities convert biogas into Fischer-Tropsch crude, which is then refined into SAF at centralized hubs. The company argues that the economics are viable at capacities of around 100,000 tonnes per year—scales large enough to be impactful, yet achievable.

According to the NovaSAF Pricing Framework, advanced bio-SAF could be produced in Europe at around $1,800 per tonne, with e-SAF at $3,000 per tonne. In the U.S., federal incentives could bring effective SAF pricing down to parity with fossil jet fuel, with credits adding $5–8 per gallon in value.

Syzygy is now seeking structured offtake agreements with airlines, as regulatory and ESG deadlines approach. “This is the moment to secure your future fuel supply,” Best said. “Airlines that act early will gain access to scalable, compliant volumes of SAF—ensuring not just regulatory alignment, but a pathway to net zero.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-09-17 07:56:49.052728

September 2025 brought yet another announcement about Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the Tees Valley. This time it was a big one. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen flew to Saudi Arabia to announce, among other things, that Alfanar would be investing £2bn in a SAF project at Seal Sands in Billingham. That’s an impressive number. Or at least it will be if it ever gets off the drawing board.

Fake Sheikh

Some cynics might argue that Houchen flew to the middle east to draw attention from the fact that he’s been caught in a lie over another Saudi Arabian firm, Sabic. After the closure of the Olefins 6 cracker at Wilton, he’d reassured Teesside that “We’re working directly with Sabic at the moment on trying to help them around employee support”, when he’d done no such thing.

Tell me another

But when it comes to Alfanar’s Lighthouse Green Fuel (LGF) project, Teessiders will feel that they’ve heard this story before. And they have, several times. It was first announced more than four years ago. This was in August 2021, as a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Alfanar and BP. A few months later, in March 2022, Ben Houchen announced that Alfanar would be investing a mere £1bn in the project, creating 700 jobs.

Think of a number, then double it

This time round, Houchen claims that Alfanar has doubled the investment at LGF to £2bn and more than doubled the number of promised jobs to 2,000. You can read more here. And, as is common with these hyperbolic press statements, Ben Houchen was careful not to announce a timescale.

Getting on with the job?

In June 2022, Alfanar gave an impression that LGF was underway, and would be producing SAF by 2027. Not only that, it promised to build another two SAF plants.

Fast forward to May 2024, and Alfanar was holding a public consultation. This time they increased the total of promised jobs at LGF from 700 to 840. But they didn’t inflate the investment amount this time, sticking with £1bn.

There is a magic money tree after all?

So, zero SAF from the company to date, and for the foreseeable future. But, it has refined its method of extracting public funding. In December 2021, Alfanar achieved a £2.4mn win in the “Green Fuels, Green Skies” competition organised by the Department for Transport (DfT). Less than a year later it was given a grant of £11mn from the DfT’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF). This was followed by a further £8.7mn in November 2023 and, finally, £8mn in July 2025 from the same funding pot.

But wait, there’s more

LGF is just one of six SAF projects that has been announced for Teesside over the past four years. And, despite the almost ceaseless flurry of press releases and photo opportunities since then, they haven’t produced a single drop of SAF between them. So, what is stalling these projects? Here’s a guide to the proposals, and the companies behind them:

Abundia

Texas-based Abundia e-fuels, also known as Jet – AB2L, intends to produce SAF from sawmill and forestry residues. However, there are serious doubts about the sustainability of this feedstock. Just as with Alfanar, Abundia has received grant funding from the AFF. It received £4.5mn in November 2023. The DfT re-announced this grant in July 2025. The DfT also predicted that Abundia’s SAF plant at Wilton International will go online in 2026.

Arcadia e-Fuels

Arcadia, another Texas-based firm, received £12.3mn in AFF funding in November 2023. But things have gone quiet since that grant was announced two years ago. And Arcadia has never stated exactly where it intends to build its Teesside SAF plant. The company intends to convert biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen into SAF. However, the green hydrogen won’t be available now due to the cancellation of BP’s HyGreen project. There’s an acute shortage of CO2 too. This scheme, also known as Project NABOO, is a long shot.

Nova Pangaea Technologies

Nova Pangaea’s plans are known as Project Speedbird, a nod to UK aviation history. The company is registered as LanzaJet UK Ltd. The sole director of this company is based in Illinois. Nova Pangaea built a demonstration SAF plant at Wilton International as long ago as February 2021. But, curiously, a July 2025 press release from the DfT states that the plant is still in development. In its 2023 announcement, the TVCA claimed that the plant was expected to be operational in 2025.

Hat Trick

Nova Pangaea has scored three times with the DfT. Firstly, £480,000 from the “Green Fuels, Green Skies” competition in December 2021, followed by AFF grants of £9mn in November 2023, and £10mn in July 2025. This is another project that intends to process woody residues. Sustainability isn’t guaranteed at Nova Pangaea if, indeed, it ever operates.

Willis Sustainable Fuels

Willis’ project is known as “Carbonshift Power-to-Liquid”. The company intends to build a plant at Dorman Point near Grangetown. The plan is to convert CO2 and green hydrogen into SAF. Again, the lack of available green hydrogen and CO2 must call the viability of this project into question. At the time that Willis received its AFF grant of £4.7mn in November 2023, it predicted an initial production start date of 2026. But a more recent press release has pushed this back to 2028.

SkyFuel Teesside

ETFuels’ project “SkyFuel Teesside” is a latecomer to the party. It’s yet another Texas-based company. However, the company website lists a registered address in Dublin, Ireland. It lists its Teesside project as being in “Redcar”, which probably means Wilton International. Yes, it’s another recipient of AFF cash, having received £5mn in July 2025. ETFuels intends to produce “methanol to jet” using biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen into SAF. A pattern is emerging here. Good luck sourcing the CO2 and the green hydrogen.

Keep on trucking

Something that the proponents of Teesside SAF never mention is the logistics of their operation. In terms of SAF plants using wood residues, this means hundreds of lorry journeys each week delivering feedstock. The finished SAF then has to be trucked to the nearest refinery for blending with fossil fuel. That’s in Immingham, 125 miles away. The blended aviation fuel will then be taken by lorry to airports throughout the country.

So what’s the national picture?

The DfT published an SAF Mandate in December 2024, which obliges “the supply of an increasing amount of SAF in the overall UK aviation fuel mix”. The mandate started in January 2025. SAF is expected to meet 2% of total UK jet fuel demand this year, “increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.”

Falling behind

But the industry is struggling to meet its first target, with SAF having only supplied 1.29% of the aviation fuel mix in the first half of this year. In some months, the supply of SAF is almost negligible. The table below has been produced from statistics released by the DfT on 14 August 2025. A link to the data can be found here.

Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket

According to the Royal Aeronautical Society, “as of early 2025, the UK only has one industrial-scale SAF refinery facility. Owned by Phillips 66 and located in Humberside since 2017, the facility produces fuel from sustainable waste feedstocks.” Will Teesside’s six SAF plants ride to the rescue?

Missed SAF targets – does it matter?

So, does it matter if the UK misses its SAF targets? Well, for anyone concerned about the devastating impact of aviation on climate change, it’s bad news. But, tackling climate change isn’t the point of SAF. Even if the SAF targets are met, they’ll be made irrelevant by the exponential growth of air travel.

Biodiversity loss, changing global market dynamics and rising inequality are affecting food systems all over the world, but especially in Asia.

Asia's agri-food future will depend on its food systems becoming less fragmented and fragile, and more inclusive, resilient and sustainable.

The networks of activities, organizations and infrastructure that bring food from the fields to our tables provide much more than nutrition, these food systems also secure the livelihoods of families and communities around the world.

In Asia, 40% of the workforce is employed in a food-related job, according to the Asian Development Bank. But food systems are becoming increasingly strained by biodiversity loss, changing global market dynamics and rising inequality.

Progress on developing more robust sustainable food systems to mitigate the effects of these issues in places like Asia depends on deep regional expertise and farmer-focused networks. Combined with global insights and multi-sector partnerships, this can catalyze innovative food system solutions and help them to scale.

Efforts to mobilize capital and technology, and to shape inclusive policies and standards, must reach millions of smallholders (farmers of less than 10 hectares, who often work with family members) to create measurable, lasting environmental, social and economic impact across Asia. Multi-stakeholder collaboration can play a crucial role in such efforts, becoming a transformative force for the future of food.

That’s why, 10 years ago, the World Economic Forum, in partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), launched Grow Asia. Its work addresses the pressing challenge of how to feed a growing population while ensuring food systems are inclusive, resilient and sustainable.

Since then, the Grow Asia network has become a vibrant ecosystem of more than 775 partners – governments, companies, civil society, academia and farmer organizations – all working together to create scalable solutions. Its supports five countries – Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam – and 44 value chains, providing more than 3.7 million smallholders and rural enterprises with technology, financial services and training. This has increased farm incomes by more than $81 million annually in selected agri-food value chains.

A strategic food system partnership

These results have been achieved by bringing together uncommon partners – investors, policy-makers, agri-food companies, philanthropies and producer organizations. The annual Grow Asia Investment Forum, for example, helps to unlock capital for sustainable and inclusive food systems by creating space for dialogue and forging new pathways for blended finance.

One of the key highlights at this year’s Grow Asia event will be the World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition (FMC) for Food. Launched at COP28, FMC for Food brings together more than 50 partner organizations with a combined $900 billion in annual revenues to use their collective purchasing power to de-risk the net-zero transition and scale resilient, low-emission food commodities.

This model has already unlocked opportunities in other industries, opening new markets for clean steel, sustainable aviation fuel and shipping. The coalition is now focusing on beef, dairy, rice and row crops – commodities that are critical for food security, farmer livelihoods and climate action.

Connecting global demand commitments with local innovation and farmer adoption will ensure that sustainable practices are not only piloted but scaled. By linking smallholder farmers to the markets, new capital and innovation will define the future of agriculture.

4 strategies to strengthen Asia’s food systems

The urgency of the climate crisis, shifting global markets and rising inequality means going further and faster to make food systems more robust and sustainable. The next decade will be critical in defining and leading transboundary efforts to build food systems that nourish people, empower farmers and protect the planet.

It will take a four-pronged approach to strengthen Asia's food systems during the decade ahead:

1. Expanding access to finance and markets for smallholders

Around 80% of Southeast Asia’s farmers are smallholders. But most remain excluded from formal financial systems. Unlocking $1 billion in sustainable funding by 2030 through blended finance, impact investment and inclusive business models, will give these farmers the resources and market connections to thrive. The GrowBeyond programme will accelerate this shift, advancing responsible investment aligned with regenerative agriculture.

2. Building sustainable supply chains and restoring soil health

Action on regenerative agriculture can help to improve soil health, restoring biodiversity, nutrient density and water retention. The GrowRight programme aims to enable millions of smallholder farmers to transition to regenerative practices, improving their livelihoods while meeting growing demand for sustainable sourcing and safeguarding Asia’s natural capital. Meanwhile, the GrowHer programmes will continue to ensure that women, who make up a significant share of Southeast Asia’s agricultural workforce, are empowered as equal participants in this transformation.

3. Driving digital transformation for inclusive agri-tech

Connecting the millions of smallholders in Southeast Asia to data-driven tools – from AI-powered advisory services to blockchain-enabled supply chain platforms – can help to reduce post-harvest losses, strengthen market access and ensure small farmers are not left behind in the digital economy. The GrowVentures programme is a catalyst for digital transformation, investing in initiatives that drive technological innovation and help to scale agri-food start-ups across the region.

4. Accelerating climate-resilient farming

Adaptive practices can help farmers withstand extreme weather, shifting rainfall patterns and rising sea levels. Such practices include using drought-resistant crops, precision irrigation and agroforestry to boost yields in the most vulnerable areas while reducing environmental risk. The work of the GrowBeyond Fund focuses on adaptation strategies that build resilience at both the farm and landscape level.

This development comes as part of a groundbreaking partnership with Petrolimex Aviation, a leading fuel supplier in Vietnam, further solidifying Vietjet’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices within the aviation industry.

A Historic Milestone in Sustainable Aviation

On October 17, 2024, a special event took place in Ho Chi Minh City, where Vietjet and Petrolimex Aviation officially launched their collaboration to fuel flights with SAF. The signing ceremony was attended by top officials, including Uong Viet Dung, the Director General of the Vietnam Civil Aviation Authority; Phạm Văn Thanh, Chairman of Petrolimex; and Vietjet’s leadership team, including CEO Dinh Viet Phuong and Standing Vice President To Viet Thang.

This partnership marks the first time in Vietnam that Petrolimex Aviation has blended and supplied 1,200 m³ of SAF for Vietjet flights. The introduction of SAF is not only a commercial milestone but also a strategic leap forward, setting the foundation for a sustainable fuel supply chain in Vietnam. With the production of SAF adhering to the ISCC EU standard, it meets stringent international sustainability and CO₂ emission reduction requirements, setting an example for other countries and airlines to follow.

The Role of SAF in Sustainable Aviation

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is made from renewable and sustainable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural by-products, wood biomass, and urban waste. The use of SAF has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuels, making it an essential part of the aviation industry’s strategy to combat climate change.

The fuel is not only safe for commercial operations but also meets all aviation standards, making it a viable alternative for airlines looking to reduce their environmental impact. Vietjet’s adoption of SAF is a significant step toward reducing the airline’s carbon footprint and supporting Vietnam’s sustainable development goals.

Commitment to Green and Sustainable Development

The introduction of SAF into Vietjet’s operations underscores the airline’s commitment to green development and its role in driving the country’s National Green Growth Strategy. As the first airline in Vietnam to publish an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) sustainability report, Vietjet has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable aviation.

Vietjet’s CEO, Dinh Viet Phuong, stated that the use of SAF in its flights is part of the airline’s long-term strategy to incorporate sustainable practices into its operations. With 576 modern aircraft on order, Vietjet is not just focusing on reducing emissions in the short term but is actively shaping a green, sustainable future for aviation. By using SAF, Vietjet aims to contribute significantly to global sustainability goals while simultaneously enhancing Vietnam’s standing in the international aviation community.

The Impact of SAF on Vietnam’s Aviation Industry

The partnership between Vietjet and Petrolimex Aviation has broader implications for Vietnam’s aviation industry and its commitment to environmental stewardship. Uong Viet Dung, the Director General of the Vietnam Civil Aviation Authority, highlighted that the launch of SAF is strategically important for establishing a domestic SAF supply chain. This will not only help meet international aviation fuel standards but also encourage cooperation among airlines, fuel suppliers, and regulatory agencies to boost SAF usage throughout Vietnam and beyond.

As Petrolimex continues to invest in the development of SAF technology at its Nha Be Oil Depot, it is laying the groundwork for expanding SAF production capabilities in the country. This initiative reflects Petrolimex’s commitment to supporting the green transition and advancing Vietnam’s sustainable development in the aviation sector. The company has also become the first in Vietnam to import SBC hydrocarbons, which are synthesized from biologically renewable materials for SAF production.

Vietjet’s Green Fleet and Future Goals

Vietjet’s long-term environmental strategy focuses on reducing emissions and pioneering the use of clean fuel. By adopting SAF, the airline is contributing significantly to protecting the environment and fulfilling its sustainability goals. This commitment goes hand in hand with Vietnam’s aspirations for growth in the global aviation industry, positioning the country as a leader in sustainable aviation in Southeast Asia.

Vietjet’s Standing Vice President, To Viet Thang, emphasized that today’s cooperation with Petrolimex Aviation is a pivotal moment for the airline and the country. This partnership aligns with Vietjet’s broader green agenda and positions the airline as an influential player in advancing sustainable air travel. As the global aviation industry increasingly turns to cleaner fuel options, Vietjet’s use of SAF serves as an example for other airlines and industries to follow in their efforts to mitigate climate change and build a more sustainable future.

Vietjet’s Green Transition and Vietnam’s Sustainable Future

By becoming a pioneer in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, Vietjet is helping to drive the shift toward greener and more sustainable air travel in Vietnam and the global aviation industry. The use of SAF, alongside Vietjet’s green fleet and long-term sustainability goals, is an important part of Vietnam’s environmental strategy. With a clear commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050, Vietjet’s efforts complement the country’s broader goals of sustainable growth and responsible tourism.

Through this collaboration with Petrolimex Aviation, Vietjet is contributing to the global green transition, marking a significant step in Vietnam’s aviation industry toward cleaner, more sustainable practices. As the aviation sector increasingly turns toward sustainable fuels, Vietjet’s efforts to embrace SAF underscore the airline’s vision for a more sustainable, eco-friendly future.

Sustainable Aviation in Vietnam: The Road Ahead

The successful use of SAF by Vietjet represents a critical turning point in the aviation industry’s green transition. With airlines around the world looking for ways to reduce their environmental impact, Vietnam is proving to be a leader in the sustainable aviation fuel movement. As Petrolimex continues to refine its SAF production capabilities and other airlines follow Vietjet’s lead, the future of aviation looks set to be much greener and more sustainable.

By continuing to invest in clean energy solutions like SAF, Vietjet and Vietnam are setting an example for the global aviation industry, showing that sustainable air travel is not just a possibility but a reality that can help protect the planet while ensuring the continued growth and success of the aviation industry.",https://www.gleaf.in/uploads//blogs/b290ac0ec8941ae4425c64132a057052.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 08:56:40.818109

Soyabean oil remained the primary feedstock and the blending rate was projected at 6.6% – below the 7.5% mandate – while production capacity remained unchanged, operating at over 70% idle.
“The local biofuels sector has been stagnant in the past several years because of laws regulating the sector, official policy or lack thereof, and political/economic decisions,” the USDA said.
The proposal would set a biodiesel blending mandate of 7.5% – with 5% of it reserved for small and medium producers – rising to 10% by 2031 under a fully liberalised market.
The European Union (EU) continues to be the main market for Argentine biodiesel, according to the report.","With domestic consumption steady, exports were forecast at a near 20-year low of 340M litres, the 2 September Argentina – Biofuels Annual said.

Soyabean oil remained the primary feedstock and the blending rate was projected at 6.6% – below the 7.5% mandate – while production capacity remained unchanged, operating at over 70% idle.

“The local biofuels sector has been stagnant in the past several years because of laws regulating the sector, official policy or lack thereof, and political/economic decisions,” the USDA said.

Biodiesel mandates had changed (up and down) several times and historically had not been reached, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) Global Agricultural Information Network (GAIN) report said.

The only notable biofuel policy development was in November 2024 when the administration submitted a bill to Congress to establish a new regulatory framework for biofuels aimed at promoting sustainability, energy efficiency and greater competition through price deregulation.

The proposal would set a biodiesel blending mandate of 7.5% – with 5% of it reserved for small and medium producers – rising to 10% by 2031 under a fully liberalised market.

However, the bill had not passed through Congress, the USDA said.

In August 2024, Liga Bioenergetica, a group formed by the six provinces which had an important role in biofuel production in the country, had presented a bill focused exclusively on biodiesel and bioethanol.

The bill focused on revamping the biofuel sector, increasing production and use, while reducing petrol and diesel imports and would allow Argentina to advance its environmental and climate change commitments, the USDA said.

The country’s 2006 and 2021 biofuels laws remain contentious, with most small-and-medium-sized biodiesel producers concerned they would open the official mandate to large companies leaving few smaller producers able to compete once the market is fully liberalised in 2031, according to the report.

“Biofuels continue to play only a small role supporting Argentina’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as the programme stagnated and has not advanced in meaningful ways,” the USDA said.

“At the same time, there are currently no policies in place to advance commercialisation of new biofuels, such as renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel.”

Argentina’s biofuels sector receives no direct financial support, relying instead on mandated blending rates, which have been reduced in recent years, particularly for biodiesel, according to the report.

Biodiesel exports remained a main pillar of the local industry but varied significantly year by year based on policies, market dynamics in export destinations and the price of diesel and biodiesel relative to the price of soyabean oil, the USDA said.

The European Union (EU) continues to be the main market for Argentine biodiesel, according to the report.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Argentina-biodiesel-prices.jpg?mtime=1633508243,N,,2025-09-17 07:57:13.532253

The first production of ‘drop‑in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks like canola, sorghum, sugar and waste.

Thanks to our advanced farming practices and access to cheap and reliable renewable energy, Australia is in an enviable position to produce cleaner, low carbon liquid fuels that jets, ships, construction machines and heavy trucks need to reach net zero.

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow. But the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050 – highlighting the untapped potential of developing local refining and value‑adding capability.

Funding to make cleaner fuel on Australian shores, from Australian feedstock will help back Australian innovators from the farmer to the fuel bowser, make our fuel supply greener and more resilient and make low carbon fuels available for early adopters.

Details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place this financial year. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process to ensure we get value for taxpayer funds.

The new production‑linked incentive builds on the Government’s support through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The Government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

A recent report from the CEFC found that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuels industry could deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2‑e in cumulative emissions reduction by 2050. This is equivalent to 2.3 times Australia’s current annual transport emissions, or the annual emissions from 86 million cars.

“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net zero supply chains.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

While solar and wind are vital to the clean energy transition, they are not always practical for industries like aviation, shipping and heavy freight. With demand for practical, scalable solutions rising, low-carbon biofuels could become a game-changer in reducing emissions while creating jobs across regional Australia.

What are low-carbon biofuels and why this matters

Low-carbon biofuels, often called low-carbon liquid fuels, are alternatives to fossil fuels made from renewable feedstocks. These can include crops like sorghum, sugar and canola, or waste materials such as used cooking oil and tallow. The fuels produced range from renewable diesel and biodiesel to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Crucially, many are ‘drop-in’ fuels, meaning they can replace or blend with conventional fuels without requiring major changes to engines or infrastructure.

This makes them particularly attractive for transport modes that are difficult to electrify or power with hydrogen in the short term. Heavy haulage, shipping and aviation can benefit from low-carbon biofuels sooner rather than later.

How they work in practice

Low-carbon biofuels are produced through several key steps. First, the feedstock is sourced from agriculture or waste streams. Next, conversion processes like hydroprocessing, fermentation or chemical upgrading turn the feedstock into liquid fuel. Finally, the refined fuel is distributed and used either directly or in blends with fossil fuels.

The versatility of these fuels means they can cut emissions without waiting for massive infrastructure overhauls. Trucks, planes and ships can start reducing their carbon footprint with minimal disruption.

Environmental impact: the promise and the pitfalls

The promise

When produced sustainably, low-carbon biofuels offer significant greenhouse gas savings. Some studies suggest Australia could avoid around 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050 if the industry scales up. Domestic production also strengthens fuel security, reducing reliance on imports and protecting supply chains. Beyond climate benefits, the industry promises billions in economic value and thousands of regional jobs.

The pitfalls

The environmental credentials of biofuels depend on how feedstocks are grown and processed. If cultivation is carbon-intensive or leads to deforestation or biodiversity loss, the net benefit shrinks. Land competition with food crops is another risk. Scaling production requires investment in refining, certification and infrastructure. Costs remain high for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel, meaning government policy and market demand will shape the speed of uptake.

Labor’s latest announcement

The $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program announced by the Labor Government will provide grants over 10 years to build Australia’s capacity to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the initiative as a central part of building a “Future Made in Australia,” adding:

“We want to make sure that Australia is at the forefront of this global shift, cutting emissions while creating good jobs at home.”

The funding signals a strong commitment to tackling emissions from transport and industry while opening new export opportunities. The government estimates the low-carbon fuels sector could grow into a $36 billion industry by 2050, cutting millions of tonnes of emissions and securing long-term economic gains.

What’s expected from leadership and industry

Policy certainty will be essential to attract private investment. Standards for sustainability, certification of fuels, and clear guarantees of origin will build confidence in the sector. Feedstock sustainability is also critical; if done right, Australia could turn agricultural residues and waste into a climate solution, not a liability.

Building the necessary refining, blending and distribution facilities will take time, but early action is key. By the mid-2030s, low-carbon fuels must be produced at scale if they are to meet Australia’s climate targets.

Strengthening fuel security

Low-carbon biofuels offer Australia a rare chance to cut emissions in some of the hardest-to-abate sectors without waiting for next-generation technology. With Labor’s $1.1 billion commitment, the pathway is clearer than ever. If the fuels are produced sustainably, they could become a cornerstone of Australia’s clean energy future, slashing emissions, strengthening fuel security, and creating jobs where they are needed most.",https://www.energymatters.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Low-carbon-biofuel.png,N,,2025-09-16 21:56:28.591509

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production. A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

Quotes attributable to Acting Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Murray Watt:

“As demand for air travel grows, and more goods are moved by road and rail, it’s essential we invest in future fuels that allow us to facilitate this increasing demand while meeting our net-zero targets.",https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/themes/custom/ministerinfrastructure/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-16 20:56:15.475112

Ms McCluskey said being at today’s announcement demonstrates the vital role farmers will play in supplying Australia’s low-carbon liquid fuels industry.
“This is an important acknowledgement that agriculture is a critical component of Australia’s cleaner fuels future,” Ms McCluskey said.
“A strong domestic biofuels industry will help diversify the market opportunities for producers, a key element of risk management.” “This isn’t just about cleaner fuels.
It means cleaner fuels for airlines and motorists, thousands of new jobs, and billions in regional investment.”","The National Farmers’ Federation (NFF) has welcomed the Federal Government’s $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program, describing it as a significant investment to stimulate the domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF).

NFF Interim Chief Executive Su McCluskey joined the Treasurer and Minister Bowen at the announcement. Ms McCluskey said being at today’s announcement demonstrates the vital role farmers will play in supplying Australia’s low-carbon liquid fuels industry.

“This is an important acknowledgement that agriculture is a critical component of Australia’s cleaner fuels future,” Ms McCluskey said.

“Farmers already supply products that power biofuel industries overseas; this investment will help to support a domestic industry.”

The new program will support the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel using Australian-grown feedstocks such as canola, sorghum and sugar, alongside agricultural byproducts.

“NFF members like GrainGrowers and Canegrowers have for years worked on developing policy settings that encourage domestic production, enabling their growers to access new markets and ensure their sectors remain profitable and sustainable,” Ms McCluskey said.

“A strong domestic biofuels industry will help diversify the market opportunities for producers, a key element of risk management.”

“This isn’t just about cleaner fuels. It’s about creating jobs, diversifying farm businesses, and ensuring our regions remain at the forefront of Australia’s transition to net zero.”

The NFF has long called for increased domestic production of biofuels. The industry’s 2030 Roadmap to a $100 billion industry highlights biofuels as a critical lever for growth by helping to diversify farm income, improve resilience, and contribute to Australia’s climate commitments.

“Alongside the sustainability benefits, building this industry here will also strengthen Australia’s sovereign fuel capability by reducing our reliance on imports.”

The NFF said it also looks forward to working with its members and Government in the development of the Government’s ‘National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy’ to ensure feedstock supply is sustainable, competitive and well-integrated with regional development.

Quotes attributable to GrainGrowers CEO, Shona Gawel:

“Today’s announcement is a welcome investment in Australia’s LCLF industry. Domestic LCLF production can strengthen Australia’s energy security and unlock new economic opportunities, ensuring Australia remains fuel-secure, sustainable, and resilient.

“Australia produces an abundance of crops suitable for biofuel production, including canola and other oilseeds. Our world-class sector and established grain supply chains are well-placed to supply domestic LCLF production.”

Quotes attributable to CANEGROWERS CEO, Dan Galligan:

“Almost half of the Queensland’s sugarcane is recognised by the world’s three biggest sustainability gatekeepers as a global leader in sustainable farming. This gives immediate confidence to airlines, freight and heavy industry that local feedstocks meet global benchmarks.

“Our growing region stretches along the Queensland coastline, alongside major population hubs. We also have a cane rail network stretching thousands of kilometres, linking farms to mills and multiple deep-water ports.

“This footprint shortens supply chains, cuts costs, and de-risks a rapid scale-up of domestic low-carbon liquid fuels. With sugarcane feedstock alone, Queensland could deliver more than 30% of Australia’s aviation fuel demand.

“This is about positioning Queensland as the nation’s biofuels hub. It means cleaner fuels for airlines and motorists, thousands of new jobs, and billions in regional investment.”",https://nff.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/canola-crop-1024x678.jpeg,N,,2025-09-16 19:56:39.148998
