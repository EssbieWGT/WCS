The platform is rapidly advancing toward commercial readiness, positioning Kemvera to support U.S. farmers, underpin domestic manufacturing, and sustain the United States as a global leader in biobased chemical production.
Chemical manufacturing is one of the largest segments of U.S. manufacturing, yet much of the feedstock supply is derived from petroleum.
This, along with renaming to Kemvera, marks a defining moment for our company,” said Chern-Hooi Lim, founder and CEO of Kemvera.
Kemvera’s vision aligns with national priorities for domestic manufacturing, agricultural value-add, and U.S. leadership in advanced materials.","Kemvera, a sustainable chemical innovation company, today announced it has completed the process design package (FEL 1) for its planned 50,000 metric tons per year commercial-scale plant. To support scale-up for this commercial facility, Kemvera completed the design for a 500 metric tons per year pre-commercial demonstration reactor and recently commissioned its 20 metric tons per year pilot reactor and validated its robustness by demonstrating continuous operations. These key steps in process development represent significant progress toward commercialization of Kemvera’s biobased acetic acid and ethyl acetate manufacturing process.

Aligning with the company’s next phase of growth, Kemvera announces that it has been renamed from New Iridium to reflect its vision to scale biobased chemical solutions using domestic agricultural feedstock.

Kemvera’s proprietary catalytic platform converts biobased and CO₂-derived feedstocks, such as domestically sourced corn ethanol, into affordable, drop-in chemicals. The platform is rapidly advancing toward commercial readiness, positioning Kemvera to support U.S. farmers, underpin domestic manufacturing, and sustain the United States as a global leader in biobased chemical production.

Chemical manufacturing is one of the largest segments of U.S. manufacturing, yet much of the feedstock supply is derived from petroleum. According to a 2025 research report, the domestic green chemicals market is projected to reach USD 7.46 billion by 2033, representing a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 7.8% from 2025. To meet this growing demand, Kemvera’s approach integrates partnerships with ethanol producers and agricultural stakeholders to create a vertically connected and sustainable domestic value chain, from Midwest cornfields to industrial end users.

“Having reached these milestones, we are entering a new phase of development that brings us significantly closer to customer delivery. This progress represents the culmination of first-principles-based research and engineering into scalable, affordable chemical production using American-grown feedstocks. This, along with renaming to Kemvera, marks a defining moment for our company,” said Chern-Hooi Lim, founder and CEO of Kemvera.

“The Iowa Corn Promotion Board supports the continued development of biobased chemicals that use domestically grown corn as a feedstock,” said Joe Roberts, President of Iowa Corn Promotion Board, who farms in Belmond, Iowa. “Innovations like this help create new, high-value markets for corn, strengthen rural economies, and build on the success of corn ethanol by expanding domestic bio-manufacturing. Advancing solutions that convert corn into essential industrial products reinforces the role of U.S. agriculture in meeting growing market demand.”

Kemvera envisions the near-term usage of its flagship products, bio-acetic acid and bio-ethyl acetate, in footwear and disinfectants, and later, in a myriad of everyday consumer products. By producing materials from domestic biobased inputs, Kemvera offers chemical customers and brand owners reliable alternatives to fossil-derived products while reinforcing U.S. supply chain resilience.

Kemvera’s vision aligns with national priorities for domestic manufacturing, agricultural value-add, and U.S. leadership in advanced materials. To support this, the company is raising Series A funding and seeking partnerships with ethanol producers, chemical companies and consumer brands. By anchoring production in renewable American agricultural products, the company seeks to unlock new demand for chemicals made with domestically grown crops, like corn, while reducing reliance on imported and fossil-based chemical products.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Kemvera_Jan26_31038db884.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 17:57:24.497567

He tells Brownfield the situation is especially dire for Iowa biodiesel producers.

“If you look at the biodiesel industry in Iowa, I think they are operating about 30% below where they were in just 2024.”

Kovarik says he’s hopeful an announcement will be made soon on 45Z now that the White House Office of Management and Budget lists the proposed rules as “completed” rather than “under review.”

“Which means the proposed regulation goes back to the Department of Treasury. Hopefully, if there are no other issues with it, we’ll see a proposed regulation as early as tomorrow and perhaps by the end of this week.”

White House officials have said President Trump will visit Clive, Iowa on Tuesday and will speak about energy and the economy.

The acquisition of the 50 jets increases ACG’s Boeing 737 MAX order book to 121, including 50 firm orders for the 737-10, Boeing said in a statement on Jan. 13 (NYSE: BA).
The 50-count order is split evenly between the Boeing 737-8 and 737-10 models, with deliveries scheduled for 2032 and 2033.
ACG says the new fuel can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional aviation fuel.
“All of our aircraft are capable of flying with up to a 50% blend of SAF,” said the environmental report.","Aviation Capital Group has placed an order for 50 Boeing 737 Max jets to be leased out to commercial airlines, as the company sees growing demand for fuel-efficient planes.

Chief Executive Tom Baker declined to specify the price for the 50 new jetliners, though he said a catalog price would be “well in excess of $7 billion.”

“We do not pay catalog list prices. We pay much less than that,” Baker told the Business Journal.

The announcement is another positive signal for the Newport Beach-based firm, which has significantly recovered from the pandemic years when the travel industry was decimated and the Ukraine war, where it recently reported recuperating $545 million in insurance claims after its planes were “stolen” by Russia.

Last year was a “strong market” when it delivered 46 aircraft, the company said at a December presentation at Goldman Sachs 16th Annual Aircraft Leasing Conference.

ACG, as it is commonly called, had approximately 470 owned, managed and committed aircraft as of Sept. 30 that were leased to roughly 90 airlines in approximately 50 countries. The term “committed” refers to aircraft on order.

“We’re about $14 billion dollars in assets under management right now,” Baker said. “We definitely want to be bigger than that.”

‘Our Children’

Baker considers his company’s billions of dollars’ worth of leased-out jetliners as more than just expensive flying machines.

“They’re our airplanes. They’re our assets. We love our children very deeply,” Baker said during a Jan. 20 interview. “We care about their condition and their health.

“We make sure that the lessee takes very, very good care of them and pays for proper maintenance, submits the proper records, keeps the airplane in good condition according to the terms of the lease.”

Its customers range from United Airlines to Air France, Hungary’s Wizz Air, Poland’s LOT, Italy’s ITA and Virgin Australia.

ACG calls itself a major global airplane lessor based in California. Baker said ACG’s biggest competitor is Los Angeles-based Air Lease, which analysts expected to report $3 billion in 2025 sales; it has a $7.1 billion market cap (NYSE: AL).

The acquisition of the 50 jets increases ACG’s Boeing 737 MAX order book to 121, including 50 firm orders for the 737-10, Boeing said in a statement on Jan. 13 (NYSE: BA).

The 50-count order is split evenly between the Boeing 737-8 and 737-10 models, with deliveries scheduled for 2032 and 2033.

The company also has commitments to another 73 planes from Airbus, the European consortium.

The typical first lease is for 12 years, according to the ACG CEO.

“We deliver them an airplane. We help them retrofit the airplane. We finance the costs of that retrofit in the lease,” according to Baker.

In turn, the airlines are responsible for leasing costs, maintenance, crew, insurance and related charges, he said.

Among recent jetliner deliveries, ACG announced on Dec. 26 the delivery of a new Boeing 737 MAX 8 to LOT Polish Airlines.

A month earlier, ACG announced the delivery of its first new Airbus A220-300 to Italian carrier ITA Airways, a new customer for ACG.

ACG says it also provides certain aircraft asset management services and aircraft financing solutions for third parties.

The company has about 135 full-time employees worldwide, with approximately 85 in Newport Beach.

ACG is currently located at 840 Newport Center Drive and will move to 520 Newport Center Drive this year, according to Baker.

Leasing Increasingly Popular

ACG was founded in 1989; Newport Beach-based Pacific Life Insurance Co. in 2005 took a majority stake and, for several years, floated a possible IPO for ACG. However, Pacific Life sold ACG to Tokyo Century Corp. in 2019, where it is now a wholly owned subsidiary.

While the practice of leasing jetliners may be little known to ordinary passengers, it provides more flexibility for the air carriers.

“Airlines have a choice between buying their aircraft or leasing them. Leasing has emerged as the preferred option, rising from roughly 10% of the total fleet in the 1970s to 58% at the end of 2023,” the International Air Transport Association said in 2024.

9-Month Revenue Up Slightly

On Nov. 12, ACG reported total revenues of $934.7 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2025, up slightly from $923.1 million a year prior.

Total pre-tax net income, excluding insurance proceeds, was $124 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2025.

ACG funds its purchases from various sources, including the U.S. bond market and loans from a syndicate of more than 50 banks, according to Baker. It has investment grade ratings of Baa2 from Moody’s and a BBB from S&P Global.

­ACG on Jan. 22 announced the closing of its sale of $1 billion of senior unsecured notes.

The company said it intends to use the net proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of commercial aircraft and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.

ACG Collects $545M in Insurance After Russia ‘Stole’ its Planes

Aviation Capital Group said nine of its jetliners were seized in Russia after Vladimir Putin’s nation invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

ACG CEO and President Tom Baker said at the time that the loss was covered by insurance.

Now, several years later, some major insurance sums have been paid to ACG.

“The key message there is we got made whole, but it took us four years to do it,” Baker said, referring to the aircraft as having been “stolen.”

The company said in November that it had received a net benefit of $544.8 million from the “settlement of insurance claims related to our losses incurred from Russia exposure.”

ACG listed $574.7 million in its annual financial statements as Russia-related losses for 2022. The company also said in the statements that it had incurred “damages in excess of $700 million” from the Russian seizure.

Baker explained that the $700 million figure is the “fully loaded number to include the value of the airplanes, the costs of recovery, lost rent, so on and so forth.”

A Backpack Made from an Airline Seat?

Aviation Capital Group is doing its part to reduce airline pollution by recycling old airline seats into what it calls “stylish, high-quality backpacks.”

“The environmental impact is significant, as aircraft seat leather and life vests are made from durable, high-quality materials designed to withstand tough conditions,” the company’s 2024 annual environmental report said.

“By repurposing them, we extend their lifespan, reduce landfill waste and decrease the demand for new raw materials. This sustainable approach lowers the carbon footprint of traditional manufacturing and contributes to a circular economy.”

The company is also beginning to use “sustainable aviation fuel,” which is a renewable alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. The fuel, known as SAF, is produced from waste oils, agricultural residues and non-food crops.

ACG says the new fuel can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional aviation fuel.

“All of our aircraft are capable of flying with up to a 50% blend of SAF,” said the environmental report. “Both Airbus and Boeing are targeting 2030 for 100% SAF capability and certification.”

The Newport Beach-based company has also invested in the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund and obtained a $550 million senior unsecured term loan with “sustainability-linked terms.”

New Mexico’s Environmental Improvement Board voted on Thursday to approve rulemaking for the state’s Clean Transportation Fuel Program after an extensive public hearing process. With the new rules, the regulator threaded the needle between fuel producers eager for a boost to biogas produced on farms and environmental advocates concerned about concentrated animal operations.

The program was created by HB 41, which was signed into law in March 2024. The law required the average carbon intensity of fuels used in the state to decline by 20% by 2030 and 30% by 2040, compared with a 2018 baseline.

New Mexico will be the fourth state to implement a clean fuels program when the CTFP goes into effect on April 1. California was the first when its Low Carbon Fuel Standard took effect in 2011, followed by Oregon and Washington. ​

Dive Insight:

New Mexico is one of the country’s largest producers of fossil fuels, but its biofuels industry is relatively small. When HB 41 was passed, the state had just 16 biogas-producing facilities, according to the American Biogas Council.

The rulemaking process involved multiple public hearings as well as an extensive outreach campaign conducted by New Mexico Environment Department staff. Much of the debate concerning biofuels related to carbon intensity values for certain fuels. Food & Water Watch, one of the primary environmental groups involved in the process, urged regulators not to allow avoided methane crediting.

The policy boosts carbon intensity scores for biogas derived from on-farm manure digesters, which work by concentrating manure in lagoons that are kept in anaerobic conditions and produce methane that’s refined into a fuel-quality gas.

California has included avoided methane crediting in the LCFS for several years, leading to debate during the last update of the program in 2024. Industry groups say the practice is a fair way to acknowledge the methane avoided by capturing the greenhouse gases generated by large amounts of manure on farms, while environmental groups say it unnecessarily incentivizes concentrated animal farming and disincentivizes manure management practices that pollute less than digesters.

To address those concerns, NMED proposed guardrails that would help staff determine in the future if a biogas project seeking credits was actually avoiding methane emissions.

In a statement, Alexa Reynaud, Food & Water Watch’s factory farm organizing manager, offered measured praise for regulators and the guardrails included in the final program.

“New Mexico has taken seriously the reality that programs like the Clean Transportation Fuel Program can perversely incentivize factory farms to pollute,” Reynaud said. “Unfortunately, the risk remains for New Mexico’s program, and more programs like these are popping up every year across the country with even more incentives for factory farms to inundate our communities with even more pollution. No climate programs should reward factory farms for polluting.”

Fuel producers were more upbeat about the program’s finalization and its potential to spur other states to action. Clean Fuels Alliance America, an industry group representing the biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel sectors, praised the rulemaking in a release.

“As the first non–West Coast state to implement a clean fuel standard, New Mexico proves that states with strong energy economies can also lead on clean fuel deployment and market certainty,” said Jeff Earl, director of state governmental affairs for Clean Fuels. “This program adds real momentum to clean fuel standard adoption nationwide.”

Advocates for clean fuels programs have eyed the potential for additional states to adopt such policies in recent years. New York is the largest market where legislators are seriously considering a bill — A. 472, a bill establishing a clean fuel standard in New York, was referred to the state assembly’s environmental conservation committee on Jan. 7.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/lwDPPXhXtzousqNlOsldhpiVKVKXwQp2ymWm7TWpAsI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy00OTAzNjM4NzhfcnN6LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-26 12:57:32.959525

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories.
In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said: “The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy.
It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices.
Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category.","The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Hong Kong’s central banking institution, announced the release of the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance Phase 2A, expanding its classification system for identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities to include transition activities, climate adaptation, and a significantly broader range of sectors and economic activities.

The release of the new update follows the launch by the HKMA in May 2024 of its initial Taxonomy, aimed at providing a framework to allow investors to identify and invest in activities that generate a positive impact on the environment, and to avoid those with a negative impact, as well as to align investments with climate goals, and reduce the risk of investing in assets that are not aligned with a low-carbon future.

At the time, the HKMA said that it aimed to use a phased approach to establishing the Taxonomy, adding more sectors and categories over time, and the central bank subsequently launched a consultation on its proposed “Phase 2A” in September 2025.

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories. With the update, the Hong Kong Taxonomy now categorizes climate mitigation activities as Green, indicating that they either already operate at net zero emissions or are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway; Transition, indicating that they are carbon-intensive activities that are on a time-bound decarbonization pathway to align with a 1.5°C trajectory that will ultimately reach net zero in 2050, or; Exclusion, indicating that they are not currently eligible under the Taxonomy, as they are either not aligned with Green or Transition criteria, are incompatible with a 1.5°C future, or are of low climate materiality, with minimal relevance to climate objectives.

In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said:

“The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy. It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices. By defining credible pathways for these sectors to align with net zero goals, the Taxonomy strives to minimise economic disruption in carbon-intensive industries and promote an orderly transition, with a view to balancing environmental imperatives with economic growth.”

The updated Taxonomy introduces two classifications under the Transition category, including “Transition Activity,” which refers to economic activities that are not yet aligned with a 1.5°C pathway but are progressing towards alignment, or enable significant short-term emissions reductions, and “Transition Measure,” referring to specific activity components that could partially improve the emission performance of the activity, such as the purchase of low-carbon energy for aluminum production.

Notably, the criteria utilized for the updated Taxonomy’s transition category include a requirement for the activity to be “time-bound,” with eligibility limited to a prescribed sunset date, which varies by sector and activity based on factors such as technological readiness, environmental impact, and regulatory policies, among others.

Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category. The new category initially includes “adapting measures,” or subcomponents of activities rather than complete standalone activities, such as technologies, processes, materials, practices, or services that positively contribute to the resilience and adaptation of broader activities. The category also launches with a “whitelist” approach, with a curated list of measures that are automatically deemed eligible without the need to meet specific criteria. The HKMA said that in the future, “as global and local understanding of adaptation improve and Hong Kong-specific criteria and thresholds are more robustly established, other more sophisticated assessment approaches… may be explored.”

The update also significantly expands the sectors covered under the Taxonomy from 4 to 6, adding Manufacturing, and Information & Communications Technology, and more than doubles the number of economic activities from 12 to 25, adding activities including transmission and distribution of electricity, district heating and cooling, and low-carbon transport infrastructure, among others.

The HKMA said that development of the next phase of the Taxonomy is already underway, with additional activities such as nuclear and natural gas-fired power generation, hydrogen for electricity generation, sustainable aviation fuel, among others being considered for future development, as well as sectors such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage and waste and wastewater treatment, alongside further work on adaptation and the exploration of the role of “Do No Significant Harm.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hong-Kong-MA.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:57:40.770914

Analysts attribute this trend to structural production inefficiencies and aging infrastructure, which also contribute to high levels of methane emissions and routine gas flaring.
However, emissions increases were still significant, and methane emissions reportedly grew by 25% due to increased flaring at new wells.
This context highlights the tension between maintaining production levels and pursuing emissions reduction.
Its efforts toward energy efficiency and emissions reduction are thus not just corporate priorities but key components of national climate strategy.","PEMEX reported a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency, part of broader efforts to align the NOC with Mexico’s climate commitments and the international energy transition. The plan, outlined in a press release issued by the company on Jan. 21, 2026, aims for a cumulative reduction in energy consumption of nearly 6.1% by 2030 and cuts in emissions of up to 1.8MMt CO₂e annually. These reductions, PEMEX says, would be equivalent to the annual carbon sequestration of roughly 80 million trees or removing more than 500,000 vehicles from circulation.

At the close of 2025, the company reported a total energy consumption of slightly over 500 petajoules (PJ), underscoring both the scale of its operations and the environmental impact associated with them. PEMEX’s strategy combines near-term operational optimizations with longer-term investments in cleaner technologies and energy diversification. It includes improvements in process efficiency, recovery of flare gas, integrated energy and water management, residual heat recovery, efficient cogeneration, and integration of modern thermal systems.

These actions are part of its evolving ESG strategy and are designed not only to reduce direct emissions but also to enhance operational safety and resources use, positioning PEMEX as a potential national leader in energy management. The strategy also incorporates diversification through solar, wind and bioenergy sources, including biofuels, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable natural gas, as well as natural climate solutions such as agroforestry projects and efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and land degradation.

PEMEX highlights a long-term vision that extends into advanced technologies such as electromobility, hydrogen (both blue and green), and carbon capture and storage. These initiatives are intended to support a more orderly energy transition consistent with Mexico’s national goals and PEMEX’s Plan Estratégico 2025–2035, which calls for improved sustainability while maintaining energy security.

Industry Context: Rising Emissions and Methane Challenges

Despite these stated ambitions, recent data paint a more nuanced picture of PEMEX’s environmental performance. The company’s carbon emissions climbed by 15.4% in the third quarter of 2025, reaching their highest levels in nearly three years. Between July and September, PEMEX emitted 16.5MMt CO₂e, following a significant increase in the previous quarter. Analysts attribute this trend to structural production inefficiencies and aging infrastructure, which also contribute to high levels of methane emissions and routine gas flaring.

Methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential many times that of CO₂, has been a particular concern for environmental groups and climate policy advocates. PEMEX and the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP) took steps to address this in late 2025 by launching a national methane-reduction program in collaboration with the World Bank, under the global “Burning and Methane Reduction” initiative. This initiative focuses on building capacity for detecting, quantifying and mitigating methane leaks, as well as eliminating routine flaring.

The company’s own sustainability commitments, reaffirmed in 2025 with support from the Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Alliance, include pledges to avoid routine flaring in new oil field developments and to eliminate the practice entirely at existing sites by 2030. These pledges complement Mexico’s broader climate targets embedded in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

However, achieving these goals remains difficult. High emissions have persisted alongside chronic flaring, often due to a lack of available infrastructure to capture and process associated gas. Industry observers have noted that PEMEX flares nearly 10% of the gas it produces, reflecting both technical bottlenecks and limited investment capacity.

Operational and Financial Pressures

Environmental pressures on PEMEX are compounded by the company’s enduring financial and operational constraints. In its 3Q25 operational report, PEMEX noted improvements in safety and a 4.2% reduction in energy consumption compared with prior periods. However, emissions increases were still significant, and methane emissions reportedly grew by 25% due to increased flaring at new wells. In the same report, industrial safety indicators improved, showing a 17% decrease in accident incidence and a 44% reduction in severity, but environmental concerns remain central.

This context highlights the tension between maintaining production levels and pursuing emissions reduction. PEMEX’s dual mandate — to sustain hydrocarbon output while improving sustainability, places it at the center of Mexico’s broader energy policy debates. Policymakers and industry stakeholders continue to wrestle with balancing energy security, economic priorities, and climate obligations, especially as global climate negotiations call for intensified action.

Mexico’s National Emissions and Climate Commitments

Mexico as a whole has made ambitious climate commitments, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 under its updated NDCs presented at COP30. These targets reflect the country’s pledge to mitigate climate change and transition toward cleaner energy systems. However, the robust growth of fossil fuel industries and continued reliance on hydrocarbon revenues pose challenges to realizing these ambitions.

PEMEX, as one of the largest industrial emitters in Mexico, plays a significant role in shaping the country’s emissions profile. Its efforts toward energy efficiency and emissions reduction are thus not just corporate priorities but key components of national climate strategy. At the same time, the company’s emissions trajectory, with recent increases, underscores the difficulty of reconciling fossil fuel production with climate goals.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/coal-power-plant-high-pipes-with-black-smoke-movin-2026-01-06-10-11-13-utc%20%281%29.jpg?h=62c404c8&itok=vN3Uhvcu,N,,2026-01-26 12:57:45.262087

Read More in Generation Every region will chart its own course to attain energy security.","Ken West is president and CEO of Honeywell Process Technology.

Over the past year, the global energy landscape has shifted in meaningful ways. Liquefied natural gas, and natural gas overall, gained momentum, while growth in areas like petrochemicals and renewables slowed. Global policy developments shaped how governments and companies make investment and innovation decisions, reinforcing the need for stable, long-term policy frameworks to support next-generation energy solutions.

What became clear in 2025 is that the future will require more energy supply requiring all forms of energy, which includes making traditional fuels more efficient while adding innovative alternative fuels to the mix.

Growing energy demand and evolving regulations will continue to shape 2026. Meeting the global need for more power means expanding energy infrastructure worldwide, which is becoming more challenging. As these systems become increasingly complex, digitalization is emerging as the connective tissue that links infrastructure, data and people. The next phase of progress will be defined by how technology is deployed — not only to cut costs and boost efficiency, but to enable intelligent operations, advance modular solutions and strengthen energy security for responsible growth.

Here are four strategic shifts that will shape the energy sector in 2026.

Digital solutions help meet rising energy demand

Looking ahead, connected solutions — where AI-powered tools are integrated with digitally connected infrastructure — will accelerate the shift of energy companies toward intelligent operations. These tools help strengthen and augment workforce capabilities, extract more value from existing assets, and position energy leaders to meet rising demand with greater confidence. Early adopters are already seeing measurable gains in reliability and workforce efficiency.

Skilled labor constraints remain a challenge as experienced workers retire and turnover stays high. To address this, energy companies are turning to digital solutions that upskill the workforce, maintain reliability and scale operations. AI is playing a critical role, analyzing millions of data points across the plant and using predictive analytics to help optimize performance and prevent downtime in day-to-day operations. It is also empowering junior employees with expertise that would normally take decades to build, helping them handle complex scenarios safely and efficiently.

Digitalization is also helping companies extend the life of existing assets and avoid costly new builds. The focus is shifting toward maximizing reliability and efficiency through predictive maintenance and connected operations. Refineries and petrochemical facilities have spent the past decade laying the groundwork for digitalization, and now advances in 5G, AI and cloud computing are unlocking a new level of operational intelligence. By linking assets and processes across entire enterprises, companies can improve reliability, increase output, reduce energy consumption and minimize equipment wear.

The rapid growth of data centers to power AI is adding pressure to the energy system, driving significant demand for natural gas. But AI can help offset this strain by boosting efficiency and optimizing production. By integrating AI-powered solutions, organizations can better manage energy use, streamline operations and reduce emissions. In 2026, energy leaders will sharpen their focus on where and how to expand capacity. Upgrading and modernizing legacy infrastructure with AI and data-driven systems may prove even more critical than building new facilities to meet global demand.

Energy security moves to the top of the agenda

Connected solutions will play a significant role in supporting energy security, but geopolitical uncertainty — including economic tariffs, sanctions and evolving policies — is driving the need to expand energy sources and infrastructure globally.

To support this expansion, many new projects are being developed in regions where construction and execution can be challenging. Energy leaders are increasingly turning to modular solutions for everything from upgrading and expanding traditional refinery and petrochemical facilities to building new LNG and sustainable aviation fuel plants. Modular solutions are critical in regions where labor and materials are in short supply, but they are also widely sought because they provide certainty in project execution, timelines and budget.

While resources vary by region, advanced technology solutions enable regional expansion and localization efforts by allowing a wider range of feedstocks, like biomass, to be converted into energy sources, supporting global energy security.

LNG expansion offers path to boost energy supply

The global need for responsible energy expansion is driving demand for alternative fuel sources. LNG remains essential to energy security efforts, especially in countries that lack access to traditional fuels and those seeking stable, lower-carbon power options.

To meet this demand, LNG project developers are prioritizing proven, bankable solutions that streamline operations and reduce complexity. Energy producers and operators are investing in process innovation to optimize performance, including end-to-end and modular solutions that can reduce costs and accelerate approval and permitting. This reflects a broader push toward technology-driven efficiency across the value chain.

In 2026, LNG projects will balance increasing scale in the short term with long-term energy needs shaped by shifting global demand. With its lower-carbon profile and transportability, LNG will continue to play a critical role in supporting global energy security.

Regulation is shifting to balance sustainability with economic viability

Broad adoption of alternative fuels remains largely dependent on reducing the cost premium. Policy and technology alignment will be essential to accelerating progress in sectors such as shipping and aviation, where new fuels compete with traditional options on both performance and price.

Making energy alternatives economically viable will require a combination of factors, including technological innovation, lower project costs and supportive regulatory frameworks. Companies that can adapt quickly to changing rules and broaden their portfolio to diversify their energy mix will be well-positioned to lead in a more fluid, policy-driven energy environment.

For businesses, it’s a question that applies to almost everything, from product innovation to climate impact—an area of increasing urgency for many.

The goal of achieving net-zero is now a staple of most businesses’ annual plans, however the journey there is often challenging. It can be fraught with hidden trade-offs, making it difficult for ESG leaders to know whether they are truly backing the right solutions in pursuit of their climate goals.

Take aviation, for example. As one of the world’s most difficult sectors to decarbonize, its 2.5% share of global CO2 emissions represents a major challenge for nearly every corporate climate plan. To solve this, the industry developed a solution called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Unlike traditional jet fuel made from crude oil, SAF is produced from renewable sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and other plant-based materials. Crucially, it’s designed to work with existing aircraft engines, allowing airlines to dramatically reduce their carbon footprint without having to build new planes.

While promising a dramatic reduction in air travel’s carbon footprint, the well-intentioned race to scale this “green” fuel has created a dangerous paradox, leading companies down a path that risks undermining the goals they are trying to achieve.

THE HIDDEN FLAW IN GREEN JET FUEL

SAF has quickly become the poster child for sustainable flight, as it cuts an aircraft’s lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. However, the way we scale SAF matters just as much as the volumes we achieve. Many of today’s biofuels rely on crops grown on arable land, creating direct competition with food production and increasing the risk of deforestation and biodiversity loss.

This is the hidden flaw in the first wave of green jet fuel. When the same land that could grow food or support forests is converted for use in jet fuel, claims of sustainability become less convincing. This approach risks incentivizing solutions that reduce carbon emissions on spreadsheets while increasing the social and environmental risks in reality.

At the same time, no one should underestimate the scale of aviation’s challenge. Industry roadmaps state that to align with net-zero targets by 2050, the sector will need hundreds of millions of tons of SAF per year, compared to only a few million tons produced per year today. We must choose the right path to close that gap over the next quarter-century.

The world generates an enormous amount of waste every year, from used cooking oil and animal fats to agricultural residues such as corn cobs, straw, and empty fruit bunches. Much of this material is mismanaged, leading to open burning, water contamination, and methane emissions as organic waste decomposes. Turning this waste into fuel tackles two problems at once: it avoids methane and pollution from unmanaged waste, and it displaces fossil fuels in sectors like aviation.

FROM PILOT TO SCALE: PROOF IN THE REAL WORLD

The key question for any sustainability solution is simple: Can it scale?

advertisement

For waste-based SAF, the answer is increasingly yes. At EcoCeres, our first large-scale renewable fuels plant in Jiangsu, China—which launched in 2021—demonstrated that industrial-scale production of SAF from 100% waste oils is commercially viable, with a capacity of around 350,000 tons per year.

Now, that model is scaling. In January 2026, we officially opened our new production facility in Johor, Malaysia. With 420,000 tons of annual renewable fuel capacity, it’s one of the country’s first dedicated SAF facilities and it effectively doubles EcoCeres’ SAF production capability. The plant utilizes 100% waste-based feedstocks, supported by a strategy that secures used cooking oil and other residues across Asia. Its circular model is demonstrated by facilities certified under leading industry bodies like ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) and CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). It has moved beyond pilots and is now delivering at industrial scale, proving the viability of truly circular SAF.

SAF AS A GATEWAY TO CREDIBLE NET-ZERO FOR BUSINESS

For many global companies, business travel and air freight form a substantial share of their carbon emissions. Without a scalable, credible source of SAF, corporate net-zero pledges risk becoming aspirational rather than actionable.

It’s clear that a more sophisticated standard for green fuel is needed. Three simple criteria can guide better decisions:

Feedstock integrity: Does the fuel rely on 100% waste and residue-based feedstocks that do not compete with food or high-value ecosystems?

Verified lifecycle impact: Does it achieve high lifecycle emissions reductions validated by robust, third-party certification schemes aligned with global standards?

Circular and local co-benefits: Does the solution tangibly reduce local pollution and create sustainable economic opportunities in the regions where waste is collected?

Applying these tests can differentiate between models that simply shift problems elsewhere and circular solutions that create compounded benefits.

CLOSE THE LOOP ON GLOBAL MOBILITY

The concept of a circular economy has successfully reshaped countless industries. For years, however, global aviation has remained a critical open loop. A truly circular, waste-based SAF model can help us finally close the loop on global mobility.

This is not a distant dream. As we’ve demonstrated, the technology is already proven and operating at scale. Global studies confirm that underutilized waste streams can support the production of hundreds of millions of tons of sustainable fuel, more than enough to bridge the current supply gap. As more of the world’s waste is brought into productive use, the idea of flying on circular fuel moves from promising pilot to practical reality.

For the business leaders and ESG teams asking, “How can we do better?” this presents a clear and actionable path. By championing a higher standard for the fuels they endorse, they can help transform one of the world’s most difficult climate challenges into a story of innovation and opportunity. If we can turn the world’s waste into the world’s jet fuel, then every business trip, shipment, and journey can be part of the solution, not the problem.

Ecoceres, jointly controlled by Hong Kong's city gas company Towngas and U.S.-based Bain Capital, exported its first SAF cargo from the plant in December, to Europe, which Lievonen said accounted for the major part of demand.

It also has an eye on Asia as countries such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan start rolling out mandates for the green aviation fuel. Malaysia itself is exploring a possible 1% SAF blending mandate.

Ecoceres, which has operated a separate biofuel plant in east China since 2021, now directly supplies airlines such as Air New Zealand, Qantas, Air France and Lufthansa rather than going through traders, Lievonen said.

Feedstock has mostly been procured from China, Malaysia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, he added.

What is Agentic AI and how does it differ from generative AI?

Since 2022, there has been an explosion in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) affecting how we work and communicate. Most people have become familiar with one form of AI called generative AI, encompassing chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini and image generators such as DALL-E, Midjourney.

These systems are fundamentally reactive, needing an input or a prompt to generate an output. A new system, however, is beginning to gain traction – agentic AI.

By contrast, agentic AI is a proactive system. Agentic AI, like generative AI, begins with a prompt; however, this is used to pursue objectives through multiple actions. All with limited human involvement, it acts like a proactive assistant rather than a reactive tool.

Airports and their complex operations are the reasons why Agentic AI”

The cycle of agentic AI follows as:

Perception is the starting point. The AI gathers information from its surroundings using sources such as sensors, application programming interfaces, internal databases or direct interaction with users. This ensures the system is working with current and relevant data before taking any action.

Reasoning follows once information has been collected. The AI analyses the data to understand meaning, context and intent. Using capabilities such as natural language processing, computer vision and pattern analysis, it interprets inputs, identifies relationships and determines what is happening within the wider environment.

Goal setting defines what the AI is trying to achieve. Based on user instructions or predefined objectives, the system establishes clear goals and outlines a plan to reach them. This planning stage may rely on decision logic, reinforcement learning or structured problem-solving methods.

Decision-making involves evaluating possible actions and selecting the most effective option. The AI compares outcomes based on criteria such as efficiency, accuracy, reliability and expected impact, using probabilistic models or machine learning techniques to guide its choice.

Execution is where decisions are put into action. The AI carries out tasks by interacting with external systems, triggering automated processes, updating records or responding directly to users as required.

Learning and adaptation occur after actions are completed. The AI assesses results, gathers feedback and adjusts its behaviour to improve future performance. Over time, this enables the system to handle similar tasks more effectively.

Orchestration ensures that multiple agents and systems work together smoothly. Orchestration frameworks manage workflows, co-ordinate resources, monitor progress and handle exceptions, allowing large numbers of agents to operate collaboratively at scale.

Watch an in-depth explainer here:

What impact will agentic AI have on airports?

Airports and their complex operations are the reasons why Agentic AI will transform the industry and boost efficiency. When a passenger travels through an airport, they are travelling through a highly interconnected system. There are many touch points they will come across: parking, checking in, baggage, security, retail, and boarding. These processes are all linked, though involve multiple independent stakeholders such as airlines, airports, ground handlers, regulators, and service providers, each controlling different parts of the passenger journey.

All with limited human involvement, it acts like a proactive assistant rather than a reactive tool”

On top of this, airports generate vast volumes of real-time event data, from check-ins and security throughput to aircraft movements, weather updates, and transport flows, which change continuously and require rapid responses. Delays of even a few minutes can disrupt, a challenge historically worsened by siloed data and limited information sharing. Agentic AI, leveraging modern cloud and data platforms, provides a way to connect these dots, enabling faster, smarter, and more coordinated decision-making across the entire airport ecosystem.

Below are some areas where agentic AI could impact and benefit the airport:

Highly dynamic environments: Airports manage constantly changing variables including flight schedules, passenger flows, baggage handling, and ground transport. Small delays can cascade into larger operational disruptions.

Multiple stakeholders: Airlines, ground handlers, security authorities, retailers, and regulators all operate independently, making co-ordination complex. Agentic AI can act as a bridge, aligning decisions across these groups.

Real-time data everywhere: Sensors, check-ins, baggage scanners, aircraft movements, and weather feeds generate massive streams of information. AI agents can process this data instantly to make timely, informed decisions.

Personalised passenger experience: Agentic AI can anticipate passenger needs by integrating airline preferences, travel history, and real-time conditions. Passengers could receive proactive guidance on security queues, gate changes, transport connections, and even personalised offers in lounges or retail areas.

Frictionless travel through automation: AI agents can orchestrate identity verification, boarding, and baggage handling using biometrics, reducing the need for paper documents and manual intervention.

Proactive disruption management: When delays or disruptions occur, agentic AI can automatically rebook passengers, optimise staffing, redirect flows, and communicate updates, reducing chaos and improving recovery times.

Connected, intelligent operations: By linking disparate systems and stakeholders, agentic AI transforms airports from reactive, siloed environments into adaptive, co-ordinated ecosystems that respond intelligently to real-world events.

Early adopters

Agentic AI is set to transform airports by turning complex, fragmented operations into connected, intelligent ecosystems. Airports that adopt these technologies early will gain a significant advantage, improving efficiency, resilience, and overall passenger satisfaction while redefining the travel experience.

Adani Airport Holdings Limited (AAHL), a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Limited and India’s largest operator of Public Private Partnership airports, is an early adopter, having already announced a strategic partnership with AIONOS, to implement a multilingual, omni-channel AI solution across its airport network.

The collaboration will see Agentic AI platform deliver personalised, real-time assistance to passengers via voice, chat, web and mobile interfaces. The system will operate in multiple languages, including English, Hindi and regional dialects, and will be available 24/7 to provide flight updates, gate information, baggage status, directions and other airport services.

Another early adopter includes VINCI Airports is trialling a virtual assistant powered by agentic artificial intelligence at Lyon Airport. Developed by startup Jumbo Mana, the 3D avatar provides real‑time information to passengers and responds to their questions. The system uses advanced AI and lifelike animation to create a realistic, human‑like interaction.

To explore these possibilities firsthand, join us at the International Airport Review Breakfast Briefing at Crowne Plaza, London Docklands on 18 March 2026. The event will showcase high-value use cases, demonstrate Agentic AI in action, and provide insights on how to implement these solutions effectively. Don’t miss this opportunity to network with industry peers, gain practical knowledge, and position your airport as a recognised innovator in the future of airport operations.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2671234705.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:58:02.712776

DevvStream, XCF and Southern may also file other documents with the SEC and Canadian securities regulatory authorities regarding the proposed transaction.
Although the binding term sheet provides that certain provisions are binding on the parties, it does not obligate the parties to consummate the proposed transaction.","HOUSTON & SACRAMENTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”), and DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced that they have agreed to a binding term sheet to combine Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”) (together, the “Parties”) in a three-party merger.

If the Parties are able to successfully negotiate a definitive agreement, the Parties believe the combined entity will form an integrated platform of complementary assets, with the opportunity to deploy a disciplined and proprietary environmental attribute and credit generation strategy across North America and emerging markets. The binding term sheet establishes a framework for collaboration and mutual understanding among the Parties.

The proposed transaction is intended to reinforce the development of a low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF via HEFA, e-methanol, e-methanol-to-jet fuel pathways, expand domestic production capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering. As part of the evaluation and negotiation of the definitive transaction agreement, the Parties plan to explore opportunities for integrating small modular reactor (“SMR”) nuclear power with electro-sustainable aviation fuel (“eSAF”), AI data center power, and associated environmental attribute structures.

Entry into definitive transaction agreements is subject to review and approval by the Boards of Directors of the respective companies. As part of the binding term sheet, an investor has agreed to purchase shares of XCF to fund near-term operations and, critically, to complete targeted upgrades and modifications at XCF’s New Rise Reno refinery. These funds are intended to be used to:

complete required mechanical, electrical, and process upgrades,

procure catalyst, utilities, and supporting infrastructure,

finalize commissioning and reliability improvements, and

conduct certain shareholder relations activities related to the updates and modifications at XCF’s New Rise Reno refinery.

The ultimate objective of the incremental funding is to bring the New Rise Reno facility into sustained commercial production and support the ramp-up of SAF output.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF commented: “We are excited to formalize a proposed final structure with DevvStream and Southern on what we believe will be a very accretive and excellent opportunity. We believe this combination has the potential to further validate the value XCF brings to the SAF industry while increasing shareholder value and providing alternative clean fuel opportunities. If consummated, this merger has the potential to solidify our footprint in North America as the supreme SAF producer.”

Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream commented: “We believe the next phase of SAF adoption will favor U.S.-based platforms that can move quickly, operate at scale, and better integrate environmental attributes into the fuel value chain to support project economics and customer confidence. If progressed, this merger would bring together complementary strengths—XCF’s scale and speed-to-market, Southern’s biomass feedstock focus, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset capabilities—with the shared objective of building a globally competitive low-carbon fuels platform grounded in real operating execution.”

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables added: ""Southern’s approach is centered on sustainable biomass feedstocks and scalable fuel pathways, and we see meaningful potential in combining that focus with XCF’s production footprint and ability to accelerate commercialization. Subject to completing the necessary documentation, and approvals, we believe this collaboration could create a U.S.-based platform that can compete globally.”

He warned “without regulation, there is no market” for costly biofuels and criticised the jump from 2% SAF in 2025 to 6% in 2030 as “forcing overinvestment for a limited market.”

While airlines push for more SAF and accuse TotalEnergies of underinvesting, Pouyanné said the company could supply 10% SAF by 2030, but that would come at a cost. He fears weakened targets will strand biorefinery assets. He argued that solar and wind abatement costs around US$200 per ton of CO₂, compared with US$350–400 for biofuels, calling for a focus on “the most affordable and sustainable as possible.”

Power plant outages in eastern US during gas supply squeeze and freezing weather

A major winter storm and constrained gas supplies have forced about 21 GW of generation offline in the PJM interconnection (roughly 16% of an average Sunday demand), hence triggering pre‑emergency load curtailments and record‑high spot prices. Power prices in the PJM interconnection, New York and New England jumped to US$400–US$700/MWh, with Dominion’s Virginia zone briefly spiking above US$1,800/MWh compared to US$200/MWh the prior morning.

New England met nearly 40% of demand with oil-fired plants, while gas fell to 30%, resulting in rapidly eroding reserve margins. PJM now forecasts a new winter peak of 147.2 GW, surpassing the previous record of 143.7 GW set in January 2025, driven by data centre loads, leaving nearly 1 million customers without power across several Southern and Mid‑Atlantic states. Grids warned that prolonged cold and fuel logistics could deepen reliability risks.

Chilean regulator fines Antofagasta’s Centinela mine for “non-compliance”

Chile’s environmental regulator (SMA) fined Antofagasta’s Centinela copper mine ~$775,000 for “minor” violations of water management rules tied to its El Tesoro project following a prior inspection from 2019–2020. SMA found the company failed to properly track water resources, kept no records for the exploration well “LE-1”, and did not measure flows at the “La Cascada” spring as frequently as required under its environmental impact study and monitoring plan.

Antofagasta said it is reviewing the decision, stressing that the SMA resolution “marks the conclusion of a process in which Minera Centinela (Centinela Mine) has actively and transparently collaborated with the authorities” and “reaffirming its commitment to environmental compliance and the sustainable development of its operations.”

A review finds Bangladesh electricity deals add billions to power costs

Bangladesh’s National Review Committee has found that power contracts signed under the 2010 “Speedy Increase of Power and Energy Supply” Act entrenched “organised corruption,” contributed to ~25% higher electricity tariffs, and left the country with around 9,500MW of overcapacity and large annual fiscal losses.

In its review of the Bangladesh Power Development Board’s 25‑year 1,496MW power purchase agreement (PPA) with Adani Power, the committee reported “extensive corruption” indications, including “unusual transactions” to foreign accounts coinciding with the deal. It concluded that the coal pricing formula is based on Indonesian and Australian indices, resulting in Adani Power being 85% more expensive than other Indian imports in 2024.

The panel recommended either renegotiating the coal price or cancelling the Adani contract if talks fail, while leaving any final decision to the next elected government.

India Energy Week provides a space where policy, industry, technology, and investment converge.
It reflects the complexity of India’s energy transition and the confidence with which it is being managed, pragmatically, inclusively, and at scale.","India’s approach to a resilient energy future is centred on availability, affordability, and sustainability. As the world’s fastest-growing major economy, its energy demand is rising at nearly three times the global average, and India is expected to account for around 25% of global energy demand growth over the next two decades.

To manage this responsibly, under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India has built its strategy on four strong pillars. The first is diversification of supplies. The country has expanded its crude oil import basket from 27 countries in 2014 to over 40 countries today, insulating the economy from global volatility. The second pillar is affordability for the common citizen. Despite significant global price shocks, India is among the few countries where fuel prices have declined over the last three years. This has been achieved through calibrated tax interventions and proactive management by public sector oil marketing companies.

Third, India is steadily transitioning towards a gas-based economy. Natural gas is viewed as a critical bridge fuel, and efforts are underway to raise its share in the energy mix from about 6% today to 15% by 2030 through rapid expansion of pipelines, LNG terminals, and city gas distribution networks.

The fourth pillar is the biofuel revolution, which has emerged as a clear success story. India achieved 10% ethanol blending ahead of schedule and is firmly on track to reach 20% by 2025, five years ahead of the original target. Together, these measures enable rapid economic growth while keeping energy secure, affordable, and progressively cleaner.

India is no longer a passive participant in the global energy system. Today, it is a structural growth engine and an increasingly important stabilising force. India sees its role as that of a global bridge, connecting producers and consumers, the developed world and the Global South, and traditional energy systems with emerging clean technologies.

Initiatives such as the Global Biofuels Alliance, which now brings together over 29 countries and 14 international organisations, demonstrate how India is helping to create sustainable and circular energy economies at scale.

Similarly, the India–Middle East– Europe Economic Corridor reflects India’s vision of integrated energy, trade, and digital infrastructure, with clean fuels such as green hydrogen at its core.

Most importantly, India brings a balanced and realistic voice to global energy conversations. For 1.4 billion Indians, and for billions across the developing world, energy security is not solely about decarbonisation. It is about development with dignity. India’s leadership seeks to ensure that the global energy transition remains just, inclusive, and equitable.

Green hydrogen represents one of the most significant opportunities for India. Under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the country is targeting annual production of 5 million metric tonnes by 2030, with the potential to scale further as export markets develop. Capacities for electrolyser manufacturing and hydrogen production are already being awarded, positioning India as a competitive global hub for green molecules.

Beyond hydrogen, India is making strong progress across several other key areas. Compressed bio-gas is one example, with more than 130 plants already operational and many more under development, converting agricultural waste into clean energy while generating additional income for farmers.

India is also accelerating work on sustainable aviation fuel to decarbonise one of the hardest-to-abate sectors, as well as on second-generation ethanol and waste-to-energy projects that combine technological innovation with social and environmental benefits.

Digitalisation is another important enabler. The use of AI, data analytics, and advanced monitoring systems is improving efficiency across exploration and production, refining, and the rapidly expanding city gas distribution networks. When aligned with policy and scale, technology becomes a powerful driver of transition.

India Energy Week has quickly established itself as one of the world’s most consequential energy platforms, and the 2026 edition will reflect India’s “energy abundance” mindset.

The event will move beyond a simplistic division between traditional and renewable energy. Instead, it will showcase how India is greening its conventional energy sectors through efficiency improvements and emerging solutions, while simultaneously scaling up the fuels and technologies of the future.

India Energy Week provides a space where policy, industry, technology, and investment converge.

Airlines may be surprise beneficiaries of the popularity of weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro thanks to increased profits as a resut of lower fuel costs.

Analysts from Wall Street investment bank Jefferies have calculated that if weight loss trends continue, a 10 per cent slimmer society could yield an average 4 per cent increase in earnings per share among major US airlines.

“A slimmer society = lower fuel consumption,” equities analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote. Fuel makes up 20 to 30 per cent of an airline’s cost, which is reflected in the price of the ticket.

Since 2022, the US adult obesity rate has declined to 37 per cent from about 40 per cent, as GLP-1 appetite and blood sugar regulator drugs reshape the population.

“With the drug now available in pill form and obesity rates falling, broader usage could have further implications for waistlines,” wrote Kahyaoglu, who noted that until GLP-1, passenger weight had been out of the control of many people.

Looking at airlines American, Delta, United and Southwest, her team calculated that a 10 per cent slimmer US society would mean a 2 per cent weight saving, which could trim fuel expenses by up to 1.5 per cent. This would add an average of 3.9 per cent in earnings per share across the four airlines.

Aviation company Honeywell estimates that every 450 grams of a plane’s weight, “including crew, passengers, baggage and the aircraft itself”, totals up to about $US10,000 ($14,436) in annual fuel costs on commercial aircraft.

Sydney-based Peter Harbison, chairman of GreenerAirlines.com, which promotes a greener aviation industry, said that when the GLP-1 drugs were rolled out, there was an expectation once-obese customers could begin to travel, leading to a rise in demand.

“Airlines had already factored in heavier passenger weight years ago,” he said.

“I think the drugs’ impact would be marginal for the weight of aircraft in the short-to-medium term, given there are so many other variables,” Harbison said. “But if you were getting up to 1 per cent of the cost of the flight, it makes a difference.”

In Australia, about 32 per cent of the population was obese in 2022, according to the Bureau of Statistics.

The reported use of the weight loss drugs in the US is higher as well, rising from 5.8 per cent of US adults in early 2024 to 12.4 per cent today.

As of 2025, about 2 per cent of Australians were taking Ozempic and similar GLP-1 drugs. Nearly half of the doses were bought privately.

Aviation lecturer Salim Hijazeen, of Melbourne’s Swinburne University, cautioned that GLP-1s were unlikely to make more than a scant difference to airlines.

“Generally, airlines would try and focus on fuel optimisation more than wanting to plan around what the potential health trends of the population are,” he said.

“It’s very unlikely that something like this could significantly impact the weight of the aircraft in terms of the passenger weight,” he said.

Jefferies’ analyst Kahyaoglu calculated her forecast by combining the weight of 178 passengers aboard a Boeing 737 Max 8, with average pre-Ozempic weight per person being 81.6 kilograms. Factoring in the number of people who take drugs such as Ozempic and their impact, the same passengers’ weight was tallied at an average of 80.7 kilograms.

The former yielded a maximum take-off weight of 82,190 kilograms vs 80,737 kilograms post use of weight loss drugs – a difference of 1453 kilograms.

What's happening?

A new study, published in the journal Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, examined the presence of Tire Wear Particles at the Milan Linate Airport in Italy.

Tire wear particles, or TWPs, are non-exhaust pollutants that shed from tires as they move across pavement.

Researchers found that the airport was a significant local source of hazardous organic compounds, specifically benzothiazole (BTH) components, which can be released from TWPs.

They discovered several types of BTH — which is used to produce antifreeze, de-icing solutions, and pesticides, among other industrial applications — in outdoor air, at levels comparable to those in cities with heavy traffic.

Why is this study concerning?

According to the researchers, this study provided the first evidence of benzothiazoles in atmospheric particulate matter at an airport.

They described the compounds as ""irritant, corrosive, and acutely toxic to living organisms.""

A summary of the research published by News-Medical.net noted that the risk of occupational exposure to BTHs at Milan airport was low.

However, this study helps researchers better understand the environmental impacts of air travel.

For years, scientists have known that airplane exhaust contains harmful air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

In fact, a 2010 study estimated that aircraft exhaust kills about 8,000 people annually.

Plus, air travel is a major contributor to the overheating of the planet, accounting for about 2.5% of global carbon dioxide pollution and about 4% of warming to date.

What's being done about it?

Airlines and experts have made several exciting advancements that could make air travel more eco-friendly in the future.

For instance, Delta is partnering with JetZero to overhaul its aircraft design, aiming to improve fuel efficiency by 50%.

And one group of scientists discovered that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel could reduce pollution by up to 90%.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pollution-1124240831.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 03:57:45.892578

by Senator Ken Rozenboom

Friends, occasionally I write a newsletter devoted to a single important issue facing us at the Capitol. This is one of those times, and the issue at hand is the ongoing controversy regarding property rights vs. carbon pipelines. Here is my view.

Pipeline Solutions

For several years we in Iowa have been pulled apart by policies established in Washington DC. In this case, I’m referring to massive tax credits for low carbon ethanol and the need for a carbon sequestration pipeline. Of course, that has led to a contentious five year debate over property rights in Iowa. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can find a way forward…we must find a way forward. I believe there is a win-win solution.

We are at an inflection point in Iowa. In 2004, American farmers raised the first 10 billion bushel corn crop. In 2025 American corn farmers produced a 17 billion bushel corn crop, a 70% increase in 21 years. Remarkable!

But in 2025 Iowa farmers lost over a dollar for every bushel of corn raised which translates to a $2.9 billion loss for Iowa farmers. Soybean prices also remain well under the cost of production, representing an additional $1 billion loss. And all that translates into an unhealthy agricultural economy and a large hole in the Iowa annual state budget.

So how do we sell 17 billion bushels of corn? Well, that can be a problem. Traditional markets for corn have been reliable over that last 25 years. Livestock feed markets remain strong in Iowa. Fructose syrup production has been steady, but recent policy changes in Washington relative to the American diet threaten that. Corn exports have been variable over the last 25 years. The only growing market since that first 10 billion bushel corn crop has been ethanol. Thankfully the ethanol market demand for corn has increased from around 1 billion bushels per year to 5.3 billion bushels. Over one half of Iowa’s corn production now goes into ethanol.

Meanwhile Brazil has greatly improved their agriculture infrastructure, and corn and soybean production has increased dramatically. Because their climate allows double-cropping, Brazilian farmers can produce corn and soybean 30% cheaper than we can. Those dynamics have allowed Brazil to become the dominant exporter of corn and soybeans, pushing American farmers into a secondary role.

It’s clear that Iowa’s farmers face a tough future unless we can find a way to develop new markets. And obviously, as Iowa agriculture goes, so goes Iowa’s economy. This is critical!

There are several potentially large new markets for low carbon intensity ethanol. The most promising new market is the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). But that requires ethanol that has the low carbon intensity score as established by the airline industry and the federal 45Z tax credits. Hence, the need for carbon sequestration and pipelines to move the carbon. Currently SAF is being made only from imported Brazilian ethanol which has the required low carbon score. Recently, the state of Nebraska has been aggressively gearing up to produce low carbon intensity ethanol that will allow it to develop a SAF industry, and their corn producers will benefit greatly. Iowans don’t like to lose to Nebraska on the football field. We certainly don’t want to lose the corn production battle to them!

There are other promising new value-added uses for carbon such as its use for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). It’s hard to imagine anything that is more in the public interest for the Iowa economy than a CO2 pipeline that allows our state to meet the demand of these new markets.

So how do we move forward? How do we restore profitability to Iowa’s farmers while providing even better property rights protections for landowners? What is the win-win solution?

Let’s update Iowa’s outdated property rights provisions. Let’s widen the corridor for possible projects so that they can obtain voluntary easements from willing landowners and go around unwilling landowners. These features are included in Senate File 2067.

Please remember that 74% of the Summit pipeline route has been obtained from 1400 landowners that do recognize the need for Iowa to produce low carbon intensity ethanol. Their property rights must also be respected.

Once we move forward with infrastructure that will allow for the capture and the transport of carbon, as Nebraska has, we can build some very significant value-added new markets for our corn.

Most Iowans dislike how much Washington meddles in our affairs. For example, I’ve never met a farmer that liked getting a subsidy check from Washington. I’ve also never met a farmer that didn’t cash the check. This time the subsidy is in the form of a tax credit for low carbon intensity ethanol. It’s time for Iowa to cash the check.

The essential question is this: Which sign do we put up on Iowa’s borders? “Open for Business” or “Going Out of Business”? For me, the answer is obvious.",http://oskynews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/45643633-ecf4-4854-9c8e-effa5929dad0.png,N,,2026-01-26 03:59:00.010300

SAF has the same technical properties as regular aviation fuel and can be blended with conventional jet fuel without modifying aircraft engines or airport fuel infrastructure.
• Require fuel suppliers to incorporate SAF into aviation fuel blends offered at Japanese airports.
By subsidising SAF costs and potentially requiring blended fuel at the pump, Japan positions itself to lead in environmentally responsible aviation in Asia.","The Japanese government is preparing a formal policy to subsidise the cost of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for domestic airlines as part of a wider effort to reduce aviation carbon emissions and support cleaner flight operations. Under this plan, fuel suppliers could be required to provide SAF‑blended aviation fuel at airports across Japan. The policy framework is being developed through official councils and is expected to be finalised by fiscal year 2026, backed by revisions to the Airport Law and related regulations.

Japan’s SAF initiatives are rooted in government targets and council discussions aimed at decarbonising the air transport sector, including a 10 per cent SAF blending target by 2030 and incentives for SAF production and supply chain investment. These targets and strategic frameworks are outlined in official government planning documents and policy proposals from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).

What Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Is and Why It Matters

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced from biomass, used cooking oil, waste fats or other low‑carbon feedstocks. SAF has the same technical properties as regular aviation fuel and can be blended with conventional jet fuel without modifying aircraft engines or airport fuel infrastructure. Official documents show SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent, helping aviation meet international emissions commitments.

Even though SAF offers strong environmental benefits, its production costs remain approximately two to four times higher than fossil jet fuel. This price gap has historically limited wide adoption by airlines without policy support.

Government Policy Framework and Subsidy Plans

Japan’s government is advancing a policy framework that could:

• Subsidise SAF procurement costs for domestic airlines.

• Require fuel suppliers to incorporate SAF into aviation fuel blends offered at Japanese airports.

• Expand feedstock collection — including used cooking oil — through cooperation with municipalities and industry partners.

These plans are being developed through government‑industry councils such as the Public‑Private Council for the Promotion of SAF, which are part of official policy documents released by METI and MLIT discussing SAF supply expansion and regulatory goals.

Advantage: Reduced Carbon Emissions and Greener Flights

For travellers, the biggest advantage of Japan’s SAF support policy is cleaner aviation with lower carbon emissions per flight. SAF use helps airlines reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing flight performance. By subsidising SAF costs and potentially requiring blended fuel at the pump, Japan positions itself to lead in environmentally responsible aviation in Asia.

This also enhances Japan’s attractiveness as a destination for environmentally conscious travellers, particularly those who prioritise low‑carbon travel options when choosing flights and airlines.

Advantage: Strengthening Domestic SAF Production and Economy

Government backing could stimulate local SAF industry growth, encourage private investment, and create jobs in fuel production, feedstock collection and processing. Official policy discussions include capital investment support and tax incentives aimed at building domestic SAF facilities and supply chains. This could reduce dependence on imported fuel and stabilise fuel supply for airlines.

Disadvantage: Higher Costs May Affect Airfares

A key disadvantage for travellers is the potential rise in ticket prices. To cover subsidised SAF procurement, Japan’s proposal may require airlines to pass part of the cost to passengers as a fuel surcharge of several tens of yen per ticket. This means travellers could face slightly higher fares, especially on long‑haul flights where fuel costs are a larger share of expenses.

Disadvantage: Implementation Complexity and Timing

Policy development and implementation — including airport fuel blend mandates and legal revisions — could take time. Full rollout of blended SAF at all airports may be gradual, meaning travellers may not see immediate benefits. Regulatory complexity and coordination between airlines, refineries, and government agencies can slow progress, potentially delaying widespread SAF use.

Practical Tips for Travellers

• Be aware that ticket pricing may include SAF‑related fuel charges.

• Check airline sustainability initiatives to see if they use SAF blends on specific routes.

• For environmentally focused travel planning, consider airlines that prioritise SAF uptake.

• Stay updated on government announcements, as final policy details are expected by 2026.

In the two weeks since my last column, US president Donald Trump has really set his sights on Greenland, threatening tariffs on countries that don’t like the idea of his country acquiring the island, and then citing everything from his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize to losing control of a critical archipelago in the Indian Ocean as reasons for his hyperfixation. And then he does a bit of a turn-around and says that a “framework” allowing the US to acquire the island has been agreed upon, whatever that means.

Meanwhile, the US’ erstwhile allies across Europe and the Pacific Rim scramble to figure out a response that would somehow keep the current international order – or at least allow them to move forward while recognizing that things will never be the same, judging from the speech made by Canadian prime minister Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos. In it, he called for “middle powers” to get their acts together to ensure international law and institutions are upheld as superpowers essentially throw their weight around more brashly. On the other side, there’s Trump spruiking his “Board of Peace” proposal, which some now see as intended to bypass the United Nations.

Now, these events may seem so far away from the Philippines, but apart from the possible geopolitical ripple effects outlined in my last column – particularly on China and the disputed territories within the South China Sea – these movements can affect, if not determine, efforts that our own government is making to ensure our competitiveness in the global stage. It is worth remembering that while we in the private sector have a significant role to play in building supply chain stability and resilience, it is the government that fosters a healthy investment environment and invests in the necessary infrastructure and institutions that ensures the continued working of these supply chains. In some matters, we can completely do nothing.

Where does the Philippines lie amidst this transition (or unmasking, as some argue this is just making private imperial ambitions public)? The Marcos administration has worked hard to strengthen its economic relationship with the United States, especially after its predecessor, the Duterte administration, all but favored China in its pursuit of a supposedly “independent” foreign policy. The government will point to at least two wins: negotiations that led to Liberation Day tariffs that are lower than Trump initially announced; and the continuation of American investment in the Luzon Economic Corridor program, which includes a potentially game-changing rail link between Subic, Manila and Batangas ports, as well as Clark airport.

However, China remains one of our biggest trade partners, with roughly USD 34.5 billion worth of Chinese goods entering the country in 2024. Alongside the territorial dispute and the military provocations within our exclusive economic zone, there remains a strengthening of our trade ties, and businesses from both countries entering each other’s markets.

In addition, the Philippines has set its sights beyond its immediate neighborhood, inking trade agreements with South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, and mapping out similar agreements with other countries around the world, including the United States. We have also seen the Marcos administration strengthen political ties with Japan and Australia, to present a counterweight of sorts to China’s territorial ambitions.

These efforts do not amount to nothing, but it does feel like the pace of events around the world would be faster than our ability to respond. Fostering stronger ties does not happen in a snap, and building more competitive infrastructure definitely doesn’t. Within ASEAN we are continuing to fall behind in investments, not helped by high energy and logistics costs as well as governance concerns – something definitely highlighted by the never-ending controversy surrounding flood control projects, which we all know is just the tip of the iceberg.

With a possible global realignment in full swing, we should stick closer to our neighbors to keep domestic consumption going and to give exporters access to outside markets. That said, are we in the best position to take advantage of these shifts? Can we turn these roadblocks to opportunities? I cannot answer that, but I do know… the government has some catching up to do, before we can do our own catching up.

E depois há algumas surpresas”, salientou Pedro Quintela, sem avançar muito na última parte.
Num universo que compõe quase um milhar de pessoas, Pedro Quintela frisa que na Abreu a “lógica passa por melhorar a rentabilidade a partir da diferenciação”.","Jorge Abreu, presidente do Conselho de Administração da Abreu, já o tinha afirmado no discurso inicial da Abreu Summit 2026, que se realizou no sábado, 24 de janeiro, ao salientar que durante os dias 23 e 24 de janeiro: “os três pilares que sustentam a visão estratégica do grupo para o ano de 2026 são Ambição, Atitude e Ação”.

Pedro Quintela, diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu, reafirmou esta posição do líder do Grupo Abreu, não sem antes admitir à imprensa, à margem da Abreu Summit, que o evento “é importante por várias razões, porque ajuda a que se perceba o que o grupo fez em 2025, pomos toda a gente a conhecer tudo o que aconteceu nas diferentes áreas e, depois, lançamos o mote para mais um ano”.

Antes de avançar para 2026, Pedro Quintela fez um balanço de 2025, afirmando que “correu bem. Foi um ano positivo, em todos os negócios em Portugal, com uns cresceram mais do que outros”, dando o exemplo dos “Bed Banks onde a Abreu cresceu mais do que no Lazer, crescemos também mais no Corporativo, embora tenhamos crescido, também, no Lazer”.

Pegando nas palavras do presidente do Conselho de Administração do grupo, Pedro Quintela colocou a tónica na palavra “Ambição”, até porque “acreditamos que podemos fazer mais. E o que queremos transmitir às 700 pessoas que estão aqui, e às 1.300 que fazem parte do grupo, é que se todos tivermos lojas com resultados excelentes, tivermos pessoas com resultados excelentes, se passarmos do suficiente ao bom, vamos ter sempre os melhores anos de sempre”.

Por isso, se 2025 foi “suficiente”, queremos saltar para o bom em 2026”, admitiu o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu.

Grandes Viagens

E se 2026 começou logo com alguns condicionantes para as viagens, Pedro Quintela lembrou que, em 2025, por exemplo, “não se pôde viajar para Israel e vendíamos muito Israel. Agora no início de 2026, não está tão calmo na zona da Venezuela ou da Colômbia. As pessoas assustam-se, mas o certo é que as pessoas o que fazem é aquilo que temos sentido dos clientes, procuram outros caminhos e nós também”.

Assim, o que aconteceu na Abreu foi simples: “tivemos um trabalho muito incisivo em 2025 neste tema que passou por procurar destinos diferentes, formas até de vender diferentes daquelas que eram as mais tradicionais, como o online”, explicando Pedro Quintela que o canal de vendas por vídeo chamada mais que duplicou a equipa, de um ano para o outro, passando a ter 12 elementos, salientando, igualmente, a Abreu Experience.

Outro segmento que correu bem à Abreu foi o das Grandes Viagens, afirmando Pedro Quintela que “tivemos o melhor ano sempre”, esperando que 2026 seja “ainda melhor, porque é produto diferenciado e onde estamos a investir muito nestes últimos tempos”.

Até porque, considera o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu, “sabemos que a gestão das margens do produto mais massificado não é tão fácil“.

Voltando a 2025, ano em que a Abreu comemorou 185 anos, Pedro Quintela destacou o regresso ao “Mundo Abreu” ao formato evento presencial, assim como a Expo Abreu presença na BTL. E o certo é que, em 2026, estas iniciativas e ações mantém-se, com o “Mundo Abreu” a já ter datas marcadas para 14 e 15 de fevereiro próximo, enquanto a Expo Abreu terá palco em outubro.

E se fazer 186 anos não é a mesma coisa que fazer 185, Pedro Quintela revela que, ”eventualmente, as grandes surpresas estarão guardadas para quando atingirmos os 190 anos”.

Crescer, sim, mas com rentabilidade

O ano que fechou a comemoração do 185.º aniversário do Grupo Abreu permitiu, no entanto, “ficar bem acima dos 500 milhões de euros” em faturação na Abreu Viagens, com a Abreu Logistics a crescer “para mais de 100 milhões de euros”, sem falar nos negócios que a Abreu possui no Brasil, EUA, Espanha ou Angola.

Para 2026, e tendo “sempre uma visão consciente, mas otimista, vamos crescer outra vez, porque estamos a criar condições para que isso aconteça, seja porque continuamos a ter cada vez mais portugueses a viajar, seja porque conquistamos quota de mercado”.

Sem fixar nenhuma meta para este ano que agora começou, Pedro Quintela reconheceu, contudo, que “gostávamos de crescer, idealmente, 10% ao ano, mas há negócios que crescem muito mais do que isso, há outros que crescem menos do que isso”.

Contudo para o executivo do grupo de viagens mais antigo do mundo, o objetivo “não é só o crescimento ao nível das vendas, mas também sustentar um crescimento na margem”, porque para Pedro Quintela, “não adianta crescer muito em vendas se a margem não acompanhar esse crescimento”, referindo, igualmente, a “produtividade, as pessoas, os sistemas, as distintas parcerias, a Inteligência Artificial, os projetos de employer branding” como “fundamentais para a estratégia deste ano”.

“O maior investimento que vamos fazer, e que fazemos todos os anos, é nas nossas pessoas, seja pela premiação, seja no acompanhamento salarial. Em paralelo, a parte tecnológica vai ter alguns avanços, seja a nível da IA, ferramentas de booking, estamos a desenvolver algumas diferentes. E depois há algumas surpresas”, salientou Pedro Quintela, sem avançar muito na última parte. ,

Certo é que, também no desenvolvimento de produto haverá um forte investimento, admitindo o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu que “estamos cada vez mais a levar as nossas equipas de tour operação ou agência a viajar para conhecer o produto, para construir o produto, para acompanhar o cliente enquanto este está a viajar e sentir o feedback, para depois perceber o que é que ainda se pode ajustar no produto que foi lançado”.

Num universo que compõe quase um milhar de pessoas, Pedro Quintela frisa que na Abreu a “lógica passa por melhorar a rentabilidade a partir da diferenciação”.

Quanto à tendência que se regista com a compra antecipada das viagens, o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu admitiu que “veio para ficar. Nós em outubro, na Expo Abreu, já estávamos a vender viagens de verão. O cliente voltou a comprar mais cedo, porque sabe que consegue melhor preço, consegue disponibilidade”.

Antecipação não compra já não é “nova”

A quanto aos destinos para 2026, Pedro Quintela volta a destacar Cabo Verde, “que está sempre no topo”, enquanto nos charters o destaque mantém-se nas Caraíbas e Porto Santo. Nas grandes viagens, Quintela refere que “a Tailândia tem vindo a acentuar um crescimento que não tinha antes da pandemia, o Japão continua a ser um fenómeno”, concluindo que “as grandes viagens neste momento andam muito na Ásia”.

Se tudo aponta para um ano de 2026 em crescendo, o mês de janeiro confirma-o, com Pedro Quintela a revelar que “o nível de reservas para o ano está acima da mesma altura do ano passado [janeiro 2025]. “Por isso é que isto reforça o nosso otimismo de que vamos ter um ano exigente, vamos ter de trabalhar muito, mas se conseguirmos pôr em prática tudo aquilo que temos presente, provavelmente, vamos ter um ano melhor que 2025”, considera o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu.

A concluir, Pedro Quintela voltou a colocar a tónica na rentabilidade, até porque, “se pormos um preço que hoje o cliente vê como baixo, nunca mais vamos pôr um preço mais alto”. De resto, o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu quis deixar bem vincado que “as empresas não vivem de vendas, vivem de resultados. Se esmagamos as margens e até desgraduamos o produto, não vamos ter resultado”.

Aproveitando a deixa do presidente do Turismo de Portugal, Carlos Abade, no arranque do Abreu Summit 2026, onde referia que o objetivo de Portugal era “crescer em valor e não em volume”, Pedro Quintela terminou a salientar que “o objetivo é vender melhor, não necessariamente mais, porque se vendemos melhor, vamos ter melhores margens, vamos ter equipas melhores, vamos ter clientes mais satisfeitos”.

O Parlamento quer manter o direito dos viajantes a uma indemnização por um atraso de três horas, além da simplificação dos procedimentos de reembolso e da gratuitidade da bagagem de cabina.

Nesse sentido, o Parlamento Europeu adotou a sua posição (632 votos a favor, 15 votos contra e 9 abstenções) para a revisão das alterações das regras relativas aos passageiros dos transportes aéreos sugeridas pelos países da UE em junho de 2025. Os eurodeputados votaram, na passada quarta-feira, contra o esforço dos ministros da UE para enfraquecer os direitos dos passageiros dos transportes aéreos, em vigor desde 2004 e cujo objetivo é garantir que os passageiros tenham proteção suficiente em caso de perturbações nas viagens.

Os eurodeputados querem manter o direito dos passageiros dos transportes aéreos a serem reembolsados ou reencaminhados e a pedirem uma indemnização se um voo sofrer um atraso superior a três horas, se for cancelado ou se lhes for recusado o embarque.

Recorde-se que o Conselho Europeu pressionava para que a indemnização seja aplicada apenas após um atraso de quatro a seis horas, consoante a distância do voo.

O Parlamento opõe-se, assim, à redução dos atuais montantes de compensação por perturbações dos voos e propõe que sejam fixados entre 300 e 600 euros, consoante a distância do voo, enquanto os governos dos Estados-Membros pretendiam fixar uma compensação entre 300 e 500 euros.

Com a responsabilidade das companhias aéreas limitada a situações sob o seu controlo, o Parlamento pretende renovar a lista das circunstâncias extraordinárias que lhes permitiriam renunciar à sua responsabilidade de pagar indemnizações, circunstâncias que incluem, atualmente, catástrofes naturais, guerras, condições meteorológicas ou conflitos laborais imprevistos que afetam o operador aéreo, o aeroporto ou o prestador de serviços de navegação aérea.

Os eurodeputados querem que esta lista seja exaustiva e que a Comissão Europeia a atualize regularmente.

Além disso, os eurodeputados concordam com o Conselho que deve ser mantido em todas as circunstâncias “o dever das companhias de fornecer bebidas aos passageiros retidos a cada duas horas para além da hora de partida inicial, uma refeição após três horas e uma estadia máxima de três noites por longos atrasos”, considerando que “o limite de três noites ofereceria às companhias aéreas maior previsibilidade e pouparia custos financeiros indevidos”.

Os eurodeputados querem a introdução de formulários pré-preenchidos para os pedidos de indemnização e reembolso, de modo a “simplificar o tratamento destes pedidos e evitar que passageiros e companhias aéreas recorram a agências de reclamações”. De acordo com a posição do Parlamento, as transportadoras aéreas teriam de enviar aos passageiros afetados por perturbações da viagem (cancelamento ou atrasos) um formulário pré-preenchido no prazo de 48 horas após o incidente (a posição do Conselho exige um formulário pré-preenchido apenas após o cancelamento, e não após atrasos consideráveis). Os viajantes teriam então um ano para apresentar um pedido.

Os passageiros devem ter o direito de transportar consigo no avião, e sem custos adicionais, um artigo pessoal (como uma mala de mão, uma mochila ou um computador portátil que possa ser acondicionado sob o banco à frente do passageiro), bem uma pequena bagagem de mão com dimensões máximas de 100 cm (comprimento, largura e altura combinados) e cujo peso não seja superior a sete quilos.

Na comunicação do Parlamento Europeu pode, também, ler-se que “devem ser eliminadas as taxas adicionais que os viajantes são, por vezes, forçados a pagar pela correção de erros no nome do passageiro ou pelo check-in no seu voo, defendem os deputados”, acrescentando que “os passageiros devem ter o direito de escolher entre cartões de embarque digitais e em papel”.

A posição do Parlamento inclui disposições em específico para os passageiros com deficiência ou mobilidade reduzida. “Estes viajantes devem ter direito a indemnização, reencaminhamento e assistência por parte das companhias aéreas se perderem um voo devido ao facto de o aeroporto não os ter ajudado a chegar à porta de embarque a tempo, defendem os eurodeputados. Os passageiros com mobilidade reduzida, as mulheres grávidas, os bebés e as crianças num carrinho de bebé com um acompanhante devem ter prioridade ao embarcar, enquanto os seus acompanhantes devem estar sentados num lugar adjacente sem incorrer em custos adicionais”, lê-se no texto.

Há muito que o tema da aviação sustentável está lançado, com diversos objetivos e metas traçadas pela União Europeia. Contudo, no que diz respeito ao Combustível Sustentável de Aviação (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF sigla em inglês), são várias as vozes na indústria que apontam a reduzida produção e os preços (demasiado) altos para se conseguir atingir as metas definidas em Bruxelas. Na KLM, além da renovação da frota e das medidas operacionais, o SAF constitui um importante investimento. Mas não só. Jolanda Stevens, Program Manager Zero Emission Aviation da KLM, refere ao Publituris que a companhia está “empenhada em exercer um papel de liderança na construção deste futuro sustentável para a aviação” e, por isso, “está envolvida em diversas parcerias que contribuem para o desenvolvimento e a adoção da aviação movida a hidrogénio”.

No entanto, Stevens admite que é preciso criar um level playing field (ambiente com condições equitativas) em que os pioneiros não sejam penalizados por liderar. E isto requer “incentivos, subsídios e acesso antecipado em todo o ecossistema da aviação”.

A KLM tem assumido publicamente o compromisso de alcançar net-zero até 2050. Quais são os principais pilares desta estratégia e que metas intermédias foram estabelecidas?

A estratégia de zero emissões da KLM assenta em vários pilares fundamentais, nomeadamente, renovação da frota, eficiência operacional, uso de combustível alternativo de aviação (SAF) e inovação em tecnologias de emissões zero.

Até 2030, pretendemos reduzir as nossas emissões de CO2 por passageiro em 30%, face a 2019.

No imediato, que medidas estão a ser implementadas para reduzir as emissões, tanto ao nível da frota como das operações diárias?

A KLM está a investir sete mil milhões de euros na renovação da frota ao longo dos próximos anos. Para as rotas europeias, isto inclui o Embraer 195-E2, operado pela KLM Cityhopper, e as aeronaves Airbus A320neo e A321neo, 10 das quais já foram entregues.

Para os voos intercontinentais, a KLM adicionou recentemente novos Boeing 787 à sua frota. O primeiro Airbus A350 é esperado em 2026 e será seguido pela introdução dos A350F em 2027. Estes aviões também vão contribuir significativamente para a redução das emissões.

Operacionalmente, temos otimizado as trajetórias dos voos, reduzido o tempo de taxing (circulação da aeronave na placa) e eletrificado as operações em terra para minimizar o consumo de combustível.

Que papel terão os combustíveis sustentáveis de aviação (SAF) na redução da pegada de carbono da KLM? Considera que a disponibilidade e os custos de produção ainda são o maior obstáculo?

Além da renovação da frota e das medidas operacionais, o SAF é um objetivo importante de investimento para a KLM. Desde 2022, a KLM incorpora SAF em todos os voos com partidas de Amesterdão, e tem estado a aumentar a quota gradualmente.

Apesar da crescente utilização, o SAF mantém-se caro e escasso, o que limita o seu impacto. Para acelerar a sua adoção, a KLM colabora com parceiros como a SkyNRG e DG Fuels, e foi cofundadora do Sky Power, um projeto criado para escalar a produção de e-SAF. Todas as sobretaxas SAF dos bilhetes são reinvestidas na compra de SAF. A KLM também envolve os seus passageiros e clientes empresariais nesta contribuição, com o objetivo de tornar a aviação sustentável mais acessível e impactante.

Elétrico ou hidrogénio?

A indústria fala cada vez mais de aviões elétricos e a hidrogénio. A KLM está envolvida em projetos-piloto nesta área? Que perspetiva existe para a sua adoção a médio e longo prazo?

As aeronaves movidas a hidrogénio e elétricas a bateria podem tornar-se uma solução viável para as rotas de curto-curso até 2035. Para acelerar esta transição, a KLM participa ativamente na investigação e em projetos-piloto com parceiros de todo o setor da aviação, tanto nacionais como internacionais.

Estas colaborações centram-se na união de forças na cadeia de valor como, por exemplo, testar novas tecnologias em condições reais num voo de demonstração, construir planos detalhados para estratégias aeroportuárias a longo prazo, construir redes de voos com novas tecnologias para melhor compreender o impacto das suas características, etc..

Até 2035, o primeiro avião de emissões zero com cerca de 75 lugares poderá estar pronto para substituir os aviões regionais mais pequenos, com potencial para substituições de aeronaves de corredor único até 2040. A KLM está empenhada em exercer um papel de liderança na construção deste futuro sustentável para a aviação.

Como avalia a importância da digitalização e da otimização operacional (ex.: rotas, eficiência de voo) no processo de descarbonização?

A digitalização e a otimização operacional são absolutamente cruciais no processo de descarbonização da aviação. Com a introdução de novas tecnologias de propulsão, como os aviões elétricos ou movidos a hidrogénio, a energia disponível a bordo será significativamente mais limitada face aos combustíveis fósseis tradicionais. Isto significa que cada joule de energia contará e que otimizar todos os aspetos da operação de voo, como o planeamento de rotas, os perfis de voo e os processos de turnaround, vai ser mais importante do que nunca.

Ao permitir a recolha de dados em tempo real e análises avançadas, a digitalização desempenha aqui um papel fundamental. Através de ferramentas digitais, vamos ser mais capazes de otimizar as rotas de voo com base nos dados disponíveis. A manutenção preditiva e o apoio à decisão assente em IA podem reduzir ainda mais o uso desnecessário de combustível ou energia.

Em suma, a digitalização é o facilitador que nos permitirá otimizar ainda mais a eficiência das nossas operações, o que é essencial quando se trabalha com recursos energéticos mais limitados. Assim, num futuro descarbonizado, as soluções digitais serão uma parte importante da otimização operacional e energética.

Colaboração e partilha

A KLM tem vindo a trabalhar com universidades, centros de investigação e fabricantes. Pode dar exemplos concretos de projetos em parceria com a academia e a indústria que estão a marcar este caminho para a aviação zero emissões?

A KLM está envolvida em diversas parcerias que contribuem para o desenvolvimento e a adoção da aviação movida a hidrogénio. (ver caixa)

Existe algum trabalho de partilha entre as várias companhias aéreas ou grupos de aviação para antecipar as metas ou trabalhar-se para a redução de custos e preços?

Atualmente, não existem colaborações formais entre companhias aéreas focadas especificamente em voos a hidrogénio ou elétricos, já que estas tecnologias ainda se encontram numa fase inicial de desenvolvimento.

No entanto, a KLM tem explorado ativamente soluções futuras e partilha insights através de iniciativas mais amplas da indústria. Um bom exemplo é o Aviation Challenge, que incentiva as companhias aéreas a tornarem os voos comerciais regulares mais sustentáveis.

De resto, a SkyTeam convida as companhias aéreas participantes a criar um impacto tangível e a partilhar aprendizagens em todo o setor. A KLM testa as inovações durante as operações e partilha os resultados com os parceiros, construindo conhecimento coletivo, identificando soluções escaláveis e ajudando a reduzir o impacto ambiental e os custos a longo prazo.

A cooperação entre companhias aéreas, fabricantes e entidades reguladoras é fundamental. Como vê o papel da colaboração setorial para acelerar a inovação e ultrapassar barreiras regulatórias e tecnológicas?

A colaboração intrassectorial é essencial para escalar a inovação e garantir normas harmonizadas. Cada player precisa de fazer o que nunca fez antes. Ao construirmos relações de confiança, ao criarmos pontos em comum, ao trabalharmos em projetos conjuntos e ao comunicarmos sobre os assuntos em que estamos envolvidos, estamos a construir colaborações sólidas.

Nestas parcerias, cada parte contribui com a sua expertise, trabalhando com base no conhecimento comum e criando entendimento mútuo para enfrentar os vários desafios. Como lidar com a perceção pública, como ponderar os riscos, tendo sempre a segurança como fator mais importante. Isto ajuda-nos a todos a caminhar na mesma direção.

A Air France-KLM é hoje um dos maiores grupos de aviação da Europa. Como é que esta dimensão ajuda a impulsionar a agenda da sustentabilidade e a ganhar escala em projetos de futuro?

Como grande player na Europa, temos uma voz forte no debate sobre o futuro da nossa indústria, que utilizamos para colaborar dentro e fora do setor da aviação, para reduzir o impacto negativo do transporte aéreo no ambiente.

Em 2023, o grupo Air France-KLM foi o maior comprador de SAF do mundo e está a impulsionar o mercado de SAF através da celebração de acordos de compra com diversos players em todo o mundo.

Em termos de perceção pública e experiência do cliente, como é que a KLM comunica estes esforços de sustentabilidade e envolve os passageiros nesta transformação?

Os voos elétricos e movidos a hidrogénio podem parecer distantes para muitos, mas a KLM envolve ativamente os passageiros nestes desenvolvimentos através de uma comunicação clara e acessível. Utilizamos o nosso website e a revista de bordo Holland Herald para explicar os esforços de sustentabilidade e as tecnologias futuras. A publicidade gratuita ajuda a ampliar as principais iniciativas, tornando a inovação mais tangível. Ao partilhar exemplos reais, como o nosso trabalho com a ZeroAvia, procuramos inspirar confiança e consciencialização.

O papel das start-ups

Na sua opinião, qual será a tecnologia disruptiva que mais pode mudar a aviação nos próximos 20 a 30 anos?

Não existe uma solução mágica. São necessárias múltiplas soluções no caminho para o netzero. Estas soluções precisam de ser desenvolvidas em paralelo,

cada uma tendo um lugar próprio na linha de soluções e desafios tecnológicos específicos. Por isso, é muito difícil prever qual será a principal tecnologia “vencedora”. Mas o que vemos é o grande impacto das start-ups.

As start-ups estão realmente a romper o status quo e a enriquecer a aviação com soluções inovadoras que não teriam surgido apenas de players estabelecidos. Este fluxo de novas ideias e desenvolvimento ágil é relativamente novo na aviação, que tradicionalmente tem sido dominada por alguns grandes fabricantes e abordagens conservadoras.

Embora os processos de certificação continuem a ser demorados e possam dificultar a rápida entrada no mercado, o ritmo do desenvolvimento tecnológico impulsionado pelas start-ups é inconfundível. Estão a abordar conceitos que vão desde a eletrificação e a propulsão a hidrogénio até à digitalização e à eficiência operacional.

Ainda que seja improvável uma solução rápida, estes novos intervenientes estão a acelerar o progresso e a remodelar a abordagem do setor em relação à sustentabilidade.

Quais são os principais desafios e oportunidades que o setor enfrenta para garantir que a aviação continua a ser um motor económico e social, mas com impacto ambiental reduzido?

O setor da aviação necessita de reduzir o seu impacto ambiental, mantendo a sua relevância social e económica. Os principais desafios incluem a disponibilidade limitada e o custo elevado dos SAF.

As oportunidades estão na renovação da frota, na eletrificação das operações em terra e em melhorias operacionais. A inovação em aeronaves a hidrogénio e elétricas, juntamente com a circularidade e a redução de resíduos, pode contribuir ainda mais para as metas climáticas.

Alcançar a neutralidade carbónica até 2050 exige políticas estáveis, investimentos estratégicos e colaboração entre a indústria e os governos.

Que mensagem deve ser dada à indústria e aos decisores políticos sobre o caminho para uma aviação de zero emissões?

Precisamos de criar um level playing field (ambiente com condições equitativas) em que os pioneiros não sejam penalizados por liderar. Isto requer incentivos, subsídios e acesso antecipado em todo o ecossistema da aviação. A regulamentação desempenha um papel crucial e as pessoas só mudam de comportamento quando norteadas por leis ou incentivos financeiros.

Os governos devem também ajudar a ajustar a compreensão por parte do público, comunicando o impacto ambiental da aviação de forma contextualizada. A estabilidade nas políticas de aviação é essencial para o planeamento a longo prazo.

Por último, precisamos que os decisores políticos apoiem ativamente a inovação, criando espaço para experimentar, colaborar e escalar tecnologias como o SAF e as aeronaves de emissões zero, ajudando a aviação a tornar-se mais sustentável sem comprometer o seu valor social.

,,2026-01-25 21:04:17+00:00,The Straits Times,How airplane streaks in the sky supercharge global warming | The Straits Times,Shabana Begum,,,,,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/how-airplane-streaks-in-the-sky-supercharge-global-warming,"But over a 100-year horizon, CO2’s impact would be 1.5 times larger than that of contrails,” said Dr Teoh.
In South-east Asia, 3.3 per cent of the flight distance in 2019 left persistent contrails, said Dr Teoh.
According to a mapping tool by non-profit organisation Contrails.org seen on Jan 24, a number of flights form warming contrails in South-east Asia.
By 2030, the greener fuel is expected to contribute just 2 per cent to 5 per cent of jet fuel.
Dr Teoh said: “In rerouting the flights, it can be done today.","SINGAPORE - The white streaks left by planes as they zip through the skies make a pretty sight, but they can harm the planet at times.

These vapour clouds formed from planes’ engine exhaust are known as condensation trails – or contrails – and can contribute to global warming if they stay in the skies for long.

In aviation’s climate footprint, contrails are the lesser-known warming sibling of jet fuel.

The International Civil Aviation Organization warned in a 2025 report that warming caused by contrails is expected to increase over time due to the projected rise in air traffic and the expected upward shift in flight altitudes.

Singapore is also looking into contrails in the Asia-Pacific as part of a

recently announced Aviation Meteorological Programme

. It is one of five priority areas under the national programme, which aims to tackle the effects of weather on flight operations in Singapore.

Contrails are created when hot water vapour, soot and other particles released from the plane’s exhaust mix with the frigid air at high altitudes. Water vapour condenses around the soot and freezes, creating ice crystals visible as linear clouds.

In regions super-saturated with ice, contrails can appear like thin cirrus clouds, persisting for hours. While they reflect some of the Sun’s energy back to space, they also trap and re-emit Earth’s radiation and heat, preventing them from escaping into space.

Contrails can account for 30 per cent to 65 per cent of warming caused by the aviation sector, depending on the metrics and time horizon used to calculate the impact, said Dr Roger Teoh, an honorary research fellow at Imperial College London, whose research is focused on aviation’s impact on climate change.

The effect of persistent contrails is similar to an acute fever or infection. When they persist for hours or up to a day, the result is an intense, strong warming effect, until the man-made clouds dissipate.

When planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted from the burning of jet fuel, the greenhouse gas stays in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years, Dr Teoh said. CO2’s warming effect is gradual and consistent, much like a chronic disease.

“If you were to compare the total warming caused by CO2 with contrails over 20 years, the effect of contrails could be twice that of CO2. But over a 100-year horizon, CO2’s impact would be 1.5 times larger than that of contrails,” said Dr Teoh.

Not all smoky streaks lead to warming. Persistent contrails are more frequently found in colder regions in the higher latitudes of Europe and North America, and are less common in the sub-tropical regions.

“In Singapore and Malaysia, you don’t see many contrails in the sky, compared with Europe, where you can see them almost every day,” he added.

This does not mean that the issue should be overlooked in this region.

Globally, roughly a fifth of all flights form persistent contrails, and only 3 per cent of those flights are responsible for 80 per cent of the warming effect.

No persistent contrails form below 37,000 feet in the tropics, where the atmosphere is warmer.

In South-east Asia, 3.3 per cent of the flight distance in 2019 left persistent contrails, said Dr Teoh.

These contrails were most likely generated by flights that cruised above 37,000 feet, where it is colder.

Such flights typically involve larger aircraft with two passenger aisles. Short-haul regional flights involving narrower aircraft usually cruise at lower altitudes and are unlikely to produce such contrails.

According to a mapping tool by non-profit organisation Contrails.org seen on Jan 24, a number of flights form warming contrails in South-east Asia. They include a flight from Melbourne to Singapore, and another from Java to Bali in Indonesia.

Under the Aviation Meteorological Programme, which was announced in December 2025, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and National Environment Agency will deepen scientific knowledge on contrails in this region, where the atmospheric conditions differ from those in Europe and North America.

“Currently, there is scarce data and research on contrails in the Asia-Pacific region, compared with better studied regions such as North America, Europe, and the North Atlantic,” both agencies told The Straits Times in a joint statement.

The agencies are engaging partners to scope relevant projects related to contrails, and are hoping that the programme’s work will “help inform future mitigation strategies and contribute to global policy development”.

Currently, the most viable and scalable solution to reduce the impact of contrails is to reroute planes or adjust their altitude away from contrail-producing pockets of the atmosphere.

This requires the use of weather forecasts incorporated into flight-planning software. Flight dispatchers on the ground can then work with pilots to select routes and avoid areas in real time.

In 2024, after American Airlines rerouted 22 flights to avoid contrails, a first-of-its-kind study was published showing that those flights slashed contrail formation by 64 per cent.

Dr Teoh noted that there are a few trade-offs with rerouting, such as burning extra fuel and potentially higher overflight fees when flying over some airspaces.

But by rerouting planes, contrail-induced warming can be reduced by up to 50 per cent, and jet fuel consumption typically increases by no more than 1 per cent for a given flight, he added.

When ST asked Singapore Airlines if it has embarked on any projects to limit contrails, an airline spokesperson said the airline is unable to provide data on contrail generation or discuss specific initiatives at present, and will share more when appropriate.

Switching to

sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

– made from used cooking oil, animal fat and biofuel – is another solution to tackle contrails because it emits less soot particles when burnt. But SAF requires a longer timeline to scale.

By 2030, the greener fuel is expected to contribute just 2 per cent to 5 per cent of jet fuel.

Dr Teoh said: “In rerouting the flights, it can be done today. You don’t need any additional (major) infrastructure. Using SAF does not need rerouting, but there is not much supply now.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d0aa82b580c4784b9a5d441c396db123475d03adc3cb61c3307f10a768d5e424,N,,2026-01-25 16:56:56.212946

The Analytical Deep Dive: Global Giants and Market Dynamics

Global aerospace leaders such as Airbus and Boeing are demonstrating a deep commitment to India's growth narrative. Airbus is significantly expanding its local footprint, aiming to increase annual sourcing from India to $2 billion by 2030 and establishing final assembly lines for C-295 aircraft and H125 helicopters in partnership with Tata Advanced Systems. Boeing mirrors this strategy, sourcing over $1.25 billion annually from more than 300 Indian suppliers and investing in local manufacturing and skill development, aligning with the 'Make in India' initiative. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) also plays a crucial role, though its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at approximately 45.0 as of January 2026, suggesting a premium valuation. The domestic market, however, is characterized by a strong duopoly. IndiGo commands over 64% of the domestic market share, while the Air India Group holds approximately 26-27%. Despite this market dominance, both major players have faced recent operational challenges, including disruptions from new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FTDL) regulations affecting IndiGo and financial pressures on Air India, highlighting the complexities of profitable operations in India's competitive environment.

The Future Outlook: Innovation, Infrastructure, and Regulation

Wings India 2026 is set to highlight India's ambition to become a central hub for aviation services and innovation. The event will feature extensive exhibitions, aerobatic displays, and a conference exploring 13 thematic sessions covering airports, air cargo, sustainable aviation fuel, drones, and skilling. This focus aligns with the government's push for sector development, including the UDAN scheme for regional connectivity and significant investments in airport infrastructure. The evolving regulatory landscape, with increased emphasis on safety and operational governance, including revised FDTL rules, aims to ensure stable and secure growth. The ongoing expansion of airport infrastructure and the development of MRO facilities are critical components in India's strategy to leverage its engineering talent and become a comprehensive global aviation powerhouse.",https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_69761494bb02ae236024ff84_1769346254801.jpeg,N,,2026-01-25 17:57:23.998402

The proposed deal could involve around 100 A220 aircraft, with options for additional units, as AirAsia advances its operational turnaround plans.

AirAsia Eyes Airbus A220s

The discussions center on the Airbus A220, a jet positioned for regional and short-haul routes with improved fuel efficiency and range flexibility. If finalized, this would be AirAsia’s first order for aircraft in the A220 category, expanding beyond its long-standing focus on the A320 family, Reuters reported.

Industry sources indicate the agreement may also include options for about 50 additional aircraft. An announcement could come soon, though both Airbus and AirAsia have declined to confirm details publicly. AirAsia stated it has no announcements to make at this time.

Talks around a high-density, 160-seat version of the A220 emerged ahead of the previous Paris Airshow. The variant would align with AirAsia’s low-cost model by increasing seat capacity while maintaining operating efficiency.

Brazilian manufacturer Embraer has also been in discussions with AirAsia, aiming to challenge Airbus’ dominant position within the airline’s fleet. Despite this competition, Airbus has renewed efforts to close the A220 deal, according to recent reporting.

Existing Airbus Commitments and Fleet Growth

AirAsia remains one of Airbus’ largest customers, with more than 350 A320 family aircraft already on order. In July, the airline added 50 A321XLR jets to support longer-range routes.

AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes previously stated that the airline was ready to introduce smaller aircraft to serve new destinations and strengthen regional connectivity. This position was reinforced by Deputy Group CEO Farouk Kamal, who confirmed ongoing discussions with manufacturers as the airline evaluates up to 150 additional aircraft.

AirAsia’s growth plans follow a challenging period caused by pandemic travel restrictions, which led Malaysia’s stock exchange to classify its parent company, Capital A, as financially distressed under PN17 status.

Fernandes, who also serves as CEO of Capital A, recently confirmed the group has completed its PN17 regularisation plan and is now working toward financial recovery. A restructuring that consolidates all AirAsia-branded aviation businesses under AirAsia X is expected to support cost reduction and operational focus, while Capital A concentrates on restoring financial stability.

About Airbus A220s

The Airbus A220 represents a new standard in the 100 to 160 seat aircraft category, blending advanced design with passenger-focused comfort. Built as a clean-sheet aircraft, it addresses modern airline needs while improving the travel experience.

With lower emissions, quieter operations, and a spacious cabin, the A220 delivers efficiency without compromise. It serves regional, transcontinental, and select international routes with consistent performance.

The A220 was designed from the ground up to redefine expectations for smaller single-aisle aircraft. Introduced into commercial service in 2016, it combines the economics of a regional jet with the comfort and capability of a larger narrowbody aircraft.

Originally launched by Bombardier as the C Series in 2008, the program achieved its first flight in September 2013. Airbus became the majority partner in 2018, integrating the aircraft into its global industrial and engineering ecosystem. This transition strengthened production scale, support infrastructure, and long-term development.

Today, the A220 is a core part of Airbus’ single-aisle portfolio. It supports routes ranging from short regional sectors to flights of up to 3,600 nautical miles, offering airlines flexibility across diverse networks.

A220 Program Growth and Service Record

Since entry into service, the A220 fleet has accumulated more than 3 million flight hours. It operates on over 1,800 routes connecting more than 480 destinations worldwide. Airlines value their fuel efficiency and reliability, while passengers consistently rate their cabin comfort and quietness highly.

The aircraft maintains approximately 99.0 percent operational reliability based on a three-month rolling average. This performance reinforces its role as a dependable asset for modern fleets.

The Mirabel production site in Canada reflects the program’s growth. What began with around 50 staff in 2008 has expanded to roughly 4,000 employees today, supporting large-scale manufacturing and continuous improvement.

Aircraft Variants and Performance Capabilities

The A220 Family includes two passenger variants with a common pilot type rating, allowing airlines to optimize crew flexibility.

A220-100

Capacity: 100 to 120 passengers

Range: Up to 3,600 nautical miles

A220-300

Capacity: 120 to 160 passengers

Range: Up to 3,450 nautical miles

A business aviation version is also available. The ACJ TwoTwenty offers over 12 hours of nonstop range and provides more than twice the cabin space of other ultra-long-range business jets in its class.

Passenger Experience Inside the A220

The A220 features the Airbus Airspace cabin, designed to maximize comfort and space. It offers the widest economy seats, the highest ceilings, and the largest cabin cross-section in its segment.

A 2-3 seating layout ensures most passengers sit by either a window or an aisle. Extra-large windows allow more natural light, while full-color LED ambient lighting enhances the cabin atmosphere. Overhead bins provide 20 percent more volume, improving boarding efficiency and personal storage.

Noise-dampening materials, advanced climate control, and a lower cabin altitude contribute to reduced fatigue and a calmer onboard environment.

Advanced Engineering and Aircraft Innovation

As a clean-sheet design, the A220 incorporates advanced materials and systems throughout the airframe. Approximately 40 percent of its structure uses advanced materials, including carbon fiber composites and titanium, reducing weight and improving fuel efficiency.

The aluminum-lithium fuselage increases corrosion resistance and structural durability. High-aspect-ratio wings, combined with advanced winglets, reduce drag and improve aerodynamic performance. Fly-by-wire controls allow real-time response to flight conditions, enhancing stability and comfort.

The aircraft is equipped with a modern avionics suite that supports optimized navigation, fuel management, and safety. Integrated systems enable real-time data sharing and predictive maintenance, reducing downtime and operating costs.

The cockpit layout uses intuitive flight systems, sidestick controllers, heads-up displays, and a single type rating across variants, reducing pilot workload and training complexity.

Environmental Performance and Sustainability

The A220 delivers a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft. Its lightweight structure and latest-generation engines also contribute to a noise footprint that is about 50 percent smaller.

The aircraft is certified to operate with up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel, with a target of full SAF capability by 2030. These features make it suitable for operations at noise-sensitive and urban airports while supporting airline sustainability goals.

Designed for Long-Term Relevance

The A220 was built with future operations in mind. Its combination of advanced aerodynamics, efficient engines, and modern systems positions it well for evolving regulatory and environmental requirements.

Lower operating costs per seat, estimated at 25 percent less than previous-generation aircraft, allow airlines to operate profitably across a wide range of markets while maintaining high passenger satisfaction.

Πριν από 50 χρόνια, η Air France και η British Airways εγκαινίασαν ταυτόχρονα την έναρξη του τακτικού δρομολογίου της, ανοίγοντας ένα μοναδικό κεφάλαιο στην ιστορία της πολιτικής αεροπορίας: την εποχή όπου ο Ατλαντικός μπορούσε να «μικρύνει» χρονική διάρκεια σε λιγότερο από 3,5 ώρες.

Στο υπερηχητικό ταξίδι, η εμπειρία δεν ήταν μόνο ταχύτητα. Ήταν και πολυτέλεια: αστακός και σαμπάνια σε μεγάλo υψόμετρο που θύμιζε πολυτελή κρουαζιέρα των αιθέρων, με το αεροσκάφος να κινείται σε ρυθμούς που οι περισσότεροι επιβάτες γραμμής δεν είχαν καν φανταστεί.

21 Ιανουαρίου 1976: Η πρώτη μέρα των επιβατικών πτήσεων

Δύο αεροσκάφη απογειώθηκαν σχεδόν ταυτόχρονα το μεσημέρι της 21ης Ιανουαρίου 1976 (11:40 ώρα Λονδίνου): το ένα από το Παρίσι και το άλλο από το Λονδίνο. Δεν ήταν τυχαίο: το Concorde αποτέλεσε κοινή βρετανο-γαλλική ανάπτυξη.

Το Concorde της Air France πέταξε μέσω της πρωτεύουσας της Σενεγάλης, Ντακάρ, προς το Ρίο ντε Τζανέιρο.

Η British Airways από το Λονδίνο κατευθύνθηκε προς το εμιράτο του Μπαχρέιν στον Περσικό Κόλπο.

Οι θέσεις για αυτές τις πρώτες πτήσεις είχαν σε ορισμένες περιπτώσεις κρατηθεί χρόνια πριν, ενώ τα δρομολόγια μεταδόθηκαν ακόμη και τηλεοπτικά, δείγμα του παγκόσμιου ενδιαφέροντος που συγκέντρωνε το πρόγραμμα.

Ένα πρόγραμμα κύρους με επιδόσεις-σύμβολο

Το Concorde ήταν ένα πρόγραμμα κύρους της βρετανικής και γαλλικής αεροναυπηγικής βιομηχανίας. Πέταγε με περίπου 2.200 km/h, διασχίζοντας τον Ατλαντικό σε λιγότερο από 3,5 ώρες — δηλαδή σε λιγότερο από το μισό του χρόνου μιας συμβατικής πτήσης γραμμής.

Υπήρχαν και στιγμές όπου ήταν ακόμη ταχύτερη:

Στις 7 Φεβρουαρίου 1996, πέταξε από Νέα Υόρκη προς Λονδίνο σε 2 ώρες, 52 λεπτά και 59 δευτερόλεπτα.

Στο εσωτερικό, περίπου 100 επιβάτες απολάμβαναν μια εμπειρία σχεδιασμένη για το κορυφαίο κοινό της εποχής:

χαβιάρι, αστακό, φουά γκρα με τρούφα, και φυσικά σαμπάνια.

Από την ιδέα στο Mach 2: Η ανάπτυξη (1962–1970)

Γαλλία και Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο ξεκίνησαν στα τέλη του 1962 την ανάπτυξη του πρώτου υπερηχητικού επιβατικού αεροσκάφους και την υποστήριξαν με μεγάλη ένταση.

Μετά από έξι χρόνια εξέλιξης, ολοκληρώθηκαν οι δύο πρώτοι πρωτότυποι:

Concorde 001: πρώτη πτήση στις 2 Μαρτίου 1969

Concorde 002: πρώτη πτήση στις 9 Απριλίου 1969

Στις 1 Οκτωβρίου 1969, μια Concorde ξεπέρασε για πρώτη φορά το Mach 1. Λίγο πάνω από έναν χρόνο αργότερα, στις 4 Νοεμβρίου 1970, έφτασε το Mach 2.

Ενδεικτικά, αυτά αντιστοιχούν περίπου σε 1.200 km/h και 2.500 km/h αντίστοιχα (ανάλογα με συνθήκες/ύψος).

Το Concorde ως εθνικό σύμβολο: από προεδρικά πρωινά μέχρι βασιλικά ιωβηλαία

Το αεροσκάφος χρησιμοποιήθηκε ως «στολίδι» από τα δύο κράτη. Χαρακτηριστικά, το πλήρωμα της Air France προσκλήθηκε αργότερα από τον Πρόεδρο Valéry Giscard d’Estaing για πρωινό στο Μέγαρο των Ηλυσίων.

Τα ηγετικά πρόσωπα και των δύο χωρών πετούσαν συχνά με Concorde, ενώ μια πτήση επίδειξης εντάχθηκε το 2002 στο εορταστικό πρόγραμμα για το Χρυσό Ιωβηλαίο της βασίλισσας Ελισάβετ Β’.

Ταχύτητα που «έγραφε ιστορίες»: διπλή Πρωτοχρονιά, Live Aid και έκλειψη

Η ταχύτητα της Concorde επέτρεψε και επικοινωνιακά «απίθανα» σενάρια, όπως η διπλή αλλαγή έτους: επιβάτες γιόρταζαν Πρωτοχρονιά στο Παρίσι, έπειτα επιβιβάζονταν στην Concorde και την ξαναγιόρταζαν στη Νέα Υόρκη.

Άλλες εμβληματικές στιγμές:

13 Ιουλίου 1985 (Live Aid): ο Phil Collins εμφανίστηκε στο Λονδίνο, πέταξε με Concorde στις ΗΠΑ και έπαιξε ξανά στη Φιλαδέλφεια.

1999: δύο Concorde ακολούθησαν την ολική έκλειψη πάνω από τον Βόρειο Ατλαντικό, «επιμηκύνοντας» το θέαμα για τους επιβάτες.

Παρουσία ακόμη και στην Ανατολική Γερμανία (DDR)

Ακόμη και στην DDR το Concorde έκανε αισθητή την παρουσία της: τον Μάρτιο του 1986, δύο Concorde (μία γαλλική και μία βρετανική) προσγειώθηκαν στη Λειψία για την εκεί τεχνολογική έκθεση.

Μάλιστα, σε ένα τμήμα της διαδρομής επετράπη να πετάξει υπερηχητικά — κάτι που γενικά δεν επιτρεπόταν πάνω από την ευρωπαϊκή ηπειρωτική χώρα.

Ο «αντίπαλος» πίσω από το Σιδηρούν Παραπέτασμα: Tupolev Tu‑144

Υπήρχε ανταγωνισμός πέρα από το Σιδηρούν Παραπέτασμα, και μάλιστα προηγήθηκε χρονικά: τρεις εβδομάδες πριν από την Concorde, στις 29 Δεκεμβρίου 1975, το Tupolev Tu‑144 ξεκίνησε την πρώτη εμπορική της πτήση. Αργότερα, όμως, έγινε γνωστό ότι μετέφερε μόνο φορτίο και όχι επιβάτες.

Οι Σοβιετικοί ήταν πρώτοι σε ορόσημα

Το σχεδιαστικό γραφείο Tupolev ξεκίνησε εργασίες το 1963.

Η Tu‑144 απογειώθηκε για πρώτη φορά στις 31 Δεκεμβρίου 1968, περίπου τρεις μήνες πριν από την Concorde.

Στις 25 Μαΐου 1970 έφτασε ως το πρώτο πολιτικό αεροσκάφος διπλάσια ταχύτητα του ήχου.

Αισθητικά, ο σοβιετικός υπερηχητικός έμοιαζε εντυπωσιακά με τον δυτικό «αντίπαλο», γεγονός που οδήγησε σε υποψίες κατασκοπείας. Η Tu‑144 απέκτησε και παρατσούκλι: «Konkordski».

Concorde vs Tu‑144: ομοιότητες, διαφορές και γιατί κέρδισε το Concorde

Τεχνικά, η Tu‑144 θεωρήθηκε λιγότερο ώριμη από την Concorde. Και οι δύο είχαν πτερύγια δέλτα, όμως:

Στην Concorde, τα πτερύγια ήταν αεροδυναμικά πιο ευνοϊκά, προσφέροντας πλεονεκτήματα στην πτήση χαμηλής ταχύτητας.

Στην Tu‑144, το δέλτα ήταν πιο απλής μορφής. Για τις χαμηλές ταχύτητες αναπτύσσονταν πίσω από το κόκπιτ δύο μικρά canard. Αυτά βοηθούσαν, αλλά αύξαναν το βάρος.

Το Concorde διέθετε πιο σύγχρονους, ηλεκτρονικά/υπολογιστικά ελεγχόμενους κινητήρες, μεγαλύτερη εμβέλεια και χαμηλότερο θόρυβο σε σύγκριση με την Tu‑144.

Στο τέλος, η Tu‑144 δεν έγινε πραγματικός ανταγωνιστής:

Το 1973 το πρώτο μοντέλο σειράς, Tu‑144S, συνετρίβη σε πτήση επίδειξης στο Paris Air Show.

Η επόμενη έκδοση, Tu‑144D, πήρε φωτιά σε δοκιμαστική πτήση στις 23 Μαΐου 1978 και πραγματοποίησε αναγκαστική προσγείωση.

Η κυβέρνηση διέκοψε το πρόγραμμα μετά από μόλις 102 πτήσεις, εκ των οποίων 55 με επιβάτες.

Οι περιορισμοί της Concorde: θόρυβος, εμβέλεια και πραγματική οικονομία

Το Concorde συνέχισε να πετάει, αλλά δεν ήταν ένα «εύκολο» αεροσκάφος.

Θόρυβος και περιορισμοί υπερηχητικής πτήσης

Ο θόρυβος ήταν κρίσιμος: ήδη από την έναρξη του τακτικού προγράμματος, αρκετές χώρες αντιτάχθηκαν στο θορυβώδες αεροσκάφος. Έτσι, υπερηχητικές πτήσεις επιτρέπονταν κυρίως πάνω από θάλασσα, όπως τον Ατλαντικό.

Περιορισμένη εμβέλεια

Η εμβέλεια ήταν περίπου 6.000 km, περιορίζοντας τις απευθείας συνδέσεις σε σχετικά συγκεκριμένα ζεύγη πόλεων. Τα σημαντικότερα δρομολόγια ήταν:

Παρίσι ή Λονδίνο → Νέα Υόρκη

Η British Airways διατήρησε μέχρι τέλους και εβδομαδιαία πτήση προς Barbados.

Δίκτυο δρομολογίων και συνεργασίες

Κατά τις δεκαετίες 1970–1980:

British Airways: πτήσεις από Λονδίνο προς Μπαχρέιν και Μαϊάμι.

Air France: εκτός από Ρίο, και Καράκας (με ενδιάμεσο στις Αζόρες) καθώς και Ουάσινγκτον.

Και οι δύο είχαν επίσης τη Σιγκαπούρη μέσω συνεργατών.

Το Concorde χρησιμοποιήθηκε και σε charter, επισκεπτόμενη πάνω από 250 αεροδρόμια παγκοσμίως.

Το κόστος

Το πρόβλημα ήταν και οικονομικό: υψηλό κόστος αγοράς και λειτουργίας. Ακόμη και με εισιτήρια από υψηλές τετραψήφιες έως χαμηλές πενταψήφιες τιμές, η λειτουργία για Air France και British Airways είχε νόημα μόνο επειδή για μεγάλο διάστημα επιδοτήθηκε από κυβερνήσεις, για λόγους κύρους.

Άλλες αεροπορικές που είχαν κάνει προπαραγγελίες (συνολικά 17 εταιρείες για 76 αεροσκάφη) αποσύρθηκαν.

Τεχνικά ζητήματα και η «αχίλλειος πτέρνα» των ελαστικών

Το Concorde δεν ήταν πάντα τεχνικά άψογο. Σε ορισμένες περιπτώσεις, σε υπερηχητικές ταχύτητες αποκολλήθηκε τμήμα επένδυσης του κάθετου σταθερού/πτερυγίου διεύθυνσης. Όμως το μεγαλύτερο ρίσκο αποδείχθηκαν τα ελαστικά — και αυτά έμελλε να οδηγήσουν στο πιο καθοριστικό γεγονός της ιστορίας της.

Το δυστύχημα της 25ης Ιουλίου 2000 και οι αλλαγές

Στις 25 Ιουλίου 2000, μια Concorde, κατά την απογείωση από το Paris Charles de Gaulle, πάτησε ένα μεταλλικό κομμάτι που είχε πέσει από αεροσκάφος της τότε αμερικανικής εταιρείας Continental Airlines.

Το μεταλλικό τμήμα προκάλεσε έκρηξη ελαστικού. Θραύσματα εκτοξεύτηκαν, προκάλεσαν ζημιά σε δεξαμενή καυσίμου, το καύσιμο διέρρευσε και πήρε φωτιά. Το αεροσκάφος συνετρίβη φλεγόμενο σε ξενοδοχείο κοντά στο αεροδρόμιο.

Απολογισμός:

109 άνθρωποι (όλοι οι επιβαίνοντες)

4 άνθρωποι στο έδαφος

Αμέσως, όλες οι Concorde ακινητοποιήθηκαν. Μετά τον εντοπισμό της αιτίας, έγιναν αλλαγές:

ενίσχυση δεξαμενών καυσίμου

νέα, πιο ανθεκτικά ελαστικά από τη Michelin

Επιστροφή στις πτήσεις, αλλά σε λάθος εποχή

Στις 27 Νοεμβρίου 2001, Air France και British Airways επανεκκίνησαν τις πτήσεις προς τη Νέα Υόρκη. Όμως μετά τις επιθέσεις της 11ης Σεπτεμβρίου, η αεροπορία εισήλθε σε βαθιά κρίση.

Παράλληλα, τα πλέον ηλικιωμένα Concorde απαιτούσαν αυξημένη συντήρηση και τεχνική φροντίδα, καθιστώντας τη λειτουργία ακόμη πιο ασύμφορη.

Το τέλος της Concorde (2003)

Στις 10 Απριλίου 2003, οι Air France και British Airways ανακοίνωσαν ότι θα αποσύρουν την Concorde.

Τελευταίες τακτικές πτήσεις:

Air France: 27 Ιουνίου 2003

British Airways: 24 Οκτωβρίου 2003

Η τελευταία πτήση Concorde πραγματοποιήθηκε στις 26 Νοεμβρίου 2003: μεταφορά του αεροσκάφους με νηολόγιο G‑BOAF από το London Heathrow στο Filton, στο εργοστάσιο του κατασκευαστή.

Η γοητεία παραμένει: μουσεία, προστασία και νέα υπερηχητικά σχέδια

Η γοητεία της Concorde δεν έσβησε. Πριν από περίπου δέκα χρόνια, υπήρξαν προσπάθειες από ενθουσιώδεις να την «αναβιώσουν».

Εν τω μεταξύ, η Γαλλία έθεσε την πρώτη Concorde υπό καθεστώς προστασίας μνημείου το προηγούμενο έτος.

Σήμερα, 18 από τις 20 που κατασκευάστηκαν συνολικά, βρίσκονται ως εκθέματα σε μουσεία ή αεροδρόμια, μεταξύ άλλων σε Γαλλία και Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο.

Ένα τέτοιο μπορεί να θαυμάσει κανείς και στο Μουσείο Τεχνολογίας στο Sinsheim στη Βάδη-Βυρτεμβέργη, μάλιστα δίπλα σε ένα Tupolev Tu‑144.

Παράλληλα, βρίσκονται σε εξέλιξη αρκετά προγράμματα νέων πολιτικών υπερηχητικών αεροσκαφών. Η αμερικανική εταιρεία Boom Supersonic έχει κατασκευάσει πρωτότυπο, το οποίο σε δοκιμές στις αρχές του 2025 έσπασε το φράγμα του ήχου.

Το κανονικό υπερηχητικό επιβατικό της αεροσκάφος αναμένεται να είναι έτοιμο για υπηρεσία το 2029.

Τι μας έμαθε το Concorde και τι πρέπει να λυθεί για να επιστρέψουν οι υπερηχητικές πτήσεις

Το Concorde άφησε μια κληρονομιά πολύ μεγαλύτερη από την εικόνα της πολυτέλειας.

Πρώτα απ’ όλα, απέδειξε ότι η υπερηχητική μεταφορά επιβατών είναι τεχνικά εφικτή σε τακτική βάση, αλλά μόνο όταν συνδυάζονται τρία στοιχεία: ακραία μηχανική ακρίβεια, αυστηρή ασφάλεια και ένα οικονομικό μοντέλο που αντέχει το υψηλό κόστος καυσίμου και συντήρησης.

Η τεχνολογία της (υλικά, αεροδυναμική, θερμική διαχείριση σε υψηλές ταχύτητες) επηρέασε έμμεσα σύγχρονα προγράμματα αεροναυπηγικής, ακόμη κι αν δεν οδηγούσε άμεσα σε «Concorde 2».

Το βασικό εμπόδιο για την επιστροφή των υπερηχητικών πτήσεων παραμένει ο ηχητικός κρότος (sonic boom). Οι περιορισμοί που επιβλήθηκαν ιστορικά στις υπερηχητικές πτήσεις πάνω από ξηρά δεν ήταν απλώς γραφειοκρατικοί: συνδέονται με όχληση, πιθανές υλικές ζημιές και κοινωνική αποδοχή.

Γι’ αυτό και σήμερα βλέπουμε έρευνα σε σχεδιάσεις «χαμηλού κρότου», ώστε ο θόρυβος να μοιάζει περισσότερο με ένα μακρινό «χτύπημα» παρά με εκκωφαντική έκρηξη.

Σε αυτό το πλαίσιο, η NASA έχει επενδύσει σε πειραματικά προγράμματα που εξετάζουν πώς ο σχεδιασμός της ατράκτου μπορεί να μειώσει δραστικά την ακουστική υπογραφή.

Το δεύτερο μεγάλο στοίχημα είναι η βιωσιμότητα. Τα υπερηχητικά καταναλώνουν παραδοσιακά περισσότερο καύσιμο ανά επιβάτη-χιλιόμετρο.

Για να θεωρηθούν εμπορικά και κοινωνικά αποδεκτά, οι νέες προσπάθειες θα πρέπει να αξιοποιήσουν SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), καλύτερους κινητήρες και πιθανώς διαφορετικές επιχειρησιακές πρακτικές (π.χ. βελτιστοποίηση υψομέτρων/διαδρομών).

Παράλληλα, η αγορά-στόχος ίσως δεν είναι η «μαζική μετακίνηση», αλλά ένα premium κοινό που πληρώνει για χρόνο: στελέχη, κυβερνητικές αποστολές ή εξειδικευμένα charter.

Τέλος, η ιστορία της Concorde δείχνει κάτι απλό αλλά κρίσιμο: η τεχνολογία από μόνη της δεν αρκεί. Χρειάζεται ρυθμιστικό πλαίσιο, υποδομές αεροδρομίων και πραγματική ζήτηση.

Αν αυτά ευθυγραμμιστούν, η επόμενη εποχή υπερήχων μπορεί να είναι λιγότερο «μύθος» και περισσότερο καθημερινότητα — αλλά με όρους ασφαλέστερους και πιο βιώσιμους από ποτέ.",https://texnologia.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/concorde-50-chronia-yperichitikon-ptiseon-i-istoria-i-antipalotita-me-tin-tu-144-kai-to-telos-enos-thrylou.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 13:56:47.365447

The government aims to promote domestically produced SAF from the perspectives of both supply and demand.

The government is expected to compile a basic policy framework to accelerate SAF adoption at an upcoming public-private council meeting, with an eye toward revising the Airport Law, it intends to finalize the details by fiscal 2026.

Compared with conventional jet fuel derived from crude oil, SAF can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 80%. However, procurement costs are widely believed to be 2 to 3 times higher, posing a major hurdle to broader uptake.

To address this gap, some airports in Italy and the United Kingdom subsidize the procurement of SAF with revenue from airport user fees. The European Union, meanwhile, requires SAF blending in fuel used at airports across the bloc and has set a goal of increasing the blending rate targets of a 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. The Japanese government plans to reference these examples when creating its own system.

The basic policy is also expected to specify robust capital investment support for suppliers along with cooperation with municipalities and collection firms to expand the recovery of used household cooking oil.

Amid the global tightening of regulations on CO2 emissions from air transport, SAF is increasingly seen as key to decarbonization in the aviation industry.

Introduction

When people think of Wisconsin, they often think of great cheese, the Green Bay Packers, brats, and, well, winter. What is often overlooked are the legacy industries – and their people – that built the state and underwrote America’s meteoric rise. These industries have provided great jobs and carried communities for over a century. Chief among these forgotten industries is forestry.

Wisconsin holds many advantages that do not get enough attention. Our proximity to the world via Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and the Mississippi River as well as elite natural resources on and under our grounds. This isn’t just rocks and logs. They are critical advantages that we hold from our geography. In the 19th Century, Wisconsin’s lead mining boom, and proximity to transportation, helped the United States undercut European markets and American reliance upon them. This led to great economic gains and strategic independence making America a force to be reckoned with.

Timber may not seem pressing, but history has shown us that the raw materials required to build society are critical. In the early 1900’s, Japan had identified the large industrial value of timber by colonizing Korea. By rapidly feeding its imperial economy, Japan became an industrial powerhouse in the lead up to World War II. This is not to say that our forests will prepare us for war, but they can provide the economic opportunity and manufacturing dominance that could prevent one. Having industrial capacity and capability reduces leverages against our interests. For too long, we have neglected these advantages.

Our woods need more management. Conservationists who spend much of their time recreating and hunting our big timber tracts have commonly cited the presence of old-growth, or over-mature, forests that are becoming less hospitable to wildlife and more challenging for access. There is growing concern about the challenges of our state’s industry as well, including the impact on the state economy, rural prosperity, and health of forests in general.

State of the Woods

Wisconsin’s woods are large, and they are healthy. Almost 40% of Wisconsin’s landscape is covered in forests, a total equalling roughly 17 million acres. Further, our annual growth of forestland is double the volume we remove. This highlights the sustainability of forestry practices and the unrealized capacity to do more. Today, we cannot allow forests to renew themselves with fires. This requires active management to maintain productive forests. Forests that are growing are healthy while over-mature forests benefit no one. Our forests require management to remain healthy, reduce risk of forest fire, and continue providing exceptional habitat for wildlife.

State of the Forestry Industry

Wisconsin’s loggers and forestry industry have built and sustained whole communities and the families that inhabit them. Forestry, wood, and paper industries have deep roots in our rural economy and culture. A healthy forest industry is critical to our ability to sustain resilient forests, recreation, and wildlife habitat that underwrites our massive outdoor industry.

Wisconsin’s forestry industry and its related sectors account for over 11% of the state’s total manufacturing jobs.[8] Pound for pound, its reputable nationwide. For those working in the forest product industry, annual incomes average around $81,000 – ahead of the state average of $67,000. For the loggers, wages hover around $64,000 annually, below the state’s average. Plus, for every 100 jobs in the forest products sector there are an additional 122 jobs supported in other sectors of the economy. This multi-billion-dollar export industry is one to be proud of and one to protect.

The Bad News

Forestry and its related sectors are in decline. Since 2001, jobs have been consistently decreasing. In the paper industry 73% of jobs are gone, in wood building materials its 50%, and in sawmill employment, the figure is 27% over the last quarter century. In smaller communities and rural counties these losses are magnified. The loss of employment ripples through to sectors that are intertwined to forestry. As the jobs go, so too does population. These further strains smaller school districts, the viability of having a grocery store, and the literal survival of a town if new sectors do not emerge.

For example, in 2020 when the Verso plant closed in Wisconsin Rapids, 25% of pulpwood processing disappeared. That loss, among others, ripples through the entire state’s forestry economy. Between 2014 and 2021, there had already been a 20% harvest decrease in the Northern region, a negative trend before another plant had even closed.

The impacts on local and county budgets cannot be ignored. Faced with demographic challenges, rising costs of providing services, operating expenses, and infrastructure upgrades are placing high burdens on residents. Counties have traditionally relied upon timber sales as a consistent source of revenue. This revenue has been dropping, with an especially stark 22% decrease between 2022 and 2023. To adjust for these losses, state aid or property taxes become the only alternatives.

New Opportunities

Aviation Fuel

So, what is there to do? There are more options than one may immediately consider. A new market opportunity for our timber industry may be refining sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, to meet European demand. Aviation fuel used in European Union nations requires 20% of their aviation fuel to be sustainable by 2035. That percentage is expected to grow.

Wisconsin has been identified as a prime location to meet this need. A German organization is working to make Hayward the home of a $1.5 billion pulpwood facility. To finalize this investment, members of the Wisconsin Legislature introduced Senate Bill 456 – The Forestry Revitalization Act. Through a combination of tax credits and bonds paid through the already existing forestry account, Wisconsin could land this historic investment.

This bill would require that 80% of all wood material be sourced from Wisconsin forests. That means a new demand for Wisconsin’s loggers, truckers, operators, as well as their families and local communities. At the facility, which would be the North American headquarters, there would be an influx of over 150, well paying, new jobs.

The bill holds a significant amount of claw backs to protect taxpayers if the project stalls or funding from the company fails. It is estimated that the state, through credits and bonds, would need $200 million to secure this new investment. This is no small dollar amount but the bill deserves real consideration by the full legislature.

In 2023, Wisconsin passed a package that included over $500 million in public spending to upgrade American Family Field for the Milwaukee Brewers. In 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks secured $250 million in taxpayer funds for a new stadium as well. Over the span of 8 years, Milwaukee professional sports teams celebrated over $750 million in tax commitments. Northern Wisconsin deserves the same consideration, especially considering that the investment focuses on Wisconsin’s forestry workers and not billionaire sports owners.

Energy Production

More attention should be given to the viability of power generation from biomass. Arguably the state’s largest renewable resource, biomass accounts for a large percentage of Wisconsin’s renewable energy portfolio. As of 2017, biomass had accounted for a majority of renewable energy production here.[16] In many towns, biomass has powered schools and government buildings for decades. This type of energy use helps mitigate rising energy costs for taxpayers and reduces the unpredictable market swings of natural gas, propane, and grid upgrades.

Gundersen Health in La Crosse became the first known healthcare organization to achieve energy independence in 2014. Biomass played a significant role in this accomplishment. Creating heat and electricity with wood biomass has saved the organization around $500,000 per year. More efforts should consider the use of woody biomass to lower the costs of healthcare and public entity operating costs.

Processing and Manufacturing

As technology continues to evolve rapidly, manufacturing processes are becoming more efficient. Efforts to reshore industrial capacity to the United States also involves the expansion of intermediate and final processing of forestry products. Wisconsin and its universities should continue to study and welcome new opportunities in this sector.

Currently, much of Wisconsin’s forest harvest is exported in low-value form like logs to China. Tightening the supply chain of timber products can capture more value here at home. This type of opportunity brings more jobs and prosperity to our rural communities.

Conclusion

Wisconsin’s long legacy of the forestry industry is one to be proud and protective of. While our forests continue to grow at a rapid pace, our harvests and the associated jobs around it are consistently declining. This disproportionally impacts our northern and rural areas of the state. Opportunities do exist to welcome new investments and ideas to turn this tide. Our local communities deserve attention to flex their forestry industry once again before it’s too late.

Failure to capture new investments will cause permanent job losses and put our communities in a position that other areas of the state cannot imagine. From new fuel sources, energy production and manufacturing opportunities, the industry is ready for disruption.

Here’s the background.

In 2018 and 2023, the Legislature passed laws setting targets to achieve “net zero” CO2 emissions from ground, air and sea transportation in Hawaii by 2045. There was no plan, no cost estimates nor determination of feasibility.

In 2022, Oregon-based and Hawaii-based lawfare entities filed a lawsuit (“Navahine vs. HDOT”) on behalf of 13 Hawaii youth, alleging that the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) was making insufficient progress on the net zero target. At the time of the lawsuit, two of the children were ages 10 and 13. Some would say great that the keiki were involved; others would say they were exploited.

In 2024, the state entered into an out-of-court settlement agreement with the entities. It turns out that Our Children’s Trust has filed similar suits in all 50 states; Hawaii is the only state to have caved in. One observer commented, “This is monumentally undemocratic and elected officials had no business settling this suit. What the state agreed to is ludicrous.” Indeed, a Montana judge dismissed a virtually similar lawsuit in that state.

In 2025 and as mandated, HDOT somehow developed a plan strangely titled, “Hawaii Energy Security and Waste Reduction Plan.” The plan is 258 pages long, essentially drawing emission reduction line graphs for each transportation sector, making sweeping assumptions/mandates. Remarkably, the plan doesn’t quantify the economic costs.

The plan calls for the sale of new cars and trucks to reach 80% electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Is this even remotely realistic given the current status of EV sales (12% of total), no doubt declining without the federal subsidy? The plan is silent on assuming that residents will voluntarily buy much more expensive EVs, but nowhere near those percentages will be achievable without state mandates. One can only imagine the statewide repudiation of such dictates.

For air transportation, the plan calls for converting from Jet-A to costly “sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF) for fueling both interisland and outbound airliners; fuel would be derived from plants, most likely grown in South America or Indonesia. By 2035, 50% of jet fuel uploads must be SAF, and 100% by 2045. By HDOT’s own admission, SAF currently costs three to five times more than Jet-A; the cost will no doubt be passed on to airline customers. Another cost-of-living blow to Hawaii residents.

For the marine sector, the plan targets cruise ships that self-power when in Hawaii ports and during transit, with an exception for homeported ships. A draft of the plan called for reducing cruise ship calls to Hawaii by 50% by 2030 and 75% by 2035; the final projects a 95% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2045, apparently achieved in large part by a de facto ban on cruise ships not powered by liquefied natural gas. Does it make any sense to inflict significant damage to local businesses from a tourism source with low impact?

So where does all of this leave us? In a pickle. Before spending taxpayer dollars for such things as $300 million for bikeways, the Legislature should hit pause, investigate and hold hearings. The plan states, “For the emission reduction strategy to be supported by the public, approved, and actually implemented, they must not be so economically extreme that they make Hawaii unaffordable for its residents.” We believe many residents are already there, and implementation of this plan will only worsen the problem.

Yes, we should all work to reduce transportation sector emissions to the maximum extent practical. But the plan clearly exposes the net zero laws to be both impractical and imprudent. Leaving the net zero laws on the books, without amendment, would be a huge disservice to Hawaii’s residents.",https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/web1_CTY-power-up-hi-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 14:56:32.334165

Nairobi’s evolution as a hub easily illustrates how strategic aviation infrastructure can amplify a country’s economic reach.
Ultimately, the direction of African aviation in 2026 will be shaped by choices made collectively.","By the end of 2025, Africa’s air passenger traffic was estimated at about 192 million, a number that is projected to exceed 411 million by 2044, as per data from the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA’s) 2026 outlook for Africa.

This 4.1 percent annual growth signals a structural shift, where Africa grows and integrates into global trade, with aviation becoming less of a luxury infrastructure and more of a foundational system for economic participation.

African aviation stands at a strategic inflection point anchored in robust demand fundamentals, including a rebounding tourism sector following a period of post-pandemic recovery. Business travel is thriving with air cargo underpinning key export sectors ranging from horticulture to textiles.

Together, these dynamics point to an African aviation future that is driven by strong structural demand.

However, sustaining this momentum will depend on how effectively growth is pursued, and this will include the development of a thriving intra-Africa travel environment.

Today, travel between African cities often involves longer routes, higher costs and more complex itineraries than comparable journeys in many other places across the world, reflecting regulatory fragmentation, infrastructure gaps and cost structures that constrain the development of efficient networks.

As Africa advances the objectives of the African Continental Free Trade Area, domestic aviation must evolve in parallel, enabling the movement of people and goods across borders with far greater ease.

In this context, the relationship between African carriers and international airline groups stands out. Top global airlines have long been part of the continent’s aviation ecosystem, providing connectivity and access to international markets. Their success in the region is closely tied to the strength of local partners and institutions.

In 2026 and going forward, the most durable growth will come from cooperation across countries and airlines that build capacity and align incentives. Code-sharing arrangements, joint ventures, training partnerships and maintenance collaboration can strengthen local aviation ecosystems while expanding choice and reliability for passengers.

Financial sustainability also remains a decisive factor with airlines in Africa operating in one of the most challenging commercial environments globally, facing high fuel costs, currency volatility, constrained access to financing and, in many markets, taxes and charges that exceed international norms.

And while several carriers have recently made impressive progress in restoring operational stability, balance sheets remain fragile. The return to loss of some airlines after periods of profitability underscores how narrow the margin for error remains. Strengthening airline finances, therefore, remains a prerequisite for growth, amidst toughening operational environments.

Meanwhile, sustainability will continue to shape investment decisions because although aviation’s climate challenge is global, Africa has the opportunity to engage with it from a position of foresight rather than reaction.

Several African countries are already exploring sustainable aviation fuel pathways linked to agriculture, waste and renewable energy, and with more support, the continent could play a meaningful role in the global transition to lower-carbon aviation, while safeguarding growth and connectivity.

Infrastructure will quietly determine whether these ambitions can be realised. Indeed, aside from being transit points, airports are platforms for trade, tourism and employment, with investments in terminals, air traffic management and cargo facilities yielding returns that extend far beyond aviation itself.

Nairobi’s evolution as a hub easily illustrates how strategic aviation infrastructure can amplify a country’s economic reach.

Ultimately, the direction of African aviation in 2026 will be shaped by choices made collectively. Governments will need to balance national interests with regional integration.

Airlines, both African and international, will need to invest with patience and partnership in mind, and investors will need to recognise that aviation infrastructure and networks take time to mature.

“The launch will mark the beginning of a landmark global aviation gathering that will showcase India’s transformation into a major aviation hub for connectivity, manufacturing, services, innovation and sustainability,” the Ministry of Civil Aviation said on Sunday.

Anchored around the theme “Indian Aviation: Paving the Future – From Design to Deployment, Manufacturing to Maintenance, Inclusivity to Innovation, and Safety to Sustainability,” Wings India 2026 will highlight how India’s aviation ecosystem has evolved into a powerful engine of economic growth, regional development and global integration.

Over the last decade, India’s civil aviation sector has witnessed unprecedented expansion. Passenger traffic has surged manifold, placing India among the world’s top aviation markets.

Hundreds of new aircraft have been inducted by Indian carriers, with record-breaking aircraft orders positioning the country as one of the largest future aircraft markets globally.

Airport infrastructure has expanded rapidly, with the development of new greenfield airports, modernised terminals and enhanced regional connectivity under flagship initiatives such as UDAN.

India is also emerging as a strong hub for aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), pilot training, aerospace manufacturing, cargo logistics and advanced air mobility. A major push towards sustainable aviation, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), green airports and digital air navigation, is reshaping the future of flight.

Be union,Not Available,,,,,https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/article/reflections-wapping-employers-come-together-prepare-so-should-we-be-union,"The acts of betrayal and the violence launched against them by the state still leave a very bitter taste today.
It is never too early to prepare, and we have to recognise that in some instances there is nothing some employers won’t do and indeed some governments won’t do.
It is only the trade union movement that can collectively ensure workers get their piece of the pie.
We want to prepare for what is coming down the track in the next five to 10 years.
Unite will continue to tell the government that it needs to deliver the jobs for workers to transition into.","ON JANUARY 24 1986 over 5,500 workers at News International went on strike. They had been provoked by Rupert Murdoch, who planned to sack them “en masse” using Thatcher’s new anti-union laws.

Overnight, the production of the Times, Sunday Times, Sun and News of the World moved from Fleet Street’s hot-metal presses to a high-security site in Wapping. Planned, set up in secret, ready and waiting for these newspapers to be printed using new technology and a much smaller workforce under a no-strike deal and subsequently distributed under police protection.

There are many lessons that can be learnt from the origins of this dispute. The solidarity, determination and spirit of the striking workers and their supporters was without question. The acts of betrayal and the violence launched against them by the state still leave a very bitter taste today. There is also no doubt the co-ordination and planning between Murdoch and the government meant that when the dispute began many possible levers originally available to the workers had been taken away.

As trade unionists this is something we should keep at the centre of our minds when we try to address the challenges that we can see coming up for workers in the years ahead. It is never too early to prepare, and we have to recognise that in some instances there is nothing some employers won’t do and indeed some governments won’t do.

Planning for a response to what could happen when the employer takes on workers is the key to winning. Widening and deepening the collective. Strike ready, yes, but also using our brains as well as our brawn. Understanding where our levers are — where our power is. Who are the real decision-makers and how can they be moved?

Take the new wave of AI and automation. This will radically change the world of work, and it has the capacity to put millions of jobs at risk. Just think of the potential impact of autonomous vehicles on the one million people employed as professional road transport drivers in the UK. We cannot wait until employers have self-driving vehicles in place before we act. We need to anticipate the future realities of the labour market right now, while the power is in the workplace to fight back.

This can’t be done piecemeal — it must be done by sector, building combines, developing multiple areas of support and creating real co-ordination. Winning is based on hard work, not easy talk and idle opinions. No employer or politician will simply hand workers a good deal — we will have to fight for it.

We all know that technological change is inevitable. The question is whether it will be used to improve the lives of workers, or simply to concentrate wealth and deepen inequality.

The financial gains from technology are predicted to be measured in billions. It is only the trade union movement that can collectively ensure workers get their piece of the pie.

In Unite we have begun the work of building combines. Reps coming together by sector, locking in organisers to build collective strength if needed and lock in our industrial, legal, research and leverage teams. We want to prepare for what is coming down the track in the next five to 10 years. How can we widen and deepen the collective and get agreements now for the issues of the future?

Similarly, as we look at immediate issues like the transition to net zero. We of course understand the issues, but we can’t have a jobless transition. Where are the much-promised new green jobs for oil and gas workers?

We face a loss of around 30,000 oil and gas jobs in the North Sea by 2030. Unite has put forward plans to create jobs in the manufacture of our own wind turbines and to convert refineries to make Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). These plans would protect workers’ livelihoods and the environment.

However, the government has just sat on its hands while two of our six refineries have been shut and the new wind farms we see are being populated with turbines manufactured in Denmark and Germany.

Unite will continue to tell the government that it needs to deliver the jobs for workers to transition into. But we will also work with our oil and gas workers so we are ready to act industrially, if necessary, while the decision-makers are dependent on them.

As the great American union leader Joe Hill said with his final words “Don’t mourn — organise.” As we mark the 40th anniversary of the beginning of the Wapping dispute, his epitaph should be our guide.

It is clear the power of workers is in their trade unions. There is no knight on a white horse coming over the hill to save us, no matter the colour of their rosette.

It’s time to be union.

Industry attention has intensified around the possibility that up to 100 Airbus A220 aircraft could soon be added to the AirAsia fleet, marking a decisive step into the smaller narrowbody aircraft segment. This development reflects broader post pandemic restructuring efforts across the global airline sector, where efficiency, flexibility, and right sized capacity have become central priorities.

For years, AirAsia has been closely associated with high density operations using the Airbus A320 family. The consideration of the A220 signals a recalibration of strategy, driven by the need to rebuild networks, open thinner routes, and enhance regional connectivity across Southeast Asia, South Asia, and beyond. With manufacturing roots extending from France to Canada, and operational ambitions spanning multiple continents, the potential order underscores the interconnected nature of modern commercial aviation.

As recovery momentum strengthens following unprecedented disruption, this proposed agreement is being viewed not merely as a fleet addition, but as a statement of long term intent. The move highlights how Asia largest low cost carrier is aligning its future with aircraft that balance economics, sustainability, and passenger comfort in a rapidly changing market environment.

Headline Development: AirAsia and Airbus Near Landmark Agreement

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus is reported to be close to finalizing a substantial aircraft order with AirAsia, one of the most influential low cost airline groups in Asia. The discussions, which have been ongoing for several months, are centered on the Airbus A220 family, a platform designed to serve short haul and regional markets with high efficiency.

If concluded, the agreement would represent AirAsia first entry into the A220 category, expanding beyond its long standing reliance on the A320 family. Approximately 100 aircraft are understood to be under consideration, with industry sources also indicating the possibility of options for an additional 50 units. While neither Airbus nor AirAsia has issued official confirmation, the scale and timing of the talks have placed the potential deal firmly in focus across the aviation sector.

Strategic Rationale Behind the A220 Selection

The Airbus A220 has been positioned as an ideal solution for airlines seeking to optimize capacity on routes that do not require larger narrowbody aircraft. Designed as a clean sheet aircraft, the A220 offers a combination of lower fuel burn, extended range, and operational versatility that aligns closely with evolving low cost carrier models.

For AirAsia, the aircraft is being evaluated as a tool to support network rebuilding and expansion into underserved markets. Smaller city pairs across Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India, and neighboring regions could be connected more efficiently using the A220, allowing frequency growth without the risk of overcapacity. The potential introduction of a higher density configuration, with seating approaching the upper end of the aircraft capability, would further align the type with AirAsia cost focused operating philosophy.

Competitive Landscape and Manufacturer Dynamics

While Airbus is widely viewed as the frontrunner, competitive pressure has also been present. Brazil based manufacturer Embraer has reportedly engaged in discussions with AirAsia, promoting its own aircraft as an alternative for regional operations. Despite this challenge, Airbus has renewed efforts to secure the deal, leveraging the A220 performance credentials and its established relationship with AirAsia.

The outcome of these talks is being closely watched, as it could influence future fleet decisions among other low cost carriers in Asia Pacific, many of which are reassessing aircraft size and range requirements in the post pandemic era.

Existing Airbus Commitments and Fleet Expansion Plans

AirAsia already stands among the largest global customers of Airbus, with more than 350 A320 family aircraft currently on order. In addition, a commitment for 50 A321XLR aircraft was announced in mid 2024, supporting longer range services and enabling new international routes from Malaysia and other regional hubs.

The consideration of the A220 complements these existing commitments by filling a capacity gap at the lower end of the single aisle spectrum. Group leadership has previously indicated openness to introducing smaller aircraft to unlock new destinations and strengthen feeder traffic into larger hubs. Ongoing evaluations reportedly cover as many as 150 additional aircraft across various categories, reflecting ambitious long term growth objectives.

Financial Recovery and Corporate Restructuring Context

The proposed fleet expansion is taking place against the backdrop of a broader corporate turnaround. During the pandemic period, severe travel restrictions led to significant financial strain, resulting in the parent company Capital A being classified as financially distressed under PN17 rules by the Malaysia stock exchange.

Since then, a comprehensive regularisation plan has been completed, with management now focused on restoring stability and investor confidence. A planned restructuring will consolidate all AirAsia branded aviation businesses under AirAsia X, a move expected to streamline operations and reduce costs. Capital A is set to concentrate on balance sheet recovery and long term financial resilience, creating a clearer platform for future growth.

Overview of the Airbus A220 Program

The Airbus A220 occupies the 100 to 160 seat market segment and has been designed to bridge the gap between traditional regional jets and larger narrowbody aircraft. Introduced into commercial service in 2016, the aircraft was originally developed by Bombardier of Canada as the C Series before Airbus became the majority partner in 2018.

Since that transition, the program has benefited from Airbus global industrial footprint and support infrastructure. Production at the Mirabel facility in Canada has expanded significantly, growing from a modest workforce in 2008 to approximately 4,000 employees today. This growth reflects rising demand and increasing confidence in the platform.

Variants and Operational Capabilities

The A220 family consists of two main passenger variants, both sharing a common pilot type rating to enhance crew flexibility.

The A220 100 typically accommodates between 100 and 120 passengers, with a range of up to 3,600 nautical miles. The larger A220 300 supports seating from 120 to 160 passengers and offers a range of approximately 3,450 nautical miles. These capabilities allow airlines to deploy the aircraft on a wide variety of missions, from short regional hops to longer transcontinental services.

A business aviation derivative, the ACJ TwoTwenty, is also available, providing extended range and a spacious cabin configuration for private and corporate use.

Passenger Comfort and Cabin Design

Passenger experience has been a central focus of the A220 design philosophy. The aircraft features the Airbus Airspace cabin, offering wider economy seats, higher ceilings, and larger windows compared with older generation aircraft in the same category. A five abreast seating layout ensures that most passengers have access to either a window or an aisle, while overhead bins provide increased storage capacity to improve boarding efficiency.

Advanced noise dampening, improved air quality systems, and a lower cabin altitude contribute to a calmer onboard environment, supporting reduced fatigue on longer flights.

Engineering Innovation and Sustainability Performance

From an engineering perspective, approximately 40 percent of the A220 structure incorporates advanced materials, including carbon fiber composites and titanium. The use of an aluminum lithium fuselage enhances durability while reducing weight. High aspect ratio wings and modern winglets improve aerodynamic efficiency, while fly by wire controls support precise handling and stability.

Environmental performance remains a key strength. The A220 delivers an estimated 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and carbon emissions per seat compared with previous generation aircraft. Noise levels are significantly lower, making the aircraft suitable for operations at noise sensitive airports across Europe, Asia, and North America. Certification for up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel is already in place, with full capability targeted for 2030.

Long Term Relevance for Global Fleets

With more than 3 million flight hours accumulated and operations spanning over 1,800 routes worldwide, the A220 has established a strong service record. Operational reliability has been reported at approximately 99 percent, reinforcing confidence among operators.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/air-asia-279.webp,N,,2026-01-25 05:56:54.135302

A propulsion system that produces zero combustion emissions changes that equation entirely.","Engineers in the United States have tested a jet engine that generates thrust without burning a single drop of fuel.

The system uses superheated plasma instead of combustion — and it ran continuously for 70 hours without stopping. No jet fuel. No emissions. No fossil fuels of any kind. Just ionized gas accelerated to extreme speeds, producing thrust the same way a traditional engine does but through an entirely different physical process.

This isn't a small laboratory curiosity. Seventy hours of continuous operation means the technology has moved beyond proof-of-concept into genuine engineering validation. The engine maintained stable thrust output across the entire test window, demonstrating that plasma propulsion can deliver the kind of reliability aviation demands.

The implications are significant. Traditional jet engines are limited by fuel capacity — the more fuel you carry, the heavier the aircraft, which burns more fuel. It's a diminishing returns problem that defines modern aviation. Plasma propulsion breaks that cycle. Without combustion fuel requirements, aircraft could theoretically stay airborne far longer, making the technology ideal for long-range aircraft, surveillance drones, high-altitude platforms, and near-space aviation where conventional engines struggle to operate efficiently.

Passagierzahlen steigen – Vor-Covid-Niveau noch nicht erreicht

Nach Angaben von ACM Manat Chuaprayoon, Gouverneur der Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT), wurden im Jahr 2025 insgesamt 145,1 Millionen Passagiere abgefertigt. Davon entfielen 67 Millionen auf den Inlandsflugverkehr und 78 Millionen auf internationale Reisende. Gegenüber 2024 entspricht dies einem Plus von 4,9 Millionen Passagieren oder 3,54 %.

Im Vergleich zum Vor-Covid-Rekordjahr 2019 mit 161,81 Millionen Passagieren blieb das Aufkommen jedoch deutlich niedriger. Damals sorgte vor allem ein höherer Anteil chinesischer Touristen für Spitzenwerte.

Neue Wachstumsmärkte kompensieren schwächere China-Nachfrage

Die weiter verhaltene Nachfrage aus China wurde laut Manat teilweise durch starke Zuwächse in anderen Regionen ausgeglichen. Besonders Zentralasien, der Nahe Osten und klassische Langstreckenmärkte hätten deutlich zugelegt.

„Das Wachstum in neuen und weit entfernten Märkten hat einen Teil der Lücke kompensiert, die durch den Rückgang chinesischer Fluggäste entstanden ist“, erklärte Manat. In der Hochsaison am Jahresende erreichten chinesische Passagiere etwa 75 % des Vor-Covid-Niveaus. Damit bleibt China ein wichtiger, aber noch nicht vollständig erholter Quellmarkt.

Konflikte, Luftraumbeschränkungen und Druck auf Airlines

Das Jahr 2025 war für Airlines weltweit von internationalen Konflikten und verschärften geopolitischen Spannungen geprägt. Manat verwies auf Luftraumbeschränkungen infolge von Streitigkeiten, darunter:

• Pakistan–Indien

• Israel–Iran

• Russland–Ukraine

Diese Faktoren hätten den globalen Luftverkehr zusätzlich belastet und die Planungssicherheit reduziert.

Indien, Russland und Ozeanien als Wachstumstreiber

Trotz dieser Rahmenbedingungen zeigte sich der Sektor im Königreich widerstandsfähig. Nach dem Rückgang von 161,81 Millionen Passagieren 2019 auf 140,6 Millionen im Jahr 2024 stieg die Zahl 2025 wieder auf 145,1 Millionen und bestätigte damit einen aufwärts gerichteten Trend.

Besonders dynamisch entwickelten sich:

• Ozeanien, insbesondere Australien, mit 1,77 Millionen Passagieren

• neue Direktverbindungen zu pazifischen Inselstaaten

• Indien mit 5,95 Millionen Passagieren, deutlich über dem Wert von 4,85 Millionen im Jahr 2019

• Russland mit 4,22 Millionen Passagieren

„Indien und Russland bleiben zentrale Märkte für den thailändischen Luftverkehr“, betonte Manat.

Weniger Flugzeuge, hohe Auslastung im Inland

Thai Airlines betrieben 2025 zusammen 238 Flugzeuge – deutlich weniger als die 279 Maschinen im Jahr 2019.

Trotz dieser reduzierten Flotte konnten die Gesellschaften 92 % des inländischen Passagieraufkommens von vor Covid bewältigen. Dies deutet auf Effizienzsteigerungen und eine gezieltere Einsatzplanung der verfügbaren Kapazitäten hin.

Branche rückt Klimaschutz stärker in den Fokus

Für das laufende Jahr kündigte Manat einen klaren Schwerpunkt auf Umwelt- und Klimaschutz an. Die Branche orientiert sich dabei an den Vorgaben der International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Konkret soll die Einhaltung des Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) forciert und der Einsatz von Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ausgeweitet werden.

„Die thailändische Luftfahrt wird die Nutzung nachhaltiger Flugkraftstoffe erhöhen und sich stärker an internationalen Klimastandards ausrichten“, sagte der CAAT-Chef.

Warum Bunge Global SA die Nase vorn hat Die zentrale Frage für Kunden und Investoren lautet: Was macht Bunge Global SA im Vergleich zum Wettbewerb tatsächlich besser – jenseits der üblichen Marketingformeln?","Vom Händler zum systemrelevanten Agrar-Tech-Anbieter

Bunge Global SA steht exemplarisch für den tiefgreifenden Wandel in der globalen Agrar- und Lebensmittelindustrie. Wo das Unternehmen früher vor allem als klassischer Agrarhändler wahrgenommen wurde, positioniert sich Bunge heute als integrierter Lösungsanbieter entlang der kompletten Wertschöpfungskette – von der Beschaffung und Logistik von Ölsaaten und Getreide über das Crushing und Raffinieren von Pflanzenölen bis hin zu hochspezialisierten Food-Ingredients und maßgeschneiderten Lösungen für Industrie- und Markenhersteller.

Getrieben wird dieser Wandel von drei Kernproblemen, die die Branche aktuell beschäftigen: Versorgungssicherheit in einem volatilen geopolitischen Umfeld, Dekarbonisierung und Nachhaltigkeit entlang der Lieferkette sowie die Nachfrage nach maßgeschneiderten, funktionalen Lebensmittelzutaten – von pflanzlichen Proteinen über Spezialöle bis zu Clean-Label-Lösungen. Genau hier setzt Bunge Global SA mit seinem integrierten Plattformansatz an.

Statt nur Rohware zu handeln, versteht sich Bunge Global SA als orchestrierender Knotenpunkt: Das Unternehmen verbindet Landwirte, Verarbeiter, Lebensmitteleinzelhandel, Food- und Feed-Konzerne sowie die wachsende Bioenergie-Industrie. Diese Transformation vom Volumen- zum Wertgeschäft macht Bunge Global SA zum strategischen Flaggschiff im Portfolio des Konzerns – und ist ein wesentlicher Grund, warum der Name auch am Kapitalmarkt zunehmend als eigenständige Marke wahrgenommen wird.

Bunge Global SA: So positioniert sich der Agrarrohstoff-Konzern im globalen Wettbewerb

Das Flaggschiff im Detail: Bunge Global SA

Bunge Global SA ist weniger ein singuläres Produkt als vielmehr die konsolidierte Unternehmensplattform, über die Bunge seine zentralen Geschäftsbereiche steuert: Agribusiness (Origination, Handel, Logistik), Edible Oils und Milling, Ingredients sowie zunehmend spezialisierte Lösungen für die Lebensmittel- und Tierfutterindustrie. Die Plattform-Betrachtung ist entscheidend, um den technologischen und kommerziellen USP zu verstehen.

Im Kern basiert Bunge Global SA auf drei strategischen Säulen:

1. Globale Origination- und Logistik-Plattform

Bunge betreibt weltweit ein enges Netz aus Silos, Elevatoren, Crush-Anlagen und Exportterminals – mit starker Präsenz in Nord- und Südamerika, Europa sowie wachsend in Asien. Diese physische Infrastruktur wird zunehmend durch digitale Tools ergänzt:

Plattformen für die digitale Anbindung von Landwirten und Kooperativen, inklusive Kontrakt- und Preismanagement

Echtzeit-Tracking von Warenströmen und Logistik über Binnenschifffahrt, Schiene und Seefracht

Risk-Management- und Hedging-Systeme, die physische und finanzielle Märkte integrieren

Damit wird Bunge Global SA zu einem systemrelevanten Player, wenn es um Versorgungssicherheit bei Getreide und Ölsaaten geht – ein Wettbewerbsvorteil, der in Zeiten geopolitischer Spannungen und Klimarisiken kaum zu überschätzen ist.

2. Wertschöpfung durch Verarbeitung und Ingredients

Herzstück der Wertschöpfung unter der Marke Bunge Global SA ist die Öl- und Proteintechnologie. Aus Soja, Raps, Sonnenblumen und weiteren Ölsaaten werden nicht nur Standardöle und -mehle gewonnen, sondern zunehmend hochspezialisierte Produkte:

Spezialöle und -fette für Backwaren, Süßwaren, Convenience-Food und Gastronomie

Hochwertige Pflanzenproteine für Fleisch- und Milchersatzprodukte

Tailor-made Fett- und Ölformulierungen für Markenhersteller, etwa hinsichtlich Schmelzpunkt, Struktur, Sensorik oder Nährwertprofil

Futtermittelbestandteile und Proteinmehle mit optimiertem Aminosäurenprofil für Geflügel, Schwein und Aquakultur

Im Markt gilt Bunge Global SA als einer der technologisch führenden Anbieter, wenn es um die Kombination aus großskaliger Verarbeitung, Prozess-Know-how und kundenspezifischer Formulierungskompetenz geht. Die Übernahmen und Joint Ventures der vergangenen Jahre – insbesondere im Bereich Spezialöle und -fette – wurden gezielt genutzt, um diese Kompetenz auszubauen.

3. Nachhaltigkeit, Rückverfolgbarkeit und Dekarbonisierung

Ein wesentlicher Differenzierungsfaktor von Bunge Global SA liegt in der systematischen Integration von ESG- und Nachhaltigkeitskriterien in das operative Geschäft. Zu den zentralen Elementen gehören:

Programme zur entwaldungsfreien Lieferkette, vor allem in Südamerika

Digitale Rückverfolgbarkeitssysteme von der Farm bis zur Fabrik

Carbon-Footprint-Analysen und Climate-Smart-Agriculture-Initiativen für Landwirte

Lieferkettenlösungen für Biodiesel, SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) und weitere biobasierte Energieträger auf Basis von Pflanzenölen

Gerade große Markenhersteller im Lebensmittel- und Einzelhandelsbereich verlangen heute Transparenz und klare CO?-Reduktionspfade ihrer Lieferkette. Bunge Global SA positioniert sich hier als Partner, der nicht nur Rohstoffe liefert, sondern gleichzeitig Daten, Zertifizierungen und Dekarbonisierungsstrategien mitliefert.

Damit wird die Plattform zu weit mehr als einem klassischen Commodity-Player: Sie entwickelt sich zu einer Art Infrastruktur- und Datenlayer der globalen Agrar- und Food-Industrie. Für Kunden bedeutet das: weniger operative Komplexität, geringeres Beschaffungs- und Reputationsrisiko, dafür höhere Planungssicherheit.

Der Wettbewerb: Bunge Global Aktie gegen den Rest

Im direkten Vergleich bewegt sich Bunge Global SA in einem hochkonzentrierten Wettbewerbsumfeld. Zu den zentralen Rivalen zählen Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM), Cargill und – mit gewissem Abstand und anderer Struktur – Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC). Sie alle verfolgen ähnliche Strategien: vertikale Integration, Ausbau von Ingredients, Fokus auf Nachhaltigkeit und Daten.

Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)

ADM positioniert sein eigenes Plattform-Geschäft mit Lösungen wie ""ADM Nutrition"" und ""ADM Origination"". Insbesondere im Bereich Spezialzutaten und Aromen hat ADM in den letzten Jahren massiv investiert und sich über Akquisitionen ein breites Portfolio aufgebaut – von Textur- und Geschmacksstoffen bis zu funktionalen Zutaten für Health-&-Wellness-Produkte.

Im direkten Vergleich zu ADM punktet Bunge Global SA mit:

Stärkerer Fokussierung auf Öl- und Fetttechnologie: Während ADM breiter in Richtung Aromen und Spezialzutaten diversifiziert, bleibt Bunge besonders tief in Ölsaaten und Fetten verankert – ein Bereich, in dem Skaleneffekte und Prozess-Know-how entscheidend sind.

Signifikanter Export- und Logistik-Footprint in Südamerika: Brasiliens Soja- und Getreideexporte sind ein zentrales Schlachtfeld. Bunge hat dort einen besonders starken physischen Footprint, der sich schwer replizieren lässt.

Cargill

Cargill ist als nicht-börsennotiertes Unternehmen weniger transparent, gilt aber als einer der größten Wettbewerber. Mit Geschäftsbereichen wie Cargill Agricultural Supply Chain, Cargill Protein & Salt sowie Cargill Food Ingredients and Bio-Industrial verfolgt der Konzern eine ähnliche Plattformlogik wie Bunge Global SA.

Im direkten Vergleich zu Cargill zeigen sich unterschiedliche Schwerpunkte:

Corporate Governance und Kapitalmarkt-Transparenz: Bunge Global SA ist börsennotiert und muss daher deutlich stärker und strukturierter reporten. Für institutionelle Kunden und Investoren kann diese Transparenz ein Vorteil sein, insbesondere bei ESG-Themen.

Klare Fokussierung auf ölsaatenbasierte Wertschöpfung: Cargill ist breiter in Protein (insbesondere Fleisch) und weiteren Value-Chains aktiv. Bunge Global SA baut dagegen sein Profil als Ölsaaten-, Pflanzenöl- und Ingredients-Spezialist weiter aus.

Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC)

LDC ist im Origination- und Handelsgeschäft stark, hat jedoch – im Vergleich zu Bunge Global SA – bislang weniger tief reichende, global integrierte Ingredients-Strukturen aufgebaut. Während LDC an der Transformation arbeitet, ist Bunge Global SA im Zusammenspiel aus Origination, Processing und Ingredients bereits deutlich weiter.

Im Gesamtbild ergibt sich ein Markt, in dem die großen Vier – Bunge, ADM, Cargill, LDC – um Marktanteile, aber vor allem um Qualität und Tiefe der Plattformen konkurrieren. Bunge Global SA nutzt dabei seinen Fokus auf Ölsaaten, Pflanzenöle, Proteine und Spezialfette, um sich als technologisch getriebener, aber zugleich skaleneffizienter Anbieter zu positionieren.

Warum Bunge Global SA die Nase vorn hat

Die zentrale Frage für Kunden und Investoren lautet: Was macht Bunge Global SA im Vergleich zum Wettbewerb tatsächlich besser – jenseits der üblichen Marketingformeln? Drei Aspekte stechen hervor:

1. Tiefe statt Breite in der Wertschöpfung

Während einige Wettbewerber stark in die horizontale Diversifikation – etwa in Aromen, Fertigprodukte oder Non-Food-Bereiche – gegangen sind, setzt Bunge Global SA konsequent auf die Tiefe in einem klar definierten Kern: Ölsaaten, Pflanzenöle, Proteine und daraus abgeleitete Ingredients.

Diese Fokussierung hat konkrete Auswirkungen:

Höhere Effizienz in Crushing- und Raffinerieprozessen durch Spezialisierung

Bessere Nutzung von Nebenprodukten, etwa in Tierfutter oder Bioenergie

Schnellere Innovationszyklen bei Spezialölen und -fetten, weil F&E eng an das Kerngeschäft angebunden ist

Gerade für große FMCG-Hersteller, die global einheitliche, aber funktional hochspezifische Fett- und Ölprofile benötigen, wird diese Prozess- und Formulierungskompetenz zum entscheidenden Mehrwert.

2. Plattform + Daten als Service

Bunge Global SA versteht sich zunehmend als Datenlieferant – nicht nur als Rohstofflieferant. Das beginnt bei Rückverfolgbarkeitssystemen und reicht über Nachhaltigkeitsmetriken bis hin zu Marktdatendiensten und Risk-Management-Services für Industriekunden.

Für Unternehmen, die eigene ESG-Reportingpflichten erfüllen müssen, ist das ein massiver Vorteil. Anstatt fragmentierte Daten aus diversen Lieferanten mühsam zu konsolidieren, können sie auf standardisierte, auditierbare Datenströme aus einer integrierten Plattform zurückgreifen. Diese Servicekomponente – Daten, Analytik, Risk-Management – ist es, die Bunge Global SA aus der Commodity-Ecke herausführt und in Richtung strategischer Partner verschiebt.

3. Skaleneffekte in Emerging Markets

Mit seinem starken Footprint in Brasilien, Argentinien und weiteren Wachstumsregionen ist Bunge Global SA in der Lage, Volatilität in der Rohstoffversorgung besser abzufedern als viele kleinere oder regional fokussierte Wettbewerber. In einem Umfeld, in dem Wetterextreme, Exportrestriktionen und geopolitische Spannungen eher zu- als abnehmen, wird dieser Punkt zu einem klaren USP.

Für Kunden bedeutet das: stabilere Versorgung, geringere Preisrisiken, Zugang zu mehreren Herkunftsregionen und die Möglichkeit, Nachhaltigkeitsanforderungen (z.B. entwaldungsfrei) bereits auf der Origination-Ebene zu verankern. Diese Kombination aus physischer Präsenz, Skaleneffekten und Nachhaltigkeitsmanagement ist einer der Gründe, warum Bunge Global SA häufig als bevorzugter Partner für globale Beschaffungsprogramme ausgewählt wird.

Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis und Innovationskraft

Aus Sicht der Abnehmer bietet Bunge Global SA ein attraktives Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis, weil die skalengetriebene Effizienz in der Supply Chain nicht nur die Margen des Unternehmens, sondern auch die Kostenposition der Kunden verbessert. Gleichzeitig sorgt der Fokus auf anwendungsnahe F&E – etwa in Test- und Pilotanlagen – dafür, dass Kunden gemeinsam mit Bunge neue Produkte oder Rezepturen entwickeln können, ohne selbst die gesamte technologische Infrastruktur vorhalten zu müssen.

Im direkten Vergleich zu Wettbewerbern, die entweder sehr stark auf High-End-Spezialzutaten (mit entsprechender Preisprämie) oder auf reines Commodity-Volumen setzen, besetzt Bunge Global SA damit eine attraktive Mittelposition: industrielle Skaleneffizienz kombiniert mit ausreichend Differenzierung in den Produkten.

Bedeutung für Aktie und Unternehmen

Die Transformation hin zu Bunge Global SA als integrierter Plattform ist nicht nur ein strategisches Industrieprojekt, sondern schlägt sich auch in der Wahrnehmung der Bunge Global Aktie (ISIN US12185T1043) nieder. Anleger bewerten Agrarrohstoff-Konzerne traditionell mit einem Bewertungsabschlag, weil sie sie stark an zyklische Rohstoffmärkte gekoppelt sehen. Je mehr jedoch das Wertschöpfungsprofil von Bunge Global SA in Richtung Ingredients, Dienstleistungen und Daten verschoben wird, desto stärker reduziert sich diese reine Commodity-Wahrnehmung.

Aktuelle Kurs- und Performanceeinordnung

Laut mehreren Finanzportalen lag der letzte verfügbare Schlusskurs der Bunge Global Aktie vor US-Handelsschluss – gemessen in US-Dollar – im mittleren zweistelligen Bereich. Die genauen Zahlen variieren je nach Quelle, doch die Tendenz ist über die vergangenen Quartale stabil bis moderat wachsend. Wichtig: Diese Kursniveaus reflektieren nicht nur kurzfristige Preisbewegungen bei Soja, Mais oder Pflanzenölen, sondern zunehmend auch die Erwartung des Marktes an die zukünftige Ertragsqualität des Unternehmens.

Analystenbewertungen, die öffentlich zugänglich sind, betonen regelmäßig drei Faktoren, die direkt mit Bunge Global SA verknüpft sind:

Höhere Margenstabilität durch einen steigenden Anteil von Ingredients und spezialisierten Food- und Feed-Lösungen am Gesamtumsatz.

Verbesserte Risikodiversifikation dank global verteilter Origination und Logistik.

ESG- und Dekarbonisierungs-Potenzial, das für viele institutionelle Investoren inzwischen zur Pflichtanforderung geworden ist.

Wachstumstreiber für die Bunge Global Aktie

Bunge Global SA wirkt auf die Aktie als langfristiger Wachstumstreiber in mehrfacher Hinsicht:

Steigende Nachfrage nach pflanzenbasierten Proteinen und Spezialfetten für die Lebensmittelindustrie

Nebenmärkte wie Biodiesel und Sustainable Aviation Fuel, die zusätzliche Absatzkanäle für Pflanzenöle öffnen

Wachsende Bedeutung von rückverfolgbaren, zertifizierten Lieferketten als Differenzierungsmerkmal

Skaleneffekte in aufstrebenden Märkten, die sowohl Umsatz- als auch Ergebnispotenzial liefern

Risiken bleiben: Preisvolatilität auf den Rohstoffmärkten, regulatorische Änderungen, geopolitische Spannungen und Klimarisiken können kurzfristig auf Margen und Bewertung drücken. Dennoch zeigt der strategische Kurs von Bunge Global SA, dass das Unternehmen – und damit die Bunge Global Aktie – zunehmend als Plattforminvestment in die globale Ernährungs- und Energiezukunft verstanden werden kann, nicht mehr nur als Wette auf den nächsten Soja-Zyklus.

Fazit für Industrie und Kapitalmarkt

Für die Lebensmittel- und Agrarindustrie ist Bunge Global SA heute ein zentraler Infrastrukturanbieter, der weit über klassische Handelstätigkeiten hinausgeht. Für Investoren ist das Konstrukt ein Hybrid aus Rohstoff-Exposure, Infrastrukturgeschäft, Ingredients-Spezialist und ESG-Enablement-Platform. In diesem Spannungsfeld liegt die eigentliche Stärke: Bunge Global SA verbindet physische Skaleneffizienz mit technologischer und datengetriebener Differenzierung.

Wer die Entwicklung der Bunge Global Aktie bewertet, muss daher weniger fragen, wie sich der nächste Erntezyklus entwickelt, sondern stärker, wie konsequent das Unternehmen seine Plattformstrategie umsetzt, seine Ingredients- und Service-Umsätze steigert und seine Nachhaltigkeitsziele erreicht. Genau darin liegt die eigentliche Investment-Story hinter Bunge Global SA.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405035_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 10:58:32.426450

This event will serve as a critical stepping stone in shaping the future of sustainable tourism across Europe, feeding directly into the upcoming EU Strategy for Sustainable Tourism.

The European Commission’s European Tourism Day marks an important step in shaping the future of tourism across Europe, particularly in terms of sustainability.","The European Commission’s newly unveiled strategy for sustainable tourism is set to reshape Ireland’s travel industry, focusing on green aviation, emissions transparency, and digital travel innovations. With tourism contributing significantly to Ireland’s economy, these reforms will not only enhance the country’s sustainability efforts but also streamline border crossings and reduce the carbon footprint of both corporate and leisure travel. By targeting key areas like decarbonisation and accessibility, the strategy positions Ireland at the forefront of the EU’s green transformation, ensuring its tourism sector thrives while meeting climate goals.

On January 23, 2026, the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport confirmed that Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas will host European Tourism Day in Brussels on January 26. This event will serve as a critical stepping stone in shaping the future of sustainable tourism across Europe, feeding directly into the upcoming EU Strategy for Sustainable Tourism. Key topics to be addressed at the event include decarbonisation, accessibility, the integration of artificial intelligence, and private sector investment.

Tourism in Ireland plays a pivotal role in the national economy, contributing around 4 percent to the country’s GDP and supporting one in every ten jobs. As a result, the direction of the EU’s sustainable tourism strategy will have a direct impact on various aspects of Ireland’s tourism landscape. From aviation slot allocation at Dublin Airport to funding for green destination initiatives along the Wild Atlantic Way, these changes will influence how Ireland approaches tourism development in the coming years. The EU Commission is expected to advocate for enhanced rail connectivity, making it easier to travel across the country, while also proposing stricter emissions reporting for short-haul flights. These measures could potentially increase costs for airlines serving Irish routes, but they also have the potential to accelerate investments in low-carbon aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel, driving Ireland towards a more sustainable future in travel.

On the corporate side, business travel managers working for multinational companies based in Ireland may soon find themselves faced with EU-wide reporting obligations related to business-trip emissions. This new regulation will align with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), a policy that aims to enhance transparency regarding companies’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts. For Irish-based companies, this will add an additional layer of responsibility in tracking and reporting business travel emissions, ensuring greater accountability within corporate sustainability frameworks.

Digital identity proposals are also on the horizon, with the EU Travel Credentials system being tested in countries like France and the Netherlands. If implemented, this system could streamline border crossings for EU citizens, including Irish passport holders. The goal is to create a more efficient and secure process, which could significantly reduce waiting times at borders and improve the overall travel experience for European citizens. This system could also facilitate easier travel for businesses, ensuring smoother movement of goods and services across borders within the EU.

For those needing to stay informed about shifting entry regulations, VisaHQ’s Ireland portal offers valuable resources. The platform provides real-time updates on visa requirements worldwide, as well as managing the entire application process online. This service will be increasingly important as EU policy reforms impact global mobility rules. VisaHQ’s ability to offer this real-time guidance is a crucial asset for both individuals and companies looking to navigate changing regulations, ensuring they are always up-to-date with the latest travel and entry requirements.

Stakeholders in Ireland’s tourism sector—such as Fáilte Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation (ITIC), and large tour operators—will have the opportunity to participate in the European Tourism Day event through virtual attendance, with livestreamed sessions available for those who cannot attend in person. The final strategy paper for the EU’s Sustainable Tourism Plan is expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2026. Once adopted, it will have a far-reaching impact on EU funding opportunities under major programmes like InvestEU and Horizon Europe, providing new avenues for investment in sustainable tourism initiatives across Europe.

For businesses involved in mobility and travel, it is essential to closely monitor the ongoing discussions surrounding these policy changes. Green criteria are likely to become a key component of public-sector travel procurement, and this trend may also extend to corporate social responsibility (CSR) frameworks. The incorporation of green travel policies into corporate relocation strategies is already becoming more prevalent, and the EU’s push for sustainable tourism will only amplify this shift.

The European Commission’s European Tourism Day marks an important step in shaping the future of tourism across Europe, particularly in terms of sustainability. Ireland, with its robust tourism sector, will undoubtedly feel the effects of the EU’s policy changes, as they aim to balance economic growth with environmental responsibility. From stricter emissions regulations to digital travel credentials, the reforms proposed will not only influence the tourism industry but will also have lasting effects on the way businesses and travelers navigate the EU’s evolving travel landscape. Companies and stakeholders in the tourism and mobility sectors are advised to stay engaged with these developments, as they are poised to reshape the future of European travel for years to come.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/istockphoto-1015452504-612x612-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 19:57:04.322973

The A350-900s will become the cornerstone of the airline’s long-haul fleet renewal and expansion strategy.

Better for the Planet and Passengers

The Airbus A350-900 brings unmissable efficiency gains. Its modern design and new Rolls-Royce engines cut fuel use and CO₂ emissions by about 25% compared to older planes. It can also fly with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). For travellers, the cabin is quieter and more comfortable. It has higher humidity, lower cabin pressure, and bigger windows. This aligns with Air Europa’s focus on quality service on long flights.

Long-Haul Fleet Shifts From Boeing to Airbus

The order marks a strategic shift for Air Europa, which currently relies on an all-Boeing long-haul fleet of 28 Dreamliners (10 787-8s and 18 787-9s). The new A350-900s are expected to initially replace the older 787-8s, which average nearly ten years of age. Air Europa operates 83 weekly flights from Madrid to Latin America, a region the airline describes as the most distinctive part of its network. The A350’s range of up to 9,700 nautical miles makes it ideally suited for these demanding transatlantic routes.

Air Europa’s Plan for Growth

These technologies work by capturing CO₂ from industrial emissions or even directly from the atmosphere and then using renewable power to drive chemical reactions that build up carbon chains equivalent to those in kerosene‑type fuels. Once fully refined, the resulting SAF can be blended with or replace traditional jet fuel with no modifications required to existing aircraft or refuelling infrastructure.

Major research and commercial efforts are underway worldwide to scale these solutions. For example, projects combining **carbon recycling and alcohol‑to‑jet (AtJ) technology** are being tested to transform waste carbon streams into sustainable fuels using renewable power and fermentation processes, creating pathways for large‑scale SAF production.

Such innovations offer a potentially transformative route to decarbonise aviation — a sector that has historically been difficult to electrify due to the high energy density demands of jet fuel. While conventional SAF production (e.g., from bio‑based feedstocks) is already underway with plans for increased blending mandates, CO₂‑to‑fuel technologies could expand the industry’s ability to reduce net emissions by turning a greenhouse gas into the very fuel that powers aircraft.

Industry analysts note that widespread deployment of carbon‑to‑fuel systems could help aviation meet long‑term climate targets, including net‑zero goals by 2050, but scaling remains a challenge. This requires not only technological maturity but also investments in renewable energy, carbon capture infrastructure and regulatory frameworks that support SAF incentives and market uptake.",https://hospitalitycareerprofile.com/uploads/images/202601/image_870x580_6974ce0012102.webp,N,,2026-01-24 16:57:25.290273

According to the company’s consolidated results, revenue from power supply increased by 21 per cent to Rs 2,420 crore in the third quarter of FY26, compared with Rs 1,993 crore in the same quarter a year earlier. For the nine-month period, revenue climbed 25 per cent to Rs 8,508 crore from Rs 6,829 crore in 9M FY25.

EBITDA from power supply also posted healthy growth. In Q3 FY26, EBITDA stood at Rs 2,269 crore, up 23 per cent from Rs 1,848 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. For the first nine months of FY26, EBITDA rose 24 per cent to Rs 7,921 crore, compared with Rs 6,366 crore in the same period of the previous year.

EBITDA margins remained strong, though slightly lower year-on-year. Margins from power supply stood at 90.6 per cent in Q3 FY26 versus 91.4 per cent in Q3 FY25, while nine-month margins eased to 91.5 per cent from 92.0 per cent in 9M FY25.

Cash profit for the quarter declined 18 per cent to Rs 812 crore in Q3 FY26, compared with Rs 996 crore a year earlier. However, on a nine-month basis, cash profit increased 7 per cent to Rs 3,906 crore from Rs 3,639 crore in the corresponding period of FY25.

The company said strong revenue and EBITDA growth were largely driven by greenfield capacity additions of 5.6 GW, deployment of advanced renewable technologies, high plant performance, and commissioning of new projects in resource-rich locations such as Khavda in Gujarat and sites in Rajasthan.

Commenting on the results, AGEL Chief Executive Officer Ashish Khanna said the company continued its strong growth trajectory in calendar year 2026, adding 5.6 GW of renewable energy capacity—nearly 14 per cent of all new solar and wind capacity installed in India. He said AGEL’s operational capacity has now reached 17.2 GW, reinforcing its position as the country’s leading green energy producer.

Khanna said the flagship Khavda project, billed as the world’s largest renewable energy installation, is progressing at an accelerated pace. He added that the company is on track to deploy one of the world’s largest single-location battery energy storage projects in the coming months, while its hydro pumped storage project on the Chitravathi river in Andhra Pradesh is also advancing as planned.

He further noted that during the first nine months of the current financial year, AGEL generated more than 27 billion units of clean electricity—enough to power a country the size of Azerbaijan for a year. Khanna said the company’s recognition as the world’s top green utility in the latest Energy Intelligence rankings reflects its commitment to sustainability and stakeholder value creation.

In its consolidated statement, AGEL said it has consistently expanded its greenfield capacity through advanced resource planning, engineering and supply chain management, supported by project execution and assurance from Adani Infra India Ltd. The company’s total operational capacity expanded 48 per cent year-on-year to 17.2 GW, keeping it on track to achieve its long-term target of 50 GW.

During the first nine months of FY26, AGEL added 2,995 MW of greenfield capacity, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the additions made in the entire FY25. Total greenfield additions over the past year stood at 5,630 MW, including 4,187 MW of solar capacity across Gujarat, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh; 462 MW of wind capacity at Khavda; and 981 MW of solar-wind hybrid capacity, also at Khavda.

The company said its operations and maintenance activities are supported by advanced data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, in collaboration with Adani Infra Management Services Pvt Ltd. AGEL has consistently generated electricity above its annual commitments under power purchase agreements, with PPA-based generation reaching 79 per cent of the annual target in 9M FY26.

According to the company, its technology-driven O&M model, anchored by an Energy Network Operation Center for real-time monitoring of plants nationwide, has helped improve plant availability, increase generation and reduce operating costs, resulting in an industry-leading EBITDA margin of 91.5 per cent.

AGEL said it continues to make steady progress on the 30 GW renewable energy project at Khavda in Gujarat, which spans 538 square kilometres—nearly five times the size of Paris. The project is expected to set a global benchmark for ultra-large-scale renewable energy development.

The operational portfolio at Khavda currently stands at 7.7 GW across solar, wind and hybrid capacity. With strong manpower deployment, a localized supply chain and advanced technologies such as robotic solar module installation, the company said it remains on track to achieve 30 GW of renewable energy capacity at Khavda by 2029.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Adani-Energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 15:56:49.655441

Jambojet, a Kenya-based low-cost airline, has been awarded the “Most Compelling Story” at The Aviation Challenge in Denmark, recognising a collaboration between the airline and Plastiki Rafiki, a people-driven circular economy initiative that transforms plastic waste into practical products while creating learning opportunities for students and income for community artisans. The recognition was announced in Copenhagen, where airlines from across the world gathered to showcase sustainability solutions tested within their operations and communities.

The story behind the award began in Nairobi’s informal settlements, university workshops, airport facilities and coastal cleanup sites. Over several months, students working with Plastiki Rafiki partnered with artisans from Mathare to collect and upcycle more than 1,000 kilograms of plastic waste into everyday items such as keychains and fridge magnets. The raw material came from multiple sources; beach clean-ups along Kenya’s coastline, discarded plastics from airport operations, and contributions from Jambojet staff, reflecting a model in which sustainability is embedded across communities, institutions and corporate systems.

For Kenya, where plastic pollution remains a visible and persistent challenge despite regulatory efforts such as the ban on plastic carrier bags, the initiative speaks to a broader gap between policy and practice. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, Africa generates more than 17 million tonnes of plastic waste annually, with only a fraction recycled. In Kenya alone, urban centres like Nairobi and Mombasa produce thousands of tonnes of plastic waste each day, much of it ending up in landfills, waterways and informal dumpsites. Against this backdrop, the Jambojet–Plastiki Rafiki collaboration represents a practical attempt to connect environmental action with economic opportunity.

What distinguished the initiative within the Aviation Challenge was its integration of social, environmental and operational realities. Students involved in the project gained hands-on exposure to sustainability beyond theory, learning how waste streams can be mapped, processed and converted into marketable products. Artisans in Mathare, many of whom operate within precarious informal economies, accessed new income streams through the production of upcycled goods. For the airline, the initiative provided a pathway to rethink waste generated within its own operations and to engage staff in sustainability beyond corporate reporting frameworks.

The Aviation Challenge itself has emerged as a global platform where airlines are required to design and implement sustainability initiatives within a defined period, often under resource constraints. Unlike traditional corporate social responsibility programmes, the challenge emphasises experimentation, cross-sector collaboration and measurable impact. Jambojet’s recognition in Copenhagen therefore signals more than a symbolic award; it reflects a growing expectation that African companies should articulate sustainability in ways that are locally grounded yet globally credible.

The implications extend beyond aviation. Across Africa, infrastructure sectors, from transport and energy to water and urban development, are under pressure to demonstrate environmental responsibility while responding to rapid population growth and urbanisation. The African Development Bank estimates that the continent faces an annual infrastructure financing gap of over $100 billion. At the same time, climate-related risks are intensifying, with African economies disproportionately exposed to floods, droughts and extreme weather events despite contributing minimally to global emissions.

Within this context, circular economy models like the one demonstrated through Plastiki Rafiki offer a practical lens through which sustainability can be understood not as an abstract concept, but as an economic strategy. By turning waste into value, such initiatives reduce environmental pressure while creating livelihoods. Countries such as Rwanda and South Africa have begun integrating circular economy principles into national strategies, while cities like Lagos and Accra are experimenting with community-based recycling enterprises. However, many of these efforts remain fragmented, underfunded or disconnected from mainstream corporate and policy frameworks.

Jambojet’s project illustrates how corporate actors can bridge this gap by working with grassroots innovators rather than operating in isolation. It also raises questions about scalability. While 1,000 kilograms of plastic diverted from landfill is modest compared to national waste volumes, the underlying model, linking corporate waste streams, educational institutions and informal sector artisans, offers a replicable framework. If adopted across multiple industries and cities, such collaborations could gradually shift how African economies manage waste and resource efficiency.

The recognition in Copenhagen also highlights the changing nature of corporate credibility in Africa. Investors, development partners and regulators increasingly scrutinise not only financial performance but also environmental and social impact. For airlines, which face mounting pressure to decarbonise and improve environmental practices, initiatives rooted in local realities may become as important as technological innovations such as sustainable aviation fuel or fleet modernisation.

Ultimately, the Jambojet-Plastiki Rafiki story is not about an award ceremony in Europe, but about a quiet experiment in Kenya that connects plastic waste, student learning, informal livelihoods and corporate responsibility. It reflects a broader shift in how sustainability is being defined across Africa, not as a distant policy goal, but as a set of everyday choices shaped by communities, businesses and institutions navigating complex economic and environmental realities.

As African economies continue to grapple with the dual pressures of development and climate risk, such stories may offer clues about where sustainable growth will actually come from: not only from large-scale infrastructure projects or international financing pledges, but from local innovations that reimagine waste, work and value in tangible ways.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/JAMBO-JET-AT-AVIATION-AWARDS-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 14:56:46.769798

Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) governor ACM Manat Chuaprayoon said there were a total of 145.1 million passengers last year, including 67 million domestic passengers and 78 million international travellers. The total represents an increase of 4.9 million passengers, or 3.54%, from the previous year.

Although the figure was still lower than pre-Covid levels in 2019, when Thailand saw a higher number of Chinese tourists, the shortfall was partially offset by strong growth in Central Asian, Middle Eastern and long-haul markets, he said.

In 2025, challenges including international conflicts, heightened geopolitical tensions, and airspace restrictions arising from disputes such as Pakistan–India, Israel–Iran, and Russia–Ukraine placed additional pressure on airlines worldwide, ACM Manat said.

Despite these constraints, Thailand's aviation sector demonstrated resilience and improved efficiency. Passenger numbers stood at 161.81 million in 2019, fell to 140.6 million in 2024 and rose again to 145.1 million in 2025, indicating a continued upward trajectory.

Heathrow has also lifted the 100ml restriction that previously applied to liquids carried in hand luggage.
Stansted and Luton airports both allow liquids to remain in hand luggage but restrict the quantity to 100ml.
It says the changes should mean that “thousands of passengers an hour” should be able to pass through security with “significantly greater efficiency” but while maintaining security.
Last year, the vast majority of passengers queued for less than five minutes before being able to pass through security, the airport said.","Passengers flying from Heathrow will no longer have to remove liquids and laptops from their bags when passing through security.

The airport said on Friday it had completed a £1bn upgrade of its security systems that will enable all items to be scanned while remaining in bags.

The roll-out of “next generation” CT scanners should help passengers to pass more quickly through security checks before boarding a flight – a bonus ahead of upcoming peak travel periods such as the February half-term school break and the Easter holidays.

Heathrow is one of the last UK airports to make the changes - others such as Gatwick, Stansted and London City already allow passengers to keep liquids in their hand luggage.

Heathrow has also lifted the 100ml restriction that previously applied to liquids carried in hand luggage.

Now it allows passengers to take bottles or containers with up to two litres of liquid on board.

However, refillable metal or “double walled” or vacuum containers must be emptied, but can be refilled once through security.

Stansted and Luton airports both allow liquids to remain in hand luggage but restrict the quantity to 100ml.

The west London airport estimates that the changes will avoid the use of 16 million plastic bags a year – previously used to ensure toiletries and other liquids were visible to security staff.

Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye said: “Every Heathrow passenger can now leave their liquids and laptops in their bags at security as we become the largest airport in the world to roll out the latest security scanning technology.

Is it imperative to apply the registered owner rule? YES. And this is the story.

Sometime in 2000, Janine R. Cruz was walking along the west-bound lane of Sampaguita Street, UPS IV, Parañaque City. Opposite Janine, a Mitsubishi L-300 van was travelling along the east-bound lane. To avoid an incoming vehicle, the van swerved to its left. It hit Janine. A good Samaritan brought Janine to a hospital. However, Janine died two days after the accident.

Upon investigation, it was found out that the registered owner of the Van was Caravan Travel, Inc., an entity engaged in the business of organizing travel and tours in Manila. The driver was Jim Bautista in the employ of Caravan as its service driver.

Janine’s paternal Aunt subsequently filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Parañaque a Complaint for damages against Jim and Caravan . The Complaint alleged that Jim was an employee of Caravan and that Caravan as the registered owner of the van should be held directly and primarily liable.

After trial, the RTC found that Jim was grossly negligent in driving the vehicle. In addition, it awarded damages to the complainant.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the RTC. And after the denial of its Motion for Reconsideration, Caravan appealed to the Supreme Court.

And the SC ruled in the following tenor:

“ x x x.

Contrary to petitioner’s position, it was not fatal to respondent’s cause that she herself did not adduce proof that ________ acted within the scope of his authority. It was sufficient that ___________ proved that the petitioner was the registered owner of the van that hit ________.

The resolution of this case must consider two (2) rules. First, Article 2180’s specification that “[e]mployers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees . . . acting within the scope of their assigned tasks[.] “Second, the operation of the registered owner rule that registered owners are liable for death or injuries caused by the operation of their vehicles.

These rules appear to be in conflict when it comes to cases in which the employer is also the registered owner of a vehicle. Article 2180 requires proof of two things; first, an employment relationship between the driver and the owner; and second, that the driver acted within the scope of his or her assigned tasks. On the other hand, applying the registered owner rule only requires the plaintiff to prove that the defendant-employer is the registered owner of the vehicle.

x x x

Thus, it is imperative to apply the registered owner rule in a manner that harmonizes it with Articles 2176 and 2180 of the Civil Code. Rules must be construed in a manner that will harmonize them with other rules so as to form a uniform and consistent system of jurisprudence. In light of this, the words used in Del Carmen are particularly notable. There, this court stated that Article 2180 “should defer to the registered owner rule”. It never stated that Article 2180 should be totally abandoned.

I wish to stress that in cases where both the registered-owner rule and Article 2180 apply, the plaintiff must first establish that the employer is the registered owner of the vehicle involved. Once the plaintiff successfully proves ownership, there arises a disputable presumption that the requirements of Article 2180 have been proven. Then and only then, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to show that no liability under Article 2180 has arisen.

In a high-stakes gathering held this week in Copenhagen, Denmark, Kenya Airways and its regional subsidiary Jambojet secured four major global titles at The Aviation Challenge 2025 awards, signaling a decisive shift in how African carriers are navigating the complex transition to a net-zero future. The ceremony, organized by the SkyTeam Alliance, brought together twenty-four of the world’s most influential airlines to demonstrate that decarbonizing the skies is no longer a theoretical exercise but a series of measurable, operational victories.

For the African continent, these wins represent more than just trophies; they serve as a blueprint for how airlines in developing economies can leapfrog traditional, carbon-heavy practices despite the significant financial and infrastructural hurdles that often stall green initiatives in the Global South.

Kenya Airways clinched the award for the Most Impactful Solution in Catering, a category that addressed one of the most visible waste problems in the industry. By systematically stripping single-use plastics from its cabin service and replacing them with locally sourced, biodegradable materials and aluminum alternatives, the airline proved that the circular economy can function at 35,000 feet. This achievement is grounded in a stark reality for African aviation, where waste management infrastructure on the ground is often fragmented.

Ensuring that materials are either compostable or infinitely recyclable, the carrier is reducing the burden on municipal waste systems in cities like Nairobi and Lagos, where landfills are already pushed to their limits. The numbers back the scale of this intervention: the airline has successfully avoided more than 337 tonnes of single-use plastic annually, a move that is simultaneously saving the company over KES 50 million each year.

The recognition extended beyond corporate policy to individual leadership, with Miriam Wangombe of Kenya Airways being named Game Changer of the Year. Her work focused on the “unseen” side of aviation sustainability, the upcycling of decommissioned textiles and the integration of a farm-to-fork supply chain. This approach directly addresses the economic leakage often seen in African aviation, where catering and supplies are frequently imported. By anchoring the supply chain within local Kenyan agriculture and small-scale manufacturing, the airline is effectively turning environmental policy into a tool for regional economic resilience. This model suggests that sustainability in Africa is inextricably linked to local content and the empowerment of domestic value chains.

Jambojet, operating in the highly competitive low-cost segment, took home the award for the Most Compelling Story for its work in turning plastic waste into community infrastructure. Through a partnership with the Plastiki Rafiki project, the airline demonstrated how an industry often criticized for its carbon footprint can provide tangible social dividends. The project involves collecting over 1,000 kilograms of plastic waste generated through operations and coastal tourism and mechanically recycling it into furniture and educational tools for schools. In a region where only a fraction of plastic waste is recycled, Jambojet’s initiative offers a practical solution to the plastic crisis while providing much-needed resources to underserved communities.

These victories come at a time when the African aviation sector is facing immense pressure to grow while simultaneously meeting the stringent requirements of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. Unlike their European or North American counterparts, African airlines often operate with older, less fuel-efficient fleets and have limited access to the massive subsidies required to scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. However, the performance of the Kenyan carriers in Copenhagen suggests that efficiency is not solely dependent on multibillion-dollar engine upgrades. Significant gains are being made through operational discipline, such as weight reduction, smarter flight path planning, and the total overhaul of cabin waste protocols.

The collaborative spirit of the challenge was further highlighted when Kenya Airways received special recognition for its partnership with KLM. This cross-continental data sharing is critical for a continent that contributes less than four percent of global greenhouse gas emissions but remains the most vulnerable to climate-driven disruptions. The partnership has allowed for the transfer of technical knowledge regarding flight deck efficiency and ground handling optimizations that can be applied across different regulatory environments. This exchange of intellectual capital is perhaps the most sustainable outcome of the challenge, as it builds a repository of best practices that other African carriers, from Ethiopian Airlines to RwandAir, can adapt to their specific operating contexts.

As the industry looks toward the 2050 net-zero target, the data coming out of the 2025 Aviation Challenge provides a sobering yet optimistic look at the numbers. On the challenge flights, participating airlines saw an average reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger kilometer, driven by a combination of SAF blending and radical weight-saving measures.

For Africa, the path forward involves balancing this environmental necessity with the continent’s need for greater air connectivity to drive the African Continental Free Trade Area.

Sustainability forms another important strand of the conversation at Wings India 2026.","When Wings India 2026 opens in Hyderabad from 28–31 January, it will do so against a backdrop of changing priorities in Indian aviation. The conversation has moved beyond headline fleet orders and airport counts toward more practical questions—how regional connectivity can be sustained over time, how supply chains are anchored, and how operating models mature beyond selective routes and initial trial phases.

It is within this context that Deutsche Aircraft’s participation at Wings India 2026—Hall C, Stall 46–47C—assumes relevance. Rather than positioning the D328eco as a future-facing concept, the company is expected to leverage the event to underline how India already forms part of the programme’s industrial and supply-chain framework, and how regional aircraft economics are becoming increasingly central to India’s next phase of aviation growth.

Regional connectivity: the gap is no longer demand, but aircraft fit

India is now the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market, yet regional traffic remains structurally concentrated. Despite a steady increase in the number of operational airports, a disproportionate share of turboprop traffic continues to flow through a limited set of major hubs. This reflects a long-standing mismatch: demand exists beyond metros, but aligning aircraft size, performance margins, and operating economics with diverse regional conditions has remained challenging.

Wings India 2026 arrives at a point where this imbalance is harder to overlook. Regional routes are no longer peripheral experiments; they are increasingly tied to network resilience, political commitments around connectivity, and airline fleet planning. At the same time, operators have had to work within the constraints of existing fleet mixes—often balancing larger aircraft that are less efficient on short or performance-limited runways with smaller platforms whose operational envelopes were shaped for different markets and conditions.

The D328eco is positioned within this context. Designed as a 40-seat turboprop with short take-off and landing capability, steep-approach performance, and a modern systems architecture, the aircraft is aimed at operating environments that have historically limited sustained connectivity—across high-altitude regions, challenging terrain, and airports with infrastructure or performance constraints. In doing so, it addresses a long-standing gap in India’s regional aviation framework: limited availability of sub-50-seat, pressurised aircraft intended for consistent, year-round operations with viable economics.

From participation to integration: India’s role in the D328eco programme

Deutsche Aircraft’s presence at Wings India 2026 is also closely linked to India’s expanding role in the D328eco’s industrial roadmap. In 2025, the programme reached a notable milestone with the inauguration of the rear-fuselage assembly line in Bengaluru in partnership with Dynamatic Technologies, signalling a move from supplier engagement toward deeper programme-level integration.

Beyond this, Indian participation in the D328eco programme extends across multiple tiers of the supply chain. Engineering and digital design support from Cyient, alongside electrical interconnection systems and aerospace-grade manufacturing inputs from SASMOS HET Technologies, reflect a broader pattern of Indian companies contributing across structures, systems, and engineering domains. These engagements illustrate a shift toward sustained programme involvement, rather than isolated work packages tied to individual components.

This trajectory aligns with one of the central themes expected at Wings India 2026: the transition from “Make in India” as a policy objective to long-term participation in global aerospace value chains. For Deutsche Aircraft, India is being approached not as a peripheral sourcing base, but as an industrial partner supporting serial production, advanced manufacturing capabilities, and systems integration for a European-built aircraft.

Beyond manufacturing, attention is also turning toward ecosystem readiness. As regional fleets grow, so does the need for aligned capabilities in pilot training, technician skill development, and, over time, localised maintenance and support. While such elements typically evolve alongside fleet induction, their early consideration reflects a broader intent to avoid aircraft introduction without the surrounding infrastructure required to sustain operations efficiently.

Sustainability forms another important strand of the conversation at Wings India 2026. The D328eco is being developed with compatibility for 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, including Power-to-Liquid pathways, alongside reduced fuel burn and lower noise footprints compared with earlier-generation regional aircraft. For India, where short-haul sectors account for a significant share of domestic flying, modern turboprops represent one of the most immediate avenues for emissions reduction without waiting for disruptive propulsion technologies to mature.

As India’s aviation sector moves from rapid expansion toward consolidation and depth, the role of regional aircraft is being reassessed. Platforms that combine operational flexibility with modern sustainability standards are increasingly viewed as long-term enablers rather than transitional assets. Wings India 2026 provides the forum for that reassessment—and for Deutsche Aircraft, the event offers an opportunity to position the D328eco as a programme already shaped by, and increasingly aligned with, India’s aviation and industrial trajectory.",https://www.aviationjeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/D328eco-Blue-Sky-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 15:57:07.650167

Trafigura also holds an option to purchase additional volumes from Syzygy’s future projects, potentially supplying a significant portion of the growing demand for regulatory-compliant SAF.

The timing of the agreement is critical. Aviation is facing tightening SAF mandates amid constrained feedstock availability, as highlighted in the Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production: Outlook to 2050. Syzygy’s modular, electrified technology sidesteps these constraints by converting abundant biogas into SAF using renewable electricity.

Global trade runs on a mess of emails, PDFs, phone calls, legacy transport-management systems and spreadsheets that refuse to die. Every container, pallet and parcel touches a chain of carriers, ports, customs authorities and warehouses that rarely speak the same digital language. For shippers, that fragmentation shows up as blind spots in their supply chains, volatile freight costs, and a painful lack of control when something breaks.

Best known as one of the world’s largest sea and air freight forwarders, the company is deliberately repositioning itself as a digital logistics platform that connects these islands of data into something a global shipper can actually manage. It is less about one shiny consumer-facing app and more about building an integrated stack of services, from instant quotes and carbon visibility to AI-assisted network design, all delivered through the company’s digital ecosystem.

Inside the Flagship: Kuehne + Nagel International AG

Kuehne + Nagel International AG, as a product and platform, is a portfolio of digitally enabled logistics services more than a single application. But the pieces interlock with deliberate intent: give shippers one orchestrated view of their physical and digital supply chain. Several pillars stand out.

1. End-to-end digital freight orchestration

At the core is a suite of tools that covers sea, air, road, and contract logistics. Products such as the myKN customer portal, the Seaexplorer and Air logistics platforms, and tailored control-tower solutions form the front door to Kuehne + Nagel International AG’s capabilities.

Through these interfaces, shippers can request and compare rates, book capacity, manage documentation, monitor shipments, and collaborate across their logistics network. The bet is that a single, data-rich interface beats stitching together point solutions from airlines, ocean carriers, trucking brokers and warehouse providers.

2. Real-time visibility that goes beyond a dot on the map

Visibility has become table stakes in logistics, but Kuehne + Nagel International AG leans on its control-tower architecture and carrier-agnostic integrations to go deeper than basic track-and-trace. Seaexplorer, for example, aggregates schedule reliability, transit times and CO2 emissions across ocean carriers and services, letting customers decide if they’re optimizing for speed, cost, reliability or environmental impact.

On the air and road side, the company plugs into IoT, carrier telematics and partner systems to keep shipment milestones updated. That feeds into predictive alerts — think early warnings for port congestion, missed cut-offs, or weather-related disruptions. The product strategy is clear: visibility is not just where your freight is, but what is likely to happen next and which alternative options exist.

3. Integrated sustainability and emissions intelligence

One of the more distinctive layers of Kuehne + Nagel International AG is its focus on decarbonization tools. The company offers embedded CO2 calculation across its booking and planning tools, verified against industry standards, and pairs that with options like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for air freight, lower-emission ocean services, and optimized routing to cut emissions.

The digital layer does the heavy lifting: it calculates emissions across legs, simulates alternative scenarios (for instance, different ports or modes), and feeds that data into corporate ESG reporting. For multinationals under pressure to decarbonize scope 3 emissions, that combination of operational choice and reporting support becomes a core part of the product story.

4. Network design, analytics and AI-assisted decision support

Beyond daily execution, Kuehne + Nagel International AG bundles its footprint of warehouses, cross-dock facilities and transport partners with analytics engines. Shippers can simulate network redesigns — consolidating regional distribution centers, shifting volume from air to ocean, or redesigning inventory placement to cope with disruptions.

Machine learning models help forecast demand variability and capacity risks, while optimization engines recommend mode splits and routing options. Crucially, these tools are not offered as pure software-as-a-service in a vacuum; they are tied directly to Kuehne + Nagel’s ability to execute the chosen design across its physical network.

5. API-first integrations into enterprise systems

Kuehne + Nagel International AG is built to plug into the systems where freight decisions are increasingly made: ERP, order management and warehouse management platforms from vendors like SAP, Oracle and Blue Yonder. Rate retrieval, booking creation, status updates and document exchange can all be automated over APIs, turning freight flows into programmatic processes rather than email threads.

For large shippers, that API-first stance is critical. Logistics becomes part of a continuous data flow from purchase order to delivery, with Kuehne + Nagel acting as the orchestration engine rather than a detached service provider.

6. A global physical backbone that still matters

While the digital story grabs most of the narrative, the product called Kuehne + Nagel International AG is inseparable from the company’s physical assets and partnerships: presence in over 100 countries, contract logistics facilities, dedicated pharma and perishable hubs, and a dense network of air and sea freight capacities.

Digital upstarts in freight often run into a wall when shipments get complex or truly global. Kuehne + Nagel leans the other way: it already has the complexity, and the product strategy is to wrap it in software so it becomes usable and transparent for customers that operate at scale.

Market Rivals: Kuehne + Nagel Aktie vs. The Competition

In the digital-forwarding and logistics-orchestration space, three names inevitably show up when evaluating Kuehne + Nagel International AG: DSV, Deutsche Post DHL Group, and, more recently, Flexport and other digital-native players. Though those are companies rather than single apps, each competes through a specific flagship product strategy.

DSV and the myDSV platform

Compared directly to myDSV, DSV’s unified customer portal, Kuehne + Nagel International AG positions itself as broader and arguably deeper in multimodal orchestration. myDSV offers booking, visibility and documentation across DSV’s transport and logistics services, with a consistent UI and good integration options.

Where Kuehne + Nagel International AG pulls ahead is in its specialized vertical products — for example, pharma and healthcare, aerospace, high-tech, and industrial verticals where bespoke handling, GDP-compliant facilities or controlled-temperature networks are critical. Its Seaexplorer capabilities and focus on emissions transparency also give Kuehne + Nagel a stronger sustainability narrative than DSV’s more execution-centric tooling.

On the flip side, DSV has built a reputation for extremely lean operations and aggressive M&A-driven scaling. For cost-focused shippers with relatively standard needs, myDSV plus DSV’s network can be highly competitive on pure price-performance for basic transport.

Deutsche Post DHL Group and the myDHL suite

Deutsche Post DHL Group comes at the problem with a family of products such as myDHLi for air and ocean freight and the DHL Supply Chain digital suite for contract logistics. Compared directly to myDHLi, Kuehne + Nagel International AG targets the same sweet spot of transparency and control for multimodal freight.

myDHLi has leaned into a clean, intuitive interface and self-service quoting and booking, particularly attractive for mid-market shippers and heavy e-commerce users. DHL also enjoys a consumer-facing brand advantage in parcels and express that spills over into its B2B products.

Kuehne + Nagel’s counter is depth in complex, high-value supply chains and its somewhat more neutral position as a freight forwarder rather than a postal-express incumbent. Its platform tends to resonate with manufacturers and industrials that care as much about network engineering and strategic optimization as about execution. In those segments, the consulting-heavy and data-rich components of Kuehne + Nagel International AG can outmatch DHL’s more standardized approach.

Flexport: A digital-native upstart

Compared directly to Flexport Platform, the Silicon Valley-born freight forwarder that popularized the idea of a logistics control tower as a clean web app, Kuehne + Nagel International AG is less flashy but more industrial-grade.

Flexport made its name by giving shippers a single, modern interface for tracking shipments, managing documents and collaborating with partners. The product experience is sharp, and Flexport has invested heavily in self-service tools and data visualization. For high-growth, tech-savvy brands, that experience is appealing.

Kuehne + Nagel International AG offers a more expansive product matrix: broader global coverage, deeper verticalization (pharma, aerospace, automotive) and a larger contract logistics footprint. Its tools are designed to scale for Fortune 500 supply chains with thousands of SKUs and truly global networks. The trade-off is that it can feel less like a Silicon Valley SaaS app and more like a heavyweight enterprise platform tied to a legacy but powerful organization.

Where the rivalry is headed

The competitive battlefield is shifting from just who can move freight cheaper to who can give shippers the best combination of control, predictability and decarbonization. DSV, DHL and Flexport are all iterating on their platforms to close gaps. But Kuehne + Nagel International AG’s long-term strategy is clear: blend its global physical network with an increasingly modular, API-driven software layer that can slot into a customer’s existing tech stack.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

For all the noise around logistics tech, the reason Kuehne + Nagel International AG stands out is that it fuses three things most rivals struggle to combine at scale: a massive physical network, an API-first digital layer, and a credible decarbonization toolkit.

1. Logistics as an extensible platform, not a single app

Instead of betting everything on one monolithic portal, Kuehne + Nagel International AG behaves like a layered platform. myKN, Seaexplorer, vertical control towers, data and analytics modules — these are all components that can be turned on, extended or integrated via APIs.

That platform architecture matters because large shippers don’t want to rip and replace; they want to orchestrate. Kuehne + Nagel’s tools can sit underneath a customer’s own control tower or plug into third-party platforms, while still allowing the company to execute the physical flows. For CIOs and supply chain leaders wary of vendor lock-in, this flexibility becomes a decisive advantage.

2. Deep domain expertise encoded in software

What often separates Kuehne + Nagel International AG from pure tech players is the way its software embodies decades of operational know-how. Whether it’s Good Distribution Practice (GDP) requirements for pharmaceuticals, aerospace AOG (aircraft on ground) critical logistics, or temperature-controlled food chains, these operational intricacies are built into routing logic, exception workflows and compliance rules.

Competitors can mimic interfaces, but encoding this kind of domain expertise at global scale is harder. That’s particularly visible in highly regulated verticals, where Kuehne + Nagel can offer not just capacity but certified facilities, specialized teams and validated processes exposed through its digital layer.

3. A credible, operational approach to sustainability

Most logistics providers now talk about green corridors and carbon dashboards. Kuehne + Nagel International AG distinguishes itself by tying emissions data directly to operational choices. Customers can compare routing options based on CO2 impact, buy sustainable aviation fuel to reduce the footprint of specific lanes, or redesign their network to cut both cost and carbon.

That approach turns sustainability from a static report into a day-to-day planning parameter. In a regulatory landscape where corporate climate disclosures are tightening, having supply chain options that are both auditable and actionable is a real competitive edge.

4. Scale that still feels programmable

Finally, the combination of global scale and programmability is where Kuehne + Nagel International AG quietly shines. Many large incumbents have sprawling networks but clunky tech. Digital upstarts have great software but patchy global coverage. Kuehne + Nagel sits in a rare intersection: the company can programmatically expose instant capacity, rates and routing options across a truly global network.

For a shipper, that means being able to automate large parts of freight execution without sacrificing nuance in complex lanes, special cargo or regulatory environments. In a world where supply chains are being rewired due to geopolitics and nearshoring, that blend of flexibility and reach is hard to beat.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Kuehne + Nagel International AG, the product and platform, is not a side project; it sits at the center of how the company is valued as a public business.

Using live market data from multiple financial sources, Kuehne + Nagel Aktie (ISIN CH0025238863) recently traded in the mid double-digit CHF range per share, with a market capitalization solidly in the large-cap bracket. As of the latest available trading session data, financial portals such as Yahoo Finance and other major quote providers show the stock hovering close to its recent trend levels, with the most recent figure reflecting the last close price rather than live intraday moves. The exact price naturally fluctuates with the broader market, but the pattern is clear: investors increasingly price Kuehne + Nagel as more than a cyclical freight volume proxy.

Historically, freight forwarders traded largely on volume cycles and rate environments in sea and air. When spot rates spiked, margins followed; when capacity normalized, multiples compressed. The digitalization of logistics, however, changes the story. Platforms like Kuehne + Nagel International AG introduce more recurring, sticky revenue streams, higher switching costs, and stronger data moats.

Analysts that cover Kuehne + Nagel Aktie now explicitly call out the company’s digital capabilities, visibility offerings and sustainability solutions as differentiators that justify a premium to more commoditized peers. The product’s impact shows up in a few ways:

Customer retention and wallet share: Shippers that embed Kuehne + Nagel International AG into their planning and ERP stack are harder to dislodge, supporting more stable revenue.

Margin resilience: Data-driven optimization and value-added services (visibility, analytics, emissions management) carry better margins than pure freight reselling, softening the blow of down-cycles in spot markets.

Optionality for new services: Once the platform sits in the middle of a customer’s logistics flows, Kuehne + Nagel can layer on new products — from financing and insurance to further analytics modules — creating cross-selling and upselling opportunities that equity markets tend to reward.

Crucially, investors are looking for proof that the digital narrative translates into actual returns. That shows up in KPIs such as the share of bookings done through digital channels, penetration of the myKN portal, adoption of visibility and analytics modules, and revenue associated with value-added services beyond core freight. As these metrics improve, Kuehne + Nagel Aktie stands to benefit from a re-rating away from being seen purely as a cyclical carrier proxy toward a hybrid of asset-light logistics and software-enabled services.

There are risks, of course. Execution missteps, integration challenges after acquisitions, or macro shocks that hammer trade volumes can all pressure earnings and sentiment. Aggressive competitors like DSV and DHL will not stand still on digital either. But the direction of travel is unambiguous: in global logistics, the companies that own the orchestration layer will command a disproportionate share of value. Kuehne + Nagel International AG is the company’s bid to be that orchestrator.

For supply chain leaders, that makes the decision less about whose logo is on the container and more about which platform they can safely build critical flows on top of for the next decade. For shareholders tracking Kuehne + Nagel Aktie under ISIN CH0025238863, it turns the product roadmap into a direct driver of valuation, not just a supporting slide in the investor presentation.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405046_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 15:57:13.341274

FAQ What is included in the hydrogen market in Germany?","EU Advances Hydrogen Market Matching as Germany Faces Capacity Shortfall

The European Commission is advancing market matching for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen by inviting European offtakers to signal supply interest under the Hydrogen Mechanism, according to pv magazine. The current phase runs until March 20, 2026, under the EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform that links buyers with suppliers of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and derivatives including ammonia, methanol, eMethane and electro-sustainable aviation fuel. This follows the submission of supply offers from more than 260 projects from Nov. 12, 2025, to Jan. 2, 2026. The European Commission will outline further details at an online webinar on Jan. 27.

Separately, the European Commission has approved a EUR200 million ($234.9 million) German plan to support the production of renewable hydrogen and its derivatives in Canada. ""The scheme will support the construction of up to 300 MW of electrolysis capacity. The aid will be awarded through a competitive bidding process, planned to be concluded in 2027,"" wrote the European executive body.

German Electrolysis Rollout Progressing Slowly

The Institute of Energy Economics at the University of Cologne (EWI) said Germany's rollout of electrolysis capacity is progressing far more slowly than planned. The institute said installed electrolyser capacity currently stands at 181 MW, with a further 1.3 GW having reached a final investment decision (FID) or being under construction. On that basis, EWI said total operating capacity could reach up to 1.5 GW by the end of 2027, leaving Germany on course to fall well short of its target of 10 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030.

Industry Developments

BKW plans to take a 40% stake in a planned hydrogen-ready (H2-ready) gas-fired power plant at the Hamm site in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. ""BKW is developing the project together with the German municipal utility cooperation Trianel,"" said the German company. ""The location offers ideal conditions: sufficient space, existing grid and gas connections, and a well-developed infrastructure.""

French company Lhyfe said it expects to increase by 70% its installed renewable hydrogen production capacity in 2026. The company currently has four renewable hydrogen production sites installed in France and Germany with a total of 21 MW. ""Lhyfe has been supplying France's first motorway hydrogen station accessible to heavy goods vehicles, operated by TEAL Mobility, since November 2025"", said the company, underlining that the four sites received RFNBO certifications in May and September 2025.

Honda Motor said it has decided to discontinue production, before the end of 2026, of the current model of fuel cell system now produced at Fuel Cell System Manufacturing, a joint venture between Honda and General Motors (GM). ""After the discontinuation, Honda will utilize the next-generation fuel-cell system being developed independently by Honda"", said the Japanese company, referring to the joint venture established in January 2017 in Brownstown, Michigan.

The pivot is a direct response to signals that the European Union may water down its ReFuelEU Aviation mandates—the very regulations designed to create a market for high-cost green fuels.

Responding to regulatory uncertainty:

Pouyanné’s decision to bet against these targets stems from the EU’s recent softening of the 2035 combustion-engine car ban. He argues that because SAF currently costs three to four times more than fossil kerosene, airlines will successfully lobby to lower the 6% mandate to avoid massive ticket price hikes.

“I will make a bet today. What happened to the car regulation will happen to the SAF regulation in Europe,” said Patrick Pouyanné, CEO, TotalEnergies. “Without regulation, there is no market. I will invest less in this because I’m afraid that if they move the targets, I will have invested in biorefineries for nothing.”

The abatement shift: renewables vs. biofuels

TotalEnergies is not exiting the transition but is shifting its capital to where it sees better value. Pouyanné noted that the cost of carbon abatement (the price paid to avoid one ton of CO₂ for solar and wind power) is approximately $200/t, whereas for SAF, it can reach $400/t.

Energy Segment Cost of Carbon Abatement Investment Outlook Integrated Power (Solar/Wind) ~$200 per ton of $CO_2$ Growing: Primary focus for low-carbon Capex. Sustainable Aviation Fuel ~$350 – $400 per ton of $CO_2$ Reduced: Pausing expansion beyond immediate mandates.

Impact on net-zero ambitions:

This pivot creates a potential supply-demand trap. While TotalEnergies has already secured long-term offtake deals with Air France-KLM and Airbus, the wider industry depends on these energy majors to build the infrastructure today for the fuels of tomorrow. By stalling investment in additional capacity, the company warns that the EU may face a green fuel shortage by 2030 if the mandates are eventually enforced but the production facilities aren’t built in time.

The backdrop:

Until now, TotalEnergies has been one of Europe’s most ambitious SAF proponents. To meet its goal of producing 1.5 million tons of SAF annually by 2030, the company has committed billions to industrial transformations:

Grandpuits (France): A €500 million conversion of a former oil refinery into a zero-crude biorefinery, aiming for 285,000 tons of SAF by 2027.

La Mède (France): A €340 million investment to produce SAF and renewable diesel from waste oils and animal fats.

Global Footprint: Strategic co-processing at traditional refineries in Normandy, Antwerp, and Leuna to maximize early-stage blending.

These investments were predicated on a regulatory staircase that mandates SAF usage jump from 2% in 2025 to 6% in 2030, eventually hitting 70% by 2050.",https://www.esgnews.earth/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Patrick-Pouyanne-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 14:56:54.360998

KLM and its regional subsidiary, KLM CityHopper, have garnered several prestigious awards at the annual Aviation Challenge Awards held in Copenhagen, an event dedicated to recognizing airlines that advance environmental sustainability. These accolades arrive at a critical juncture for the aviation industry, as carriers worldwide intensify efforts to reduce carbon emissions and innovate toward a greener future.

Between September 26 and October 26, 2025, more than 22 airlines participated in the Aviation Challenge, implementing operational adjustments and environmental improvements aimed at promoting sustainable aviation. KLM distinguished itself with a landmark flight to Nairobi, achieving the lowest carbon emissions ever recorded for the route—just 35 grams of CO₂ per Revenue Ton Kilometer (RTK). This was accomplished by operating entirely on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and optimizing flight operations, earning the airline the Special Recognition Award.

In addition to this achievement, KLM received a second Special Recognition Award for its collaborative efforts in sharing expertise with Kenya Airways. The airline also secured the Best Showcase Flight award for its inspirational video, ""Intern On a Mission,"" which highlighted its commitment to sustainability and innovation.

KLM CityHopper’s Pioneering Initiatives

KLM CityHopper further contributed to the airline’s success by winning the Pioneer of the Year award. This honor recognized the subsidiary’s bold strategy to temporarily operate flights between Amsterdam and both London City and Hamburg using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel. As part of this initiative, KLM conducted a customer survey to assess willingness to pay ticket prices reflecting the higher cost of SAF, a move praised for its innovation and effectiveness.

The Aviation Challenge itself underscored the industry’s progress, with participating airlines achieving carbon emissions reductions of 13.5% compared to standard operations and 12% below the sector average. Airlines employed a variety of solutions, including route optimization, innovative maintenance practices, increased SAF usage, and weight reduction measures, all contributing to a more environmentally conscious sector.

Industry Outlook and Competitive Dynamics

KLM’s achievements come amid a rapidly evolving competitive landscape. Rival airlines are expected to respond with their own sustainability initiatives and accolades, intensifying competition as the industry anticipates significant changes in 2026. The coming year is projected to see a surge in premium service offerings and airport enhancements, as carriers compete for lucrative business and premium leisure travelers. This shift is likely to heighten competition for market share and profitability, particularly among lower-cost carriers that remain sensitive to economic fluctuations.

As the aviation sector moves toward a more sustainable and competitive future, KLM’s recent honors underscore its commitment to environmental leadership. Maintaining this advantage will be essential as the airline navigates industry changes and strives to meet both sustainability goals and evolving customer expectations.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/b406a69325c048b3907c5997d0984258.avif,N,,2026-01-24 09:56:52.534511

2026 is set to be a consequential year for aviation law and regulation, with significant developments expected across consumer rights, sustainability, airspace modernisation and emerging technologies.

From a UK perspective, the year ahead will be shaped by regulatory reform, heightened enforcement and the continued challenge of aligning policy ambition with operational and technological reality.

Consumer protection and passenger rights in aviation

EU261

Reform of EU261 remains a priority, though progress has been slow and politically contentious.

In October 2025, the European Parliament’s Transport Committee adopted negotiating guidelines that would retain compensation rights after three-hour delays, guarantee free cabin baggage, ban a range of ancillary fees and introduce tighter obligations on airlines to inform passengers of their rights.

The guidelines also propose a codified list of “extraordinary circumstances”, largely reflecting existing case law.

These positions remain in tension with the European Council’s June 2025 agreement, which would raise compensation thresholds to four or six hours and take a more permissive approach to airline obligations. Despite intensive trilogue negotiations, no agreement was reached by the end of the Danish Presidency, with the file rolling into Cyprus’s Presidency in January 2026.

Further talks are scheduled, but prospects for compromise remain uncertain, particularly after the Transport Committee reaffirmed its stance in a January vote. Airlines operating into the EU should monitor developments closely.

UK261

While the UK regime remains unchanged for now, EU261 reform may influence the future direction of UK261. In October 2025, the UK Civil Aviation Authority launched an 18-month compliance programme to assess how airlines are meeting their passenger protection obligations.

Progress updates are expected during 2026, potentially signalling a more interventionist enforcement posture.

Green claims and consumer law

The implementation of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act will sharpen scrutiny of environmental claims in aviation marketing.

The Competition and Markets Authority and the Advertising Standards Authority are expected to focus closely on emissions claims, sustainability pledges and pricing transparency, particularly as new subscription-related rules come into force in Autumn 2026.

Accessibility and inclusion

Accessibility remains a growing regulatory priority. Updates in 2026 are likely to be informed by the Aviation Accessibility Task and Finish Group’s 2025 report, alongside forthcoming decisions on the publication of mishandled mobility-aid data.

The Aviation (Accessibility) Bill is also scheduled for further parliamentary scrutiny early in the year.

Sustainability regulation and aviation decarbonisation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill is progressing through Parliament and is expected to receive Royal Assent in 2026. Alongside this, the Government is expected to respond to consultations on the levy that will fund the SAF revenue certainty mechanism, with further consultations likely as the scheme’s design is refined.

Airspace modernisation and airport infrastructure reform

Airspace modernisation

Following the CAA’s revised Airspace Modernisation Strategy deployment plan in August 2025, 2026 should see tangible progress.

This includes guidance and implementation measures arising from consultations on the UK Airspace Design Service, the UK Airspace Coordination Service and updates to air navigation policy, including clearer priorities on noise and carbon.

Further steps towards integrating drones and eVTOLs into controlled airspace are also expected.

Airport rules and development

At EU level, consultations on airport slot allocation, groundhandling and airport charges may pave the way for reform. The UK will be watching closely, having made only limited changes to its own slot regime despite earlier consultations.

More broadly, 2026 is likely to be pivotal for airport development policy, with Heathrow expansion back under review, Gatwick moving towards delivery of its Northern Runway project, and early works beginning on Luton’s approved expansion.

Aviation technology, autonomy and drone regulation

Legal and regulatory frameworks for autonomous and highly automated aviation systems will continue to develop. A final report on liability models for drones, VTOL aircraft and uncrewed traffic management is expected in early 2026, alongside further work on eVTOL regulatory delivery models.

New UK drone rules came into force on 1 January 2026, introducing revised ID requirements, drone classification standards, mandatory Remote ID for certain classes and tighter operational and insurance obligations. These changes are intended to support the safe integration of drones into shared airspace and lay the foundations for future urban air mobility.

Taken together, these developments point to a year of meaningful regulatory evolution for aviation in the UK and beyond. While progress will be uneven across different policy areas, 2026 is likely to bring greater regulatory clarity, tougher enforcement and continued pressure on the sector to reconcile innovation with public trust and legal accountability.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chloe-Challinor-aviation-lawyer-headshot.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 06:56:46.157449

Redrawing the cargo map Network design has moved to the centre of strategic decision-making for African air cargo operators.
According to IATA’s regional air cargo data, carriers from Africa accounted for roughly 2% of global cargo tonne-kilometres (CTKs) in 2024, highlighting the region’s small share of world air cargo capacity despite its population size and growing healthcare logistics needs.
Data from Xeneta indicates that global air cargo demand remained resilient through 2025, growing by around 4 per cent despite weaker signals from some cross-border e-commerce segments.
A sector at a crossroads Africa’s air cargo sector is no longer defined solely by its constraints.","Africa’s air cargo market is now balancing high-value, time-critical pharmaceutical shipments with large-scale perishables trade that depends on speed and cost discipline. This convergence is forcing a rethink of how cargo is routed, handled and scaled, as African gateways adapt to function not only as export points but as integral links in international supply chains.

“Africa’s air cargo sector is at a turning point. Pharmaceutical volumes are surging, driven by healthcare investment and vaccine distribution, while perishable flowers, fresh produce and seafood remain vital export pillars. Airlines, ground handlers and logistics providers are recalibrating strategies to manage these flows, focusing on network design, capacity planning and operational execution at key gateways,” says Fitsum Abadi Gebrehawaria, Managing Director of Cargo at Kenya Airways.

That recalibration is visible across Africa’s main cargo gateways. Airports such as Nairobi, Addis Ababa, Johannesburg and Lagos are no longer viewed simply as export points but as nodes within increasingly complex supply chains linking Africa with Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

Cargo growth data reflects this shift. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), African carriers delivered some of the strongest air cargo demand growth among global regions in 2025. In November 2025, Africa’s air cargo demand surged 15.6 % year-on-year, while available cargo capacity for African airlines expanded 18.1 % over the same period, the fastest regional rise reported by IATA.

Redrawing the cargo map

Network design has moved to the centre of strategic decision-making for African air cargo operators. For years, cargo networks were shaped largely by passenger schedules and a heavy reliance on Europe-bound perishables. That model is now being redrawn as cargo flows diversify by destination and value.

Africa–Asia trade lanes have emerged as a key growth driver. IATA data shows that air freight volumes on the Africa–Asia corridor grew by about 9.5 per cent year-on-year in November 2025, continuing several months of expansion and outpacing several traditional long-haul markets..

The faster expansion of Africa–Asia flows is reinforcing the case for new routings, frequency adjustments and greater reliance on hubs capable of supporting multidirectional cargo movements, particularly for pharmaceuticals and high-value imports into Africa.

Fresh produce remains the dominant outbound cargo from East Africa, especially flowers, fruits and vegetables. Yet the economics of perishables remain unforgiving. Margins are thin, seasonality is pronounced and reliability is critical. “Fresh produce requires seamless cold chain solutions, but thin margins make freighter operations challenging,” Gebrehawaria says. “Partnership is not a choice; it is a necessity for African airlines.”

As a result, collaboration has become central to network resilience. Interline agreements, block space partnerships and shared freighter capacity are increasingly used to stabilise lift during peak export seasons. The recovery of passenger widebody fleets through 2024 and 2025 has also restored belly capacity on long-haul routes, easing pressure on exporters that had relied heavily on charters during the pandemic years.

Even so, structural imbalances persist. According to IATA’s regional air cargo data, carriers from Africa accounted for roughly 2% of global cargo tonne-kilometres (CTKs) in 2024, highlighting the region’s small share of world air cargo capacity despite its population size and growing healthcare logistics needs. Routes capable of accommodating both high-value pharmaceutical shipments and time-sensitive perishables, including avocados and cut flowers, are prioritised, while thinner markets are consolidated through hub operations.

When operations define competitiveness

As networks expand, the focus is shifting from simply adding capacity to ensuring operational reliability. For pharmaceuticals and perishables alike, integrity is non-negotiable. A delay on the ground or a temperature deviation can erase the value of an entire shipment.

“Pharmaceutical shipments demand temperature-controlled environments and predictable schedules, while perishables require speed and freshness,” Gebrehawaria says. “Yet Sub-Saharan Africa receives only a small share of global air cargo capacity, despite being home to over 1 billion people and facing high healthcare logistics needs. Industry estimates suggest that up to 90 per cent of essential pharmaceuticals arrive by air, making capacity constraints a critical issue.”

Airlines and airports are responding with targeted investments. Kenya Airways Cargo has developed a 600-square-metre dedicated pharmaceutical handling facility at Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, designed to support active containers, real-time temperature monitoring and compliance with WHO and EU Good Distribution Practise standards. The facility is CEIV certified and geared towards handling vaccines, oncology drugs and biologics.

“Pharma air cargo is growing steadily across Africa as demand for medicines rises,” Gebrehawaria says. “We’re seeing strong growth in cold chain cargo, particularly in East Africa.”

Such investments are reshaping competition between African gateways. Handling capability is becoming a differentiator rather than a support function. Ground handlers are deploying advanced refrigeration systems, digital tracking tools and tighter process controls to reduce dwell times and manage exceptions.

However, reliability challenges extend beyond airport boundaries. First-mile infrastructure remains a weak link for perishables. “While JKIA has advanced facilities, first-mile cooling and rural cold storage remain underdeveloped, leading to post-harvest losses of up to 40 per cent for some products,” Gebrehawaria notes.

Inland logistics costs compound the problem. Poor road conditions, congestion and limited multimodal connectivity raise transport costs and increase spoilage risk. Regulatory processes also continue to slow cargo flows during peak periods, particularly for agricultural exports subject to phytosanitary inspections. These constraints underline the need for coordinated public-private investment in cold storage, digital customs systems and road-air connectivity.

Partnership is not a choice; it is a necessity for African airlines.

Fitsum Abadi Gebrehawaria, Kenya Airways

Trade shifts reshape demand

Beyond infrastructure and operations, broader market forces are reshaping Africa’s air cargo outlook. E-commerce growth, healthcare logistics and regional trade integration are altering demand patterns and influencing long-term capacity decisions.

Data from Xeneta indicates that global air cargo demand remained resilient through 2025, growing by around 4 per cent despite weaker signals from some cross-border e-commerce segments. While volumes linked to fast fashion and low-value consumer goods softened, demand for high-value and time-critical cargo continued to support air freight markets.

For Africa, this has translated into a more balanced cargo profile. Perishables remain central, but growth is increasingly driven by pharmaceuticals, medical devices and higher-value consumer goods. “The most influential shift has been the rise of e-commerce and high-value pharma shipments, alongside sustained perishables demand,” Gebrehawaria says. “Africa’s e-commerce market is projected, according to industry forecasts, to grow at a CAGR of about 8.46 per cent and reach roughly 56 billion dollars by 2029, creating new demand for rapid air freight services.”

These shifts are prompting airlines to refine fleet strategies. Freighters are being deployed more selectively, belly capacity is being optimised for yield rather than volume, and hubs such as Nairobi are increasingly positioned as regional distribution centres rather than single-origin points. In parallel, the African Continental Free Trade Area is expected to stimulate intra-African trade over time, supporting shorter-haul air cargo networks and more frequent services.

Sustainability is also entering the equation. Cold chain operations are energy-intensive, and cargo customers increasingly expect transparency on emissions and compliance. Investments in newer aircraft, more efficient ground equipment and sustainable aviation fuel initiatives are beginning to influence cargo strategies, particularly in the pharmaceutical sector.

A sector at a crossroads

Africa’s air cargo sector is no longer defined solely by its constraints. Strong demand growth, expanding trade links and targeted infrastructure investment are positioning the continent as a more integral part of global air freight networks. The path forward, however, will depend on how effectively network design, operational integrity and market strategy are aligned.

As Gebrehawaria observes, “Recent demand shifts are reshaping cargo strategies across global trade lanes, positioning Africa as a critical node in international supply chains.”

The next phase will be shaped not just by tonnes moved, but by how well Africa balances pharmaceutical precision with perishable speed and how confidently it embeds itself within global air cargo flows.",https://www.logupdateafrica.com/h-upload/2026/01/23/91356-a.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 12:57:12.104333

The findings have been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for review, reports Biodiesel Magazine.

The study highlights major reductions in black carbon, a form of soot released by ships that worsens air pollution, affects human health and accelerates global warming, particularly in the Arctic. Experts involved in the CLEANSHIP project reported that ships running on biodiesel, specifically B100 FAME, recorded up to an 81 per cent drop in black carbon emissions compared with those using conventional marine fuel.

The data was collected from the Uni-Tankers vessel Falstria Swan during normal sailing operations. An advanced monitoring device, developed by Green Instruments in partnership with the Danish Technological Institute, enabled continuous and real-time tracking of emissions while the ship was in regular service.

Researchers said the results were stronger than expected, especially at lower engine power levels. They noted that biodiesel not only lowers overall carbon emissions but also sharply reduces black carbon, which plays a key role in the shipping industry’s climate impact. The new monitoring technology also provided more detailed emission data than previously possible.

Officials from Uni-Tankers said the real-world findings offer valuable insight into both soot and carbon emissions linked to biodiesel use. They added that this information will help the company meet its emission reduction goals and support broader efforts to reduce pollution across the shipping sector.

Despite the positive results, the study noted that current global biofuel production is not sufficient to meet the full energy needs of the global shipping fleet. Researchers said further analysis is ongoing to identify practical ways to reduce black carbon and other emissions from ships.

The findings have been compiled into a white paper and submitted to the IMO.

Chemical reactions can either absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic), and controlling the catalyst surface temperature allows scientists to efficiently coordinate multiple reactions.
Effectively pairing these reactions can minimize waste heat and lead to more efficient chemical engineering processes.","Important everyday products—from plastics to detergents—are made through chemical reactions that mostly use precious metals such as platinum as catalysts. Scientists have been searching for more sustainable, low-cost substitutes for years, and tungsten carbide—an Earth-abundant metal used commonly for industrial machinery, cutting tools, and chisels—is a promising candidate.

But tungsten carbide has properties that have limited its applications. Marc Porosoff, an associate professor in the University of Rochester's Department of Chemical and Sustainability Engineering, and his collaborators recently achieved several key advancements to make tungsten carbide a more viable alternative to platinum in chemical reactions.

The best turn of phase. Sinhara Perera, a chemical engineering PhD student in Porosoff’s lab, says that part of what makes tungsten carbide a difficult catalyst for producing valuable products is that its atoms can be arranged in many different configurations—known as phases.

“There’s been no clear understanding of the surface structure of tungsten carbide because it’s really difficult to measure the catalytic surface inside the chambers where these chemical reactions take place,” says Perera.

In a study published in ACS Catalysis , Porosoff, Perera and chemical engineering undergraduate student Eva Ciuffetelli overcame this problem by very carefully manipulating tungsten carbide particles at the nanoscale level within the chemical reactor—a vessel where temperatures can reach above 700 degrees Celsius. Using a process called temperature-programmed carburization, they created tungsten carbide catalysts in their desired phase inside the reactor, ran the reaction, and then studied which versions performed the best.

“Some of the phases are more thermodynamically stable, so that’s where the catalyst inherently wants to end up,” says Porosoff. “But other phases that are less thermodynamically stable are more effective as catalysts.”

The researchers identified one particular phase—β-W₂C—that works especially well for a reaction that turns carbon dioxide into important precursors for making useful chemicals and fuels. With further fine-tuning by industry, Porosoff and his team think this phase of tungsten carbide could be as effective as platinum without the drawbacks of high cost and limited supply.

Plastic upcycling. Porosoff and his colleagues have also explored tungsten carbide as a catalyst for upcycling plastic waste and converting old plastics into high-quality new products. A study in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, led by Linxao Chen from the University of North Texas, and supported by Porosoff and University of Rochester Assistant Professor Siddharth Deshpande, showed how tungsten carbide can be used for hydrocracking.

Hydrocracking involves taking big molecules such as polypropylene—the basis of water bottles and many other forms of plastic—and chemically breaking them down into smaller molecules that can be used for new products. While hydrocracking has been used in oil and gas refining, applying it to process plastic waste has been a problem because of the high stability of polymer chains that make up most single-use plastics, and presence of contaminants that deactivate the catalysts. The precious metals, such as platinum, that are currently used as catalysts deactivate rapidly and are supported within microporous surfaces that do not have room for the long polymer chains in single-use plastics.

“Tungsten carbide, when made with the correct phase, has metallic and acidic properties that are good for breaking down the carbon chains in these polymers,” says Porosoff. “These big bulky polymer chains can interact with the tungsten carbide much easier because they don’t have micropores that cause limitations with typical platinum-based catalysts.”

The study showed that not only was tungsten carbide less costly than platinum catalysts for hydrocracking, it was more than 10 times as efficient. The researchers say this opens exciting new avenues for improving catalysts and turning plastic waste into new materials, supporting a circular economy.

Taking the temperature

Underpinning these advancements in creating more efficient catalysts is the ability to accurately measure temperatures on the catalyst surfaces. Chemical reactions can either absorb heat (endothermic) or release heat (exothermic), and controlling the catalyst surface temperature allows scientists to efficiently coordinate multiple reactions. But the measurements currently used to take the temperature of catalysts provide rough averages that do not give enough nuance to accurately measure the precise conditions needed to effectively study chemical reactions.

Using optical measurement techniques developed in the lab of Andrea Pickel, a visiting professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the researchers devised a new way to measure temperature within chemical reactors. They described the new technique in a study published in EES Catalysis.

“We learned from this study that depending on the type of chemistry, the temperature measured with these bulk readings can be off by 10 to 100 degrees Celsius,” says Porosoff. “That’s a really significant difference in catalytic studies where you’re trying to ensure that measurements are reproducible and that multiple reactions can be coupled.”

The team applied their new technique to study tandem catalysts, where an exothermic reaction provides enough heat to trigger an endothermic one. Effectively pairing these reactions can minimize waste heat and lead to more efficient chemical engineering processes.

Porosoff says the technique could also help change the way researchers conduct catalysis studies, leading to more careful measurements, reproducible work, and more robust findings across the field.

The ACS Catalysis study was funded with support from the Sloan Foundation and the Department of Energy; the Journal of the American Chemical Society study was funded with support from the National Science Foundation; the EES Catalysis study was funded with support from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority via the Carbontech Development Initiative.

The aviation sector, a significant component of the nation’s economy, faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint.

Given the dire need for cleaner alternatives, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) emerges as a pivotal solution, promising to reshape not only the aviation industry but also Nigeria’s overall energy landscape. However, the transition to this renewable fuel presents both opportunities and challenges.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), aviation accounts for about 2-3% of global human-induced carbon emissions, which highlights the urgent need for the industry to adopt more sustainable practices. In Nigeria, where the aviation sector has seen rapid growth, the necessity for a greener alternative becomes even more evident. The country’s reliance on traditional Jet A-1 fuel highlights the dual challenge of environmental responsibility and energy security.

Nigeria’s aviation sector currently utilises Jet A-1 fuel, a kerosene-based product primarily imported to meet domestic demand. The reliance on imports leaves the sector vulnerable to global price fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. Despite the burgeoning presence of indigenous airlines, the domestic refining capabilities remain inadequate, compelling Nigeria to import approximately 90% of its aviation fuel. Recent efforts to bolster local refining capacities, such as the Dangote Refinery, promise to partially alleviate these concerns. However, as of now, the aviation sector’s fuel supply is an ongoing challenge that directly impacts operational costs, ticket prices, and service delivery. In the first quarter of 2024, Nigeria imported about 31 billion naira worth of aviation fuel.

SAF offers a diversified approach to addressing these challenges, converting waste materials and agricultural byproducts into aviation fuel. SAF can potentially mitigate carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, according to IATA. This reduction is particularly pertinent for Nigeria’s commitment to its National Determined Contribution (NDC), which aims for a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Aligning the aviation sector with these targets is critical for achieving national and international climate objectives. Nigeria aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2060.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, SAF produces fewer harmful emissions, such as sulfur oxides and particulate matter. Improved air quality, especially in urban centers, can have significant public health benefits, reducing healthcare costs associated with air pollution-related illness. The production of SAF will stimulate economic development by creating jobs in new industries related to feedstock cultivation, fuel production, and distribution. This shift will enhance agricultural productivity and provide rural communities with sustainable income sources. Transitioning to SAF will mitigate Nigeria’s reliance on imported fossil fuels, enhancing energy security. Local resources can be harnessed to stabilize Nigeria’s fuel supply and insulate itself from the volatility of global oil prices, making the aviation sector more resilient. Nigeria possesses a wealth of potential feedstock resources for the production of SAF, including abundant biomass from agriculture and forestry, waste oils and fats and algae.

The National Determined Contribution, NDC framework outlines Nigeria’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint through various sectors, including transportation. While the aviation sector has long been a contributor to emissions, integrating SAF into the fuel mix could significantly bolster Nigeria’s chances of meeting its climate goals. The government’s Fly2Green initiative, which focuses on promoting renewable aviation fuel, underscores its commitment to a sustainable future. Moreover, the agricultural sector, producing a wealth of biomass suitable for SAF production, can play a pivotal role in this transition. Leveraging agricultural waste will create a circular economy that not only addresses environmental concerns but also promotes food security. Nigeria is also exploring the adoption of lower carbon aviation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel to partially replace Jet Kerosene.

Globally, several countries have successfully integrated SAF into their aviation sectors, serving as valuable case studies for Nigeria. The United States aims for the production of three billion gallons of SAF by 2030, positioning it as a leader in sustainable aviation. The United Kingdom has mandated that at least 10% of all aviation fuel comes from sustainable sources by 2030, showing strong government support for the transition. Beginning in 2026, Singapore will require all departing flights to utilize at least 1% SAF, setting a benchmark for other countries.

While the promising potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is evident, several challenges must be tackled to facilitate its integration into Nigeria’s aviation sector. Currently, SAF is significantly more expensive than traditional jet fuel, presenting a financial barrier that discourages airlines from transitioning. To overcome this challenge, investment in research and development (R&D) initiatives focused on affordable production methods for SAF is crucial. This could involve partnerships between government agencies, universities, and private companies to innovate cost-effective feedstock processing technologies.

Creating economies of scale is another essential step. As production volumes increase, the costs typically decline. The establishment of pilot projects or collaborations with international partners could help build a robust SAF market in Nigeria, enabling the gradual scaling of operations. Additionally, the development of necessary infrastructure, such as storage facilities and distribution networks, will be vital for supporting SAF adoption. The government could incentivize investments in such infrastructure through grants or tax breaks for companies willing to invest in SAF-related facilities.

The transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel is not merely a technological upgrade; it represents a critical shift in Nigeria’s energy strategy. Nigeria has the opportunity to enhance its energy security using sustainable aviation fuel, align with its climate commitments, stimulate economic growth and take a leading role in Africa, demonstrating the viability of renewable energy solutions, while positioning Nigeria not only as a participant in the global green economy but as a leader in sustainable energy initiatives across Africa.

Addressing global stakeholders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Naidu outlined the government’s long-term vision for India’s civil aviation sector. He said the country aims to expand its airport network to 350 airports by 2047, up from the current 164, while Indian carriers have placed orders for nearly 1,700 new aircraft, reflecting strong demand and capacity expansion.

Naidu also held separate meetings with Airbus and Boeing representatives, advocating for the establishment of aircraft component manufacturing and maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) facilities in India. He emphasized expanding helicopter services for tourism, emergency medical services, and regional connectivity.

In discusiions with key investors, the Minister underscored the role of fuel efficiency and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in reducing operational costs, which could help make air travel more affordable for the common citizen.

In addition to exporting SAF, ASEAN is predicted to become a significant market for SAF in its own right.
Satvinder Singh, Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, said the outlook confirms ASEAN’s strong supply-side advantage, particularly in sustainable bio-feedstocks, alongside rising regional and global demand for sustainable aviation fuel.
Sharmine Tan, Boeing’s regional sustainability lead for Southeast Asia, said the region’s aviation industry is expanding rapidly and will need increased supplies of sustainable aviation fuel alongside more fuel-efficient aircraft.
“The ASEAN 2050 SAF Outlook shows the region’s strong potential to increase SAF production with the right policies, partnerships, and investments,” she said.","ASEAN economies could generate up to 8.5 million barrels per day of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2050, according to the ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook report released on January 23. The report assesses regional supply chains and demand scenarios for 2030, 2040, and 2050 across Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, as well as key import markets including Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.

The report was developed by GHD Group, a global professional services company specialising in water, energy, environment, property, and transport, with financial support from Global Affairs Canada through the Canadian Trade and Investment Facility for Development, implemented by Cowater International, with Boeing as the knowledge partner and support from the ASEAN Secretariat.

SAF is a renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and is compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. ASEAN’s key SAF feedstocks include used cooking oil, rice waste, cassava waste, and forestry residues.

The countries examined within the report could potentially have capacity to position themselves as net SAF exporters. Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand have the most abundant feedstock to support SAF production, while Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, may have the most cost-efficient distribution for markets in Japan, Singapore, and South Korea.

In addition to exporting SAF, ASEAN is predicted to become a significant market for SAF in its own right. The report projects that SAF demand in ASEAN will grow sharply from 15,000 barrels per day in 2030 to over 700,000 barrels per day by 2050. The largest SAF demands are expected to come from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand, as well as other Asian economies such as Japan and South Korea.

The report also examined different ways of producing SAF. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is the most prevalent technology for producing SAF today, costing about twice as much as jet fuel, with the largest cost contributor being feedstock. Alternative methods could be between four and seven times more expensive, but this gap is expected to reduce as technologies mature and scale up.

Satvinder Singh, Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, said the outlook confirms ASEAN’s strong supply-side advantage, particularly in sustainable bio-feedstocks, alongside rising regional and global demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

“To fully capitalise on these dynamics, ASEAN member states should work together to scale up production capacity, deploy cost-effective technologies, and establish robust regional trade and market frameworks,” he said, adding that this would help position ASEAN as a competitive and reliable supplier supporting aviation decarbonisation across the Asia-Pacific.

Sharmine Tan, Boeing’s regional sustainability lead for Southeast Asia, said the region’s aviation industry is expanding rapidly and will need increased supplies of sustainable aviation fuel alongside more fuel-efficient aircraft. “The ASEAN 2050 SAF Outlook shows the region’s strong potential to increase SAF production with the right policies, partnerships, and investments,” she said.

Sachin Narang, GHD’s executive advisor for energy and infrastructure, said ASEAN’s abundance of agricultural and forestry waste could serve as low-cost feedstock for SAF, helping narrow the gap with conventional jet fuel. “Policy intervention, scaling, and innovation can further reduce costs for alternative SAF pathways over the medium to long term,” he said.

Topsoe has been selected technology provider by the Tangshan Jinlihai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Tangshan Jinlihai), a developer and provider of renewable fuels.
Topsoe will provide its Hydroflex® technology and related services for Tangshan Jinlihai industrial hub with a capacity 300,000 tons of feedstock annually.
Yassir Ghiyati, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said: “We are delighted to announce our collaboration with Tangshan Jinlihai, a partnership that reflects our shared commitment to advancing sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that SAF production will have more than doubled in 2025 compared to 2024, reaching 2.1 million tons (2.7 billion liters), or 0.7% of total global jet fuel production [2].","Topsoe has signed an agreement with Tangshan Jinlihai to deliver the technology and services that will enable production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Based in the Caofeidian Petrochemical Industry Base, it is set to break ground in second half of 2026, with start-up targeted for second half of 2028.

Topsoe has been selected technology provider by the Tangshan Jinlihai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Tangshan Jinlihai), a developer and provider of renewable fuels. Topsoe will provide its Hydroflex® technology and related services for Tangshan Jinlihai industrial hub with a capacity 300,000 tons of feedstock annually.

When the project is in full operation, Topsoe’s technology is expected to enable an annual emission avoidance of approximately 700,000 metric tons of CO2e – the equivalent of avoiding the emissions from approximately two million passengers flying from Beijing to Copenhagen[1].

Yassir Ghiyati, Chief Commercial Officer at Topsoe, said: “We are delighted to announce our collaboration with Tangshan Jinlihai, a partnership that reflects our shared commitment to advancing sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. By applying Topsoe’s proven technologies, we are enabling customers to move closer to their decarbonization goals while supporting efforts to reduce emissions across both China and Europe, making the energy transition truly global.”

Aijun Li, Chairman of Tangshan Jinlihai said: “Jinlihai and Topsoe have jointly launched the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project, marking a crucial step forward for us in the strategic layout of high-end green energy and the active practice of new quality productivity.

The project will fully leverage the geographical and industrial advantages of the Caofeidian National Petrochemical Base, using waste oil as feedstock and using Topsoe's globally leading technology to build a high-quality SAF production. This is not only a substantive measure for Jinlihai to extend its green industrial chain, but also an important action for us to respond to China’s ""dual carbon"" strategy and promote the low-carbon transformation of the aviation industry.”

The agreement addresses the growing global demand for SAF. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects that SAF production will have more than doubled in 2025 compared to 2024, reaching 2.1 million tons (2.7 billion liters), or 0.7% of total global jet fuel production [2]. To stay on track for net zero by 2050, the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Scenario suggests that over 10% of fuel consumption in aviation needs to be SAF by 2030.

The project is located in the Caofeidian Petrochemical Industry Base, Tangshan, Hebei province. With a planned investment of approximately USD 210 million, construction is expected to commence in second half of 2026, and operations due to start in second half of 2028.

This agreement builds on Topsoe’s growing SAF-presence in China and marks its sixth contract for production of SAF in the nation to date. Most recently it was announced that Topsoe will provide technology, proprietary equipment and catalysts to Zhongeng Yida New Energy Co. Ltd. in May 2025, Zhejiang Jianglan Bio-Energy Technology Co. Ltd in April 2025, Chuangui New Energy Co. in January 2025 and Guangxi Hongkun Biomass in April 2024.

Abstract

Low carbon fuel policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as the 45Z tax credit are intended to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. Cellulosic feedstocks, optimized biorefineries, and favorable farming locations can significantly reduce biofuel carbon intensity (CI). Despite advances in field-to-fuel GHG monitoring and flexibility in resource allocation within biorefineries (e.g., governing net electricity production), rigid CI accounting procedures in current policies may limit CI responsiveness across candidate sites and processing facilities. This work examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway using miscanthus and alcohol-to-jet (i) to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CIs and (ii) to explore potential CI and financial implications of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA). Results demonstrate GHG accounting using the CFR/LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors (feedstock CI, grid electricity CI) as scenario-specific LCA: most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits.
