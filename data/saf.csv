The company announced Monday that construction has started on the HVO plant in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province.
It is used in various applications, including sustainable aviation fuel, car fuel and bio-naphtha — a versatile feedstock in the chemical industry.
LG Chem plans to utilize HVO not only for biofuel production but also to expand its eco-friendly plastics business, which it sees as a core driver of future growth.
“LG Chem is transforming its business portfolio toward low-carbon models, aiming for both sustainable growth and improved profitability,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol.","LG Chem has begun construction on Korea’s first hydrotreated vegetable oil production facility, furthering the company’s strategy to bring the supply of eco-friendly raw materials in-house amid rising global demand for sustainable alternatives.

The company announced Monday that construction has started on the HVO plant in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province. Once completed in 2027, the facility is expected to produce 300,000 tons of HVO annually.

HVO, sometimes called green diesel, is produced by using hydrogen to break down vegetable oils, particularly used cooking oil, into smaller molecules. The concept is similar to biodiesel but the different chemistry of the resulting fuel means it is more stable and performs better at low temperatures.

While HVO has around 10 percent lower energy density than petroleum diesel, its proponents claim it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 90 percent. It is used in various applications, including sustainable aviation fuel, car fuel and bio-naphtha — a versatile feedstock in the chemical industry.

LG Chem plans to utilize HVO not only for biofuel production but also to expand its eco-friendly plastics business, which it sees as a core driver of future growth. The company aims to convert bio-naphtha into high-performance plastics used in home appliances, automobiles, sporting goods and hygiene products.

“LG Chem is transforming its business portfolio toward low-carbon models, aiming for both sustainable growth and improved profitability,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol.

“We will continue to drive technological innovation and commercialization in eco-friendly fuel and bio-resources, including HVO, to strengthen our global competitiveness and respond proactively to customer demand.”

The Seosan facility is being developed through a 50:50 joint venture with Italian energy firm Eni, which currently produces 2 million tons of HVO annually at its facilities in Italy and has an extensive global supply network.

An LG Chem official said the new facility will provide the company with more affordable access to bio-based feedstocks for its chemical manufacturing operations, which until now have largely relied on imports from global suppliers.

Competition to secure sustainable raw materials is intensifying worldwide, as companies seek to meet growing customer expectations and regulatory requirements.

According to Fortune Business Insights, the global HVO market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 8.2 percent, expanding from approximately $21.36 billion in 2025 to $36.86 billion by 2032.

Hanya dengan kolaborasi menyeluruh dan dukungan regulasi yang kuat, transisi energi Indonesia dapat berjalan stabil, cepat, dan inklusif menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.","Minahasa Selatan, Sulut, ruangenergi.com-Transisi energi di Indonesia tidak bisa hanya ditopang oleh satu pilar. Jika kita ingin mencapai target emisi nol bersih (net zero emission) pada 2060, maka strategi nasional harus ditopang oleh dua kaki utama: elektrifikasi berbasis energi terbarukan dan penguatan energi alternatif non-listrik seperti bioenergi, hidrogen, amonia, hingga carbon capture.

Sejauh ini, sektor elektrifikasi melalui PLN dan proyek-proyek berbasis EBT (Energi Baru Terbarukan) memang telah berjalan cukup progresif. Program 5 GW energi hijau dari PLN tiap tahun—dengan nilai investasi mencapai 6–7 miliar dolar AS—adalah langkah besar. Namun, kaki kedua, yakni sektor bioenergi, biofuel, bioetanol, green ammonia, hingga sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), masih belum mendapatkan ruang regulasi dan dukungan yang memadai.

Padahal, sektor non-listrik ini adalah kekuatan besar Indonesia. Pertamina, misalnya, memiliki kompetensi dan infrastruktur kuat dalam ekosistem biofuel dan energi molekular lainnya. Bioetanol, biodiesel, hingga green hydrogen bukan lagi sekadar opsi, tapi merupakan fondasi percepatan transisi energi di sektor transportasi, industri, dan maritim.

Direktur Proyek dan Operasi PT Pertamina NRE, Norman Ginting, menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan strategi nasional.

“Transisi energi harus dijalankan dengan pendekatan dua kaki. Elektrifikasi memang penting, tapi pengembangan bioenergi dan teknologi molekular tak kalah krusial untuk dekarbonisasi sektor-sektor yang tidak bisa dialiri listrik langsung,” ujar Norman kepada ruangenergi.com di sela-sela kunjungan ke PLTP Lahendong , Kamis(31/07/2025), di Sulawesi Utara.

Sayangnya, proses regulasi dan perencanaan energi nasional saat ini masih cenderung berat sebelah. Banyak potensi bioenergi belum tergarap secara optimal. Negara-negara produsen minyak seperti Brasil dan Arab Saudi bahkan telah bergerak lebih cepat melalui penguatan bioekonomi dan pengembangan SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Dua Lokomotif, Satu Tujuan

Norman bercerita, transisi energi tidak akan stabil jika hanya ditarik oleh satu lokomotif. PLN dan Pertamina harus menjadi dua mesin penggerak utama. Keduanya mewakili dua sisi strategi besar: elektrifikasi dan dekarbonisasi molekular. Pemerintah perlu menjamin bahwa kolaborasi antara keduanya berlangsung harmonis dan berimbang.

Namun dua kaki ini saja tidak cukup. Diperlukan peran aktif dari sektor swasta sebagai inovator, akselerator, sekaligus penyandang modal. Sayangnya, belum ada ekosistem kolaboratif yang benar-benar inklusif. Sektor swasta masih minim keterlibatannya dalam desain besar transisi energi nasional.

Regulasi Harus Dipercepat

Salah satu kunci utama adalah percepatan regulasi. Menurut Norman, dukungan terhadap bioenergi, green fuel, dan teknologi non-listrik seperti carbon capture dan green ammonia harus dituangkan ke dalam kebijakan yang jelas, insentif yang menarik, serta roadmap yang terukur dan realistis.

Regulasi yang kuat juga akan menjadi sinyal positif bagi para investor. Tanpa kepastian hukum dan kebijakan, baik investor lokal maupun global akan ragu untuk masuk. Transisi energi tidak boleh menjadi domain eksklusif BUMN saja—ini adalah proyek nasional yang harus melibatkan semua pihak.

Kesimpulan: Transisi Energi Butuh Akselerator, Kolaborator, dan Keseimbangan

Indonesia tidak bisa bertumpu pada satu kaki saja. Transisi energi akan goyah jika hanya berfokus pada elektrifikasi, tanpa memperkuat pilar bioenergi dan inovasi molekular lainnya. PLN dan Pertamina harus bergerak bersama sebagai dua lokomotif utama. Pemerintah harus menjadi akselerator, fasilitator, dan penyambung antar pelaku.

Dan yang paling penting: swasta harus dilibatkan secara penuh. Hanya dengan kolaborasi menyeluruh dan dukungan regulasi yang kuat, transisi energi Indonesia dapat berjalan stabil, cepat, dan inklusif menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.",https://www.ruangenergi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/norman1.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 02:56:54.899321

Long-Term Potential: A Structural Shift in Aviation Investors must consider structural shifts in the industry.","The recent 180% surge in Thai Airways International's (THAI) share price following its trading resumption on August 4, 2025, is not merely a short-term rally but a reflection of a meticulously executed corporate transformation. This resurgence, however, must be contextualized within the broader dynamics of a post-pandemic aviation sector that is navigating both headwinds and tailwinds. For investors, the question is whether THAI's revival is a fleeting rebound or a durable repositioning for long-term growth.

Catalysts for the Surge: Restructuring, Resilience, and Reimagining

Thai Airways' journey from insolvency to recovery is a case study in strategic restructuring. By 2020, the airline had accumulated over 400 billion baht in debt, forcing it into bankruptcy protection. Yet, through a combination of debt-to-equity conversion, cost-cutting, and operational streamlining, THAI reduced its liabilities to 95 billion baht by Q1 2025. Shareholders' equity turned positive at 55 billion baht, and the company now holds 125 billion baht in cash—a stark contrast to its near-delisting status in 2021. The Central Bankruptcy Court's June 2025 termination of its rehabilitation plan marked the culmination of this effort, restoring investor confidence and triggering the stock's meteoric rise.

Analysts from Tisco and Yuanta Securities have underscored THAI's improved balance sheet and aggressive growth plans. With a 26.5% EBIT margin in Q1 2025—the highest among Asia-Pacific full-service carriers—and a projected EBITDA CAGR of 8.6% through 2027, the airline's financial health is no longer a liability but an asset. Strategic partnerships, including a Joint Business Agreement with Turkish Airlines and collaborations with Airports of Thailand (AOT), further strengthen its regional and global connectivity.

The Aviation Sector's Post-Pandemic Renaissance

The broader aviation industry is experiencing a nuanced recovery. Global passenger demand has not only rebounded to pre-pandemic levels but has surpassed them, with IATA forecasting 5.2 billion travelers in 2025—a 6.7% increase over 2024. This growth is fueled by pent-up demand, falling airfares (down 44% in real terms since 2014), and a shift toward leisure travel. However, airlines face challenges: fuel remains a 26.4% cost burden in 2025, and regulatory pressures, such as CORSIA compliance and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates, add complexity.

THAI's position in this landscape is unique. Unlike budget carriers, which operate on razor-thin margins, THAI's focus on full-service operations allows it to leverage premium revenue streams while maintaining cost discipline. Its fleet modernization—45 Boeing 787s and 32 Airbus A321neos—enhances fuel efficiency and passenger experience, aligning with trends toward sustainability and comfort. Moreover, its 22% market share at Suvarnabhumi Airport positions it as a critical player in Thailand's ambition to become a regional aviation hub.

Long-Term Potential: A Structural Shift in Aviation

Investors must consider structural shifts in the industry. Airline profitability is increasingly tied to digital transformation and AI-driven revenue management. THAI's digital initiatives—enhanced booking platforms, “Cash + Miles” loyalty programs, and SCB credit card partnerships—position it to capture a larger share of the digital-first traveler market. Additionally, its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2065 and partnerships with PTT Global Chemical to integrate SAF align with global ESG trends, which are becoming non-negotiable for long-term capital.

The airline's expansion plans are equally compelling. By 2033, THAI aims to double its fleet from 78 to 150 aircraft, supported by strategic acquisitions and leases. This growth is not speculative: it is underpinned by a 12.3% year-on-year revenue increase in Q1 2025 and a 3%–13% revenue growth projection for 2025–2027. The airline's ability to balance capacity with demand—raising ASK by 21.1% in Q1 2025 while maintaining an 83.4% load factor—demonstrates operational agility.

Risks and Realities

No investment is without risk. Fuel prices, though currently favorable, remain volatile, and a spike could erode margins. Regulatory compliance costs, particularly for CORSIA and SAF, could also strain profitability. Additionally, the competitive landscape is intensifying, with low-cost carriers and regional players vying for market share. However, THAI's debt reduction, liquidity, and strategic partnerships mitigate these risks. The airline's debt-to-equity ratio of 4.37—a sharp decline from 20.66 in 2020—provides a buffer against external shocks.

Investment Thesis

For investors with a long-term horizon, THAI presents a compelling opportunity. The airline's financial restructuring has created a resilient foundation, while its strategic bets on fleet modernization, digital innovation, and sustainability align with global trends. Analysts' consensus target price of 10.40–10.70 baht suggests a 10–15% upside from current levels, but the broader recovery of the aviation sector could unlock even greater value.

However, patience is key. The stock's volatility reflects both optimism and uncertainty. Investors should monitor THAI's ability to execute its expansion plans, maintain cost discipline, and navigate regulatory challenges. Those who can stomach short-term fluctuations may find themselves positioned for a substantial payoff as the airline reclaims its role as a leader in the Asia-Pacific aviation ecosystem.

In a world where industries are being reshaped by technology, sustainability, and shifting consumer behavior, Thai Airways' revival is more than a story of survival—it is a blueprint for reinvention. For investors, the question is not whether the airline will recover, but how much further it can go.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-04 02:56:59.329102

In an era of shifting geopolitical alliances and rising multipolarity, Indonesia’s formal entry into BRICS in January 2025 marks more than just a diplomatic milestone. It signals a new strategic direction for Southeast Asia’s largest economy, particularly in its approach to global norms, alternative development finance, and sectoral cooperation, including civil aviation. After being officially declared a full member in January 2025, Indonesia was immediately accepted as the 10th member of BRICS. BRICS originally consisted of five countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — but has since expanded to include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, and Indonesia. This expanded group now represents over 45% of the world’s population and a significant share of global GDP. For Indonesia, its participation opens doors to enhanced economic, technological, and diplomatic networks that go beyond the traditional Western-led institutional framework.

Aviation Diplomacy in the BRICS Context

Aviation has long symbolized and facilitated sovereignty, mobility, and integration. For Indonesia — a vast archipelagic nation with over 17,000 islands — aviation is not a luxury but a lifeline. However, the sector faces persistent challenges: uneven infrastructure, reliance on foreign technology, skill gaps, and vulnerability to external economic shocks. By joining BRICS, Indonesia gains an alternative platform for forming partnerships and technical cooperation in aviation. This includes potential collaborations in areas such as air traffic management, satellite-based navigation systems, airport development, safety oversight, and personnel training. Indonesia’s diplomacy within BRICS can now focus on advocating for more inclusive global aviation governance — particularly within the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), where BRICS countries are increasingly coordinating their positions. With India and China already active in ICAO’s Council and technical panels, Indonesia could now join this emerging bloc to balance the influence of traditional powers.

Technology Transfer and Diversified Aviation Supply Chains

One of the key benefits of increased BRICS involvement is the potential for technology transfer and diversification of the supply chain. Indonesia currently imports much of its aviation technology — from radar systems to ground-based navigational aids — from Europe and the United States. While these systems are technically advanced, they come with restrictions: complex procurement standards, intellectual property limitations, and vendor lock-in, which can limit Indonesia’s independence. Through BRICS, Indonesia can access collaborative R&D programs with countries like China, India, and Russia, which are actively developing satellite navigation systems (e.g., Beidou, GAGAN, GLONASS), indigenous aircraft manufacturing initiatives, and airport infrastructure technologies suited to emerging markets. These countries are also more open to co-production, local assembly, and licensing agreements. Indonesia’s aerospace industry — led by PT Dirgantara Indonesia — can benefit from exposure to different design approaches and compatible standards. Such cooperation could lessen reliance on a few Western OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and establish a diverse supply network for both civilian and military aviation needs.

Infrastructure and Alternative Financing Opportunities

One of the persistent bottlenecks in Indonesia’s aviation sector has been infrastructure development, especially in remote and underdeveloped regions known as the 3T (Terdepan, Terpencil, dan Tertinggal).

Traditional financing routes — dominated by Bretton Woods institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank — often impose strict conditionalities related to governance, environmental impact, and fiscal prudence. While these safeguards are important, they can delay or disqualify projects that fail to meet rigid procedural benchmarks.

In contrast, BRICS’ New Development Bank (NDB) provides a more flexible financing mechanism. Although still maintaining safeguards, the NDB emphasizes local ownership, quicker disbursement timelines, and more adaptable terms of credit. This could be a game-changer for Indonesia’s efforts to fund regional airports, satellite-based air navigation systems, weather radar, and search and rescue (SAR) operations.

Moreover, access to NDB financing could allow Indonesia to pilot next-generation air mobility programs, including seaplane bases, unmanned aircraft corridors, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) infrastructure — all within frameworks better suited to national development priorities.

Civil-Military Integration and Airspace Sovereignty

Another strategic dimension is the management of Indonesian airspace and Flight Information Regions (FIRs). Indonesia has long aspired to regain full control over several FIRs currently delegated to neighbouring states. Yet progress has been gradual, constrained by technical readiness, diplomatic complexity, and military-civil coordination challenges.

BRICS participation offers new avenues to learn from countries that have achieved FIR sovereignty under contested circumstances, such as India and China. Additionally, joint exercises, simulation training, and technology-sharing initiatives could support Indonesia’s push for integrated air surveillance and radar fusion systems, critical for both safety and national security.

Beyond FIRs, the issue of cybersecurity and data sovereignty in aviation is increasingly important. Partnering with BRICS countries could help Indonesia secure its aviation databases, aircraft tracking infrastructure, and communications networks from foreign interception or unilateral dependencies.

Challenges: Geopolitics, Standards, and Perception

Despite its many potential benefits, Indonesia’s BRICS participation is not without challenges, particularly in the aviation sector.

First, geopolitical alignments within BRICS can complicate consensus-building. For instance, the interests of Russia and China may not always align with those of Brazil, India, or South Africa, let alone Indonesia. In aviation diplomacy, where regulatory alignment is key, diverging priorities could slow progress on standard-setting and interoperability.

Second, while BRICS promotes alternative standards, the global aviation system remains anchored in frameworks defined by ICAO, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and other legacy institutions. Integrating BRICS-based practices into this system requires careful navigation to avoid misalignment or duplication.

Third, there is the challenge of international perception. Indonesia must reassure its traditional aviation partners, including the US, EU, and Japan, that BRICS participation complements rather than contradicts existing commitments. Diplomatically, Indonesia must uphold its “independent and active” foreign policy while navigating the optics of deeper ties with Russia or China, especially amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.

Recommendations: Strategic Steps Forward

To maximize the aviation-related gains from BRICS membership, Indonesia should consider the following steps:

Establish a BRICS Aviation Cooperation Desk within the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coordinate sectoral initiatives and track joint programs.

Leverage NDB for pilot projects, especially in outer island airports, disaster response aviation systems, and satellite navigation services.

Forge technical partnerships with Indian and Chinese air navigation service providers to accelerate domestic capacity-building in air traffic control and aeronautical data services.

Promote joint ventures involving PT Dirgantara Indonesia and BRICS aerospace firms for component manufacturing and aircraft retrofitting.

Develop a long-term aviation diplomacy roadmap that aligns BRICS priorities with Indonesia’s ICAO and ASEAN obligations.

Maintain transparency and multilateral balance to prevent over-dependence on any one bloc or funding source.

Champion inclusive aviation governance, using BRICS as a platform to advocate for fairer global rules on carbon markets, passenger rights, and safety oversight.

A Broader Strategic Vision

Indonesia’s entry into BRICS is a reminder that global governance is evolving. For too long, the developing world’s aviation needs have been addressed through a top-down model dominated by the Global North. With BRICS, Indonesia can help rewrite this narrative — not through confrontation, but through constructive collaboration.

In a world where connectivity is currency, aviation becomes both a tool of influence and an index of inclusion. Indonesia must now rise to the challenge of transforming this new diplomatic opportunity into tangible progress for its skies and its citizens.",https://geotimes.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/geotimes-Indonesias-BRICS-Shift-Opens-New-Runways-for-Global-Air-Cooperation.png,N,,2025-08-04 02:57:34.127918

Melalui program Perhutanan Sosial Sri Wana Lestari, PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Aviation Fuel Terminal (AFT) Ngurah Rai menghadirkan pendekatan berbasis komunitas untuk menjaga kelestarian hutan sekaligus mendorong ekonomi masyarakat.

Program ini bukan sekadar tentang bagaimana menanam pohon tetapi dibaliknya ada filosofi lokal Tri Hita Karana, yang mencerminkan harmoni antara manusia, Tuhan, dan alam. Dengan melibatkan Kelompok Tani Hutan (KTH) Banu Giri Lestari, BUMDes Abdi Rahayu dan Poktan Taman Lestari, program Sri Wana Lestari menjadi contoh nyata bagaimana pelestarian lingkungan bisa berjalan beriringan dengan pemberdayaan masyarakat.

Salah satu sosok di balik program adalah Ketua KTH Banu Giri Lestari I Gede Sugiantara. Ia mengungkapkan bahwa program ini telah menekan angka kemiskinan di desa hingga 9,3% serta meningkatkan rata-rata penghasilan anggota KTH menjadi Rp2,2 juta per bulan.

“Semua kegiatan dikelola berbasis konservasi, dengan pendekatan agroforestry dan perlindungan sumber mata air untuk keberlanjutan jangka panjang,” ujar Sugiantara.

Sejak digulirkan, sebanyak 7.896 pohon produktif telah ditanam. Kawasan hutan seluas 76,25 hektar dikelola secara lestari oleh 58 orang anggota KTH. Masyarakat tak hanya menjaga hutan, tapi juga membangun sumber ekonomi baru dengan budidaya madu klanceng, pengembangan produk kakao, hingga wisata edukatif Green Clift yang menyuguhkan keindahan lanskap hutan.

“Tujuan kami bukan hanya merawat hutan tapi menjadikannya sumber kehidupan, kami ingin masyarakat bisa hidup layak tanpa harus merusak alam. Terbukti saat ini, kelompok tani berhasil menjalin sinergi antara konservasi, ekonomi dan nilai-nilai budaya yang luhur. Hal ini dibuktikan dengan munculnya sumber air deras yang disuling dan jual sebagai Air Minum Dalam Kemasan (AMDK) Amara, yang dalam 1 tahun dapat memproduksi sekitar 6.166 galon,” lanjut Sugiantara.

In the international sense, these programs are part of a larger effort to combat climate change by making aviation more sustainable. To bring the environmental impact of the aviation industry down, Thailand’s Department of Energy Business has said that it hopes to enforce global standards for SAF specifications in its home market as early as next year.

Creation of these SAF standards coincided with the global guidelines set forth by ASTM International (formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials). In adopting SAF, Thailand joins a chorus of aviation stakeholders who are under increasing pressure to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint across its supply chain. According to the Coalition for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), SAF has the potential to cut up to 80% less greenhouse gas emissions than conventionally derived jet fuel.

The Director-General of Thailand’s Department of Energy Business, Sarawut Kaewtathip said the country is strictly following ASTM D7566 standard to ensure SAF mixes with fossil jet fuel within its quality and safety standards. The standard is seen as Thailand’s first step to building a more formal SAF framework for its aviation sector – which in turn is an important element of the nation’s sustainable aviation and overall carbon emissions reduction strategy.

Expected to be finalized before 2025, the national standard is meant to take into account public hearings and consultations with industry stakeholders. In addition, the department is collaborating with several airlines to help align SAF production facilities in Thailand with international standards, and assist the country in becoming a key player in regional sustainability programs.

Global Efforts in SAF Adoption and Partnerships for Sustainable Aviation

Between January and August 2025, the world saw a significant ramp-up in regional, national and intra-industry activity aimed at driving more frequent use of SAF through the aviation value chain. Given the global goal of reducing the environmental impact of aviation, fleets can be utilized as powerful channels through which strategic initiatives and partnerships have been formed to support further SAF deployment.

And one of the most important steps forward for sustainable aviation, is joining forces with countries from around the world and global organizations and leading aviation industry partners to scale up production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. As the standard-setting body for global aviation sustainability, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is central to helping member states build SAF policies enforcement capacity. ICAO ACT-SAF program is critical for providing the necessary resources to any nation like Thailand, in order for them to craft their SAF strategies.

The Finvest Hub of ICAO also facilitated in securing funding for the establishment of SAF production facilities. This effort aims to accelerate the deployment of clean fuel infrastructure, to ensure that SAF is available to airlines globally. Turning to the global standards would mean that countries like Thailand adhere to a global goal of net-zero emissions in aviation by 2050.

The South Korean government has unveiled plans to mandate that airlines mix 1% SAF into their fuel beginning in 2027, with a gradual rise in the following years. This action is a component of South Korea’s larger plan to enhance sustainability in its aviation industry, supporting additional environmental initiatives focused on lowering carbon emissions. By mid-2025, Korean Air along with other major airlines is anticipated to initiate the use of SAF on certain international routes, representing a significant milestone in the nation’s journey towards aviation sustainability

Brazil has been acknowledged for its efforts in promoting sustainable aviation. The nation’s implementation of multicropping methods to generate feedstocks for SAF has received global recognition, particularly since these approaches are in line with worldwide sustainability objectives. This acknowledgment emphasizes Brazil’s position as a prominent model for incorporating sustainable agriculture into aviation fuel production, guaranteeing that SAF production maintains food security.

In the UAE, innovation in hydrogen-powered aviation is taking center stage. The country is investing in green hydrogen as a future fuel alternative for aviation, leveraging its abundant solar energy resources to produce hydrogen in a cost-effective manner. Although hydrogen-powered aircraft are still a distant reality, the UAE’s ongoing efforts show a clear commitment to advancing sustainable aviation solutions.

Southeast Asia, with its abundant natural resources and growing political support, is positioning itself to become a major global hub for SAF production.

Abundant Resources, Limitless Potential

Southeast Asia’s greatest strength lies in its wealth of feedstock. From rice straw, cassava pulp, and used cooking oil (UCO), to palm oil waste and municipal solid waste, the region holds vast potential to convert these materials into SAF.

According to a joint study by ASEAN, Boeing, CTIF, and GHD—funded by Global Affairs Canada—Southeast Asia could supply up to 12% of the world’s SAF needs by 2050. Countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam are even projected to become net exporters of SAF starting in 2040.

Technology for a Greener Sky

SAF production technologies are evolving rapidly. While Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) remains the dominant method, the region is increasingly shifting toward Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technologies, which are better suited to local feedstock compositions.

Infrastructure is already taking shape. Indonesia, through Pertamina, and Singapore, via Neste, have established SAF production facilities—marking the beginning of a cleaner, more sustainable energy transformation in the region.

A Unique Combination: Supply Meets Demand

Indonesia is known for its abundant feedstock, while Singapore is the region’s largest consumer of jet fuel. This combination creates a balanced production-consumption cycle—a critical foundation for building a resilient SAF ecosystem.

However, challenges remain. The use of palm oil for SAF has raised concerns about deforestation. As a result, attention is shifting toward more sustainable alternatives such as UCO and agricultural waste, which can be sourced without expanding land use.

Concrete Steps from Governments and Industry

Political commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Southeast Asia is becoming increasingly tangible. Singapore will mandate a 1% SAF blend for all departing flights starting in 2026, aiming to reach 3–5% by 2030.

Indonesia has also laid out an ambitious roadmap targeting 30% SAF by 2050. Malaysia and Thailand have developed similar plans to decarbonize their aviation sectors.

On the airline front, Singapore Airlines and Scoot aim to reach 5% SAF usage by 2030. Thai Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Cebu Pacific, and Vietnam Airlines have already completed their first flights using sustainable fuels, partnering with major players like Neste and Shell Aviation.

Beyond the Environment: Economic and Social Gains

SAF offers more than just environmental benefits. It generates employment, enhances workforce skills, and promotes the inclusion of women and marginalized communities in the clean energy supply chain.

Notably, rice straw has been identified as having the lowest carbon intensity among feedstocks, offering a promising opportunity for local farmers to participate directly in the energy transition without altering land use or causing deforestation.

The Future of SAF: Collaboration Is Key

The project “Promoting the Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels from Agricultural Waste in the ASEAN Region” marks a significant milestone. The region is now entering a critical next phase focused on strengthening regulations, building technical capacity, and mobilizing investment.

With production potential likely to exceed domestic demand, Southeast Asia is well positioned to become a key exporter of SAF to markets such as Japan and South Korea. Realizing this vision will require close collaboration among governments, private sectors, academia, and investors.",https://seasia.co/img/articles/2025/08/04/the-future-of-flight-southeast-asia-eyes-global-leadership-in-sustainable-aviation-fuel-qKlHR1jL6N.jpg?p=articles-lg,N,,2025-08-04 01:56:15.298828

The current India-US trade relationship is facing renewed strain following the United States’ imposition of a 25 per cent blanket tariff on all Indian imports, effective, August 1, 2025. This move, driven by concerns over India’s high tariffs on agricultural and dairy products, its continued engagement with Russian oil and defense markets, has disrupted the momentum of bilateral trade negotiations aimed at expanding trade to USD 500 billion by 2030. As a result, talks have stalled and key Indian export sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, auto components, and electronics face heightened vulnerability in the US market.

Amidst these tensions, India, the US, and Brazil continue to collaborate through the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), launched during India’s G20 presidency in 2023. The alliance is focused on advancing biofuel adoption, including ethanol blending, sustainable aviation fuels, and flex-fuel technologies. India’s ambitions to reach 20 per cent ethanol blending by 2025 align closely with Brazil’s mature biofuel ecosystem and the US’s technological leadership. While the tariff dispute underscores geopolitical and trade frictions, the trilateral cooperation on clean fuels remains a strategic area of convergence, offering a counterbalance to growing protectionist trends, reinforcing shared commitments to energy security and low-carbon growth.

The Global Biofuels Alliance aspires to ensure sustainable biofuel production across the Global South, but can it remain unaffected by the sudden shift in global trade dynamics?

Why biofuels?

Biofuel, as most would understand, is a fuel that is made from plant material or animal waste. On the strategic level for India, the GBA is an extension of the International Solar Alliance, where these two countries are jointly attempting to shape global energy norms from the perspective of developing countries. The initiators of the GBA see this as another strategic step in India’s international relations game plan of promoting the effort to establish energy norms globally from a developing nation’s perspective. For Brazil, it will be a chance to reassert its leadership position in the bioenergy market, more so when completing its outreach for diversification of diplomatic avenues into ties with Global South countries and beyond. It is most likely that the tango between India and Brazil plays out at many levels.

Biofuels are a critical element in the global strategy to fight climate change. They help lower GHG emissions, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, promote sustainable land use, support rural economies, and are necessary for achieving national and international climate goals, especially in hard-to-abate sectors of the economy. The India Brazil collaboration on biofuels is being intensified considering that this partnership, erstwhile on the periphery of biofuel diplomacy, is currently placed at the heart of larger geopolitical shift concerning energy security and climate protection, where a meeting of urban and rural people takes place. This changing focus has put biofuels at the centre of an energy renaissance in the rural world. The people in this narrative are doing a tango and getting down to brass tacks in biosphere unison.

Ethanol, a biofuel primarily derived from sugarcane, is Brazil’s remedy when its hydroelectric plants are under duress, and it is becoming the world’s largest large-scale sugarcane ethanol energy economy. Brazil grows sugarcane in its off-season, allowing both ethanol and sugar production to provide more than 30 per cent of the nation’s car fuel consumption through ethanol. Biofuels can boost rural incomes by creating demand for crops, generating jobs, and encouraging investment in agriculture. They support energy security and climate resilience. However, without safeguards, they may risk food security and environmental sustainability. Will any biofuel model in India based on ethanol mixed with petrol be distinguishable from Brazil?

High Ambition in Policy

Both the countries have high-blending mandates at the policy level. Brazil has had the Fuels of the Future law in force since October 2024, bringing a gradual increase in biodiesel blending, with blending rates increasing from 14 per cent at the start of 2025 to 20 per cent in 2030. At the same time, the Indian Government is furthering its ethanol-blending program with the imposition of a 10 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol as an interim target, whilst placing compressed biogas and sustainable aviation fuel as key pillars of its energy portfolio. These mandates have strong regulatory frameworks and financial incentives backing them, and they send a signal for medium — and long-term commitment to biofuels as important parts of the national energy policy.

Indian technologists are tapping Brazilian researchers and policymakers in sugarcane-based ethanol and second-generation biofuels to come and work in India and deepen this partnership. However, even as India uses feedstocks like rice straw, maize, and used cooking oil to amplify its biofuel output, the partnership strengthens Brazil’s soybean, oil, and sugarcane portfolio, creating enough diversification to withstand global supply shocks. Now, the two are looking at joint ventures in India and Brazil to build picobiorefinerías or bio-refineries, with Indian companies pumping money into Brazilian infrastructure deals and the other way around. Petrobras, Brazil’s mammoth state-owned energy company, has committed $600 million to biodiesel and biomethane projects in its 2025 derecho plan, while Indian companies like ONGC Videsh and Bharat Petroleum are getting into the business of upstream oil and bioenergy in Brazil.

The biofuel partnership between Brazil and India serves as a case study in South-South cooperation, showing how two developing countries can work together to solve mutual problems in a respectful and cooperative way. Both countries have a lot of experience dealing with the kinds of energy and rural development problems that many African countries face. They are using that experience to promote biofuels as part of a rural development and climate resilience toolkit for those countries. Brazil’s renewed engagement with African countries like Angola and Nigeria, coupled with India’s growing presence in East Africa, allows for a parallel in energy diplomacy that could benefit the trilateral cooperation of the two countries with African nations.

Political Complexities

The dance has its missteps, and the question of feedstock sustainability is no exception. Brazil’s dependence on soybean oil — over 70 per cent of biodiesel in commercial application in Brazil — has caused some raised eyebrows with regard to the Amazon and Cerrado. In the meantime, India is trying to juggle food security with expanding on biofuels as ethanol production from sugarcane and maize is ramped up. Politics about sourcing feedstock in amounts suitable for the kinds of biofuels meant to be of assistance are complex and likely only to heat up further. After all, trade is not just import and export; it is also a matter of conserving and expanding political power.

The world of biofuels knows no friction. It’s a mini-maelstrom of pricing shenanigans, currency swings, and regulatory inequities. The pricing scenario for biodiesel in Brazil, the second-largest producer of biodiesel in the world, has been nothing short of unprecedented. High prices of biodiesel were witnessed in late 2024, garnering a lot of attention as prices went up to about 30 per cent compared to the previous year because of Government mandates and the new crushing dynamics of the soybean industry in South America. In Brazil, biodiesel producers were paid R$6115/m3, whereas the biodiesel sector of India seemed to be frozen, not due to bad weather but due to traffic congestion caused by ethanol production and excessive vehicles on the road.

The evolving India-Brazil biofuels alliance is emerging as a compelling response to the rapidly shifting global energy and climate geopolitics. At a time when dominant economies like China are championing electric vehicles and synthetic fuels, and the United States is reshaping its clean energy architecture through the Inflation Reduction Act, Brazil and India represent a distinct alternative. Rooted in the principles of developmental equity and south-south cooperation, their collaboration articulates a vision of green industrialisation that is inclusive, pragmatic, and reflective of the needs of emerging economies.

What Next?

As the world’s energy landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and competitive, the India-Brazil partnership offers a narrative grounded in mutual resilience, technology exchange, and long-term sustainability. It moves beyond mere trade dynamics to define a new axis of energy diplomacy in the Global South. The forthcoming BRICS Summit in Brasilia presents an opportunity to strengthen this narrative, especially by positioning biofuels within broader discussions on climate finance, innovation, and south-led green transitions. A particularly promising area of collaboration is the aviation sector, which is under growing pressure to decarbonise. With no viable electrification or hydrogen-based alternatives currently feasible for large-scale aviation, Sustainable Aviation Fuel has emerged as a key enabler. Capable of reducing emissions by up to 80 per cent, SAF offers a practical decarbonisation pathway but global production remains limited. Here, Brazil’s advanced ethanol infrastructure and India’s expanding renewable energy base provide a synergistic foundation for joint SAF development, potentially establishing the Global South as a major contributor to aviation sustainability.

The India-Brazil biofuels alliance is thus more than a policy framework, it is a declaration of shared intent and strategic alignment. It signals the emergence of a bilateral compact that not only boosts trade and energy security but also contributes to shaping global norms on sustainable fuels.

As countries contemplate pathways to a low-carbon future, Brazil’s biofuel legislation serves as a pragmatic model an invitation to join a new era of biomass-based energy with clear rules and shared benefits. Moving forward, the alliance must focus on institutionalising its cooperation through joint research platforms, investment in SAF and ethanol infrastructure, and coordinated engagement in multilateral forums such as the Global Biofuels Alliance and BRICS. By leading with ambition and inclusivity, India and Brazil can redefine the contours of global biofuel leadership transforming their bilateral dance into a blueprint for the world.

As the energy transition accelerates, the winners and losers will be determined not by crude prices alone, but by the evolving arithmetic of refinery utilization and sector divergence.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly refinery utilization rate is more than a dry statistical report—it is a seismic barometer of sectoral shifts in the energy transition. As of August 2025, the data reveals a striking trend: utilization rates climbed steadily from 90.5% on August 2 to 93.3% by August 30. While this appears to signal robust refining activity, it masks a deeper structural divergence. A closer examination of historical patterns, fuel price dynamics, and sectoral interdependencies reveals why a utilization rate miss (i.e., a deviation from expected trends) could trigger bearish pressure on the Oil & Gas sector while creating bullish momentum for Passenger Airlines.

The Bear Case: Refinery Utilization and Oil & Gas Margins

Refinery utilization rates are intrinsically tied to refining margins, often measured by the ""crack spread""—the difference between crude oil input costs and the value of refined products like gasoline and diesel. When utilization rates rise, crack spreads typically widen, reflecting strong demand for refined fuels. However, in 2025, this dynamic is being upended.

The recent peak in utilization (93.3%) coincides with a structural decline in demand for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Electric vehicle (EV) adoption, now exceeding 18% of U.S. auto sales, has eroded gasoline consumption. Refiners, once flush with margins during peak utilization periods, are now grappling with overcapacity. For example, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes have reported declining orders for refining equipment upgrades, as operators prioritize mothballing older facilities over expansion.

A utilization rate miss—such as a sudden drop below 90%—would exacerbate this bearish narrative. It would signal weakening domestic demand for refined products, further compressing crack spreads and squeezing refining profits. This dynamic is already evident in the Oil & Gas sector's underperformance: the S&P 500 Energy Index has lagged the broader market by 12% year-to-date, as investors price in the long-term erosion of refining margins.

The Bull Case: Airlines and the Fuel Price Tailwind

While the Oil & Gas sector faces headwinds, Passenger Airlines are poised to benefit from the same shifts. As refining utilization stabilizes or declines, gasoline and diesel prices at the pump have remained subdued relative to crude oil prices. This has created a favorable tailwind for airlines, whose fuel costs typically account for 20-30% of operating expenses.

The EIA's historical data underscores this inverse relationship. In 2015, when utilization rates hit 95.1%, gasoline prices spiked $0.36 above crude-linked forecasts, directly cutting into airline margins. By contrast, 2025's utilization rates (93.3%) have kept refining margins in check, with gasoline prices aligning closely to crude oil prices. This has allowed airlines like Delta and American Airlines to lock in fuel savings through hedging strategies, improving net margins by 4-6 percentage points.

Moreover, the energy transition has created a unique arbitrage opportunity. As refiners reduce capital expenditures on ICE infrastructure, they are shifting focus to hydrogen and biofuel projects—sectors where airlines are already investing. For instance, United Airlines' recent $1.5 billion investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is now more economically viable in a low-refining-margin environment.

Strategic Portfolio Reallocation: The Energy Transition Playbook

The divergence between these sectors demands a strategic rebalancing of energy-related portfolios. Here's how investors can capitalize:

Underweight Oil & Gas Refiners: Refiners operating in overutilized regions (e.g., the Gulf Coast at 93.5% utilization) are increasingly exposed to margin compression. Companies like Valero and Marathon Petroleum are facing pressure to divest non-core assets, which could trigger further valuation declines.

Overweight Industrial Conglomerates: As refining activity shifts toward retrofitting and decarbonization, industrial firms like Caterpillar and 3M are seeing renewed demand for equipment upgrades and emissions-control technologies. These firms are positioned to outperform as refiners prioritize compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates.

Long-Term Positioning in Airlines: With fuel costs stabilizing and demand for air travel rebounding post-pandemic, airlines are entering a phase of margin expansion. Investors should consider ETFs like the iShares U.S. Airlines ETF (IAA) or individual stocks with strong hedging strategies.

Short-Term Bets on Energy Transition Plays: The shift from refining to decarbonization creates opportunities in hydrogen infrastructure and carbon capture. Companies like Plug Power and Occidental Petroleum are set to benefit from policy-driven capital flows.

The Unseen Thread: EIA Data as a Sector Rotation Signal

The EIA's refinery utilization data is not just a backward-looking metric—it is a forward-looking signal for sector rotations. A utilization rate miss (e.g., a sustained drop below 90%) would likely accelerate capital outflows from Oil & Gas and into energy transition plays. Conversely, a rate above 93% would reinforce the bear case for refiners but could temporarily benefit automakers reliant on ICE demand.

Investors must monitor this data alongside other indicators, such as the EIA's weekly crude oil inventory reports and the American Petroleum Institute's (API) refining activity assessments. The interplay between these metrics will shape the next phase of the energy transition, offering both risks and opportunities for those attuned to the sectoral shifts.

In a world where fuel price dynamics and utilization rates dictate sectoral fortunes, the EIA's weekly report is no longer just a footnote in energy markets—it is a roadmap for strategic portfolio reallocation. As the energy transition accelerates, the winners and losers will be determined not by crude prices alone, but by the evolving arithmetic of refinery utilization and sector divergence.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 16:56:07.853530

Founded in 2016 by the aerospace engineer Mark Lundstrom, Boulder-based Radia is working to build the WindRunner, a plane big enough to transport super-size wind turbines to onshore locations.

In a YouTube video posted by Radia, Lundstrom explains that wind turbines installed in offshore wind farms have blades that can exceed 100 meters (345ft) in length.

However, turbines built on land are typically limited to blades of about 70 meters 230ft - a problem chiefly caused by the challenge of transporting the blades along roads not built for such enormous cargo.

Turbines “simply too big” for road infrastructure

“It’s the inability to move big things that is basically the barrier that prevents us from super-sizing onshore wind turbines,” Lundstrom told an interview with the BBC this week.

In Radia’s video explainer, Lundstrom adds: “The turbines are simply too big to get under bridges, through tunnels, around curves.”

Why are bigger wind turbines important?

By enabling the installation of larger wind turbines in on-shore locations, wind farms’ productivity can be multiplied, notes the U.S. Department of Energy.

“Larger rotor diameters allow wind turbines to sweep more area, capture more wind, and produce more electricity,” the agency says.

“A turbine with longer blades will be able to capture more of the available wind than shorter blades - even in areas with relatively less wind.”

WindRunner dimensions - length, wingspan, payload:

According to Radia, the WindRunner will be 365ft in length, with a 261ft wingspan. Compare that to the Boeing 747, which measures a comparatively paltry 250ft in length and has a 224ft wingspan.

The WindRunner will have a payload volume of 272,000ft³, which the company notes is some 12 times greater than that of the Boeing 747.

The WindRunner’s length and payload would also outstrip those of the Antonov An-225 Mriya, so far the largest airplane ever built.

Built in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, the An-225 was 275ft long, with a payload bay some six times smaller. The craft was destroyed in 2022, during fighting in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Designed with a flying range of 1,200 miles, the WindRunner will run on sustainable aviation fuel, Radia says, and will be able to land on short, unpaved runways.

“It has the capability of […] landing on dirt within a wind farm,” Lundstrom says. “By doing this, we will be able to create the path to the cheapest energy in the world.”

Per Aerospace Global News, Radia aims to complete its first WindRunner in 2028, before pressing the craft into full service by 2030.

“The airline industry does in my view have a serious intent to meet net-zero targets but faces increased challenges in doing so”, John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, said. “Alternative technologies are being pushed further out, which means an increased emphasis on the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which is still in limited supply.”

The delays may also create another obstacle to the planned expansion of Heathrow. The airport said on August 1 that it would “only deliver expansion in a way that is consistent with net zero 2050”. And some analysts believe the hold-up increases the chances of a challenge to Boeing and Airbus from new entrants more eager to take up the environmental mantle.

Aviation is estimated by the International Energy Agency to account for 2.5 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, with a slightly greater — 4 per cent — contribution to global warming thanks to the creation of vapour trails. In the UK, it has a greater share of direct emissions: 9 per cent this year, according to the Climate Change Committee, the government’s independent advisers. That share is forecast to grow to 11 per cent by 2030 and 16 per cent by 2035.

That global emissions share is also likely to increase. After a severe decline during the pandemic, flights are now increasing fast. Iata, the airline trade body, has said passenger numbers will grow nearly 6 per cent this year to just under 5 billion and could hit 16 billion by 2050. As other energy-intensive industries find ways to cut their carbon emissions — electricity replacing blast furnaces in steel, new technology for making cement, and electric vehicles for land transport — aviation’s share of total CO₂ could, by some estimates, rise to 20 per cent by 2050.

Carbon-cutting technology for aviation is proving slow to arrive. Most experts think battery-power will be limited to small commuter aircraft, but there are high hopes for hydrogen. Airbus had invested significantly, including a plan to test a hydrogen fuel-cell engine on a modified A380 superjumbo. But it paused work in February, saying progress on “key enablers”, in particular the production of large amounts of hydrogen from renewable energy, was “slower than anticipated”.

Boeing has been less interested in hydrogen, but said the X-66A could lead to a 10 per cent reduction in emissions. When it cancelled the project it said it would instead concentrate on other designs for thinner, more efficient wings.

Neither manufacturer appears in any rush to bring out radical designs. Airbus’s plan to replace its bestselling A320 family of aircraft envisages something familiar to passengers today, albeit with engines that can be powered by conventional fuels or “sustainable” replacements. That plane is unlikely to enter service until 2035 at the earliest, and probably much later.

Boeing, which has been beset by a series of crises in the past year, also appears to be in no hurry. At its quarterly results on July 29, chief executive Kelly Ortberg said: “I don’t think the market is ready yet for a new airplane.”

• Boeing 737 Max 8: which airlines use the plane and is it safe?

Slow progress on alternative technology means airlines’ hopes rest on the rapid introduction of sustainable fuels — hydrocarbons not pumped from the ground, but made from plants or re-used oils, or directly synthesised. However, the current supply is tiny — a mere 0.53 per cent of total aviation fuel worldwide last year, according to Air Transport Action Group (Atag), which brings together airlines, airports and aerospace manufacturers.

Atag’s Waypoint 2050 report concluded that making enough sustainable fuel to hit net zero would require the construction of 5,000 refineries, costing $1.45 trillion over the next 25 years. IBA, the aviation consultancy, has forecast production of sustainable fuels will hit 18 million tonnes a year by 2035 — but that will be 23 million tonnes short of demand.

Environmental campaigners are scornful. “The only serious remedy [to increasing CO₂ emissions] is demand restraint,” Dr Douglas Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said. “Everything else — the nonsensical offset schemes, the utopian technology forecasts and now the implausible optimism surrounding ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel — is primarily a collection of elaborate misdirection techniques.”

If aviation’s emissions do grow as a proportion of the total, Airbus and Boeing could face societal pressure to do more. Nick Cunningham, managing partner at Agency Partners, an aerospace analysis firm, recently published a note on how “complacency” on decarbonisation posed an “existential risk” to the companies.

Cunningham said planemakers were understandably reluctant to make large investments in new technology. “Boeing does not at the moment have the financial resources to develop an all-new aircraft. Airbus has reason to be wary because some of its development programmes — the A380 and the A400M for example — ended up way over budget.”

• Net zero by 2050 struggles with reality

The Chinese aerospace industry could be a potential challenger. There are now 16 Comac C919s, the first modern Chinese airliner, in service, with a second, larger aircraft, the C929, expected to begin commercial flights towards the end of the decade. Cunningham said, however, that carbon reduction is not China’s main goal. “There could be a challenge from China, but for the moment it is concentrating on replacing imports of western aerospace equipment,” he said.

One potential rival to the Airbus-Boeing hegemony is JetZero, a California-based company set up in 2021. It has ambitious plans to build a radical new type of passenger aircraft: a blended wing body, where the wings and fuselage are one smooth shape. The Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber, used by the US Air Force in the recent attacks against Iran, is such a design.

JetZero claims its design could cut emissions in half compared to conventional designs. It has secured backing from two big US carriers, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, including a commitment from them to buy aircraft. The USAF has awarded it a development contract for a potential new transport aircraft.

“JetZero is extremely interesting,” Cunningham said. “The backing it has from airlines and the air force give it credibility, and it has very ambitious production plans. Its design would be more efficient than conventional aircraft, and crucially it would lend itself to a switch to hydrogen fuel when that is adopted.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F7a76cc80-d40b-4ce7-a770-c0b6a20a95b8.jpg?crop=2325%2C1308%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-03 11:56:18.379222

Net zero rules introduced by Sir Keir Starmer mean planes must be filled with at least 2 per cent sustainable fuel, which will rise to 10 per cent followed by 22 per cent by 2040.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate means airlines that do not comply with the green policy face heavy fines likely to be passed on in part to passengers.

Costs associated with the new levy are expected to reach £4.5 billion by 2035, according to a new analysis by Public First.

This works out at £12.79 per passenger per flight leaving the UK, adding £51.16 to the average overseas holiday taken by a family of four.

The impact of the policy is expected to hit Britons as soon as 2027, with its cost hitting £200 million in that year.

‘Ludicrous net stupid zero’

By 2030, this figure will have ballooned to £1.5 million, the equivalent to £4.64 per passenger per flight – making a holiday for a family of four £18.56 more expensive.

Richard Tice, the Reform UK deputy leader, told The Telegraph: “This is yet another egregious tax on working citizens to pay for the ludicrous net stupid zero. A Reform government will scrap all this nonsense.”

Greg Smith, a Tory transport minister, said: “Labour said the transition to green aviation would cost pennies but now families are being hit with soaring ticket prices to fund Ed Miliband’s net zero experiment.

“It’s not just weekend getaways being priced out. It’s regional airports under threat, tourism on the ropes, and British families paying the price for Labour’s ideological fantasy.

“The truth is net zero by 2050 is impossible without bankrupting our country and Labour’s plan to chase it will ground British families before it ever lands.”

80pc cost could be passed to consumers

The Government’s own impact assessment of the green mandate found that as much as 80 per cent of its cost could be passed on to consumers.

Labour claims the pledge to use more sustainable fuel will support thousands of jobs while cutting the UK’s transport emissions on the way to becoming a “clean energy superpower”.

The figures come as ministers were urged to relax red tape that means SAF cannot currently be made from non-food grade British-grown wheat.

Phil New led the Government’s independent review into the future of SAF and urged it to consider British bioethanol as a credible and scalable option.

Mr New said: “Ethanol made from British-grown milling wheat, which would otherwise be exported as animal feed, can be processed into SAF in a way that meets the emissions reductions required by the UK’s standards.

‘Home-grown, low-carbon aviation fuel industry’

“This is a real opportunity to create a home-grown, low-carbon aviation fuel industry that supports British agriculture, strengthens fuel security and helps us meet our climate ambitions.”

Ben Hackett, managing director at Vivergo Fuels, added: “The UK has the capability today to produce sustainable aviation fuel from home-grown non-food grade wheat – supporting British farmers, reducing carbon emissions, and improving our energy security. But outdated regulations are blocking this from happening.

“It makes no sense that ethanol from British wheat can be blended into petrol for cars, but not used to make jet fuel, especially when other countries are already moving ahead with this technology.”

The analysis by Public First also found the UK could require the output of seven large-scale bioethanol plants by 2035 to meet growing domestic demand for SAF.

Industry leaders fear that excessive reliance on imported cooking oil could hinder progress in growing domestic demand.

Liz Webster, the founder of Save British Farming, said: “British farmers should be able to grow British wheat to power British planes.

“It’s a win-win, unless we cave to foreign pressure and let down British farmers yet again.”

British farmers facing disaster

Earlier this year, a leaked memo claimed British farmers were facing disaster because of Sir Keir’s trade deal with Donald Trump.

Under the deal struck by Sir Keir, which has not yet come into force, the US will be able to supply Britain with some 1.4 billion litres of duty-free ethanol.

Vivergo runs the UK’s largest bioethanol plant at Saltend in East Yorkshire, but has warned this will have to close without help given from the Government.

This would in turn represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who provide grain to the site.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The move to greener fuels has been designed to cut emissions while protecting both industry and consumers from excessive cost increases. Any impact on ticket prices is expected to be within the range of normal year to year changes in air fares.

“Our SAF mandate sets out ambitious but achievable targets. Our approach to growing the UK SAF industry will also support skilled jobs in every part of the country, while boosting economic growth and reducing our emissions.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2025/08/03/TELEMMGLPICT000434587637_17542299168040_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-08-03 11:56:23.074738

One of those countries, Japan, has been one of the U.S.’s most dependable trading partners. That deal was announced July 23 and the White House also announced a pact with Indonesia on July 22.

Japan

Japan will invest $550 billion directed by the U.S. to rebuild and expand core American industries, the White House said. The funds, at Trump’s direction, will be targeted toward the revitalization of America’s strategic industrial base in five core areas: Energy infrastructure and production; semiconductor manufacturing and research; critical minerals mining, processing, and refining; pharmaceutical and medical production; and commercial and defense shipbuilding.

As part of the agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate. The White House believes the agreement will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan with an enforceable and transparent trade policy.

The agreement also calls for increased market access for agricultural producers. Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75% with a major expansion of import quotas. Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

The agreement was applauded by U.S. Meat Export Federation and CEO Dan Halstrom.

“USMEF greatly appreciates the Trump administration with Japan, reassuring and expanding opportunities in the No. 2 export destination for U.S. beef and pork,” Halstrom said. “In President Trump’s first term, the critical U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement was reached, returning U.S. red meat to a level playing field in Japan reinforcing its position as an extremely reliable market.”

According to the information released by the White House, the new agreement focuses on reinforcing the long-term economic partnership between the two countries, which for decades has delivered tremendous benefits for U.S. livestock and meat industries and for Japanese consumers, importers and customers, he added.

Indonesia

The Republic of Indonesia agreed to a framework for negotiating an agreement on reciprocal trade, the White House announced. That agreement builds on a longstanding agreement that was first signed in 1996.

Indonesia will eliminate an approximately 99% of tariff barriers for a full range of U.S. industrial and U.S. food and agricultural products exported to Indonesia.

The U.S. will reduce to 19% the reciprocal tariff that was started on April 2 on goods originating in Indonesia, and identify certain commodities that are not naturally available or domestically produced in the U.S. for a further reduction in the reciprocal tariff rate.

In the agricultural front, the two countries agreed to address and prevent barriers to U.S. food and agricultural products in the Indonesia market, including exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all import licensing regimes, including commodity balance requirements. It provides permanent Fresh Food of Plant Origin designation for all applicable U.S. plant products. The agreement recognizes U.S. regulatory oversight, including the listing of all U.S. meat, poultry and dairy facilities and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.

Halstrom said Indonesia is a market with incredible potential and could mean as much as $250 million annually for U.S. beef.

“But today, exports are minimal due to numerous trade barriers,” he said. “We are encouraged to see that the highlights detailed in the U.S.-Indonesia joint statement include resolving key issues such as import licensing, the commodity balance policy and Indonesia’s onerous plant-by-plant approval process.

“For both U.S. beef and U.S. pork, these longstanding restrictions have limited exports to Indonesia. Indonesian importers and consumers are demanding U.S. red meat, and we look forward to the swift conclusion of these negotiations and expanded export opportunities.”

The White House also announced that Indonesia has agreed to purchase soybeans, soybean meal, wheat and cotton with an estimated value of $4.5 billion.

In the short term, the UK bioethanol sector is a ticking time bomb.
Final Verdict The UK bioethanol industry is a cautionary tale for investors: even well-intentioned renewable energy projects can crumble under the weight of geopolitical decisions.","The UK bioethanol industry is at a crossroads, and investors in renewable energy infrastructure tied to regional agricultural supply chains need to tread carefully. Recent trade policy shifts, particularly the May 2025 U.S.-UK trade deal, have exposed vulnerabilities that could unravel decades of progress in decarbonizing transport and supporting domestic agriculture. For those eyeing the green energy sector, this is a stark reminder that political decisions can be as volatile as stock prices—and just as dangerous if ignored.

The Trade Deal's Blow to Domestic Producers

The removal of the 19% tariff on U.S. ethanol imports, granting duty-free access to 1.4 billion liters annually, has created a perfect storm for UK producers. With U.S. ethanol priced 30–40% lower than UK-produced wheat-based ethanol, companies like Vivergo Fuels and Ensus are staring down the barrel of insolvency. These plants, which process millions of tonnes of UK wheat and corn annually, are not just factories—they're linchpins in a regional agricultural ecosystem.

Consider the ripple effects: Vivergo alone sources wheat from 4,000 farms, producing 420 million liters of ethanol and 420,000 tonnes of high-protein animal feed. If it shuts down, farmers lose a critical market, and the livestock sector faces higher feed costs. The same applies to Ensus in Teesside. This isn't just about energy; it's about food security, rural economies, and the circular economy.

The Structural Weakness of Renewable Energy Supply Chains

The UK's reliance on bioethanol for its Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates is now at risk. The government's plan to increase petrol blending from E10 to E15 by 2026 hinges on domestic production. But with U.S. ethanol flooding the market, that mandate could backfire, accelerating the collapse of local producers.

The SAF mandate—requiring 22% SAF in jet fuel by 2040—is equally precarious. The alcohol-to-jet pathway, which depends on domestic ethanol, will struggle without stable feedstock supplies. Meanwhile, the government's focus on waste-based SAF (like HEFA) overlooks the strategic value of wheat and corn-based ethanol. Investors should ask: Can a country that's losing its ethanol plants realistically meet its climate targets?

Government Support: A Temporary Bandage, Not a Cure

The UK government has offered a £75 million annual subsidy to Vivergo and Ensus through 2026, along with promises to boost ethanol blending mandates. But these measures are stopgaps, not long-term solutions. The subsidies come with strings attached—specifically, they're tied to meeting blending targets that may become unachievable if U.S. imports dominate the market.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer's team has pledged “close engagement” with the industry, but time is running out. Vivergo Fuels is already warning of closure by September 13, 2025, unless urgent action is taken. This uncertainty makes the sector a high-risk bet for investors.

Investment Implications: Where to Watch

For investors, the key takeaway is to avoid overexposure to UK bioethanol companies without clear policy protection. Vivergo Fuels (parent company ABF Sugar) and Ensus are underperformers unless the government intervenes aggressively. Instead, consider hedging with companies in the waste-based SAF sector or renewable infrastructure less tied to agricultural feedstocks.

Monitor the following:

1. Policy Developments: Will the UK raise tariffs on U.S. ethanol or implement a carbon border adjustment mechanism to level the playing field?

2. Blending Mandates: Can the E15 mandate drive enough domestic demand to sustain producers?

3. SAF Incentives: Will the government shift subsidies toward alcohol-to-jet pathways to preserve ethanol supply chains?

The Bigger Picture: Trade vs. Climate Goals

This crisis underscores a fundamental tension in renewable energy policy: the clash between free trade and climate resilience. The UK's pursuit of trade concessions (e.g., steel and car export quotas) came at the expense of its bioethanol industry. Investors should watch how this plays out—will the government prioritize climate goals over trade deals in the future? The answer will shape the next decade of green energy investments.

In the short term, the UK bioethanol sector is a ticking time bomb. But for those willing to navigate the political turbulence, there's potential in companies that adapt to a post-ethanol world—whether through diversification into SAF or partnerships with agricultural tech firms. Just don't expect smooth sailing.

Final Verdict

The UK bioethanol industry is a cautionary tale for investors: even well-intentioned renewable energy projects can crumble under the weight of geopolitical decisions. Stay cautious, keep a close eye on policy shifts, and don't bet the farm on a sector that's already on the brink. For now, the safest play is to wait for clarity—and maybe a government that's ready to stand up to the ethanol titans across the Atlantic.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 15:56:13.009329

The Japanese conglomerate's performance underscores its ability to adapt to volatility while maintaining profitability and long-term growth momentum. For investors seeking stability amid uncertainty, ITOCHU's strategic reinvention and diversified portfolio position it as a compelling case study in resilience-driven value creation.

Resilient Earnings Amid Economic Headwinds

ITOCHU's Q1 2026 results highlight a striking divergence between revenue and profit trends. While total revenue declined 1.1% to ¥3.56 trillion, net profit surged 37% year-on-year to ¥283.9 billion. This outperformance was driven by disciplined asset management and sectoral reallocation. The privatization of DESCENTE, a premium apparel brand, boosted the Textile segment's profitability by 37%, showcasing ITOCHU's agility in optimizing its portfolio. Similarly, the Food division benefited from Dole's performance and provisions-related transactions, while the North American electric-power-related business thrived due to rising electricity demand and maintenance-free operations.

The company's ability to generate robust earnings despite a stronger yen (averaging 144.59 against the dollar) and falling resource prices reflects its strategic focus on high-margin services like logistics and renewable energy. This shift reduces exposure to cyclical commodities and aligns with global decarbonization trends, a critical factor for long-term sustainability.

Strategic Initiatives: Innovation and Diversification

ITOCHU's growth strategy is anchored in three pillars: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), North American energy expansion, and shareholder alignment.

Leading the SAF Revolution

ITOCHU has emerged as a key player in the global transition to cleaner energy. The company completed Phase 1 of a world-first initiative to promote SAF usage, collaborating with partners like ENEOS and Japan Airlines. This effort, validated by third-party verification from Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK), paves the way for a scalable Scope 3 environmental value trading system. By diversifying SAF production pathways—Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch (FT), and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)—ITOCHU mitigates feedstock volatility and technological risks. Strategic partnerships with Neste and Raven SR ensure access to 2.2 million tons of HEFA-based SAF capacity by 2026 and 200,000 tons of FT-based SAF by 2025, aligning with Japan's 2030 mandate for 10% SAF blending.

North American Energy Expansion

The North American electric-power-related business is a cornerstone of ITOCHU's energy strategy. Q1 2026 saw a 21% progress toward the annual goal, driven by increased electricity sales revenue and the absence of maintenance disruptions. The company is accelerating investments in solar power and renewable development assets, leveraging tax incentives and global demand for clean energy. With plans to expand peripheral services like operation and maintenance, ITOCHU is positioning itself to capitalize on the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and Europe's ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, creating complementary markets for its SAF exports.

Shareholder Alignment and Financial Discipline

ITOCHU's commitment to shareholder returns is evident in its 50% total payout ratio, exceeding its own Management Policy target. The company maintained a dividend of ¥200 per share and executed a ¥150 billion share buyback program, with ¥40.1 billion already completed in Q1. This balance between reinvestment and returns is critical in an environment where interest rate uncertainty and potential recessions in developed markets could strain cash flow. A net debt/EBITDA ratio under 0.6x and ¥1 trillion in planned investments underscore ITOCHU's disciplined capital allocation, ensuring it remains financially robust while funding growth.

Risk Mitigation and Global Positioning

ITOCHU's strategic depth is further reinforced by its proactive risk management. The company has expanded PT PROJECT TREE INDONESIA, a sustainability service firm, and deepened its Silicon Valley presence to target tech-driven business development. These moves align with global decarbonization trends and diversify revenue streams. However, risks such as potential U.S. trade policy shifts under a “Trump 2.0” administration and yen strength remain. ITOCHU's focus on renewable energy and high-margin services, however, provides a buffer against these uncertainties.

Investment Outlook

For investors, ITOCHU represents a rare blend of defensive qualities and growth potential. Its current valuation (P/E of ~14x) reflects stable earnings from its core trading business while offering exposure to high-growth SAF and renewable energy markets. Analysts project annual revenue growth of 4% and a 2.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in earnings, with return on equity (ROE) expected to reach 14% in three years.

Recommendation: ITOCHU is well-positioned to navigate macroeconomic headwinds through its diversified portfolio, innovative strategies, and financial prudence. Investors seeking exposure to the energy transition and sustainable logistics should consider a long-term position, with a focus on monitoring the company's North American energy projects and currency risk management. With a target net profit of ¥900 billion for FYE 2026 and a clear path to scaling SAF production, ITOCHU exemplifies how strategic agility can turn uncertainty into opportunity.

In a world where resilience is the new competitive edge, ITOCHU Corporation stands out as a model of adaptive leadership—a company not just surviving, but thriving, in the face of global challenges.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 03:56:23.746921

Peningkatan harga tiket disebabkan kebijakan baru Pemerintah Singapura yang mewajibkan penggunaan bahan bakar penerbangan ramah lingkungan atau sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) dengan komposisi campuran minimal 1 mulai 1 Januari 2026.

Berikut fakta harga tiket pesawat akan naik, pajak karbon masuk hitungan yang dirangkum Okezone, Minggu (3/8/2025).

1. Mulai 1 Januari 2026

""Singapura itu, mulai 1 Januari 2026 itu mandat 1 dengan SAF. Kemudian konsekuensinya, kalau kita belum ada mandat (penggunaan SAF) tetapi pesawat rute internasional kita terbang di wilayah udara lain yang sudah mandat, itu akan kena carbon tax,"" ujarnya saat ditemui pada acara Indonesia Aero Summit 2025 di Jakarta.

Denon menjelaskan, kebijakan Singapura atau negara lain itu akan memicu tambahan beban biaya operasional bagi maskapai, terutama akibat penerapan pajak karbon atau carbon tax yang dikenakan kepada penerbangan yang memasuki atau melintasi wilayah udara negara-negara yang telah menetapkan mandat emisi karbon. Menurutnya, tambahan itu pada akhirnya akan dibebankan kepada penumpang.

2. Tiket Bakal Lebih Mahal

Dengan demikian, tiket pesawat tujuan Singapura dipastikan akan lebih mahal dibandingkan sebelumnya. Kenaikan ini bukan hanya disebabkan oleh harga bahan bakar alternatif yang lebih tinggi, tetapi juga oleh konsekuensi regulasi karbon yang kini semakin ketat di kawasan Asia Tenggara.

""Contohnya kalau sekarang ada rute Garuda ke Amsterdam, itu kan melewati juga sebagian besar Mainland, nah itu akan kena carbon tax, per penumpang,"" tambahnya.

3. Harus Susun Regulasi

INACA mendorong pemerintah untuk menyusun regulasi pengelolaan ruang udara Indonesia. Salah satunya pengenaan carbon tax bagi maskapai asing yang belum menerapkan mandat SAF jika melintasi ruang udara Indonesia.

""Sehingga kalau misalnya ada maskapai lain yang lewat di airspace Indonesia, penerapan pentarifan carbon tax-nya juga harus didesain oleh Indonesia. Karena setiap negara yang dilewati pesawat itu buang karbon di negara mereka, itu kena carbon tax,"" lanjutnya.

4. Transisi Penerbangan Berkelanjutan

INACA mendukung transisi menuju penerbangan berkelanjutan. Di Indonesia sendiri, pemerintah melalui Pertamina dan Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) tengah mempersiapkan penerapan bioavtur berbasis used cooking oil (minyak jelantah) dengan target campuran sebesar 3 persen pada 2026.

5. Target Net Zero Carbon pada 2060

Langkah ini dilakukan untuk mendukung target nasional mencapai net zero carbon pada 2060.

6. Penerapan Bahan Bakar

INACA menekankan bahwa penerapan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan harus diikuti dengan strategi distribusi yang efisien dan terdesentralisasi agar biaya tidak melonjak tajam. Jika dikelola dengan baik, penggunaan bioavtur dalam negeri diharapkan dapat menekan biaya operasional maskapai dan menjaga harga tiket tetap terjangkau bagi masyarakat.",https://static.rctiplus.id/media/600/files/fta_rcti/news/images/harga_tiket_pesawat-7bDo_large.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:56:35.702987

However, ITOCHU's strategic depth offers a buffer.
Investment Implications For investors, ITOCHU's Q1 results present a compelling case for long-term value creation.","Japan's ITOCHU Corporation, a global trading giant with a diversified portfolio spanning energy, machinery, textiles, and food, has delivered a Q1 FYE2026 performance that underscores its operational resilience in a turbulent global economy. Despite a 1.1% decline in revenue to ¥3.56 trillion, the company reported a staggering 37% year-on-year surge in net profit to ¥283.9 billion. This divergence between top-line and bottom-line results reveals a strategic recalibration that positions ITOCHU to navigate macroeconomic headwinds while capitalizing on emerging opportunities.

Navigating a Fractured Global Market

The first quarter of FYE2026 unfolded against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating exchange rates, and resource price volatility. ITOCHU's ability to boost profits despite these challenges speaks to its structural adaptability. The yen's appreciation and falling commodity prices—iron ore dropped from $111 to $98 per ton, and crude oil fell from $85 to $67 per barrel—eroded margins in its Metals & Minerals segment. Yet, the company offset these pressures through strategic asset management and sectoral reallocation.

A key driver was the privatization of DESCENTE, a premium apparel brand, which contributed significantly to the Textile segment's 37% profit growth. By consolidating this asset, ITOCHU not only strengthened its direct-to-consumer model but also leveraged lean management practices to enhance profitability. Meanwhile, the Food division, bolstered by Dole's performance and provisions-related transactions, demonstrated resilience against inflationary pressures.

The company also navigated U.S. tariff risks with relative success. While the immediate impact of Trump-era trade policies on Q1 was limited, ITOCHU remains vigilant about potential escalation. Its North American electric-power-related business, however, thrived due to rising electricity demand and the absence of maintenance costs, highlighting the value of its renewable energy investments.

Strategic Reinvention: From CAPEX to Shareholder Returns

ITOCHU's Q1 results reflect a disciplined approach to capital allocation and long-term positioning. The company executed ¥185 billion in investments approved in FYE2025 and added ¥50 billion in new initiatives, including CAPEX of ¥62 billion. These funds are directed toward high-growth areas such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), cellulose nanofiber-reinforced plastics, and logistics innovations. For instance, the launch of PT PROJECT TREE INDONESIA—a sustainability service company—aligns with global decarbonization trends, while its Silicon Valley expansion targets tech-driven business development.

Shareholder returns remain a priority. ITOCHU maintained its dividend at ¥200 per share and announced a ¥150 billion share buyback program, with ¥40.1 billion already executed by Q1's end. The 50% total payout ratio exceeds its own Management Policy target, signaling confidence in its cash flow generation. This balance between reinvestment and returns is critical for investors seeking both growth and income in an uncertain environment.

Risks and Opportunities in the Outlook

While ITOCHU's Q1 performance is commendable, the road ahead is not without risks. A potential “Trump 2.0” administration could disrupt global trade dynamics, and a recession in developed markets could dampen demand for machinery and energy. Moreover, the yen's strength—averaging 144.59 against the dollar in Q1—continues to pressure resource-based profits.

However, ITOCHU's strategic depth offers a buffer. Its diversified portfolio limits exposure to any single sector, and its focus on high-margin services (e.g., logistics, renewable energy) reduces reliance on cyclical commodities. The company's 2.2% net profit growth guidance for FYE2026, coupled with a robust balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA <0.6x), suggests a conservative yet ambitious approach.

Investment Implications

For investors, ITOCHU's Q1 results present a compelling case for long-term value creation. The company's ability to generate strong earnings growth in a volatile environment, coupled with its proactive reinvestment in sustainable and tech-enabled sectors, positions it as a defensive yet growth-oriented play.

However, prudence is warranted. A 50% total payout ratio is ambitious, and any sharp rise in interest rates or a global economic slowdown could strain cash flow. Investors should monitor ITOCHU's progress in its North American energy projects and its capacity to mitigate currency risks.

In a world where global supply chains are increasingly fragmented and environmental regulations tighten, ITOCHU's blend of operational agility and strategic foresight makes it a standout.

""Selama tahun 2024 dan 2025 industri penerbangan nasional masih belum membaik dan masih menghadapi banyak tantangan baik tantangan global maupun nasional,"" kata Ketua Umum INACA Denon Prawiraatmadja dalam keterangan di Jakarta, dikutip Antara, Sabtu, 2 Agustus.

Menurutnya, memanasnya kondisi geopolitik global mempengaruhi berbagai hal dalam industri penerbangan, seperti terganggunya rantai pasok untuk pesawat dan sparepart, serta harga minyak dan kurs rupiah terhadap dolar Amerika Serikat (AS) yang cenderung meningkat.

Di dalam negeri, katanya lagi, dampak pandemi COVID-19, kebijakan serta iklim usaha yang diwarnai persaingan bisnis tajam, juga membuat industri penerbangan belum kembali seperti sebelum pandemi.

Hal itu mengakibatkan jumlah penumpang domestik untuk penerbangan berjadwal selama tahun 2024 stagnan dengan tahun 2023. Selain itu, jumlah pesawat juga turun karena banyak pesawat yang masuk perawatan Repair and Overhaul (MRO) dan kesulitan mendapatkan spareparts.

Menurutnya, terdapat beberapa tantangan penerbangan nasional, baik untuk maskapai penerbangan berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, dan kargo yang harus disikapi bersama stakeholder penerbangan, yaitu regulasi yang kurang fleksibel; risiko nilai tukar rupiah terhadap dolar AS; pengadaan spareparts; hubungan dengan pengelola bandara dan Airnav.

Selanjutnya masalah operasional penerbangan tidak berjadwal (terbang malam, terbang khusus, air ambulance dan lainnya; serta Ilegal charter (penerbangan charter ilegal).

""Diperlukan langkah-langkah strategis jangka pendek, menengah dan panjang, agar tantangan ini bisa segera teratasi dan industri penerbangan pulih seperti sebelum pandemi COVID-19,"" ujar Denon.

INACA berharap pembahasan permasalahan industri penerbangan secara holistik dan komprehensif mulai dari bisnis dan operasional penerbangan sampai dengan hal-hal pendukungnya dengan melibatkan pemerintah lintas kementerian dan lembaga; kalangan bisnis; akademisi; media; dan masyarakat dapat dilanjutkan.

Kedua, dilanjutkan pembahasan upaya peningkatan kondisi finansial maskapai penerbangan baik maskapai penerbangan berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, kargo dan perintis melalui regulasi operasional bisnis penerbangan yang lebih adil

""Ketiga menyelenggarakan konektivitas penerbangan secara komprehensif dengan sistem hub dan spoke baik untuk penerbangan domestik maupun internasional,"" katanya pula.

Keempat melakukan deregulasi terkait proses ekspor-impor sparepart baik yang melekat maupun tidak melekat di pesawat dengan menggunakan Ilustrated Part Catalog (IPC) serta berdasarkan aturan Tokyo Round dari WTC.

Kelima meningkatkan implementasi safety management system (SMS) dan peningkatan safety culture dalam operasional penerbangan dari semua stakeholder, baik itu regulator (pemerintah), operator penerbangan (maskapai, bandara, MRO), dan masyarakat.

""Keenam dibentuknya Dewan Transportation Board bekerjasama dengan moda transportasi lain dan stakeholder terkait untuk mengembangkan transportasi multi moda dalam rangka mendukung pertumbuhan perekonomian nasional Indonesia,"" ujar Denon.

INACA juga berharap peningkatan dukungan pemangku kepentingan di sektor penerbangan terhadap maskapai penerbangan nasional baik berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, kargo, dan perintis.

Dengan begitu dapat meningkatkan konektivitas penerbangan dan menjembatani kesenjangan pembangunan, mendukung desentralisasi, meningkatkan daya saing komoditas lokal, dan meningkatkan fungsi sebagai katalisator bagi pembangunan ekonomi lokal sehingga memastikan tidak ada wilayah Indonesia yang tertinggal.

After five years in deep storage triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the final two giants are being readied for service, signaling a renewed era of ultra-luxury and high-capacity air travel.

Etihad Airways is set to reintroduce two more Airbus A380-800 aircraft into its fleet. The move was initially reported by aviation journalist Andreas Spaeth, who identified aircraft A6–APC and A6-APB as the next in line to return to active duty.

Confirmation followed during an Etihad open day held for Wizz Air Abu Dhabi staff in late July 2025. At the event, Arik De, Etihad’s Chief Revenue and Commercial Officer, shared the carrier’s strategy for expanding its A380 operations.

According to the timeline:

A6-APC is scheduled to rejoin the fleet by June 2026

A6-APB will return by January 2027

These two will complement the seven A380s already flying for Etihad, bringing the total to nine by early 2027. One A380, A6-APA, remains in storage but is being parted out and will not return to service.

Etihad’s CEO, Antonoaldo Neves, has expressed a clear long-term vision to keep the A380 flying until at least 2032, bucking the trend of other airlines retiring the type in favor of smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft. This decision comes as the airline experiences strong demand recovery and expands its global reach.

Currently, Etihad’s A380s serve major international routes from Abu Dhabi (AUH) to destinations including: London (LHR), Paris (CDG), Singapore (SIN), Toronto (YYZ)

A380 service to New York (JFK) was recently dropped due to underperformance, though new long-haul destinations are under review.

Etihad is in full expansion mode. In July 2025 alone, the airline accepted delivery of:

Its first Airbus A321LR (set for commercial service to Phuket starting August 1)

Two Boeing 787 Dreamliners

One Airbus A350-1000

One Airbus A320

What are the potential factors driving the growth and Key Trends of the South Korea Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Solution Market?

The growth of the South Korea Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) solution market is being driven by a combination of regulatory pressure, environmental consciousness, and advancements in fuel technology. As global and domestic aviation industries face increasing scrutiny over carbon emissions, South Korea is aligning with international initiatives such as ICAO’s CORSIA and the EU's Fit for 55 package. This has led to a push for decarbonization and sustainability within the aviation sector, making SAF a critical component of future-ready operations. Government incentives, including tax credits and subsidies for biofuel production, are encouraging energy companies and airlines to invest in SAF technologies. The rising cost of conventional jet fuel and the economic volatility associated with fossil fuel markets further reinforce the shift toward more stable and environmentally friendly alternatives like SAF. Additionally, strategic partnerships between airlines, refiners, and biotech firms are accelerating the commercialization and local production capacity of SAF, which is essential to meet domestic demand while minimizing dependence on imports.

Key trends shaping the South Korea SAF solution market include the emergence of advanced feedstock technologies, such as waste oils, algae, and municipal solid waste, which provide more sustainable and scalable sources for fuel production. Technological innovation in hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and alcohol-to-jet pathways is enhancing fuel performance and reducing lifecycle emissions, making SAF more viable for long-haul and international flights. The market is also witnessing increasing engagement from major Korean carriers who are committing to net-zero targets and trialing SAF-blended flights, often in partnership with global sustainability coalitions. Furthermore, the growth of green airport infrastructure and carbon offset programs is creating a broader ecosystem to support SAF adoption. These developments, coupled with a growing public and corporate emphasis on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance, are positioning the SAF solution market as a pivotal sector in South Korea’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

In South Korea, the growth of ESG-focused market research is being propelled by a combination of regulatory, economic, and cultural factors. The South Korean government has introduced stringent ESG disclosure mandates, requiring large companies to publish ESG reports by 2025. This policy shift has prompted a surge in demand for data-driven ESG insights and compliance frameworks. Additionally, the country’s powerful conglomerates, or chaebols, face increasing scrutiny from investors and the public, driving them to enhance transparency, environmental stewardship, and governance standards—areas where market research plays a critical role. Investor influence, particularly from institutions like the National Pension Service (NPS), is another major growth driver, as ESG principles become central to capital allocation. South Korea’s export-heavy economy is also responding to international ESG norms, especially in light of EU carbon border taxes and global supply chain expectations. Furthermore, consumer behavior is shifting; younger demographics are prioritizing sustainability and ethical consumption, compelling brands to rely on ESG research to refine messaging and product development.

Key trends in the region reflect this momentum. Carbon neutrality analytics are gaining prominence as companies align with the national goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. There is a heightened focus on ESG risks in supply chains, including labor practices and environmental compliance, especially for export-oriented industries. ESG scoring is becoming increasingly localized, with Korean firms developing region-specific metrics that better capture domestic regulatory and cultural nuances. Technological integration is another defining trend—AI-powered ESG dashboards and big data platforms are enabling real-time monitoring and strategic analysis. Importantly, ESG is expanding beyond traditional sectors like heavy industry into emerging areas such as fintech, beauty, entertainment, and smart mobility, making ESG research a strategic necessity across South Korea’s innovation-driven economy.

The latest report comes after Ian Ball, the man who attempted to kidnap Princess Anne in 1974, was released from a high-security facility.","King Charles III has made surprising announcement amid reports of his younger sister Princess Anne's kidnapper's release.

The 76-year-old monarch has reportedly put his late mother Queen Elizabeth II's luxury helicopter on the market.

The monarch has decided to sell the eight-seater red 2009 Sikorsky and will instead use two environmentally friendly jets, believed to cost £8.5m each.

The opulent interior of the late Queen's helicopter has been revealed for the first time after it was put on sale. Spacious grey leather seats are matched with a blue carpet, while a magazine rack, a wooden clock and tinted windows complete the design.

The listing, by helicopter broker AeroAsset, boasts that it has only had 'one owner since new' and is a 'Head of State Aircraft'. It has had 5222 hours of flying and comes with 'ultraleather and ultrasuede interior panel upholstery,'

The Queen made innumerable trips in her helicopter, including one from Sandringham to Windsor a few months before she died. The royal family have flown the helicopter for 15 years, between 2009 and 2024.

Her personal Range Rover, which she used between 2006 and 2008, is also up for auction. The 2006 L322 model features a distinctive ornament of a labrador with a grouse in its mouth.

It also has a number of unique features including side steps, mud flaps, a made-to-measure dog guard for Elizabeth II's canine companions and extra wiring for security measures.

It is worth mentioning here that the royal family now uses the new AgustaWestland AW139s, which run on 50 per cent sustainable aviation fuel.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Caution and Opportunity Fluor's Q2 results underscore the challenges of executing large-scale infrastructure projects in a high-inflation environment.
Its Q2 2025 earnings highlight the fragility of its infrastructure business but also the strength of its energy transition strategy.","Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) has always been a barometer of the energy and infrastructure sectors. Its second-quarter 2025 earnings report, however, reveals a company navigating a turbulent landscape. Revenue of $4 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.43 fell short of historical benchmarks, with adjusted EBITDA declining 42% year-over-year to $96 million. Yet, beneath these figures lies a story of strategic recalibration and long-term positioning in megatrends that could redefine global energy systems. For investors, the question is not whether Fluor is struggling, but whether its resilience and adaptability can unlock value in a world increasingly defined by decarbonization and digital transformation.

Headwinds and Hurdles: A Q2 in Context

Fluor's Q2 results reflect the dual pressures of sector-specific challenges and macroeconomic headwinds. The Energy Solutions segment, once a cornerstone of profitability, saw profits plummet from $75 million in Q2 2024 to $15 million, driven by cost overruns on three infrastructure projects and an unexpected $31 million arbitration ruling. Meanwhile, the Mission Solutions segment, while posting a $35 million profit, faced a temporary stop work order on a key airfield project.

The Urban Solutions segment, which reported a modest $29 million profit, has been particularly vulnerable to subcontractor errors and project delays. Fluor's response—strengthening execution teams and taking legal action against underperforming partners—signals a recognition of operational fragilities. Yet, these issues are symptomatic of a broader industry-wide struggle with supply chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures.

Strategic Resilience: The Long Game in Energy Transition

While the Q2 numbers are sobering, Fluor's long-term value proposition hinges on its alignment with the energy transition. The company's $28.2 billion backlog—80% reimbursable—provides a critical buffer against short-term volatility. This includes high-margin, long-term contracts in hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture, sectors poised for explosive growth.

The LNG Canada project, now shipping its first cargo after achieving Ready for Start-Up (RFSU) for Train 1, exemplifies Fluor's ability to deliver complex, capital-intensive projects. The proposed phase 2 expansion, which could double the facility's size, underscores its relevance in a world increasingly reliant on cleaner energy sources. Meanwhile, Fluor's 51% stake in NuScale Power—a leader in small modular reactors (SMRs)—offers a unique advantage in the nuclear renaissance. A $3.2 billion pretax mark-to-market gain from NuScale in Q2, though non-recurring, highlights the potential of this asset to generate long-term value.

Fluor's foray into green hydrogen and carbon capture further cements its role in the energy transition. The company's expertise in converting existing facilities into renewable fuels production sites—such as the former Come By Chance refinery—positions it to capitalize on the shift toward sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel. Additionally, Fluor's patented Econamine carbon dioxide recovery technology is being deployed in projects like the Albemarle Lithium Conversion Project, aligning with global net-zero targets.

The Infrastructure Imperative: A $57 GW Opportunity

The infrastructure segment remains a double-edged sword for Fluor. While cost overruns and execution challenges have dented profitability, the underlying demand for infrastructure is robust. By 2030, data centers alone are projected to drive 44 GW of additional energy demand, much of it to be met by renewables. Fluor's work on colocation data centers in India and its partnerships with tech firms to deploy AI-optimized power systems position it to benefit from this surge.

However, Fluor must address its operational execution risks. The company's revised 2025 guidance—adjusted EBITDA of $475–525 million and operating cash flow of $200–250 million—reflects a more cautious outlook. Share repurchases have been scaled back to $450–500 million for the year, a sign of fiscal prudence in uncertain times. For investors, the key will be whether Fluor can stabilize its infrastructure segments while accelerating its energy transition bets.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Caution and Opportunity

Fluor's Q2 results underscore the challenges of executing large-scale infrastructure projects in a high-inflation environment. Yet, its strategic focus on energy transition and digital transformation—through tools like Building Information Modeling (BIM) and AI-driven predictive analytics—positions it to outperform in the long run. The company's $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, coupled with a manageable debt-to-equity ratio of 0.75, provides flexibility to weather near-term headwinds.

For investors, the path forward is nuanced. Fluor's revised guidance and cash flow challenges suggest caution in the short term. However, its backlog, energy transition expertise, and NuScale stake offer compelling long-term upside. A prudent approach would involve a staggered entry into the stock, with a focus on its exposure to hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture—a $2.5 trillion global market by 2030. Historically, a simple buy-and-hold strategy following Fluor's earnings releases has shown promising results, with a 57.14% win rate over three days, 71.43% over ten days, and 78.57% over thirty days, peaking at a 10.47% return on day 59.

Conclusion: A Company at the Crossroads

Fluor Corporation stands at a crossroads. Its Q2 2025 earnings highlight the fragility of its infrastructure business but also the strength of its energy transition strategy. While the near-term outlook is cautious, the company's alignment with megatrends like decarbonization, AI-driven efficiency, and green hydrogen offers a compelling narrative for long-term investors. For those willing to navigate the volatility, Fluor represents a unique opportunity to bet on the future of energy—one modular reactor, one carbon capture project, and one data center at a time.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 15:56:24.396425

This decision, driven by an irreconcilable valuation gap with Air Europa's owners, reflects a broader shift in strategic priorities and underscores the mounting risks facing investors in a sector grappling with financial, regulatory, and environmental headwinds.

A Failed Bid and the Valuation Dilemma

Air France-KLM's €300 million offer for 51% of Air Europa—a valuation of roughly €600 million—was dismissed as insufficient by the Hidalgo family, who valued a 25% stake at the same amount (implying a €960 million total valuation). This discrepancy highlights the challenges of aligning expectations in a market where recovery trajectories remain uncertain. For Air France-KLM, the decision to exit the race was a pragmatic one, avoiding a costly stalemate with stakeholders unwilling to compromise. However, it also signals a recalibration of appetite for large-scale acquisitions in an environment where capital allocation must now balance growth ambitions with profitability pressures.

The airline's repeated attempts to secure a stake in Air Europa—from a 2019 bid derailed by Iberia's interest to a 2021 partnership with Delta Air Lines—underscore the strategic value of Madrid-Barajas as a hub for transatlantic and Latin American routes. Yet the failure to finalize a deal now shifts the spotlight to Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines, both of whom are reportedly circling the Spanish carrier. This dynamic illustrates the intensifying competition for market share in a fragmented industry, where access to key hubs and route networks remains a critical differentiator.

Post-Pandemic Consolidation: Strategic Gains and Structural Risks

The European airline sector is undergoing a wave of consolidation, driven by the need to counteract the pandemic's long-term effects, including reduced consumer demand, higher fuel costs, and the transition to sustainable aviation. Lufthansa's integration of ITA Airways and Air France-KLM's fleet modernization with A350s and 787-10s are emblematic of this trend. These moves aim to enhance unit revenue, reduce costs, and align with 2030 sustainability targets. However, the sector's gains are tempered by systemic risks that investors must scrutinize.

One such risk is the soaring cost of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is now 4.2 times pricier than conventional jet fuel. While European carriers are investing in SAF partnerships, scaling production will require regulatory incentives and technological breakthroughs. Additionally, supply chain bottlenecks have delayed aircraft deliveries, pushing the average fleet age to 15 years and constraining capacity growth. These constraints are compounded by CORSIA compliance costs, which could drain €1 billion from the sector in 2025 alone.

Regulatory scrutiny further complicates consolidation efforts. The European Commission's evolving merger framework—combining route-based and airport-based market definitions—has raised the bar for approvals. For example, the EC's rejection of the Connect Airways/Flybe merger hinged on the inability to transfer valuable take-off and landing slots, a hurdle that Air Europa's bidders must now navigate. With Brexit-era regulatory duality (e.g., UK Competition and Markets Authority involvement), the path to cross-border deals is fraught with legal and political uncertainties.

Investment Implications: Balancing Resilience and Volatility

Despite these challenges, the sector offers compelling opportunities for investors who can discern resilience amid volatility. The European airline industry's net profit margin improved to 4.3% in 2025, outpacing historical averages in the context of higher operating costs. Low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Wizz Air have accelerated capacity expansion, operating at 105.2% of 2019 levels, while legacy carriers are leveraging premium offerings (e.g., Lufthansa's Allegris brand) to capture higher-yielding passengers.

However, investors must remain cautious. Sudden spikes in fuel prices, geopolitical shocks, or regulatory overreach could erode margins swiftly. For instance, Air France-KLM's recent operating profit of €736 million in Q2 2025 masks underlying fragility: a 2.4% increase in unit revenue per ASK is modest against a backdrop of rising SAF and CORSIA costs. Similarly, Lufthansa's 27% year-on-year profit growth is contingent on maintaining cost discipline and navigating aircraft delivery delays.

For investors, the key is to adopt a diversified approach. Strategic alliances—such as Lufthansa's stake in ITA Airways and Air France-KLM's investment in SAS—offer a safer path to expansion than outright acquisitions. Additionally, companies positioned in premium and intercontinental markets (e.g., British Airways, Air France) are better insulated against price-sensitive demand shifts.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

Air France-KLM's exit from the Air Europa bid is a microcosm of the European airline industry's broader transformation. While consolidation remains a strategic imperative, the sector's risks—ranging from regulatory hurdles to sustainability costs—demand a measured approach. Investors who prioritize flexibility, sustainability alignment, and regulatory foresight will be better positioned to capitalize on the sector's long-term potential. In a market where the only certainty is uncertainty, adaptability will be the ultimate differentiator.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 14:56:11.616668

The King is selling his mother's eight-seater red 2009 Sikorsky and will instead use two environmentally friendly jets, believed to cost £8.5m each.

The royal family have used the new AgustaWestland AW139s, which run on 50 per cent sustainable aviation fuel, since last year, having flown in the previous helicopter for the previous 15 years.

The opulent interior of the late Queen's helicopter has been revealed for the first time after it was put on sale.

Spacious grey leather seats are matched with a blue carpet, while a magazine rack, a wooden clock and tinted windows complete the design.

The listing, by helicopter broker AeroAsset, boasts that it has only had 'one owner since new' and is a 'Head of State Aircraft'.

It has had 5222 hours of flying and comes with 'ultraleather and ultrasuede interior panel upholstery,' it adds.

The Queen made innumerable trips in her helicopter, including one from Sandringham to Windsor a few months before she died.

Her personal Range Rover, which she used between 2006 and 2008, is also up for auction.

The 2006 L322 model features a distinctive ornament of a labrador with a grouse in its mouth.

It also has a number of unique features including side steps, mud flaps, a made-to-measure dog guard for Elizabeth II's canine companions and extra wiring for security measures.

While the rear grab handles, to help with the late Queen's entry and exit from the vehicle have been removed.

The car has covered 120,000 miles and is described as being in 'exemplary condition throughout.

The model's current value is between £9,000 and £16,000.

But it is estimated to raise up to £70,000 when it goes for sale at the Silverstone Festival on August 23.

The same auction house sold a different one of her Range Rovers for £132,750.

The car's MOT record shows that by April 2009 - around a year after it was released from the Royal Household - it had clocked just under 18,000 miles. Today, it is showing 119,938.

Rob Hubbard, Managing Director and Principal Auctioneer of Iconic Auctioneers, said: 'Vehicles with such distinguished provenance rarely enter the market, making this an exceptional opportunity for collectors and enthusiasts alike.

During a visit to the university on Monday, 21 July, Aviation Minister Mike Kane MP announced that Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million initiative aimed at commercialising a new SAF production method. The project is designed to attract investment for large-scale SAF production facilities, helping to increase the availability of low-carbon fuels across the aviation sector.

The initiative, known as NextGen-SAF, brings together an international consortium of partners, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK). It has also garnered letters of support from key industry players such as Airbus, Boeing, Qatar Airways, and the City of Doncaster Council.

Traditional SAF production typically relies on bio-based or waste-derived feedstocks, raising questions about the long-term sustainability and scalability of supply. The University of Sheffield’s innovative approach bypasses this challenge. Instead, it uses renewable energy and advanced carbon capture technologies to create synthetic fuel.

At the core of this approach is a method known as Power to Liquid (PtL), which combines renewable electricity and atmospheric or industrial carbon dioxide to produce hydrogen. These elements are then converted into synthetic hydrocarbons, which are refined into SAF.

The process not only holds promise for reducing aviation emissions but could also offer a cost-effective and flexible solution for decarbonising other industrial operations.

NextGen-SAF plans to build the world’s first demonstration plant integrating two breakthrough technologies: a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The MCFC is capable of both generating hydrogen and capturing CO₂, while the AFT reactor transforms these components into synthetic fuel. The demonstration plant will test the full system’s performance, with the goal of scaling it up for commercial use.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

“We are proud to lead this pioneering project, made possible through crucial government funding, to develop a new route for producing sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is vital for cutting emissions in aviation, and this work represents a significant step in scaling up domestic SAF production. This project not only aligns with national sustainability goals but also strengthens the UK’s fuel production capabilities and long-term economic growth.”

The announcement comes as part of a wider £63 million funding package from the Department for Transport, supporting 17 projects across the UK aimed at boosting SAF innovation.

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution,” said Aviation Minister Mike Kane. “We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and cementing the UK’s place as a global leader in sustainable flight.”

The University of Sheffield is internationally recognised for its leadership in SAF research. Its Energy Innovation Centre is equipped with state-of-the-art pilot-scale testing facilities, enabling close collaboration between researchers and industry to trial clean energy technologies before they’re brought to market.

The university is also home to the UK SAF Clearing House, one of only two centres globally that support fuel producers in gaining certification for SAF to be used in commercial aviation.

Sheffield played a key role in the world’s first transatlantic flight powered entirely by SAF. Its researchers assessed the impact of the fuel on particulate emissions and contrail formation, with findings showing a reduction in emissions of up to 70%, thanks to testing conducted at the Energy Innovation Centre.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-8.png,N,,2025-08-02 11:56:37.484198

If approved, flights could take off from the new runway within a decade.

The expansion will boost connectivity with at least 30 new daily routes, modernised terminals, and capacity for 150 million passengers annually. The project aligns with Heathrow’s net-zero by 2050 commitment and supports long-term UK economic growth.

London Heathrow Plans Third Runway and New Terminals

Heathrow Airport (LHR), home to British Airways (BA) and others, has launched its most ambitious development yet. A third runway measuring 3,500 metres will lift annual capacity to 756,000 aircraft movements and 150 million passengers. Parliament has approved the proposed layout and design.

To support this, Heathrow will expand terminal infrastructure. The plan includes Terminal 5X, three satellite terminals, and a larger Terminal 2. Terminal 5X will serve as a second main entrance to Terminal 5, with a shared transport interchange.

The airport will phase out Terminal 3 and redevelop the Central Terminal Area. These upgrades aim to improve operations and passenger experience. Heathrow wants to streamline transfers across terminals.

Heathrow will invest $27.9 billion (£21 billion) on the third runway and airfield expansion, $16 billion (£12 billion) on new terminals and airport infrastructure, and $20.7 billion (£15 billion) to upgrade existing infrastructure. These costs reflect inflation and project complexity.

The third runway and initial works should finish by the mid-2030s. Terminal upgrades will follow in stages. All funding will come from private investors under a tailored regulatory system.

Heathrow Airport’s Expansion Boosts Economy and Connectivity

Heathrow’s expansion could boost UK GDP by 0.43 percent. The airport supports over $260 billion (£200 billion) in annual trade and connects exporters to 92 percent of global output. A third runway would raise cargo capacity by 50 percent and add long-haul routes.

The plan will improve regional connectivity. Areas like Cornwall, Scotland, and Northern Ireland will gain better access to Heathrow’s global network. Business leaders across the UK welcome the inclusive growth model.

easyJet (U2) plans to scale operations at Heathrow. The carrier sees more competition and lower fares ahead. This may reshape Heathrow’s accessibility for budget travellers.

Surface transport links will also improve. A new road tunnel, two parkways, and upgraded rail connections are planned. Walking and cycling paths will promote greener journeys.

Construction and operations will generate tens of thousands of jobs. Around 60 percent of supply chain spending will support regions beyond London. A community fund will assist local residents.

Heathrow Airport Aims Long-Term Sustainability

Heathrow aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Since 2019, it has cut flight emissions by 10 percent and ground emissions by 15 percent. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and clean energy drive this strategy.

Redesigned airspace will reduce delays and holding patterns. This improves punctuality and cuts emissions. Current air quality monitors remain within legal limits.

Heathrow has reduced its noise footprint by 41 percent since 2006. Expansion will standardise flight paths and lessen disruption. Environmental assessments will continue throughout the project.

New terminals will adopt energy-efficient designs and support electric vehicles. SAF infrastructure and low-emission ground equipment will be built in. These steps align with the UK’s climate goals.

Heathrow will engage closely with regulators and communities. It aims to set global standards in green aviation. Ongoing consultation will ensure progress is transparent.

Government Support and Industry Backing

Business groups strongly support the expansion. The Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, and Federation of Small Businesses see trade and regional growth opportunities. They call it a national priority.

easyJet (U2) endorses the expansion plans. The airline expects better fares and more consumer choice. Heathrow could soon serve more price-sensitive travellers.

Regional airports like Newquay (NQY) back the third runway. They ask for fair slot allocation and affordability. Regional involvement will remain key during planning.

The Heathrow Business Coalition, which includes exporters and logistics firms, supports the project. Members say it will boost competitiveness and supply chains. They view extra capacity as essential.

CEO Thomas Woldbye confirmed Heathrow is ready to proceed with approval. Past projects like Terminals 2 and 5 finished on time and on budget. A government decision is expected by September to maintain timelines.

If you’ve ever wondered why airports seem busier every year, you’re not alone. Boeing, one of the world’s leading aircraft manufacturers, predicts that air travel isn’t just holding steady—it’s about to skyrocket. The company’s latest outlook suggests that by 2044, there could be as many as 50,000 planes crisscrossing our skies. That’s a staggering leap from today’s fleet, and it raises a big question: what’s fueling this massive growth?

How Are Emerging Markets Changing the Aviation Game?

Let’s start with a simple truth: the world is getting more connected, and much of that growth is happening outside traditional aviation powerhouses. Countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are investing heavily in airports, runways, and air traffic control systems. These aren’t just vanity projects—they’re laying the groundwork for millions of new travelers to take to the skies.

Take India, for example. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), India is on track to become the world’s third-largest aviation market by 2026. Airports are expanding, new routes are opening, and low-cost carriers are making air travel accessible to a broader swath of the population. Similar stories are unfolding in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Nigeria, where rising incomes and urbanization are turning air travel from a luxury into a necessity.

What Role Does the Expanding Global Middle Class Play?

Here’s where things get interesting. The global middle class is booming—especially in Asia. The Brookings Institution estimates that by 2030, two-thirds of the world’s middle class will live in Asia. More disposable income means more people booking flights for business, leisure, and family visits.

This isn’t just about vacations, either. As people move into higher income brackets, their expectations shift. They want faster, more convenient ways to travel, both domestically and internationally. Airlines are responding with new routes, better service, and more competitive prices. The result? Air travel becomes the default choice, not just for the wealthy, but for millions of everyday families.

Are Airlines and Airports Ready for This Surge?

Growth is exciting, but it comes with challenges. Airports in rapidly developing regions are racing to keep up with demand. In China alone, more than 200 new airports are planned or under construction, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Meanwhile, airlines are placing record orders for new aircraft, betting big on the future.

But it’s not just about building runways and buying planes. There’s a pressing need for skilled pilots, air traffic controllers, and maintenance crews. The aviation industry is investing in training programs and technology to ensure safety and efficiency keep pace with expansion. Boeing’s own projections highlight a need for over 600,000 new pilots globally by 2040. That’s a hiring spree of epic proportions.

How Will This Boom Affect the Environment?

It’s impossible to talk about aviation’s future without addressing its environmental impact. More planes in the sky mean more carbon emissions—unless the industry adapts. The good news? Airlines and manufacturers are making real strides. Sustainable aviation fuel, lighter materials, and more efficient engines are all part of the equation.

Boeing, for instance, is investing heavily in research to reduce the carbon footprint of its next-generation aircraft. Meanwhile, international agreements like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) are pushing airlines to offset emissions and invest in greener technologies. It’s not a perfect solution yet, but the momentum is real.

What Does This Mean for Travelers and the Industry?

For travelers, the coming decades promise more choices, better prices, and new destinations. Imagine flying direct from a mid-sized city in Africa to Southeast Asia, or hopping on a budget flight across South America with ease. The democratization of air travel is a win for global connectivity, business, and cultural exchange.

For the industry, the stakes are high. Companies that adapt quickly—by embracing new technologies, investing in sustainability, and training the next generation of aviation professionals—will thrive. Those that don’t may struggle to keep up with the pace of change.

The big takeaway? The future of air travel isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments. Start with one change this week, and you’ll likely spot the difference by month’s end. The sky’s not the limit; it’s just the beginning.",https://www.globalvillagespace.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/soaring-skies-ahead-as-global-air-travel-set-to-surge-with-expanding-middle-class.avif,N,,2025-08-02 13:56:53.282973

North American airlines have emerged as pioneers in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry. Their leadership is visible in long-term SAF offtake agreements, early infrastructure deployment, and corporate partnerships that foster demand aggregation. As of 2025, five major carriers United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Air Canada, and JetBlue have committed to substantial SAF volumes, illustrating the increasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size in the region.

United Airlines leads the charge with a total of 2.9 billion gallons in SAF commitments. Notably, a landmark 1 billion gallon agreement with Cemvita marks a shift toward synthetic fuel pathways. United plans to use 10 million gallons of SAF in 2025, tripling its 2022 volume.

Delta Air Lines has secured offtake agreements totaling 910 million gallons 525 million from Gevo and 385 million from DG Fuels targeting a 5% SAF blend by 2030.

American Airlines has inked deals worth 620 million gallons through 2030. Its partnerships with Aemetis and Gevo include annual deliveries beginning in 2024, reinforcing its strategic SAF ambitions.

Air Canada will deploy 77.6 million liters (20.5 million US gallons) of Neste SAF in 2025, representing 1% of its fuel consumption, with further growth expected under Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations.

JetBlue, while smaller in scope, has launched a 1 million gallon per year SAF program at JFK, marking the first regular SAF supply at that major hub.

These examples reflect growing Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share among North American airlines.

Barriers to Scaling SAF

Despite remarkable progress, the SAF Industry faces systemic barriers that hinder broader adoption. Chief among them are cost premiums, feedstock limitations, infrastructure inadequacies, and inconsistent policy frameworks.

SAF remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel often 2 to 5 times the cost. In Europe, SAF blending mandates are projected to add $1.7 billion in airline costs in 2025 alone. These price disparities reduce competitiveness, especially for carriers operating on tight margins.

Feedstock availability poses another critical challenge. Most SAF today is produced using the HEFA pathway, reliant on used cooking oil and animal fats. However, this feedstock stream is expected to plateau at 2 million tonnes by 2030. Advanced feedstocks like municipal solid waste and cellulosic biomass require intricate logistics and higher processing costs.

Infrastructure remains a bottleneck. Only 25% of North American airports are SAF-capable, and retrofitting facilities is capital intensive. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market cannot scale unless distribution and blending infrastructure is widely available.

Finally, regulatory fragmentation further complicates progress. The U.S. SAF Grand Challenge sets ambitious voluntary goals, but lacks federal blending mandates. Tax credits under Section 45Z expire between 2024–2027, creating long-term uncertainty. Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations are more prescriptive, requiring 1 billion liters of SAF by 2030, but regional differences remain.

Opportunities for Acceleration

Despite these challenges, significant opportunities exist to catalyze SAF Market growth across North America.

Emerging SAF pathways, such as Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), promise dramatic lifecycle emissions reductions. United Airlines is investing in Twelve’s CO2-to-fuel technology, which can reduce emissions by up to 90%. DG Fuels is developing timber waste-to-SAF conversion plants with 85% reduction potential.

Corporate demand aggregation is gaining traction. Programs like Eco-Skies Alliance enable cargo and logistics companies (e.g., SEKO Logistics) to co-invest in SAF, creating reliable demand pools and de-risking project financing.

Policy incentives are proving effective. California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits and Michigan’s $1.50/gallon SAF tax credit stimulate regional production and feedstock utilization, helping to expand Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share.

Technological integration also supports scaling. Companies like LanzaJet are deploying modular ATJ facilities to lower capital expenditure. Digital platforms, such as SAFc-Registry powered by Chooose, streamline SAF transaction certification and traceability.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

North American policy is evolving to support the SAF Industry, but further alignment is needed to create long-term stability.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge outlines a goal of 3 billion gallons of annual SAF production by 2030, scaling to 35 billion by 2050. The Inflation Reduction Act offers Section 45Z tax credits of $1.25–$1.75/gallon, contingent on emissions reductions of over 50%.

State-level programs complement federal efforts. California’s LCFS rewards carbon intensity reductions, while Michigan offers per-gallon credits to SAF producers. However, without a federal mandate, airlines and producers still face demand uncertainty.

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations offer more structured targets: 1 billion liters by 2030 (approximately 10% of aviation fuel) and up to 25% by 2035. Provincial mandates and incentives further support regional development, boosting Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Trends.

JetBlue Airways: Operating the first regular JFK SAF supply through a 1 million gallon/year partnership with Valero and World Fuel Services, JetBlue also promotes corporate sustainability programs.

Strategic Recommendations

To expand the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size and achieve net-zero aviation by 2050, coordinated efforts are required:

Establish a federal blending mandate in the U.S., starting at 2% in 2025 and scaling to 10% by 2030. This would create predictable demand and incentivize private investment.

Extend and expand tax incentives under Section 45Z and explore Contracts for Difference (CfDs) to reduce financial risk for producers.

Invest in advanced feedstocks such as cellulosic biomass, algae, and direct air capture through grants and tax credit mechanisms.

Fund infrastructure retrofits at major hubs to enhance SAF blending and storage capabilities.

Strengthen partnerships between airlines, SAF producers, and corporations to promote collaborative offtake agreements and boost Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share.

Fueling the Future of Flight

North American airlines are setting the global pace in the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel. Through bold commitments, innovative partnerships, and policy advocacy, they are building the foundation for a low-carbon aviation sector. Yet realizing the full potential of the SAF Market depends on overcoming high costs, scaling feedstock supply, harmonizing policy, and upgrading infrastructure. As these elements align, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry will be poised for exponential growth, enabling aviation to meet its climate goals and reshaping the future of flight.

Investment proposal

The £49bn investment consists of three main elements: £21bn (US$27bn) for the new runway and airfield infrastructure (up from £14bn in 2018 due to construction inflation); £12bn (US$16bn) for new terminal and stand capacity – the brand new T5X; and £15bn (US$20bn) to modernize the current airport by expanding Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3. The blueprint details a north-western runway up to 3,500m, and increased capacity to accommodate up to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers.

According to the airport, a third runway and supporting infrastructure could be ready within a decade, with the full investment across all terminals taking place over the coming decades.

A new road tunnel and plans for two dedicated parkways and improvements to the country’s busiest bus and coach station have also been proposed. Heathrow’s proposals include more choice and capacity on public transportation, such as enhanced rail capacity and walking and cycling routes, reducing local and environmental impacts.

Advantages

The airport says the expansion would add approximately 30 extra daily domestic routes connections and a better selection of flight times to the most popular destinations. Terminals will be more spacious and accessible, and the once-in-a-generation redesign of the airfield will enable flights to take off more quickly.

Once completed, Heathrow’s plans are projected to grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP, adding 50% capacity to the country’s most valuable trading port – already enabling more than £200bn (US$260bn) of annual trade. Expanding Heathrow is expected to deliver new long-haul routes to growing economies and increase cargo capacity by 50%, expanding trading opportunities for businesses of all sizes.

Local employment

The airport has highlighted the tens of thousands of employment opportunities during design, construction and operation. Meanwhile 60% of the wider supply chain spend will go to companies outside London and the South-East. A community fund is being proposed for the airport’s nearest neighbors.

Thomas Woldbye, CEO of Heathrow, said, “It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit-for-purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilize and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country; it is time to clear the way for take-off.”

Next steps

If the UK government implements the necessary policy changes, Heathrow will consult with airlines, the local community, local authorities, businesses and others from next year. A planning application is expected to be submitted in 2028.

The Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, Make UK, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, stated, “The UK business community supports the expansion of Heathrow with a third runway – an investment in the nation’s future. The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs and driving skills across the country.”

Kenton Jarvis, CEO of easyJet, added, “Expansion at Heathrow will provide consumer and economic benefits and represents a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers.”

Sustainable growth

With this proposal, Heathrow has confirmed its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and set targets on noise reduction and air quality. So far, the airport has cut 10% of its carbon from flights since 2019, and 15% of its carbon emissions on the ground. It has plans to further ramp up its world leadership on the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Heathrow’s noise footprint has also reduced by 41% since 2006 and all air quality monitors around the airport are meeting limits.

This project, valued at £21 billion, represents a direct commitment to the economic growth of the UK and its leadership in global connectivity.

More Flights, Better Prices, and Greater Connectivity

The expansion would allow the airport to handle up to 756,000 flights and 150 million passengers annually, unlocking at least 30 new daily routes and strengthening domestic connections. This will translate into more destination options, better schedules, and more competitive fares, thanks to increased competition among airlines.

Additionally, a complete transformation of the airfield is planned, promising faster takeoffs and more spacious, accessible terminals. The new “T5X” terminal, along with the expansion of Terminal 2 and the construction of three satellite terminals, are part of this ambitious overhaul.

Direct and Distributed Economic Impact

The expansion would add 0.43% to the UK’s GDP, with 60% of that benefit generated outside London and the Southeast. Heathrow, already considered the country’s most valuable port with over £200 billion in annual trade, would increase its cargo capacity by 50%.

→ Global Passenger Demand Grows in June, but at a Slower Pace, IATA says

The impact will also be felt in employment: tens of thousands of jobs will be created during the design, construction, and operational phases. Sixty percent of the supply chain spending will benefit companies located outside the London metropolitan area, reinforcing the national character of the project.

Environmental Commitment: Carbon, Noise, and Accessibility

Heathrow is not only betting on growth but also on doing so sustainably. The proposal includes:

A goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

A 10% reduction in flight emissions since 2019 and a 15% reduction in ground emissions.

Promotion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use.

A 41% reduction in noise footprint since 2006.

Compliance with air quality limits at all monitoring stations.

Additionally, significant improvements in public transport and airport access will be implemented: increased rail capacity, dedicated cycling and pedestrian routes, a new road tunnel, two dedicated parkways, and upgrades to the busiest bus and coach station in the country.

A Viable, Backed, and Ready Proposal

The plan includes a northwest runway of up to 3,500 meters, an infrastructure already backed by Parliament. Unlike other proposals, Heathrow has years of prior studies and engagement, enabling it to meet government deadlines and begin investments this year, provided the regulatory framework allows it.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye was emphatic: “It’s now or never. We are operating at capacity, affecting trade and connectivity. If the government gives the green light and provides the right regulatory support, we are ready to take off with investments across the country.”

Timeline and Next Steps

2025: Consultation with airlines, local authorities, and the community.

2028: Formal submission of the planning application.

2029: Expected approval.

Next decade: Third runway operational.

The project has the backing of chambers of commerce across the country, unions, educators, and construction sector businesses. All agree that this is a historic opportunity to strengthen access to global markets and secure the UK’s economic future.

An Airport at Capacity, a Nation at Risk

The expansion plans aim to enable Heathrow to give passengers more choice – at least 30 new daily routes, extra domestic connections and a better selection of flight times to the most popular destinations. Once completed, Heathrow’s plans aim to grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP, add 50% capacity to the country’s most valuable trading port – already enabling more than £200bn of annual trade – while keeping its global competitive edge.

The blueprint submitted to Government today includes:

A north-western runway up to 3,500m – a design that already has Parliamentary support

Increased capacity to serve up to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers

A brand-new terminal ‘T5X’, expanding Terminal 2 and three new satellite terminals

The investment consists of three main elements: £21 billion for the new runway and airfield infrastructure (up from £14 billion in 2018 due to construction inflation), £12billion for new terminal and stand capacity – the brand new T5X – and £15 billion for modernising the current airport through expanding Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3.

A third runway and supporting infrastructure can be ready within a decade and the full investment across all terminals would take place over the coming decades.

Heathrow’s proposals include more choice and capacity on public transport, such as enhanced rail capacity and walking and cycling routes, reducing local and environmental impacts. A new road tunnel, plans for two dedicated parkways and improvements to the country’s busiest bus and coach station will make it easier to reach the airport.

Crucially, Heathrow is confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and has a deliverable plan to get there, as well as setting targets on noise reduction and air quality. The airport is already ahead of target on its decarbonisation journey, cutting carbon from flights by around 10% since 2019, and carbon on the ground by 15% and has plans to ramp up further its world leadership on the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Heathrow’s noise footprint has reduced by 41% since 2006 and all air quality monitors around the airport are meeting limits. A third runway and redesigned airspace will give communities and passengers more certainty and reliability on flight paths.

There will be tens of thousands of employment opportunities during design, construction and operation, unlocking lifelong careers for those who live closest. Meanwhile 60% of the wider supply chain spend will go to companies outside London and the South-East, a truly national endeavour.

For the airport's nearest neighbours, a community fund is being proposed, and Heathrow will continue to engage on how to be a better neighbour to its local community.

An appropriate regulatory framework needs to be put in place – one that encourages growth and investment while remaining affordable for customers – to secure many tens of billions of private capital from equity shareholders and from debt investors.

Feedback from the Government will be required by September to stay on track for Ministers’ set timeline.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said: “It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from Government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit for purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country, it is time to clear the way for take-off.”

If the Government implements the necessary policy changes, Heathrow plans to consult with airlines, the local community, local authorities, businesses and others from next year. A planning application is expected to be submitted in 2028.

Support for Heathrow expansion comes from Chambers of Commerce across the whole of the UK, businesses wanting better access to global markets, trade unions reaffirming the career opportunities, while local Chambers of Commerce, educators and construction firms are ready to roll up the sleeves and get to work.

Heathrow has stressed that its role in the country’s economy is unique. Today it connects UK exporters to 92% of the world’s economy in a direct flight. It argues that expanding Heathrow will deliver new long-haul routes to growing economies and increase cargo capacity by 50%, expanding trading opportunities for businesses of all sizes and that without action, the UK is at risk of losing its global aviation hub status in the face of growing competition from European hubs. While international competitors have room to grow, Heathrow is already at capacity. Without expansion the UK’s hub will fall behind, harming opportunities for the country’s economy.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander welcomed the initial proposals for Heathrow expansion. She said: “I am pleased to have received the initial Heathrow expansion proposals - a significant step towards unlocking growth, creating jobs, and delivering vital national infrastructure to drive forward our Plan for Change.

“We'll consider the proposals carefully over the summer so that we can begin a review of the Airports National Policy Statement later this year.”

Kenton Jarvis, CEO, easyJet said: ""The UK business community supports the expansion of Heathrow with a third runway — an investment in the nation's future. The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs, and driving skills across the country.""

“Expansion at Heathrow will provide consumer and economic benefits and represents a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers.”

Amy Smith, Managing Director (Interim), Cornwall Airport Newquay, said: “Cornwall Airport Newquay supports infrastructure development that enables true regional connectivity.

Therefore, while it’s chemically synthesized, it is certifiable as sustainable aviation fuel under the ATJ-SPK pathway.","Gevo has long explored various processes, including synthetic biology and industrial chemistry, to develop cost-competitive pathways to create SAF (synthetic aviation fuel) using alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) methods and exploring the benefits of bio-based feedstocks.

Depending on the feedstocks used and the efficiencies built into the production process, our SAF can offer enough carbon abatement and sustainability as attributes that it can be classified as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Since it is ready to replace petroleum-based jet fuel, our ATJ SAF is demonstrated to meet or exceed the standards in ASTM D1655/7566 specification, which specifies blending up to 50 percent (though we’ve flown test aircraft on 100-percent SAF). Here’s a breakdown:

For flash point, the standard stipulates a 38 degrees C minimum, and ATJ is well within acceptable range at 45 to 50 degrees C.

Both also pass the standard for thermal oxidation stability.

For freezing point, the standard requires -40 degrees C maximum for Jet A and -47 degrees C for Jet A-1, and Jet A-1 complies with -50 degrees C, while ATJ is -78 degrees C.

The energy density standard is 42.8 MJ/kg minimum, and Jet A-1 complies with 42.9 MJ/kg, while ATJ has 44.0 MJ/kg.

The total sulfur content standard is 0.3 percent max, while Jet A-1 comes in at 0.05 percent and ATJ rates at less than 0.00 percent.

SAF Opportunities

While the terms Synthetic Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are often used interchangeably, there are important distinctions. Here’s a helpful breakdown of the determining qualifications for each label:

Synthetic Aviation Fuel

Synthetic aviation fuel refers to hydrocarbons created through chemical synthesis. These fuels can be derived from a wide range of sources, not all of which are sustainable, and have the following characteristics:

Usually considered sustainable aviation fuel only if the production process meets sustainability criteria.

Source materials also are a factor in determining the level of sustainability—not considered inherently sustainable unless made from green H₂ and captured CO₂.

Often made from fossil sources, such as coal or natural gas

Examples include:

PtL (Power-to-Liquid) using electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis and then combine it with carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize various liquid hydrocarbons fuels.

CTL (Coal-to-Liquid) using coal

GTL (Gas-to-Liquid) using natural gas

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is an umbrella term for aviation fuels that reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. They must meet sustainability criteria, including feedstock origin and carbon intensity over the lifecycle of the product, and have the following characteristics:

Derived from renewable or waste-based feedstocks.

Must reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by at least 50 percent (per ICAO CORSIA standards).

Examples include:

HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) from used cooking oil or animal fats

FT-SPK (Fischer Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) produced through a process called Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which converts synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, into liquid hydrocarbons from solid waste or biomass

ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet) converts alcohols like ethanol and butanol, derived from renewable sources, into sustainable aviation fuel

PtL (Power-to-Liquid) use renewable electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis and then combine it with carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize various liquid hydrocarbons fuels.

Summary of SAF-Type Differences:

How Does Gevo Fit in the World of SAF?

Gevo Inc. is a U.S.-based company that produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and they fall into the “Alcohol-to-Jet” (ATJ) category, developing both ATJ and Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) pathways.

Gevo SAF at a Glance

Why Gevo’s SAF Is Both Synthetic and Sustainable

Gevo’s process synthesizes jet fuel molecules, but from biologically derived alcohols.

Since the source is renewable (plant-based sugars from regeneratively grown corn) and the process is engineered to minimize emissions, Gevo’s fuel meets sustainability criteria.

Therefore, while it’s chemically synthesized, it is certifiable as sustainable aviation fuel under the ATJ-SPK pathway.

In 2024, Enap oil production in Chile was 23,000boe/d (20,000boe/d gas and the balance crude).","Sustainable fuels, refinery flexibility, midstream and upstream are focus areas of Chile's state oil company Enap, which plans to invest US$3.78bn in 2025-29, up from US$3.50bn in its previous five-year plan.

Enap, whose bottom line climbed 84% year-on-year in January-June to US$318mn, has earmarked around 70% of its multibillion-dollar war chest to projects, with the balance assigned for maintenance.

Profit growth drivers were increased sales of added-value products, logistics optimization and lower financial costs linked to a debt-reduction process.

Sustainable fuels

In terms of energy diversification, Enap CEO Julio Friedmann, in response to a BNamericas question during a results presentation, said the company was working on three fronts: renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green hydrogen.

Enap this year announced the launch of a renewable diesel pilot project, employing used cooking oils and infrastructure at its Aconcagua refinery in Valparaíso region. The mining industry was an offtaker of initial production last half, for usage in buses and trucks.

A next phase would involve building a standalone plant.

Echoing comments made by Enap chair Gloria Maldonado earlier in the week, Friedmann said long-term supply contracts would be needed to unlock further investment, adding that renewable diesel production is not something still stuck on the drawing board.

Friedmann said: ""We've got the capacity, today, to produce this renewable diesel; with successful sales and the agreement of long-term supply contracts, we'll be able to finalize the business case to justify the eventual construction of a plant dedicated to renewable diesel

""Depending on sales volumes, on how the market grows, we could, here, think about directing some of the investment plan to increase capacity, dedicated exclusively to renewable diesel.""

In parallel, Enap is sharpening its focus on SAF. The company already supplies the local aviation market with conventional jet fuel.

SAF development would follow a similar trajectory as that of renewable diesel, said Friedmann, adding that conceptual trial work was planned this half.

""We're in talks with airlines, which have expressed interest in the matter,"" Friedmann said.

He said development of this product, like renewable diesel, is not something that is a long way over the horizon.

The UN's civil aviation standards and planning agency, ICAO, is due to publish a Chilean SAF feasibility report this half, BNamericas reported recently. The airline industry aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which will require a major uptick in SAF usage.

In terms of green hydrogen, Enap has begun ground preparation work at its Cabo Negro industrial site in Magallanes region, where a 1.2MW electrolyzer is due for installation by the end of the year. Output from the US$12mn wind-powered pilot facility, whose construction contract was awarded to Germany's Neuman & Esser, will initially be used in Enap industrial processes, with scope to potentially deploy it elsewhere in the region. Enap staff are receiving technical training.

The Enap facility will join HIF's Haru Oni e-fuels demonstration plant, also in Magallanes.

Refining

Another major pillar is refinery modernization and operational flexibility work, with goals including boosting capacity to process a wider range of crude.

In terms of flexibility, Friedmann referred to the need to mitigate global price and product volatility: ""So we've invested, and that's how it's going to continue. For example, we call it a retrofit – replacing some of the internal components of existing equipment so that we can, for instance, process a wider range of crude oils.""

Logistics, exports

Increasing logistics efficiency is also a key pillar. Enap has 11 ships and four maritime terminals, along with storage infrastructure.

""We're going to place a strong emphasis on modernizing our logistics infrastructure,"" Friedmann said. ""We want it to be more efficient, whether through our own investment plan or through partnerships with third parties we're working with. There's nothing we can announce at this time, as it always involves ongoing discussions and confidentiality agreements, but it's something we're actively working on as well.""

In the sphere of logistics efficiency, Enap is seeking the environmental green light to carry out a US$60mn dredging project at its San Vicente crude and fuel terminal in Biobío region to support the access of larger crude carriers.

""Our investment plan takes into account this dredging work,"" said Friedmann, who added work was underway to boost operational flexibility of the terminal.

This falls under a wider plan to have capacity to potentially export crude. Enap has ramped up oil imports from Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale play via the 110,000b/d Otasa duct, in which it is a stakeholder, along with YPF and Chevron.

In May, 12,000m3/d (75,477b/d) was exported to Enap's Biobío region refinery via the Otasa pipeline, according to data from Argentina's federal energy department.

About 30% of crude refined in Chile today comes from Vaca Muerta. Enap will retain capacity to obtain crude from diverse sources, such as Brazil and Ecuador.

A potential Otasa capacity expansion is being considered.

Upstream

In Chile, Enap operates in the upstream segment in Magallanes region, where the gas it produces supplies local offtakers, among them methanol producer Methanex.

A chunk of cash is earmarked for keeping gas flowing and replacing reserves both in Chile and elsewhere. After exiting Argentina, in terms of its international upstream footprint, Enap today has assets in Ecuador and Egypt.

Friedmann said: ""Part of the investment plan also involves Magallanes and ensuring the long-term supply for that region. Remember, that region is 100% dependent on natural gas production, and also Methanex, which is a private company.""

He added: ""And in our international operations, we've also made it a priority to see how we can responsibly replace reserves – whether through organic or inorganic growth – and that may also require a portion of our investment plan.""

At the end of December, Enap's total reserves stood at 121Mboe, chiefly spread across Chile and Ecuador. In 2024, Enap oil production in Chile was 23,000boe/d (20,000boe/d gas and the balance crude).

Refining capacity is around 224,000b/d, spread across three facilities.",https://cdnimg.bnamericas.com/tHTLxnvmPqLfzCmnIVzZTEwOUWmndaNZJhPnODUpmVSceUQWyUKZZmkzzbRpHroo.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 17:56:33.050738

As the UK government weighs final approval by September 2025, investors and policymakers must assess how this £49 billion endeavor could reshape asset values, industrial demand, and economic connectivity across the country.

Strategic Implications for Real Estate Markets

Heathrow's expansion is already triggering a seismic shift in the West London industrial real estate landscape. Over 850,000 sq. ft. of industrial space within the development zone faces potential displacement, forcing occupiers to relocate to areas like Slough and Reading. This migration is tightening supply in these hubs, driving industrial rents upward. For instance, Slough currently commands £23–£28 per sq. ft., while Park Royal and Uxbridge see rates above £30 per sq. ft. Analysts project further increases as demand intensifies, creating a compelling case for investors to target logistics and warehousing assets in these regions.

The ripple effects extend beyond commercial property. As businesses and their workforces relocate, residential demand in Slough and Reading is likely to rise, buoyed by improved transport links and infrastructure upgrades. While the government has yet to finalize flight paths, the anticipation of increased economic activity alone could spur speculative development in these areas. Investors should monitor local planning decisions and housing supply trends, as residential property values may outpace national averages over the next five years.

Aviation and Environmental Considerations

Heathrow's third runway aims to elevate the UK's global aviation dominance, supporting up to 756,000 flights annually and connecting 92% of the world's economy to the UK. This expansion aligns with the government's broader Airports National Policy Statement, which prioritizes connectivity and economic growth. However, the project faces scrutiny over its carbon footprint. Heathrow's net-zero pledge by 2050 hinges on aggressive adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which currently accounts for less than 1% of jet fuel. The UK's £63 million Advanced Fuels Fund in 2025-26 is a step forward, but scalability remains a challenge.

Investors in the aviation sector must balance the short-term gains from increased passenger and freight traffic against long-term environmental risks. Airlines operating at Heathrow, including British Airways and easyJet, may benefit from expanded routes but could face pressure to offset emissions through SAF investments or carbon credits.

Regional Economic Growth and Diversification

The project's economic benefits are projected to extend beyond London, with 60% of the GDP uplift expected in regions like the Southeast. This aligns with the UK's “levelling up” agenda, aiming to reduce regional disparities. For instance, the relocation of the M25 motorway to a tunnel under the new runway could catalyze industrial growth in nearby areas, while the £15 billion modernization of existing infrastructure will create jobs and stimulate demand for construction materials.

Competing proposals, such as the Arora Group's shorter runway, highlight the government's dilemma between cost efficiency and long-term capacity. Investors should closely follow the September 2025 decision, as it will determine the pace and scale of economic activity.

Investment Opportunities and Risks

Industrial Real Estate: Focus on logistics hubs in Slough, Reading, and Uxbridge, where demand is surging. Consider REITs or private equity funds targeting UK industrial assets.

Infrastructure Providers: Companies involved in airport construction, such as Balfour Beatty or VINCI, could see increased contracts.

Sustainable Aviation: Invest in SAF producers or airlines prioritizing green technology, though this sector remains high-risk.

Regional Development: Monitor freeport-linked projects in Thames, Liverpool, and Teesside, which align with the government's industrial strategy.

Conclusion

Heathrow's third runway is a transformative project with the potential to unlock £49 billion in economic value and reshape the UK's real estate and aviation sectors. While environmental and political challenges persist, the project's strategic importance for global connectivity and regional growth cannot be overstated. Investors who position themselves early in logistics hubs and sustainable aviation may reap significant rewards, provided they navigate the uncertainties of regulatory outcomes and market dynamics. As the UK charts its post-Brexit economic path, Heathrow's expansion offers a rare opportunity to align infrastructure investment with long-term strategic goals.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 04:56:47.998656

The airport says the project is “shovel-ready”, with many technical studies and consultations already undertaken. If Government feedback is received by September, Heathrow expects to begin wider engagement with airlines, local authorities, businesses and communities from 2026, and submit a formal planning application by 2028.

Heathrow estimates the expansion would contribute around 0.43% to UK GDP, with 60% of economic benefits occurring outside London and the South East. The airport also expects to create employment opportunities through construction and operations, including across its national supply chain.

Additional capacity is intended to support up to 30 new destinations and strengthen domestic connectivity. Heathrow claims increased competition from more airlines operating at the airport would offer passengers a wider choice and could place downward pressure on fares.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said:

It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from Government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit for purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country; it is time to clear the way for take-off.

Transport and Environmental Commitments

Despite the controversy of the third-runway plans, the proposals include commitments to the environment and surrounding transport networks. These include improvements to surface transport connections, such as rail capacity enhancements, a new road tunnel, two new parkways, and expanded walking and cycling routes. Plans also involve upgrades to Heathrow’s bus and coach station to improve access for passengers and airport staff.

Environmental measures form part of the submission, including a target for net zero emissions by 2050. Heathrow reports it has already reduced carbon emissions from aircraft by 10% and ground operations by 15% compared with 2019 levels. It plans further use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and airspace redesigns intended to improve reliability and reduce community disruption.

The airport’s noise footprint has reportedly reduced by 41% since 2006, and all current air quality monitoring stations are said to be within legal limits.

Heathrow is now awaiting the Government’s response to keep the project aligned with their proposed roadmap. The airport operator has said it is ready to begin early-stage investment and supply chain mobilisation before the end of this year, subject to policy clarity and regulatory alignment.

The total 49 billion GBP investment comprises:

21 billion GBP for the runway and associated airfield infrastructure

12 billion GBP for the new terminal and additional stand capacity

15 billion GBP for modernisation of existing infrastructure, including a major redevelopment of Terminal 2 and phased closure of Terminal 3

The figures include inflationary increases since previous estimates in 2018 and are subject to adjustment as design and regulatory processes progress.

In this interview, Rebina Pozole, Head of Sustainability at Deutsche Aircraft, shares how the company is tackling sustainability challenges through smarter aircraft design, fuel experimentation, and strategic partnerships-with the D328eco aircraft leading the charge.

“We’ve always reduced fuel for economic reasons-now we’re doing it for environmental ones.”

Pozole explains that while long-term innovation is crucial, OEMs have a responsibility to pursue near-term, feasible solutions. For Deutsche Aircraft, this includes improving aerodynamics, weight, and engine efficiency while also testing alternative fuel types like hydrogen, batteries, and more sustainable hydrocarbon use.

“There aren’t that many energy carriers we can use in aviation. We need to explore realistic alternatives-and SAF is one of them.”

She highlights two tracks of experimentation:

Applied tech testing, like flights using zero-aromatics synthetic fuels

Research-based experimentation, exploring what may be possible in the future

One major milestone? The upcoming D328eco, scheduled for entry into service in late 2027:

“We’re on track. Seeing the aircraft take shape in the hangar-it’s really exciting.”

Pozole also dives into the critical need for deep, technical collaboration between OEMs, fuel producers, and other ecosystem players:

“It’s not just cooperation for the sake of it. We need to understand each other’s technical and business constraints-something we never had to do before.”

Looking ahead, Deutsche Aircraft is actively forming strategic partnerships with SAF producers to ensure their aircraft can fly with 100% PTL zero-aromatics fuel once it’s commercially available.

Questions asked include:

What role do OEMs play in the aviation industry’s sustainability journey?

The fuel was produced in Jülich, western Germany, using concentrated solar energy to power an innovative thermochemical process.
How does solar fuel work?
Unlike conventional biofuels, produced from organic waste, solar fuel from Synhelion is generated from a combination of solar heat, captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
According to the company, new solar fuel acquisitions are planned for next year, in partnership with SWISS and the Lufthansa Group.","The Swiss company Synhelion, a world leader in the production of synthetic solar fuels, delivered 190 liters of solar fuel to Hamburg Airport in Germany, marking the world's first use of a nearly CO₂-neutral synthetic fuel in commercial flight operations.

SWISS, a partner and investor in Synhelion since 2022, was the first airline to use the product, which covers around 7% of the energy required for a flight between Hamburg and Zurich.

The fuel was produced in Jülich, western Germany, using concentrated solar energy to power an innovative thermochemical process.

Synthetic crude oil, called syncrude, was processed in a refinery in northern Germany and subsequently integrated into the airport's conventional supply system, demonstrating that no modifications to the existing infrastructure are necessary to adopt this technology.

How does solar fuel work?

Unlike conventional biofuels, produced from organic waste, solar fuel from Synhelion is generated from a combination of solar heat, captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

The thermochemical process used by the company results in liquid fuels, such as kerosene, gasoline and diesel, with net CO₂ emissions up to 99% lower than those used in conventional fuels. fossil fuels.

The most significant innovation lies in the process's energy self-sufficiency: solar heat is stored and allows production to occur 24 hours a day, making the model scalable and less dependent on climate variations.

The future of solar flights

Although annual production is still modest, the growth potential is enormous. The DAWN demonstration plant, which began operations in late summer 2024, already produces limited quantities of fuel and is being expanded.

According to the company, new solar fuel acquisitions are planned for next year, in partnership with SWISS and the Lufthansa Group.

In the medium term, costs may still be reflected in the price of air tickets, but these values are expected to fall with increased production scale and the support of public policies.

Synhelion claims its technology is “drop-in,” meaning it is fully compatible with current engines and existing logistics infrastructure, which significantly facilitates its adoption.

In addition to aviation, the company also plans to distribute sustainable gasoline and diesel for land vehicles, ships and passenger buses at airports, as already planned for Zurich Airport from 2027.

Scaling and challenges

Despite the progress, expanding large-scale production still faces challenges. The biggest is the high investment cost of building plants capable of supplying the global market.

A recent example was the cancellation of the plant that was to be built in Spain, scheduled for 2027, due to difficulties in environmental licensing.

In response, Synhelion decided to expand its current facility in Jülich, building a plant approximately ten times larger. The goal is to reach annual production of 2030 tons by 100 with the future SHINE plant, the first truly competitive industrial-scale solar production complex.

Commitments to European sustainability

The initiative is in line with EU (European Union) targets, which require that, by 2050, 70% of flights on the continent use sustainable fuels.

From 2024, all airlines operating in the EU must ensure that at least 2% of the fuel used is SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), which represents around 1 million tonnes per year.

Rolls-Royce Aims Net Zero by 2050: Real Progress, Not Offsets

Rolls-Royce has made climate leadership a priority. It aims for net zero by 2050, not just in its operations but also across its products.

The company avoids relying on carbon offsets. Instead, it focuses on cutting emissions through innovation, efficient operations, and renewable fuels.

Here’s how it is cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its operations:

It targets a 46% emissions cut by 2030, based on 2019 levels. The goal is to reach net zero emissions from its operations by 2050. This includes emissions from engine testing, which have increased due to higher development activity.

The company plans to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in tests. They are shifting to clean power sources and installing batteries in locations like Friedrichshafen. Additionally, they are also buying renewable energy and focusing on efficiency improvements.

In 2024, total Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased to 301 ktCO2e. This rise includes a 55 ktCO2e jump in test-related emissions.

However, operational emissions dropped by 5 ktCO2e, a 3% decrease, which indicates progress.

Scope 3 Focus: Tackling Value Chain Emissions

Beyond direct emissions, Rolls-Royce is addressing Scope 3 emissions—especially from the use of its products (category 11) and purchased goods and services (category 1). These are major sources, with purchased goods accounting for 2.18 MtCO2e in 2024, around 2.5% of total emissions.

It is working with suppliers to set net zero targets, partnering with logistics firms for low-emission transport, and promoting resource efficiency to reduce waste.

Innovation for Cleaner Products

Rolls-Royce is investing significantly in future-ready, low-carbon products. They aim to ramp up their R&D spending on net-zero technologies by 75% this year.

Notable milestones include the UltraFan engine, a next-gen demonstrator with high fuel efficiency and SAF compatibility. All current in-production aero engines are certified to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel. The company’s SMR projects aim to deliver scalable, clean electricity to national grids.

These projects are vital for its net-zero strategy and essential for decarbonizing the heavy industry and global aviation sectors.

All in all, Rolls-Royce demonstrates that climate action and financial growth can be mutually beneficial. From record profits to world-class clean tech investments, Rolls-Royce exemplifies how legacy companies can become climate leaders even without carbon credits.

This can lead to new regional employment opportunities, enhanced energy security, and better use of our renewable and biomass resources.
Our methanol-to-jet fuel project highlights how we can deliver investment-ready, competitive infrastructure that aids decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.” This announcement builds on recent momentum for HAMR Energy, as it nears completion of a $10 million Series A funding round.","HAMR Energy, a prominent developer of low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF), has unveiled its intention to establish Australia’s first major methanol-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility. With an estimated investment of $700–800 million, the proposed facility is designed to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry while generating hundreds of new jobs across construction and long-term operations.

This milestone announcement comes after the successful completion of a comprehensive feasibility study, positioning the project as a critical step in HAMR Energy’s broader plan to harness new international regulations that permit the use of methanol as a feedstock in SAF production. Methanol, which can be derived from a variety of renewable sources, is emerging as a game-changer in aviation fuel development due to its scalability, versatility, and ability to serve as a drop-in fuel for existing aircraft infrastructure.

The proposed facility will utilize approximately 300,000 tonnes of low-carbon methanol—produced from forestry waste and green hydrogen at HAMR’s Portland Renewable Fuels project—to generate around 125 million litres of SAF annually. This output would be sufficient to decarbonize nearly 3.5 million economy-class flights between Sydney and Melbourne each year, helping to bridge the global SAF supply gap, which is projected to reach 10 million tonnes by 2030.

The feasibility study conducted by HAMR Energy identified refining technologies that offer a commercially viable path to converting methanol into SAF. The study also assessed critical project considerations such as access to renewable energy, proximity to key markets, and construction economics. Based on these findings, South Australia and Victoria have emerged as the most promising regions for establishing the new facility.

HAMR Energy's vertically integrated approach—encompassing the entire production chain from biomass to final fuel—enables it to maintain one of the industry's lowest production costs. This is particularly attractive to airlines and other SAF buyers that are urgently seeking affordable and scalable decarbonization solutions. The company has already secured supply agreements for limited renewable biomass feedstock, further enhancing project viability.

Co-founder David Stribley emphasized the national benefits of this initiative, stating, “With appropriate policy support, Australia is well-positioned to develop a globally competitive LCLF industry. This can lead to new regional employment opportunities, enhanced energy security, and better use of our renewable and biomass resources. Our methanol-to-jet fuel project highlights how we can deliver investment-ready, competitive infrastructure that aids decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.”

This announcement builds on recent momentum for HAMR Energy, as it nears completion of a $10 million Series A funding round.

In addition to advancing its strategic goal of maximizing value from existing assets, should the project proceed, RYAM would receive a license to GranBio’s latest-generation Celer2L™ yeast and AVAP technologies for ethanol and sugar production at its own facility, in partnership with GranBio - a meaningful step in diversifying into high-growth biofuel and biochemical markets.

“This MoU aligns with our strategy to unlock new value from our core assets and expand into renewable markets where our infrastructure and technical capabilities create a competitive advantage,” said De Lyle Bloomquist, President and CEO of RYAM. “GranBio brings world-class technology to this partnership, and together we’re exploring practical, scalable solutions to help decarbonize global aviation fuel markets.”

“I am very pleased to strengthen our collaboration with RYAM and work toward our joint goal of developing clean energy solutions, while improving the communities in which we work,” said Luiz Oliveira, CEO of GranBio. “At Jesup, we will leverage our complementary capabilities in the development of a cost-effective, scalable solution for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels.”

This first-of-its-kind project marks a major milestone in GranBio’s strategic goal of systematically scaling up SAF production, with strong potential for replication.

The due diligence is expected to conclude later this year, at which point both parties will determine next steps. The MoU underscores both companies’ commitment to sustainability, innovation, and the development of next-generation biomaterials and fuels.

Even before you play it, the World Peace Game offers you a fresh perspective simply by learning how it’s played.
The lesson of collective wisdom In a recent conversation, Executive Director of the World Peace Game Foundation Robin Klingler offered what just might be the most vital lesson the game shares.
Yet for many leaders, it’s a lesson overlooked and undervalued.
It’s never been true, but in an uncertain world, holding onto that expectation is a dangerous strategy.","Leaders aren’t typically known for playing games, but maybe it’s time they should, at least this one. It’s called the World Peace Game, and if you’re a leader with even the slightest interest in adaptability, resilience or how to grow the value of something, it’s time you had a look.

On its surface alone, two things immediately stand out. First, in no small way, the game is about dealing with uncertainty. The World Peace Game’s version takes the form of a hands-on political simulation made up of dozens of complex and interlocking problems — actual real-world problems that inhibit actual world peace. Within the game, players take on the roles of countries, international bodies, forces of nature and even ambiguity itself. Their objective is to solve every interlocking problem while leaving no player worse off at the end than they were at the start. The second and more bracing fact? The game was designed to be played by fourth graders.

Before you scoff at any of this or its relevance, you should know that the World Peace Game’s nine and ten-year-old players have more than once been invited to the Pentagon alongside the game’s creator, John Hunter, to consult with the secretary of defense and its generals about what they might learn from these short-in-stature but long-on-wisdom preteen leaders. If you’re a senior leader, those facts alone should have you asking, “What could this game teach me about how to lead better?”

A different view of leadership in uncertainty

Leading at any time is hard, but leading in uncertain times demands a new view. Uncertainty is every leader’s new abnormal, and in that unfamiliar terrain, the message is clear: What worked in the past won’t work now. What that means is that it’s high time you stopped looking in the usual places and to the usual suspects for leadership guidance.

Even before you play it, the World Peace Game offers you a fresh perspective simply by learning how it’s played. One awakening is learning who leads. Though the grown-ups (teachers and school administrators) choose the game, once the basic guidelines for play have been shared, the kids take over. You heard right. Those who by default and title typically lead literally step back and rely on those on the front lines to create, collaborate and solve. Across an intense week of play, the kids not only direct the game, they do it exceptionally, not just solving the challenges presented, but remarkably finding different ways to solve them every time.

The flipping of roles offers a powerful and uncommon chance for everyone to see bigger. It causes both students and teachers to revisit well-worn habits and see through new eyes. The approach quite naturally expands critical and creative thinking while supplanting black-and-white assumptions with a mindset of “what if …” There are countless other advantages and insights the game offers, yet even this one example alone stands in marked contrast to most real-world leadership. More than just a game, Hunter accurately describes it as “a flexible, renewable practice.”

The game teaches so much more, with many of those lessons easily gleaned by watching Hunter’s first TED Talk or reading his wonderfully titled book, World Peace and Other Fourth Grade Achievements. But whether you look further into this powerful game or not, there’s one lesson that must be shared here and now. It’s a lesson every leader in this new abnormal needs to embrace – not someday, but right now.

The lesson of collective wisdom

In a recent conversation, Executive Director of the World Peace Game Foundation Robin Klingler offered what just might be the most vital lesson the game shares. To her, it’s foundational and something she stays in touch with every day. Yet for many leaders, it’s a lesson overlooked and undervalued. “The Game doesn’t work without collective wisdom,” Klingler remarked. What’s obvious to her is hidden in plain sight for many leaders, in part because, despite these deeply uncertain times, we still carry around the mythology that leadership and the individual leader are one in the same. It’s never been true, but in an uncertain world, holding onto that expectation is a dangerous strategy.

The key to comfort with the unknown

More than just an insight about the World Peace Game, Klingler’s observation may just be the best advice any leader on any front can embrace if thriving in uncertain times is their goal. Indeed, collective wisdom and the range of knowledge and experience it implies have repeatedly been shown, including by Harvard Business Review, to make teams smarter, more resilient and perhaps most vital in uncertain times, “more likely to constantly reexamine facts and remain objective.” In short, more than a nice aphorism, Klingler’s insight is the fulcrum for the change leaders need and the key to the lasting success they seek. As Hunter says, the game is ultimately about learning to live and work comfortably in the unknown. Without collective wisdom, it’s a pretty tough lesson to master.

This agreement paves the way for jointly exploring the development of a small-scale commercial cellulosic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility, strategically co-located at RYAM’s Jesup, Georgia site.

The proposed project represents a forward-thinking initiative in the rapidly evolving clean energy sector. Under the terms of the MoU, GranBio will take the lead in this ambitious endeavor, deploying its cutting-edge proprietary AVAP® technology. This advanced process is designed to efficiently convert lignocellulosic biomass – a renewable resource derived from plant matter – into second-generation ethanol. This ethanol will then undergo further upgrading to produce SAF, a crucial component in the global effort to decarbonize the aviation industry. The produced SAF will be subsequently sold to an identified offtaker, ensuring a direct pathway to market.

A key advantage of this collaboration lies in its synergistic approach. The new facility is set to capitalize on RYAM’s extensive existing infrastructure at its Jesup plant. The project is poised to receive substantial financial backing, partially through a $100 million grant awarded to GranBio by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Beyond the immediate benefits of the SAF project, this MoU holds significant strategic implications for RYAM. Should the project successfully move forward, RYAM stands to gain a license to GranBio’s latest-generation Celer2L™ yeast and AVAP® technologies. This access would extend to both ethanol and sugar production at its own facility, in partnership with GranBio.

De Lyle Bloomquist, President and CEO of RYAM, emphasized the strategic alignment of this partnership, stating, “This MoU aligns with our strategy to unlock new value from our core assets and expand into renewable markets where our infrastructure and technical capabilities create a competitive advantage.

When we hire and train with sustainability in mind, we’re not just filling jobs, we’re helping aviation reach its net‑zero future.”

— Giovanna Mirabile

KALKARA, SOUTH EAST, MALTA, August 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As airlines work to cut carbon emissions and meet net-zero targets by 2050, one area is starting to gain more attention: human resources.

While much of the aviation industry’s climate focus has been on cleaner fuels and electric ground vehicles, experts say the people behind daily operations could play just as important a role. From hiring and training to digital systems and flexible work, HR departments are beginning to influence how airlines meet their environmental goals.

Aviation makes up about 2.5% of global carbon emissions, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). And with air travel expected to grow, reducing that number will require change across the entire industry, not just in engineering.

One growing trend is known as sustainability in aviation HR. This means bringing climate awareness into how companies hire, train, and manage staff. It includes looking for employees who understand environmental issues, offering training on topics like energy efficiency, and encouraging low-impact travel to and from work.

Some companies have already started making changes. For example, many airlines in Europe have moved support roles to remote or hybrid work models. This has led to fewer internal flights and commuting, helping cut travel-related emissions by up to 40%. A study from Cornell University and Microsoft in 2023 found that full-time remote work can reduce a worker’s carbon footprint by more than half. Even hybrid models can cut emissions by nearly 30%.

Digital tools are also making a difference. HR teams are switching from paper-based processes to cloud systems, electronic contracts, and online payroll. A 2024 report from the Global Sustainable Aviation Forum found that digital HR operations can lower administrative emissions by up to 30% over five years.

Some companies are also offering green onboarding. One large maintenance provider in the Middle East recently added a sustainability module to its new employee training. It covers things like sorting waste, saving energy, and using lower-emission transport options like e-bikes or carpooling. The company saw a 17% improvement in recycling and a 12% drop in energy use within a year.

As airlines invest more in clean technologies like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and electric equipment, they also need skilled people to manage those changes. HR teams are helping by quickly hiring and placing the right staff in new green projects. According to IATA, SAF use is expected to grow from less than 1% of fuel today to 10% by 2030, which means more training and hiring will be needed.

Aviation HR provider Aeroates is one example of a company helping airlines plan for this shift. They work with clients to add sustainability goals to job descriptions, build digital systems, and stay up to date with environmental rules and regulations.

There is also evidence that these changes are good for business. A 2025 survey by Deloitte found that 67% of airline executives saw better employee engagement when HR policies supported sustainability. More than half said their teams also became more efficient.

While aircraft design and clean fuel remain central to cutting emissions, many in the industry now believe people will play a bigger role than expected. Culture, behaviour, and day-to-day choices all matter, and that is where HR comes in.

With just 25 years left to hit net-zero targets, aviation companies are realising that sustainability needs to reach every part of the business. That includes the people who help it run every day. Human resources may not have been part of the climate conversation in the past, but it is becoming a key part of the solution.

The University of Sheffield is to lead a new £1.5 million UK government-funded project to speed up Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and help bring passengers a step closer to greener flights

Sheffield will lead a consortium to commercialise its innovative SAF production pathway that can produce cleaner aviation fuel using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology

Consortium plans to attract investors to build SAF demonstration and production plants to boost the supply of UK-homegrown fuel

The University of Sheffield has been awarded UK government funding to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel and bring passengers a step closer to greener flights.

Announced by the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane MP, during a visit to the University (Monday 21 July), Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million project to commercialise its new SAF production technology and attract investors to build SAF production plants in order to boost the supply of the cleaner fuel to the aviation industry.

The project will be delivered by a consortium, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK), and received letters of support from Airbus, Boeing, City of Doncaster Council and Qatar Airways.

SAF is typically produced using bio or waste feedstock. However, there are concerns over whether a sufficient level of feedstock is possible to establish and maintain. The University of Sheffield’s new production pathway eliminates this reliance as it can produce SAF using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology.

The pathway is called Power to Liquid (PtL). It uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes. The hydrogen and CO2 are then combined to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which can be refined into SAF.

This pathway could enable cost-competitive SAF production, offering operational flexibility while also decarbonising industrial appliances.

The Sheffield-led project, called NextGen-SAF, aims to build a world first demonstration plant combining two innovative technologies to produce SAF – a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advance Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The fuel cell can generate hydrogen and capture CO2 and the reactor converts the mixture into the synthetic hydrocarbons that are then refined into SAF. The plant will demonstrate the operability, reliability and performance of the integrated system so the method can be scaled up.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK. This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Announcing £63 million of funding for 17 projects to accelerate SAF production, Aviation Minister, Mike Kane said:

This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution.

We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

“From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

The University of Sheffield is one of the world’s leading universities for sustainable aviation fuel R&D. Its Energy Innovation Centre is home to some of the most advanced clean energy research facilities in Europe, which include pilot scale testing facilities that enable academics and businesses to collaborate to test new clean energy technologies, including sustainable aviation fuel, before scaling up and commercialising.

The University hosts the UK SAF Clearing House – one of only two centres in the world – that support fuel producers in obtaining the certification needed for use in the aviation industry.

Sheffield was part of a consortium that delivered the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel. Researchers from the University analysed the impact of SAF on the flight’s particulate emissions and contrail formation using the unique SAF research facilities at the Energy Innovation Centre. The results demonstrated up to a 70 per cent reduction in emission levels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

“At Sheffield we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

Industrial hemp is a miracle crop. It grows fast, absorbs up to 15 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, and can be used for building materials, textiles, and fuel. It needs little water, no pesticides, and improves soil quality. When you grow hemp, you grow hope.

Hemp is also a powerful tool for carbon removal. As it grows, it absorbs carbon from the air and locks it in the biomass. We use this carbon to build hempcrete homes or make sustainable aviation fuel. The carbon is stored for decades or burned cleanly in a circular economy model.

Our Ukraine project

In partnership with Hemp Ukraine Recover, we’ve built a powerful pilot project that delivers climate, social, and economic impact. We’ve already removed and permanently sequestered 500 tonnes of net CO2, housed 170 people, and proven the viability of hemp carbon removal in post-conflict zones, and everywhere else.

Every tonne of CO2 removed is measured and verified. We subtract all emissions associated with the project, including fuel use, to ensure net removals. And every removal credit can be tracked to a real impact on the ground.

A pathway for aviation

We are scaling hemp carbon removal as a solution for aviation. Hemp can also be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel with high energy density. Our vision is to turn airports into hemp farms that remove carbon and fuel planes at the same time.

High-quality removal credits can be sold to passengers, airlines, and airports. This creates new revenue streams, engages climate-conscious customers, and helps aviation meet its decarbonisation targets.

On 4 July 2025, GIZ Thailand, through the International Hydrogen Ramp-Up Programme (H2Uppp), in cooperation with the National Energy Technology Centre (ENTEC) and the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (GTCC), organised ‘From Waste to Wings: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Thailand and Southeast Asia’ at Asia Sustainable Energy Week 2025 (ASEW 2025). The forum brought together policymakers, industry representatives and academics from the aviation and SAF industry to exchange insights and perspectives on the role and potential of SAF in creating a cleaner and more sustainable future for aviation, focusing on Thailand and Southeast Asia (SEA).

Dr Dominika Kalinowska, Transport Projects Director from GIZ Thailand, emphasised GIZ’s commitment to sustainable aviation, supported by a series of events organised under the H2Uppp SAF Working Group, as well as further GIZ initiatives assisting public stakeholders in developing an SAF roadmap for Thailand.

“The forum theme ‘From Waste to Wings’ reflects our vision to transform waste and renewable resources into low-carbon fuels, supporting decarbonisation of the aviation sector while enhancing energy security, economic value creation and regional cooperation. This forum aims to scale up ambition, align regional efforts, and chart a practical roadmap for Thailand and ASEAN to move from vision to action.”

The plenary sessions of the forum featured an array of distinguished speakers, who shared insights on a variety of SAF topics – from the SAF value chain, policies and regulations to production and trade.

Beginning the session was Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon, Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT), who spoke about SAF integration prospects in Thailand, emphasising aligning airline companies’ policies with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), advancing the SAF value chain in the country, and CAAT’s own SAF expansion framework.

Sutharee Kiatman from the Biofuel Development Division, Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE), Ministry of Energy (MoE), provided an overview of Thailand’s national SAF policy and strategic approaches, underpinning the commitment reflected in the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) 2024 and the Oil Plan 2025.

Ketsada Sutthiumporn from the Department of Energy Business (DoEB) presented fuel regulations and standards related to SAF in Thailand, highlighting inspection and laboratory processes as key in ensuring biofuel standards.

Pahoong Thammaratdumrong from Energy Absolute (E@) shared insights into different SAF production methods, together with challenges and potential solutions through the company’s insights and experience in the field.

Finally, a presentation by Scott Turn, a professor from the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute (HNEI), University of Hawaii at Manoa, offered an in-depth observation of SAF development in Southeast Asia over the years, highlighting initiatives and progress from different countries such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.

Following the plenary session, a panel discussion was held to exchange expert perspectives on aligning SAF to transport decarbonisation in Thailand and Southeast Asia through the perspectives of experts and project developers in relevant sectors. Focusing on the topic of SAF production, the panel suggested that, while feedstocks are abundant in countries such as Thailand, alternative feedstocks such as biomass-to-fuels and other pathways based on SAF demand-supply should be explored to ensure sustainability and environmental impact reduction from the production chain. With technologies and policy frameworks currently in place to support SAF in Thailand, the challenges now lie in aligning its implementation to meet decarbonisation and climate targets in the transport sector.

In the closing speech, Tim Nees, H2Uppp Project Manager, expressed his appreciation to the forum speakers and participants for fostering discussion and cooperation on SAF in the region. He also invited interested parties on SAF topics (as well as hydrogen and other PtX products) to further collaborate through networking opportunities and activities from the H2Uppp programme.

Additionally, H2Uppp also joined the Future Move Forum at ASEW 2025, where Dr Pramote Puengjinda introduced the project and shared insights into SAF feasibility and application potential, especially for decarbonising the transport sector. The project also organised an exhibition booth to offer information on the global H2Uppp project and engage with interested visitors around green hydrogen and PtX topics.

The H2Uppp programme, financed by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWE), is implemented globally. In Thailand, GIZ implements the project together with the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (GTCC), with the aim of supporting policy and market development for green hydrogen and Power-to-X through expert networking, knowledge dissemination and public-private partnerships (PPP).

A green jet fuel investment worth £1.25bn could be at risk if the UK's largest bioethanol plant is forced to close, the firm behind it has said.

Meld Energy signed an agreement with Vivergo Fuels earlier this year for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at the Saltend Chemicals Park in Hull.

However, Vivergo's future has been put in doubt over the past few months after the decision to end the 19% tariff on US bioethanol imports as part of the recent UK-US trade deal.

Meld Energy CEO and founder Chris Smith said that without Vivergo at the site they may have to look overseas where ""that infrastructure is already in place"".

He said: ""We're excited about the potential to bring our sustainable aviation fuel project to the Humber – one of the UK's most important industrial and energy hubs.

""A bioethanol plant on site at Saltend is a critical part of that mix.

""Without it, we'd have to consider alternative locations overseas where that infrastructure is already in place.""

Mr Smith's comments came as the Vivergo plant was expecting its last scheduled wheat delivery from a farm in Lincolnshire on Friday.

'Urgent support needed'

Last month, Vivergo Fuels, which is owned by Associated British Foods and employs more than 160 people, said staff had been told about its uncertain future, which could see production stop before 13 September, if it does not get support.

Earlier this year, managing director Ben Hackett also wrote to wheat growers to say that the plant will only be able to honour existing contracts for wheat purchases while the uncertainty continued.

Mr Hackett said: ""We have the site, the skills, the supply chain and the ambition to lead the way on sustainable aviation fuel.

""But without urgent government support for British bioethanol, the UK risks losing that opportunity, along with the jobs and billions of pounds in investment that depend on it.""

A government spokesperson said officials and ministers have met with Vivergo over the past few months to discuss options over the ""significant challenges"" that the bioethanol industry had been facing for some time.

""We will continue to take proactive steps to address the long-standing challenges the company faces and remain committed to working closely with them throughout this period to present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods,"" the spokesperson added.

It aligns with national goals set by the National Development and Reform Commission to promote green hydrogen and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
If successful, the pipeline could become a model for future projects both in China and globally, advancing efforts to build low-carbon energy systems.","China has started building its first interprovincial green hydrogen pipeline, a major step in the country’s effort to expand clean energy infrastructure. The pipeline will carry hydrogen made from wind power in Ulanqab, Inner Mongolia, to Beijing, covering a distance of nearly 400 kilometers, reports Intellinews.com.

The project is being led by Sinopec, China’s top hydrogen producer. Once completed, the pipeline will supply up to 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually to Sinopec’s Yanshan petrochemical complex in the capital. Future phases aim to raise that capacity to 500,000 tonnes.

Approved by the Inner Mongolia Energy Bureau, the pipeline is part of a broader national strategy to lower emissions from heavy industry and reduce energy waste. Inner Mongolia has abundant wind and solar energy, but much of it currently goes unused due to a lack of transmission systems.

A 1-gigawatt wind-powered electrolysis facility in Ulanqab will be at the heart of the project. Electricity from wind turbines will be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen will then be compressed and sent through the new pipeline to industrial users in Beijing.

This marks a shift from earlier hydrogen systems along China’s coast, many of which still rely on fossil fuels. The new project is designed to directly connect areas with surplus renewable energy to regions with high energy demand, such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei economic zone.

Sinopec says the project is a key step toward a cleaner, more flexible energy system. “This pipeline will help us move clean energy from where it’s made to where it’s needed, cutting waste and supporting industrial demand,” a company spokesperson said.

Transporting hydrogen by pipeline is expected to be far cheaper and more efficient than moving it by truck or mixing it with natural gas. This could remove one of the biggest hurdles in developing China’s hydrogen sector.

The project also supports Inner Mongolia’s regional development plan, which includes a network of hydrogen pipelines. It aligns with national goals set by the National Development and Reform Commission to promote green hydrogen and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Analysts warn that the success of the project will depend on how quickly industries adopt hydrogen and whether prices remain competitive. But many believe this new pipeline could encourage further investments across the hydrogen supply chain—from fuel production to storage and transport.

If successful, the pipeline could become a model for future projects both in China and globally, advancing efforts to build low-carbon energy systems.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Green-Hydrogen-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 09:57:17.611556

For the first time, UK air passengers say they care more about punctual flights than cutting emissions.

According to the 2025 NATS Aviation Index, 63% of respondents now rank on-time performance as the industry’s top priority, overtaking reducing carbon emissions (56%) for the first time in the survey’s history.

While environmental concerns remain important, they have declined from their pandemic-era peak.

In 2020, 70% of passengers said cutting emissions was their number one priority. Today, however, passengers are more focused on improvements they can feel—like arriving on time—than those they can’t immediately see.

Air passengers are concerned, but won’t reduce flying

When asked which climate solutions the industry should pursue, the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ranked highest, prioritised by 39% of respondents. This puts SAF ahead of airspace modernisation (21%) and carbon offsetting as the most popular route to lower emissions.

Despite this support for greener technology, only 17% of passengers say environmental concerns actively deter them from flying. In contrast, ticket cost remains crucial, with 89% citing price as the primary influence on travel decisions.

Public perceptions around responsibility for aviation’s climate impact remain skewed toward institutions rather than individuals:

30% place the burden primarily on government

26% on airlines

23% on industry bodies like NATS and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)

Just 4% believe individual passengers should take the lead

This disconnect is reflected in personal behaviour: one-third of respondents admit they’ve done nothing to reduce their own flight-related emissions, despite growing awareness and concern.

Support for green taxes is growing—but not for limits on flying

In a surprising shift, 50% of respondents now support a frequent flyer tax, up from previous years. However, enthusiasm drops when it comes to more direct restrictions: just 36% would support hard limits on the number of flights individuals can take within a given timeframe.

While this indicates growing public openness to policy interventions, it’s unclear how sentiment might shift if such proposals became real government policy.

Although travel habits have stabilised post-pandemic—with 52% flying internationally and 32% domestically in the past year—the balance between sustainability and affordability is still tilted firmly toward cost.

Looking ahead, 26% expect to fly more over the next 12 months, particularly younger and ethnically diverse passengers. But cost remains the biggest constraint to that growth.

Airspace reform and innovation are gaining ground

Public support for airspace modernisation is rising. Awareness of UK efforts to redesign flight paths jumped from 11% to 19% in a year, and 52% support changes to enable more efficient routing.

Support for airport expansion remains stable at 53%, but 69% say any capacity growth must be underpinned by airspace reform.

Passengers are also warming to innovation. Support for flying taxis rose from 34% to 40%, while drones for emergency services (86%) and infrastructure inspection (81%) received overwhelming support.

Attitudes to artificial intelligence are mixed: 68% support AI in baggage screening and 50% approve of its use in air traffic control, but 49% express concerns about misuse and cybersecurity risks.

The NATS Aviation Index makes clear that UK passengers still value aviation’s social and economic benefits, but punctuality, affordability, and convenience are winning out over sustainability.

While support for SAF, airspace reform and even green taxes is growing, public expectations remain firmly grounded in the here and now: getting where they want, on time, at the right price.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/British-Airways-aircraft-with-palm-trees.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 06:56:17.312352
