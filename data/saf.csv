Source: EcoCeres, British Airways","British Airways signed a multi-year agreement with renewable fuel producer EcoCeres to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to reduce lifecycle carbon by up to 400,000 metric tonnes. The SAF will be made using used cooking oil only as biomass feedstocks. The agreement will assist British Airways in achieving its target of running 10 percent of flights on SAF by 2030, as per the UK government's SAF policy.

It is made by Hong Kong company EcoCeres and has the potential to cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 80 percent on average versus traditional fossil-derived jet fuel. Carbon reductions from the deal are forecast at the equivalent of the carbon footprint of a combined total of about 240,000 return economy-class flights between New York and London.

British Airways is part of a network of expanding airlines to try out greener fuel in a bid to reduce the environmentally harmful nature of flying. British Airways' Sustainable Aviation Fuel, for example, covered 2.7 percent of the airline's fuel consumption in 2024 and reduced carbon intensity by 13 percent compared to the 2019 baseline. One advantage of SAF is that its chemistry is the same as conventional fossil jet fuel, and therefore it will be feasible to blend it with current airplane engines and airport refuelling infrastructure without it requiring to be changed.

Although SAF continues to emit carbon dioxide when it burns, its net impact on greenhouse gases is much lower since the carbon is derived from renewable, biological origins and hence stays in the natural carbon cycle. SAF is thereby therefore a key near-to-medium-term solution to aviation de-carbonization, at least until industry is technology mature with hydrogen propulsion and electric flight.

EcoCeres, sponsored by private equity backers Kerogen Capital and Bain Capital, produces low-carbon fuels on commercial scale. A spin-off of Hong Kong towngas utility company and ISCC-certified, its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), and renewable naphtha are all produced on the back of waste and residue feedstocks.

British Airways partnership is embraced as a milestone for EcoCeres in securing further worldwide access to the SAF market. The deal is proof of increasing commercial aviation demand for low-carbon alternative fuel and further endorsement of waste-based biofuels' contribution to worldwide climate ambitions.

While in view is the environmental return, scale availability worldwide is not yet imminent. Global SAF use continues to be below 3 percent of all aviation fuel used worldwide. Industry experts foresee a transition at scale worldwide will depend on increasing production levels, building supply infrastructure, and consistent government incentivization by way of regulation.

The production of SAF is currently limited by feedstock availability, low yields, and the low number of commercial facilities. Indeed, developments like the research work by British Airways and EcoCeres are in the direction of establishing a system for sustainable markets along the way to fulfilling requirements someday across the globe.

Although neither of the carriers reports the size or terms of the deal, the strategic rationale is clear: both of them wish to minimize plane emissions in the race towards world net-zero ambitions. British Airways' overarching business strategy for sustainability is to be 2050 net-zero carbon, and SAF forms the cornerstone for such a strategy.

Sale of alternative fuel to aviation is a sign that the airline sector desires to break free from its carbon past. Pressure on the world airlines sector to cut carbon emissions will grow, and agreements between carriers and manufacturers will be more rapid in pace, giving birth to green aviation.

In 2025, Kenya Airways cemented its position as a major force in African and global aviation, earning widespread acclaim for its service excellence, sustainability efforts, and financial revival. The national carrier marked an extraordinary year with a series of prestigious awards, operational milestones, and strategic initiatives aimed at strengthening its network and leadership in the aviation industry.

Africa’s Leading Airline and Multiple Accolades

Kenya Airways’ remarkable year began with a triumph at the 32nd Annual World Travel Awards Africa & Indian Ocean Gala Ceremony held in Dar es Salaam. The airline was named Africa’s Leading Airline for 2025, a highly coveted title that recognizes the carrier’s exceptional service, innovation, and operational performance. This award was accompanied by three additional accolades: Africa’s Leading Airline Brand, Africa’s Leading Airline – Business Class, and Africa’s Leading Inflight Magazine (Msafiri).

These four victories underscored Kenya Airways’ commitment to delivering high-quality services across all aspects of the passenger experience, from inflight hospitality to the strength of its brand. The recognition also highlighted the success of Msafiri, the airline’s flagship inflight magazine, which has resonated with passengers by blending cultural storytelling with operational performance.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Initiative and Environmental Leadership

Kenya Airways made significant strides in its sustainability efforts during 2025. In October, the airline achieved a continental milestone by operating Africa’s first intra-continental flight using a 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blend on its Nairobi–Cape Town route. This initiative was in line with global standards under the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and CORSIA, marking a significant step toward reducing aviation’s environmental impact. The SAF initiative aligns with Kenya Airways’ broader commitment to environmental leadership and sustainability.

These efforts include plans to incorporate SAF blending on European routes, with the airline projecting a reduction of tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions annually. As part of its strategy to lead environmental aviation practices in Africa, Kenya Airways has emerged as a prominent player in the drive for sustainable air travel.

Record Financial Performance and Strategic Partnerships

The carrier’s success extended beyond service awards and sustainability. By December 2025, Kenya Airways achieved its first net profit in 11 years, signaling a robust financial recovery after years of pandemic-related disruptions and challenges. The airline’s ability to turn around its financial performance, despite global industry challenges, highlights its strong leadership and commitment to long-term growth.

Strategic partnerships were key to expanding Kenya Airways’ global reach. The airline deepened its alliance with Qatar Airways, enhancing its codeshare agreement to cover 19 destinations across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. This partnership not only strengthens Nairobi’s position as a key regional hub but also boosts connectivity for passengers traveling between continents.

Additionally, Kenya Airways’ growth trajectory was supported by its cargo division. In February, Kenya Airways Cargo was named African Air Cargo Airline of the Year at the Air Cargo Africa Conference in Nairobi, further solidifying its role in regional logistics and trade facilitation.

Kenya Airways Leads in Workforce Development

Internal growth and employee engagement played a pivotal role in the airline’s success in 2025. Earlier in the year, the airline was awarded Top Employer of the Year by The Employers Institute. This recognition reflects Kenya Airways’ ongoing efforts to improve its organizational culture, enhance employee satisfaction, and develop its workforce, all of which are critical elements in the carrier’s turnaround strategy.

The air cargo terminal of the 2026–2030 period is resolving this through a radical transition toward smart terminals.
Forward-thinking cargo hubs like LGG are proactively addressing the future gap in cargo aviation infrastructure by focusing on three key areas.
The air cargo industry of 2026 is no longer a supporting actor in global trade; it is the lead architect.","The global air cargo sector is currently undergoing a profound metamorphosis. Once characterised as a labor-intensive, documentation-heavy foundation of international commerce, the industry is rapidly divesting itself of its analog processes. In their stead, a highly interconnected, data-centric, and increasingly automated ecosystem is emerging, one that is redefining the movement of goods globally in an era of instant gratification and environmental urgency.

Driven by a staggering $8.1 trillion e-commerce boom and an industry-wide mandate for net-zero emissions, the aviation cargo landscape of 2026 transcends the mere physical movement of boxes. It has become a digital-first frontier where success is predicated not solely on fleet size, but on the capacity to optimally orchestrate the data those aircraft generate.

According to Airbus’ 2025 Cargo Global Market Forecast (GMF), the global skyline is projected to become considerably more crowded. The report anticipates that the worldwide dedicated freighter fleet will surge to 3,420 aircraft over the next two decades, representing a substantial 45% increase from current levels.

This influx of capacity does not signify a simple replication of existing assets. The GMF outlines a strategy of renewal and specialised growth. To satisfy the projected demand for cargo aviation, a total of 2,605 additional freighters will be necessitated between 2026 and 2030, according to the Airbus GMF.

This requirement is segmented into three primary categories: 1,120 small aircraft, which will be essential for maintaining regional agility; 855 mid-size widebodies; and 630 large widebodies, which are requisite for transcontinental heavy lifting operations.

Perhaps most indicative of the industry’s pivot toward circularity and efficiency is the origin of these aircraft. While 935 will be new constructions, the vast majority 1,670 aircraft will be passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversions. This trend injects new operational life into existing airframes, enabling airlines to strategically redeploy assets into the high-margin cargo sector as passenger travel patterns stabilise.

While aircraft technology advances significantly, the industry has long identified a persistent bottleneck: the warehouse. This terrestrial hurdle has historically slowed transit, encumbered by manual sorting and paper manifests.

The air cargo terminal of the 2026–2030 period is resolving this through a radical transition toward smart terminals. These facilities are intentionally designed to be human-light, prioritising extreme throughput speed and the near-total elimination of processing errors.

""We perceive the evolution toward more automated, human-light cargo terminals not as a binary choice between efficiency and survival, but as a strategic imperative,"" stated Frédéric Brun, Head of Commercial Cargo & Logistics at Liege Airport (LGG) and Torsten Wefers, Vice President Sales & Marketing at LGG.

At CargoLand by LGG, the practical implementation of this vision is evident. By deploying AI-powered vision systems and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), terminals are reporting a 70% reduction in errors. These robots execute palletisation and sorting with a level of precision that human crews are unable to replicate consistently over a 24-hour shift.

Brun noted that this initiative is not focused on replacing personnel, but on empowering them. By utilising tools such as digital twins, virtual replicas of the physical warehouse, operators can simulate workflows in real-time, proactively identifying potential bottlenecks before they manifest on the floor.

The infrastructure of tomorrow

The evolution extends beyond the confines of the warehouse and into the fundamental fuel and flight paths of the industry. The middle-mile drone has formally transitioned from a nascent technology to a logistical imperative.

New-generation cargo drones, developed by companies such as Dronamics (Bulgaria/UK), Elroy Air, and Sabrewing Aircraft Company, have moved beyond carrying light parcels. These autonomous aerial vehicles are now capable of transporting 200–500kg across hundreds of miles.

Aviation confronts a formidable path toward achieving Net Zero. Innovation in propulsion is bifurcating into solutions for short-haul (Electric/Hydrogen) and long-haul.

“Alternative propulsion for regional middle-mile cargo, specifically electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) and hydrogen-propulsion aircraft, are progressing rapidly from prototype stages to certification,” said Brun.

According to IATA reports, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to constitute less than 1% of total fuel consumption in 2026, a reflection of the inefficacy of the current policy environment.

This deficiency is further compounded by the lack of harmonisation between CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) and various regional initiatives, which engenders fragmentation and curtails substantive emissions reductions.

Forward-thinking cargo hubs like LGG are proactively addressing the future gap in cargo aviation infrastructure by focusing on three key areas. Firstly, they are committing to complete electrification, transitioning all ground equipment to 100% electric operations.

Secondly, they are ensuring the immediate availability of SAF through the development of dedicated fuel infrastructure. Finally, these hubs are implementing cargo connect, a comprehensive digital ecosystem designed to facilitate the seamless sharing of critical data among airlines, handlers, and all logistics partners.

The brain of the operation

As the physical and digital infrastructure attains maturity, the commercial dimension of the business is also undergoing a revolution. For decades, the industry operated in silos, with sales (GSAs), operations, and tech infrequently communicating effectively.

Aerion, a commercial holding company, is challenging the current fragmented model of cargo aviation. It unites ECS Group, Global GSA Group, CargoTech, Healthc’Air, Mail & More, TCE, and Squair. Founded by the leaders of the ECS Group, Aerion signifies an evolution from simple airline representation toward full operational orchestration.

“For nearly three decades, we have been actively shaping the air cargo industry rather than simply adapting to it,” said Adrien Thominet, Founder and Chairman of Aerion. “First by establishing ECS Group, then by integrating Global GSA Group, we constructed an unparalleled network. Aerion is the mechanism that connects these components.”

Aerion centralises strategic intelligence by consolidating a range of specialised entities, each focusing on a distinct area of cargo aviation: CargoTech provides high-end digital capabilities for planning and optimisation; TCE offers expertise in safety, security, and quality operations; Squair delivers specialised back-office and claims support; Mail&More handles the high-velocity requirements of e-commerce and postal flows; and Healthc'Air manages the rigorous requirements of temperature-sensitive medical logistics.

In practice, Aerion functions as a strategic central intelligence unit. While each entity preserves its operational independence, they function under a consolidated commercial strategy aimed at achieving measurable, sustainable profit.

Perhaps the most significant paradigm shift highlighted by the emergence of Aerion is the industry's new relationship with data. Historically, possessing information conferred a competitive advantage. Today, data is ubiquitous; it has become a commodity.

The true disruption in 2026 resides not in access to data, but in the capability to exploit it judiciously. Industry standards such as IATA’s ONE Record have provided the requisite foundation for a cleaner, consistent methodology for information sharing. However, Aerion contends that this foundation merely represents the beginning.

""The substantive difference is no longer determined by ‘who possesses the data, but ‘who truly understands how to leverage it to drive profitability,"" the company added.

Aerion does not seek ownership of the data, but rather the orchestration of its utilisation, translating market signals into precise decisions concerning network planning, pricing, and customer segmentation. In this environment, technology serves as a decision accelerator.

The rise of the neutral hub

As the industry advances, the concept of the neutral hub is becoming increasingly appealing to traditional carriers. To maintain relevance in the face of tech-heavy integrators and agile startups, traditional airlines require operating environments that offer 24/7 flexibility unconstrained by passenger-driven schedules.

Torsten Wefers, Vice President of Sales & Marketing at LGG, observes that the objective is to ensure a seamless integration between air and ground logistics. By utilising hubs such as CargoLand, airlines can operate within an ecosystem where pricing, legal compliance, safety protocols, and sales execution are comprehensively aligned.

The air cargo industry of 2026 is no longer a supporting actor in global trade; it is the lead architect. By blending physical capacity with digital orchestration, the sector is finally moving at the speed of the modern world.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2026/01/17/91133-1763396335400.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 06:56:11.868770

Market Driver

At the heart of the refined petroleum products market’s expansion lies the surging demand for transportation fuels. Rapid urbanization and rising vehicle ownership in emerging economies continue to drive gasoline and diesel consumption. Road transport remains the largest segment, accounting for a substantial share of fuel demand due to the vast number of passenger cars, commercial trucks, buses, and two‑wheelers navigating expanding transport networks. Diesel, in particular, is essential not just for freight and logistics but also for agricultural and construction machinery, amplifying its market importance.

Simultaneously, the recovery and growth of commercial aviation are bolstering demand for jet fuel. With air travel rebounding from pandemic‑era lows, airlines are increasing flights and fleet utilization, thereby lifting refined product consumption. Industrial sectors, ranging from manufacturing to mining and energy generation, further add to diesel and heavy fuel oil requirements, embedding refined products deeply into economic infrastructure.

Amidst this robust demand, refineries are also responding to environmental mandates and fuel quality standards. Stricter regulations — such as low‑sulfur fuel requirements and emissions caps — are prompting upgrades to existing facilities and incentivizing the production of cleaner fuel variants. These regulatory pressures act as both challenges and drivers, as producers invest in refining processes that can deliver compliant, high‑value products. The outcome is a market that not only grows in volume but increasingly emphasizes fuel quality, environmental performance, and operational flexibility.

Technology Advancement

Technological innovation is a powerful catalyst transforming how refined petroleum products are produced, optimized, and delivered. Modern refineries are adopting advanced processing technologies such as hydrocracking, catalytic reforming, and deep desulfurization — all aimed at boosting yields, improving fuel purity, and meeting stringent environmental standards. These technologies allow producers to convert heavier crude fractions into lighter, higher‑value products like gasoline and diesel more efficiently.

Digital transformation plays a pivotal role in operational excellence. The integration of real‑time data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables predictive maintenance, optimized process control, and energy efficiency enhancements. For example, AI‑driven models can forecast equipment failures before they occur, minimizing downtime and extending the life of critical units. Digital twins — virtual replicas of physical refinery operations — help engineers simulate process changes, explore optimization scenarios, and enhance safety margins.

Refineries are also exploring cleaner fuel technologies and alternative feedstocks as part of sustainability strategies. This includes co‑processing bio‑based feedstocks such as vegetable oils or waste fats alongside conventional crude, producing biodiesel blends and lower‑carbon fuel alternatives. The development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel is particularly notable, reflecting the industry’s efforts to reduce lifecycle emissions from transportation fuels.

Innovation in catalyst development is another key area. New catalyst formulations enhance reaction efficiency in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and hydroprocessing units, leading to improved product yields and reduced environmental impact. Similarly, advancements like modular hydrocrackers offer flexibility in refinery configurations, helping operators adjust quickly to market demands or regulatory changes.

Together, these advancements are not only improving refinery performance but are also helping the market evolve in line with global energy and environmental goals.

Pour y répondre, les constructeurs aéronautiques misent notamment sur l'avion électrique, une technologie encore en développement mais porteuse de fortes promesses. Moins polluant et potentiellement moins coûteux à exploiter, ce nouveau modèle pourrait aussi rebattre les cartes du prix des billets Une bonne nouvelle pour le portefeuille des voyageurs?

La compagnie scandinave SAS prévoit le premier vol en avion électrique pour 2028

En juin 2023, la compagnie aérienne SAS a ouvert les réservations pour ses trois premiers vols commerciaux en avion électrique à destination de la Suède, la Norvège et le Danemark. 90 billets (30 par vol) ont été mis en vente. Ils ont rapidement trouvé preneur. Les heureux élus devront prendre leur mal en patience, ces vols inauguraux n'étant pas prévus avant 2028! Le prix du billet était fixé à 1.946 couronnes suédoises, danoises ou norvégiennes, frais et taxes inclus. Cela correspondait, à cette période, à un tarif de 165 euros pour les passagers suédois, 171 euros pour les Norvégiens, et 261 euros pour les voyageurs danois. Le montant de 1.946 couronnes est un clin d'œil à l'année de création de la compagnie aérienne. Celle-ci espère écrire «un nouveau chapitre de l'histoire de l'aviation».

La Suède développe le plus grand avion électrique au monde

L'annonce de SAS peut paraître prématurée. En 2019, la compagnie a conclu un accord avec Heart Aerospace pour développer des avions électriques. L'entreprise basée près de Göteborg, en Suède, travaille actuellement sur le futur ES-30. Cet appareil d'une envergure de 32 mètres, pouvant embarquer jusqu'à 30 passagers, sera propulsé par quatre moteurs électriques alimentés par des batteries rechargeables en 30 minutes. Il disposera d'une autonomie de 200km, et pourra effectuer un trajet total de 400km grâce à un moteur hybride alimenté en carburant d'aviation durable (CAD, en anglais SAF pour sustainable aviation fuel). En réduisant la capacité à 25 passagers, l'avion peut atteindre 800km d'autonomie.

Le prototype Heart Experimental 1 (Heart X1) devait effectuer son vol-test inaugural au départ de l'aéroport de Plattsburgh, dans l'État de New York, en 2025, mais il a été reporté à deux reprises. Il est désormais prévu pour 2026. Heart Aerospace présentera ensuite un prototype de préproduction, le Heart X2, capable d'effectuer un vol hybride-électrique. L'entreprise vise une certification de l'ES-30 et son exploitation commerciale dès 2028, mais cette date pourrait être décalée.

Plusieurs prototypes pourraient voler d'ici 2030

La start-up américaine BETA Technologies a conçu le Alia CTOL CX300. En septembre 2025, l'avion a effectué un premier vol-test de fret en conditions réelles entre les aéroports de Stavanger et de Bergen, dans le sud-ouest de la Norvège. L'appareil a parcouru les 160km en 55 minutes. Il peut transporter jusqu'à 5 passagers, et dispose d'une autonomie de 400km. L'entreprise vise une certification à l'horizon 2028-2030

La start-up allemande Vaeridion développe un avion électrique d'une autonomie de 500km. Selon Eurocontrol, près d'un tiers des vols au sein de l'Union européenne en 2022 concernaient des distances inférieures ou égales à ce rayon d'action. Cela permet par exemple de couvrir des liaisons comme Londres-Amsterdam, Berlin-Munich ou Madrid-Lisbonne. Vaeridion prévoit le premier vol d'un prototype en 2027, avec une exploitation commerciale dès 2030. L'entreprise vise une clientèle d'affaires aisée, avec des prix de sièges entre 150 et 300 euros

Le concept E9X, créé par la start-up néerlandaise Elysian en collaboration avec l'Université de technologie de Delft, est un avion à réaction entièrement électrique pouvant accueillir jusqu'à 90 passagers, et voler sur 800km. Dans sa version finale, il pourrait parcourir jusqu'à 1.000 kilomètres. Selon l'entreprise, l'appareil serait adapté pour couvrir environ la moitié des vols commerciaux réguliers. Un prototype pourrait voler en 2033. Il reste à savoir si un tel projet est viable sur le plan économique.

L'avion est jusqu'à 26 fois moins cher que le train en Europe

L'ONG Greenpeace a analysé 142 trajets de moins de 1.500 km en Europe, dont 109 transfrontaliers. En pondérant par le nombre de passagers aériens, le train coûte en moyenne 2,5 fois plus cher que l'avion pour voyager en Europe. Certains vols low cost sont jusqu'à 26 fois moins chers que le même trajet en train. L'étude prend l'exemple d'un voyage Barcelone-Londres à 14,99 euros en avion contre 389 euros en train pour une réservation anticipée à moyen terme. Un vol Marseille-Londres est affiché à 15 euros , contre 188 euros pour le rail. En France, 95% des voyages transfrontaliers sont moins chers en avion.

If you are looking beyond Minerals Technologies, this could be a useful moment to broaden your watchlist with .

So with Minerals Technologies trading around US$67, a DCF suggesting a 57% discount and the share price still below its 1 year level, is this a genuine mispricing, or is the market already factoring in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 20.1% Undervalued

On this narrative, Minerals Technologies' fair value of US$84 sits well above the last close of US$67.12, setting up a clear valuation gap for investors to assess.

Ongoing investments in capacity expansions for high-growth, sustainable products (e.g., sustainable aviation fuel purification, animal health solutions, fabric care, and pet litter in Asia) are positioned to benefit from global population growth, urbanization, and heightened sustainability demand. These factors directly support revenue growth and above-average margin expansion.

Curious what earnings, margin shifts, and revenue trajectory have to look like for that fair value to stack up? The narrative leans on sharp profit turnaround, sustained top line growth, and a very low future earnings multiple. If you want to see how those pieces fit together, the full story is worth a read.

Result: Fair Value of $84 (UNDERVALUED)

However, there are still pressure points to watch, particularly weakening paper demand in key regions and ongoing talc litigation, which could unsettle earnings and sentiment.

""Look at all of the private jets at Nice airport on takeoff,"" wrote the original poster.

The French city of Nice has been well aware of the impact of luxury travel on its infrastructure. The city's mayor has previously worked to ban cruise ships from docking there.

Besides being a tacky display of wealth, luxury travel produces an outsized share of pollution. Per passenger emissions from private jets are far higher than commercial airlines. For example, one study suggested that Jeff Bezos' two private jets crank out more pollution in a year than the average Amazon worker could in 207 years.

Worse still, private jet travel is on the rise. Between 2019 and 2023, private jet pollution went up 50%. A big part of this increase are empty legs, where private jets fly without passengers on board.

Private jet pollution has immediate effects on local air quality, but the issue is even bigger than that. Atmospheric pollution traps heat, exacerbates destructive weather patterns, and passes the costs of natural disasters to society at large. This has led to crises in home insurance and agriculture.

The use of sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to reduce pollution from air travel, but there are much lower-impact options available, like rail. Taking the train when possible is not only better for the environment, it can be a very comfortable ride, too.

Reddit commenters were less than pleased to see so many private jets parked in the south of France.

What’s changing about the Air France-KLM credit card

Over the coming weeks, we’re going to see some major changes to Flying Blue’s credit card in the United States.

For one, in March 2026 we’re going to see the card converted from a Mastercard to a Visa — specifically, it’ll go from being the Air France KLM World Elite Mastercard to being the Air France KLM Visa Signature Card. The transition should be seamless, so existing cardmembers should automatically receive a new version of the card, with a new card number.

More immediately, for applications as of Wednesday, January 21, 2026 (and for existing cardmembers), we’re seeing some improvements to the benefits of the card. It’ll maintain the same $89 annual fee it currently has, with a couple of major changes.

First, we’ll see the card get a new bonus category of earning 3x miles on dining. This complements the existing rewards structure of 3x miles on Air France, KLM, and SkyTeam bookings, plus 1.5x miles on all other everyday spending.

On top of that, we’ll see new anniversary rewards on the card. As before, the card will offer 5,000 anniversary bonus miles after $50 in annual purchases, in addition to 20XPs each card anniversary just for having the card. With these updates, you’ll also be able to earn 80 XPs for annual purchases of at least $15,000, and an enhanced offer of an additional 60 XPs for annual purchases of at least $25,000.

In other words, in total cardmembers will be able to earn 160 XPs if they spend $25,000 on the card in anniversary year.

I’m very happy to see these changes to the card!

I find the Air France-KLM Flying Blue program to be super useful, which is why I have Platinum status in the program. It’s fantastic to see Flying Blue actually make it more compelling to use the card for spending.

If I can earn 160 XPs per year by spending $25,000 on the card, all while earning a minimum of 1.5x miles, I’d consider that to be a worthwhile opportunity. For context on XPs, that’s the metric by which you earn status with the Flying Blue program:

100 XPs gets you Silver status

You then need 180 additional XPs to earn Gold status

You then need 300 additional XPs to earn Platinum status

The clock resets as you work your way up the tiers. In other words, if you’re starting from scratch, you’d need a total of 580 XPs to earn Platinum status, but you’d have more than a year, since the tiers keep resetting. Meanwhile if you already have Platinum status, you only need 300 XPs to requalify for the status.

So by spending $25,000 on the card per year, that’ll get me over half way to Platinum status. Personally, I didn’t find it worthwhile to put spending on the card before, so I’m very happy to see this. I also find the annual fee on the card easy to justify, since the 5,000 miles go a long way to offsetting the $89 annual fee.

Kudos to Flying Blue on these changes. If I had any wish, it’s that it would be awesome if there were even more opportunities to earn XPs for spending on the card. The folks at Flying Blue are savvy and understand the US market really well, so you’d think they’d embrace credit card spending as much as possible.

Bottom line

The Air France-KLM credit card in the United States is going to see some updates. For one, it’ll go from being a Mastercard to a Visa, which is the most minor change, as I see it. On top of that, the card will earn 3x miles on dining, and it’ll also be possible to earn up to 160 XPs on the card per year, by spending $25,000.

When you consider that the annual fee is staying the same, I’d consider these to be entirely positive changes. At least for me, Flying Blue will accomplish its goal — I’ll be switching some spending to the card!",https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Air-France-Business-Class-A350-104.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 18:56:58.725746

Shipping Giants to the Rescue

Without its own fleet or warehouses, eBay relies heavily on its partners to meet its climate goals. DHL, FedEx, and UPS are already on the path, investing in electric vehicles and sustainable aviation fuels. FedEx plans to transition to fully electric vehicles by 2030. DHL and UPS have similar targets, aiming to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel in 30% of their air operations by 2035.

Climate-related challenges like floods and heatwaves could disrupt these strategies. eBay is urging its partners to collaborate closely to anticipate and mitigate these risks.

Challenges on the Green Road

While the plan is ambitious, it’s not without its critics. One major hurdle is the high cost of transitioning to greener technologies. Implementing electric vehicles and investing in alternative fuels require significant resources, which not all companies are willing to allocate.

Additionally, eBay must ensure its partners maintain their commitments and progress steadily. Unpredictable climate changes pose another potential risk, threatening supply chains and the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality.

As European regulations tighten and consumer expectations for sustainability rise, eBay must skillfully navigate this rapidly changing environment.

But how did commercial flights go from being exclusively for the wealthy to the mainstream and affordable option they are today? Artemis Aerospace guides us through the different decades of air travel and how it has shaped modern-day living.

The First Commercial Flight

The first ever passenger flight took off in May 1908 when Wilbur Wright carried Charles Furnas just 2000 feet across the beach at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Just one year later, the first airline in the world, the German airship company DELAG, was founded.

In 1914, the world’s first scheduled passenger service, an airboat piloted by Tony Jannus, set off from St. Petersburg, Florida, and landed at Tampa, around 17 miles away. The service only ran for four months, but it had unlocked the appetite of those keen to tap into the novelty of air transport.

A New Era of Aviation

However, it wasn’t until the 1920s that commercial flights carrying paying passengers started to become commonplace with the introduction of the multi-engine airplane, the Lawson C-2, which was specifically built to carry passengers.

During this time, more and more start-up airline carriers were being established, some of which are still in operation today. These include KLM in the Netherlands (1919), Colombia’s Avianca (1919), Qantas in Australia (1920), and Czech Airlines (1923).

Aircraft from this period would land frequently to refuel and fly at lower altitudes due to unpressurized cabins. This made traveling by plane noisy, cold, and expensive. Flying times were lengthy, and turbulence was frequent. Passengers regularly experienced air sickness, and many airlines hired nurses to reduce anxiety and tend to those affected.

In 1935, one of the world’s oldest airlines, Qantas, operated its first international passenger flight, traveling from Brisbane to Singapore. From there, British-owned Imperial Airways connected this flight to the UK. This was to set the wheels in motion for creating a regular travel route between Australia and the UK in the coming decades.

Despite flying being incredibly dangerous and extremely expensive during this period, it was still a fashionable way to travel for the rich. According to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, the number of airline passengers grew from just 6,000 in 1930 to nearly half a million by 1934; the aviation industry was well on its way to becoming hugely important to the global economy.

Innovation That Revolutionized Air Travel

The introduction of the Douglas DC-3 in 1935 also had a big impact on the future of commercial flight. The propeller-driven airliner was a larger and much improved aircraft compared to its predecessors. Faster and more reliable, it could carry up to 32 passengers and had a cruising speed of 207 mph with a range of 1500 miles. This made it popular with well-established airlines, including Delta, TWA, American, and United, who soon added the aircraft to their fleets.

During the 1940s, the onset of WWII meant commercial aviation developments slowed considerably. However, by the end of the decade, the industry was heading towards a new era as Pan Am began operating its fleet of Boeing 307s, which featured the first-ever pressurized cabin.

This transformed air travel for passengers, allowing them to enjoy a comfortable experience at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Major airlines were now ramping up their advertising spending and offering travelers smooth journeys to far-flung destinations and business hubs, including Pan Am’s iconic New York-London route.

The Golden Age of Air Travel

The 1950s and 1960s heralded the age of jet engine aircraft, and with it came an upsurge in commercial flights, airline carriers, and international flying routes.

Commercial air travel was booming, and major airlines were fiercely competitive, offering passengers more and more inflight perks, including lavish silver-service meals and fine wines.

Pan Am was a front-runner in pioneering and marketing the very best air travel had to offer. It was the first airline to fly worldwide and introduced ground-breaking changes to the industry, such as adding jet aircraft to their fleets and utilizing computerized reservation systems.

In the 1960s, work began on creating the world’s first supersonic aircraft and what would eventually become an iconic symbol of commercial flight, the Concorde. Offering transatlantic flights in just 3.5 hours, the aircraft was a hit with business travelers and royalty alike. However, tickets were extremely expensive and only a privileged few could afford to travel via Concorde.

The Rise of the No-frills Airline

Seeing a gap in the market for making air travel more accessible to everyday people, British-owned Laker Airways, founded in 1966 by Freddie Laker, was one of the first airlines to start offering a budget alternative by adjusting its inflight offer.

Using the budget airline business model that is commonplace today, Laker was able to offer lower fares by reducing inflight services and luxuries, such as free meals. The airline also found innovative ways to reduce fuel consumption and engine wear by introducing the reduced thrust take-off technique and faster climbs to obtain the optimum flying altitude in as little time as possible. Sadly, the airline was a casualty of the 1980s recession and subsequently went bankrupt.

However, it paved the way for budget travel and opened a world of possibilities for millions more people to get the chance to travel by air.

Today, the world’s largest low-cost carrier is Southwest Airlines in the US. Synonymous with budget travel, the company’s low-cost domestic and short-haul offer has undoubtedly inspired many other well-known brands to tap into the no-frills market, including Ryanair and EasyJet.

Air Travel for the Masses

Larger and more economical aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, had also made cheaper air travel possible. Airlines were now able to carry more passengers than ever before, meaning ticket prices could be sold at a reduced rate. Holidaying abroad was no longer reserved for the rich.

This change in dynamics meant airlines now started to look for different ways to retain the luxurious service and long lunches that had been synonymous with the golden age of travel, without compromising on providing a budget alternative.

First-class cabins, sophisticated onboard bars, and exclusive-use airport lounges meant those who could afford to, could still travel in style.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the budget airlines Ryanair and EasyJet launched. Offering airfares for as little as £20, they changed the face of commercial flying and put pressure on traditional carriers to lower ticket prices.

Security Tightening in the 2000s

The tragic events of 9/11 had a profound effect on air travel. Security at airports was increased significantly and passengers without a ticket at US airports could no longer accompany friends and family through security to the gate.

Cockpit security was also heightened. Previously, it had been possible for passengers to visit the flight deck and speak to the pilots. However, after 2001, cockpit doors were locked with only the pilots controlling who could enter.

A New Era for Air Travel

According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, it took until 2004 for air passenger numbers to reach pre-9/11 levels and until 2007 to reach a record high.

During this period, low-cost carriers were experiencing increased demand as the popularity of booking websites surged, and, by 2009, figures from the tourism research company PhoCusWright reported that half of all travel-related bookings were being made online.

Passenger numbers continued to surge throughout the 2010s, and by the end of the decade, the volume of travelers using commercial airlines was at an all-time high.

The Post-pandemic Era: Flying into a New Age for Aviation

Prior to the pandemic, the IATA projected that global passenger numbers could reach 7.2 billion by 2035. Few, however, could have anticipated the scale of disruption that followed: worldwide fleet groundings, fractured supply chains, volatile border policies, and the most severe financial shock in aviation history.

By 2024, global passenger traffic had largely returned to, and in some regions surpassed, pre-pandemic levels, marking one of the fastest recoveries the industry has ever experienced. International long-haul demand rebounded strongly across the Atlantic and Pacific, while emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America reshaped global traffic flows. New hubs gained prominence, secondary cities secured nonstop intercontinental links, and airlines rethought network strategies with resilience, not just growth, in mind.

Yet recovery has not meant a return to the old normal. From 2023 through early 2026, aviation has operated under persistent structural constraints. Aircraft delivery delays, engine reliability issues, pilot shortages, and air traffic control bottlenecks have limited capacity just as demand surged. Airlines responded by extending fleet lifespans, accelerating cabin retrofits, and prioritizing yield over sheer scale — signaling a more disciplined era of growth.

The Promises to Come True

At the same time, sustainability moved from aspiration to operational reality. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production expanded, regulatory frameworks tightened in Europe and beyond, and airlines increasingly tied long-term strategies to fleet renewal conducive to cost and emissions reduction, and transparent environmental reporting. While the path to net-zero remains complex, aviation entered 2026 with clearer benchmarks and stronger alignment between policy, manufacturers, and operators than at any point before.

Technology and passenger expectations have also reshaped the experience of flying. AI-driven operations, biometric processing, next-generation premium cabins, and redesigned airport infrastructure reflect an industry focused on efficiency, comfort, and differentiation. Premium and long-haul leisure travel proved especially resilient, reinforcing aviation’s role not just as transport, but as a lifestyle and economic enabler.

As we move deeper into this new era, global aviation stands neither fragile nor complacent, but transformed. The years since the pandemic have reaffirmed a central truth: air travel adapts because it must. No matter the geopolitical, economic, or environmental challenges ahead, the impulse to connect across cities, continents, and cultures remains fundamental.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/696bc79d393a2c05e679cc33_AW_Chris%20Goulet-35.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 13:56:25.869756

Strategic partnership to scale CBG in India

On 11 November 2025, Sumitomo Corporation agreed to acquire a stake in TruAlt Gas Private Limited (TGPL), a subsidiary of TruAlt Bioenergy Limited, and enter into a strategic collaboration. Following the investment, TGPL will be renamed TruAlt Sumi Gas Private Limited (TSGPL).

TSGPL plans to build 16 compressed biomethane gas production facilities across India over the next three years, with operations starting in phases from 2026. Once fully operational, the plants are expected to produce around 320 tonnes of CBG per day, equivalent to the daily gas needs of nearly 800,000 Indian households. The gas will mainly be sold as automobile fuel to city gas distributors.

Supporting energy security and government targets

India, the world’s third-largest energy consumer, is pushing to improve energy self-sufficiency and reach energy independence by 2047. CBG plays a key role in this plan, as it is produced from agricultural and industrial waste such as sugarcane and ethanol residue.

The Indian government has mandated CBG blending in vehicle fuel and household city gas, targeting a 5 per cent blend by 2028. This policy has made rapid expansion of CBG production facilities a priority.

Expansion plans and future bioenergy initiatives

TSGPL will first construct four CBG plants in Karnataka and Maharashtra, major sugarcane-producing regions. Sumitomo Corporation and TruAlt will also explore expanding bioethanol capacity and producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from bioethanol.

Despite the abrupt shift in federal energy policy, US innovators in the fleet electrification field continue to exercise an outsized impact on the global decarbonization movement. The latest example comes from the Texas startup Fleetzero, which has just nailed $43 million in Series A financing to scale up its electric ship business.

The Fleetzero Electric Ship Solution: Smaller And Slower Are Better

Fleetzero surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar in 2022 with a multi-faceted approach to electrifying the global shipping industry. Rather than attempting to electrify the biggest cargo vessels traveling the longest routes at the fastest speed, Fleetzero reverses the economy of scale script to focus attention on smaller electric ships traveling relatively short distances between stops, at slower speeds.

If you’re guessing that battery swapping comes into the picture, run right out and buy yourself a cigar. Fleetzero’s electric ships can swap batteries in far less time than it takes to recharge. The battery system is designed to fit into standing shipping containers, so they can be changed out with standard port equipment.

As a follow-on effect of the swapping approach, Fleetzero’s ships require smaller batteries that take up less space, leaving more room for cargo. In addition, the focus on smaller ships enables Fleetzero to call at smaller port facilities that are closer to local destinations, shrinking the last-mile expenses associated with ground transportation.

Yet another intertwining factor is the speed of the ships. The Fleetzero fleet runs at about half the speed of the biggest container ships. That provides a savings on battery range, while the lost time can be offset by shrinking the miles needed for ground transportation.

As for who’s gonna pay for all this, Fleetzero calculates that their electric ships will cost less to operate than conventional propulsion systems. “The company’s Leviathan™ propulsion system can be used on new or existing ships in a hybrid or all-electric configuration and is designed to lower the total cost of ownership of large commercial ships through maintenance and fuel savings,” Fleetzero states.

$43 Million More For The Electric Ships Of The Future

In the latest news, Fleetzero’s new cash infusion of $43 million will enable the company to open up a new electric ship factory and research facility — in Texas, of course, where everything is bigger including the maritime fleet electrification movement.

“The capital will be used to expand manufacturing of Fleetzero’s Leviathan™ hybrid and electric marine propulsion system, which is being deployed globally on commercial vessels,” Fleetzero explained in a press statement.

Fleetzero initially launched in New Orleans, Louisiana. The new $43 million cash infusion supports the company’s move to Texas, where it will ramp up operations to the next level.

“Fleetzero’s new headquarters in Houston will serve as the company’s hub for manufacturing and R&D. The facility includes a production line with an initial capacity of 300 MWh/year of marine ESS systems, a marine robotics and autonomy lab, and a marine propulsion R&D center. Fleetzero plans to expand its Houston production capacity up to three GWh/yr over the next five years,” the company explained in a press statement.

“Houston has the people who know how to build and operate big hardware – ships, rigs, refineries, and power systems,” emphasized Fleetzero COO and co-founder Mike Carter.

“We’re pairing that industrial DNA with modern batteries, autonomy, and software to bring back shipbuilding to the US,” Carter added again for good measure.

Keeping Up With The Joneses

That’s … interesting! With a focus on supporting fossil fuel producers, the Trump administration has been putting the brakes on the vehicle electrification movement. However, some automakers are continuing to introduce new EVs to the US, including Toyota as well as newcomers Slate Auto and Telo Trucks. Signs of activity are also rising in the truck and other delivery fleet electrification area. Now here comes Fleetzero with a plan to displace fossil fuels by floating more electric ships into the market, too.

As Carter indicates, the broader aim is to keep the US shipbuilding industry competitive with new technologies as global stakeholders move beyond conventional fuels to adopt autonomous and alternative propulsion systems.

Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk also participated in the Series A funding round through its Maersk Growth branch, attracted in part by the port infrastructure element in Fleetzero’s business model.

“We believe that electrification will be an important part of the mix on our journey to reach net-zero,” explained the company’s Head of Energy Transition, Morten Bo Christiansen, taking note of Fleetzero’s focus on “broader infrastructure.”

Think Globally, Invest Locally

The Series A round also demonstrates that US-based investors can continue to push the decarbonization envelope globally, regardless of temporary shifts in federal energy policy.

Leading the Series A round was the California firm Obvious Ventures. A quick stroll through the firm’s portfolio indicates a focus on transformative technologies that push the energy transition envelope in the US and globally. The list features some familiar faces on the pages of CleanTechnica, including the US advanced geothermal startup Zanskar and California-based Lightship, creator of a battery-powered, self-propelled RV.

Other participants in the Series A round included the New York-based firm 8090 Industries, which is also on the prowl for transformative industrial-scale technologies with a focus on energy, including the Texas SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) startup Cemvita, which has a billion-gallon order under its wing from American Airlines.

Also on the 8090 roster are the electric seaglider startup Regent, the synthentic graphite manufacturer Maple Materials, the renewable energy and thermal storage specialist Exowatt, the advanced geothermal firm Quaise, and the e-fuels specialist Infinium, the startup behind the massive Project Roadrunner renewable energy and e-fuels facility in Texas.

The “seaglider” angle is of interest as a sort of airborne version of Fleetzero’s electric boat. Regent uses seaglider to refer to wing-in-ground watercraft, which generate a cushion of air to lift themselves completely out of water. That distinguishes them from seaplanes, which are aircraft equipped to land on water, but in terms of sustainable transportation the general idea is similar. Both planes can use existing bodies of water instead of runway infrastructure and they can dock at existing port facilities, ideally landing their passengers closer to their ground destinations.

Rounding out the returning Fleetzero investors for Series A are the very familiar US-identified firms Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Y Combinator, among others.

These initiatives are expected to generate more than €44 billion in additional industrial value for the country. The scope of these changes extends to almost all regions except Castilla y León and the island territories. The list ranges from methanol production plants in Asturias to major data centers in Madrid and expansive hydrogen valleys in Andalucía.

In recent years, Spain has become a magnet for foreign investors attracted by low electricity prices driven by the growth of green energy. Until now, however, it has remained unclear exactly how many projects are in the pipeline and where they will be located. Investors often negotiated with several regional authorities at once, leading to confusion and inflated expectations over the number of future enterprises.

Energy and Industry

The spotlight is on the future of nuclear energy. If the operational life of all existing Spanish nuclear power plants is extended beyond 2035, industry could save about 1.4 billion euros annually on energy costs. This is because nuclear generation can reduce wholesale electricity prices by approximately 14 euros per megawatt-hour. Such a move is particularly important for regions with developed industry: Catalonia, País Vasco, Andalucía, and Valencia. Most of these regions have nuclear plants either within their territory or very close by—for example, Catalonia hosts the Ascó and Valdellós plants, Valencia has Cofrentes, and Andalucía is near Almaraz.

Preserving nuclear generation will help maintain the competitiveness of Spanish industry amid rising global energy prices. This will not only reduce costs but also help preserve jobs, which is especially important in regions where industry has traditionally played a key role.

New projects

The industrial development vector is shifting toward new sectors. Andalucía is planning the creation of two major hydrogen valleys—in Palos de la Frontera and San Roque—each potentially adding 1.5 billion euros to the regional economy. In addition, the north of Huelva province is expected to launch a large mining complex extracting zinc, lead, and copper, which could bring in another 450 million euros.

Murcia is preparing to launch a major green hydrogen plant — the Cartagena Large Electrolyzer — which could generate an additional €340 million for the region. Extremadura is becoming a hub for several innovative projects: data centers expected to generate up to €15 billion in added value, a battery cathode production facility (€800 million), and a synthetic diamond plant in Trujillo, where Leonardo DiCaprio is among the investors, with an estimated investment of €730 million.

Technologies and Regions

In Valencia, construction has already begun on a battery production plant in Sagunto, projected to contribute €10 billion to the regional economy. Zaragoza is set to host another battery facility with a potential value of €4.1 billion. Castilla–La Mancha will see the opening of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant capable of adding €4 billion, as well as data centers with a combined value of €750 million.

Madrid isn’t standing by: new data centers under construction here could bring in €930 million. But the greatest potential in this segment belongs to the Altamira project in Cantabria, estimated at €3.6 billion. Asturias is set for a renewable methanol production plant worth €250 million, while Galicia will gain a facility projected to add €190 million.

Industrial Map

Traditional industrial regions such as Catalonia and the Basque Country may miss out on major new projects this time. The main investments and innovations are increasingly shifting to the southern and western regions of the country. This could alter the balance of economic power between regions and create new hubs for high-tech manufacturing.

Overall, Spain stands on the threshold of sweeping change. If all announced projects are implemented, the country will not only gain new jobs and boost GDP, but also have a chance to become a leader in Europe’s industrial transformation. However, much will depend on how quickly stable energy supplies can be secured and a favorable climate for investors created. Time will tell whether these new industries can reshape the country’s economic landscape.",https://russpain.com/wp-content/smush-webp/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-180144-1-780x470.png.webp,N,,2026-01-17 11:56:39.509045

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins Clariant AG doesn’t ""beat"" BASF or Evonik in the absolute sense; these are bigger, more diversified rivals.","The New Chemistry of Advantage: Why Clariant AG Matters Now

In an era where every industrial company claims to be ""green"", Clariant AG is trying something harder: rewiring the guts of global chemicals value chains rather than just polishing the ESG slide deck. The Swiss specialty chemicals group is reshaping its portfolio around high-performance, low?carbon solutions that solve a brutally practical problem for its customers: how to keep making everything from plastics and fuels to detergents and crop protection agents, while slashing emissions, waste, and regulatory risk.

Clariant AG is not a single product in the narrow, gadget sense. It is a tightly curated portfolio with three flagship business areas—Care Chemicals, Catalysis, and Adsorbents & Additives—each engineered to be less commodity, more brainpower. If you’re a refinery trying to hit new clean-fuel standards, a packaging producer under pressure to cut plastic waste, or a consumer brand racing to decarbonize your supply chain, Clariant wants to sit in the critical path.

This pivot toward performance and sustainability is more than branding. Under activist pressure and shifting market economics, Clariant has spent the past several years offloading low-margin, asset-heavy operations and doubling down on higher-return specialties. That transformation is now showing up in its product roadmap—and increasingly, in how investors read Clariant Aktie.

Inside the Flagship: Clariant AG

To understand Clariant AG as a ""product"", you have to think platform, not SKU. The company’s edge comes from translating chemistry R&D into modular solutions that can be tuned for specific industries, regulations, and performance targets. The three core units are increasingly interlinked in how customers actually experience Clariant.

Care Chemicals: Where Sustainability Becomes a Selling Point

Clariant’s Care Chemicals division is the most consumer-facing part of Clariant AG’s portfolio. It powers ingredients for personal care, home care, crop solutions, and industrial applications. The storyline here is clear: bio-based, low-ethoxylate, low-tox formulations that let downstream brands slap ""greener"" on the label without sacrificing performance.

Key pillars include:

Personal & Home Care Ingredients: Surfactants, emulsifiers, rheology modifiers, and actives developed to comply with stricter eco-labels and microplastics regulations. Clariant is investing heavily in naturally derived and renewable raw materials, designed to help brands in Europe, North America, and increasingly Asia-Pacific meet tightening rules without redesigning products from scratch.

Crop Solutions: Formulation aids and adjuvants that help agrochemical producers improve the efficiency and stability of crop protection products. With regulators restricting actives and pushing lower application rates, Clariant’s chemistry is positioned as a way to stretch the performance of existing molecules.

Industrial & Oilfield Chemicals: While more cyclical, these offerings lean on high-performance formulations for corrosion inhibition, lubrication, and process optimization. Here, the selling point is efficiency and uptime rather than pure ESG, but energy transition pressures still loom in the background.

The USP across Care Chemicals is clear: Clariant AG is aiming to be the ""formulation brain"" behind many of the world’s consumer and agro brands, turning regulatory pain into premium-margin chemistry.

Catalysis: Small Pellets, Big Decarbonization Bets

If Care Chemicals is how Clariant touches consumers, Catalysis is how it touches the energy transition. Clariant’s Catalysis segment designs and manufactures catalysts for petrochemicals, syngas, hydrogen production, and increasingly, sustainable fuels and chemical recycling.

Strategic highlights include:

Sustainable fuels and bio-based processes: Clariant has invested in catalyst systems that enable bioethanol, bio-based chemicals, and renewable fuels production. These play directly into mandates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, particularly in Europe and the U.S.

Hydrogen and syngas: The company offers catalysts used in steam methane reforming and related processes, and is positioning strongly for low-carbon hydrogen supply chains. As blue and turquoise hydrogen scale, optimized catalysts become a decisive lever for both efficiency and CO? intensity.

Chemical recycling: Clariant’s catalysts support depolymerization and pyrolysis processes that convert plastic waste back into feedstock. It’s an early-stage market, but one with huge regulatory and reputational tailwinds for Clariant’s customers.

In all of these areas, Clariant AG isn’t trying to build plants; it’s trying to be the indispensable, high-margin enabler that refineries, chemical companies, and recyclers can’t swap out without painful requalification.

Adsorbents & Additives: Quiet Infrastructure for Circular Materials

The Adsorbents & Additives unit is where Clariant AG gets closest to the circular economy buzzwords—without the fluff. This business provides:

Plastic additives that enhance stability, color, flame resistance, and recyclability of polymers, with a growing focus on enabling higher recycled content and longer lifecycles for plastics used in packaging, automotive, and electronics.

Purification adsorbents for edible oils, fuels, and industrial fluids, removing impurities that affect quality, safety, or regulatory compliance.

Foundry and mineral solutions that improve casting quality, process efficiency, and environmental performance in heavy industry.

This is the under-the-hood portfolio: you rarely see Clariant’s name on the final product, but the properties that regulators, OEMs, and consumers care about—recyclability, durability, safety—often ride on these additives and adsorbents.

A Portfolio Rewired Around Specialty, not Scale

Over the last few years, Clariant AG has taken significant steps to make this portfolio more coherent and more profitable. It has exited commoditized businesses like pigments and certain parts of standard performance chemicals, using disposals and joint ventures to sharpen its focus. The goal is a tighter, higher-ROCE mix driven by proprietary formulations and technical applications expertise, rather than sheer volume.

That repositioning changes how Clariant competes. Instead of fighting on cost per ton, it’s trying to win on:

Application know-how: Deep, collaborative engineering with customers—especially in Catalysis and Care Chemicals.

Sustainability credentials: Lifecycle analysis, bio-based feedstocks, and products engineered to meet or pre-empt new rules.

Global reach with regional customisation: R&D and technical centers close to growth markets, especially in Asia, where demand for both performance and sustainability is rising fast.

Market Rivals: Clariant Aktie vs. The Competition

Clariant AG doesn’t operate in a vacuum. It faces heavyweight competition across its three main domains. Compared directly to these rival ""product systems"", its strategy looks both differentiated and constrained.

Evonik Industries: Competing Portfolios in Specialty and Care

In Care Chemicals and selected specialty additives, one of Clariant’s sharpest competitors is Evonik Industries AG. Evonik’s product suite for personal care, home care, and specialty additives overlaps significantly with Clariant AG’s Care Chemicals and Adsorbents & Additives, and it is pushing its own sustainability narrative hard.

Compared directly to Evonik’s Care Solutions portfolio, Clariant AG positions itself with:

Strengths: Highly focused on bio-based and naturally derived formulations; a track record of early moves into eco-label compliant surfactants and preservatives; and strong relationships with premium and mid-tier consumer brands that need rapid formulation updates as regulations change.

Weaknesses: Evonik often has greater scale and breadth in some ingredient categories, and deeper exposure to high-value life-science applications, which can support higher long-term margins. Evonik’s diversified specialty portfolio can sometimes cushion sector-specific downturns better than Clariant’s more concentrated mix.

In additives, Evonik’s High Performance Polymers and Additives suite attacks many of the same pain points—e.g., thermal stability and durability for engineering plastics—where Clariant AG competes by pushing recyclability and circularity as added differentiators.

BASF SE: The Integrated Giant vs. the Focused Specialist

On the other flank is BASF SE, the world’s largest chemical company, with deep integration from basic chemicals to advanced specialties. BASF’s Care Chemicals and Performance Chemicals segments are a direct match-up with major parts of Clariant AG.

Compared directly to BASF’s Care Chemicals and Performance Products baskets:

Clariant’s advantages: As a more focused specialty player, Clariant can move faster in certain niches, especially where regulation and sustainability are moving targets. Its product development cycles are often more agile, and its portfolio pruning means less internal competition for capital with massive commodity units.

BASF’s advantages: BASF wields unmatched feedstock integration, cost leverage, and scale in R&D. It can bundle solutions across multiple value chain steps, making it harder for smaller customers to switch. In catalysts, BASF’s Process Catalysts unit is a formidable competitor to Clariant’s Catalysis, with a broad lineup for petrochemicals, emissions control, and energy transition applications.

In catalysis specifically, compared directly to BASF’s process catalysts for syngas, hydrogen, and emission control, Clariant AG leans on its sharper focus on renewable fuels, biomass conversion, and chemical recycling as a way to differentiate where large incumbents may be more conservative.

Solvay / Syensqo and the Battle for Advanced Materials

Clariant AG also skirts competition from players like Solvay (with its spin-off Syensqo focusing on advanced materials and specialty chemistries). While the portfolios don’t map perfectly, there is overlap in high-performance additives and polymer solutions.

Compared directly to Solvay’s advanced materials and specialty polymers offerings, Clariant AG tends to focus less on the polymer backbone and more on the tuning elements—additives and modifiers that give standard polymers new life in circular systems. Solvay may win on high-tech, aerospace-grade materials; Clariant aims to win where mainstream plastics meet real-world recycling and regulatory constraints.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Clariant AG doesn’t ""beat"" BASF or Evonik in the absolute sense; these are bigger, more diversified rivals. But in its chosen lanes, it’s building a distinct competitive edge.

1. Sustainability as an Engineering Constraint, Not a Marketing Label

In many of Clariant AG’s flagship families—whether in Care Chemicals or Catalysis—sustainability is baked in at the design stage. That means products built for:

Regulatory resilience: Formulations that pre-empt upcoming restrictions on certain chemicals of concern, microplastics, or CO? intensity, giving customers a longer compliance runway.

Lifecycle performance: Additives and catalysts engineered not just for immediate performance, but for recyclability, lower energy use, and reduced waste over the product lifecycle.

Where some competitors retrofit existing chemistries with sustainability narratives, Clariant AG is increasingly building its portfolio with sustainability as a non-negotiable design requirement. For customers, that translates into fewer reformulations, fewer supply disruptions, and a clearer ESG story.

2. Focused Portfolio = Sharper Capital Allocation

By exiting commoditized or structurally low-margin businesses, Clariant AG has freed capital and management bandwidth for specialties with better pricing power. That shows up in three ways:

Higher R&D intensity in targeted niches, especially in renewable fuels catalysts, circular plastics additives, and bio-based surfactants.

More disciplined M&A, with bolt-on deals aimed at deepening technology or market access in specific growth pockets, rather than broad diversification plays.

Clearer narrative to customers and investors, who increasingly understand Clariant as a focused specialty player rather than a sprawling chemicals conglomerate.

3. Co-development and Technical Support as Stickiness Engines

In catalysis and high-performance additives, switching costs are real—and Clariant knows it. Its technical service and co-development model creates sticky relationships: once a refinery, polymer converter, or consumer brand co-designs a process around Clariant’s technology, the appetite to switch purely for a small price difference is low.

Compared to giants like BASF, Clariant AG can sometimes be a more nimble development partner, especially for mid-sized customers that want top-tier technical support without being a rounding error in a mega-portfolio.

4. Leveraging Megatrends: Energy Transition and Circular Plastics

Clariant AG’s portfolio lines up squarely with two of the strongest structural drivers in chemicals:

Energy transition: Through its Catalysis segment, it is embedded in hydrogen, sustainable fuels, and lower-carbon petrochemicals—areas where volumes might be volatile, but value per ton of catalyst is high.

Circular materials and eco-design: Through Adsorbents & Additives and Care Chemicals, it plays at the interface where plastics, packaging, and consumer products need to reconcile performance with recyclability and environmental pressure.

That doesn’t immunize Clariant from cycles, but it does anchor the growth story in themes that are likely to outlast individual economic downturns.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

For investors watching Clariant Aktie (ISIN CH0012142631), the transformation of Clariant AG’s product and business mix is central to the equity story. The stock reflects not just quarterly demand for catalysts or additives, but a more structural bet on whether this portfolio can consistently command specialty-level margins.

The company’s shift from bulk and standard chemicals toward higher-value specialties has several implications for valuation:

Margin profile: Specialty-dominated portfolios typically trade at higher earnings multiples than commodity chemicals, assuming execution is credible. Clariant’s growing exposure to high-margin catalysts and differentiated additives is a core reason investors track its product roadmap so closely.

Cyclicality: While Clariant AG remains exposed to industrial and energy cycles—refinery investments, consumer demand, construction, automotive—it is less tied to pure volume swings in basic chemicals. That can justify a smoother earnings profile over time, a key consideration for institutional investors.

ESG and capital flows: Many sustainability-focused funds and mandates are shifting capital away from pure commodity chemicals and toward companies that enable decarbonization and circularity. Clariant’s positioning in sustainable fuels catalysts, chemical recycling, and bio-based ingredients increases its relevance to this investor base.

At the same time, execution risk is real. Underperformance in major catalyst projects, slower-than-expected adoption of chemical recycling, or setbacks in regulatory-driven demand for greener ingredients could weigh on growth expectations and, by extension, on Clariant Aktie. Competitive pressure from integrated rivals like BASF or innovation-centric peers like Evonik adds another layer of risk.

For now, the trajectory of Clariant AG’s product strategy is clear: fewer commodities, more brains; fewer tons, more value per ton. As that mix deepens, the stock increasingly trades not just on volume and cost, but on how convincingly Clariant can claim a premium spot in the global specialty chemicals hierarchy.

In that sense, Clariant AG is more than a portfolio of molecules. It is a live experiment in whether a mid-sized European chemicals player can reinvent itself as a critical enabler of the low?carbon, circular economy—and be paid accordingly in both margins and market capitalization.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404993_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 10:57:40.353481

The number of operational sugar mills has also risen to 518, compared with 500 at the same stage a year ago, reflecting steady crushing progress across major producing states.
Uttar Pradesh has produced 46.05 lakh tonnes, around 8% higher than last year, while Karnataka has reported a 13% rise in output so far this season.
Recent increases in sugarcane prices by several state governments have widened the gap between input costs and sugar realisations.
ISMA has proposed comprehensive GST rationalisation across the biofuels and clean mobility ecosystem, including sharp cuts in GST on flex-fuel vehicles, strong hybrid electric vehicles, higher ethanol blends such as E85 and E100, ethanol production machinery, and ethanol-based cookstoves.","With India’s sugar production recording a sharp increase in the ongoing 2025-26 season, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) has called on the government to use the Union Budget 2026-27 to push tax rationalisation and policy support for biofuels and clean mobility, while also addressing rising financial stress in the sugar sector.

As of January 15, 2026, all-India sugar production has reached 159.09 lakh tonnes, nearly 22% higher than the 130.44 lakh tonnes produced during the same period last year. The number of operational sugar mills has also risen to 518, compared with 500 at the same stage a year ago, reflecting steady crushing progress across major producing states.

Maharashtra has emerged as the strongest performer, with sugar production at 64.50 lakh tonnes, marking a 51% year-on-year increase, supported by higher crushing rates and an increase in the number of operating mills. Uttar Pradesh has produced 46.05 lakh tonnes, around 8% higher than last year, while Karnataka has reported a 13% rise in output so far this season.

Despite the robust production trend, ISMA cautioned that mill finances are under growing pressure. Recent increases in sugarcane prices by several state governments have widened the gap between input costs and sugar realisations. Ex-mill sugar prices in key producing states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka have slipped to around ₹3,550 per quintal, significantly below the current cost of production. As inventories build up, the industry fears a rise in cane payment arrears unless corrective policy measures are taken.

In this context, ISMA has renewed its demand for an early revision of the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar, arguing that a cost-aligned MSP is critical to restoring financial viability, ensuring timely cane payments to farmers, and maintaining market stability — without adding to the government’s fiscal burden.

Alongside immediate market concerns, the association is pushing for longer-term structural reforms through the upcoming Union Budget. ISMA has proposed comprehensive GST rationalisation across the biofuels and clean mobility ecosystem, including sharp cuts in GST on flex-fuel vehicles, strong hybrid electric vehicles, higher ethanol blends such as E85 and E100, ethanol production machinery, and ethanol-based cookstoves.

The industry body has also sought targeted financial support for advanced biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), green bio-hydrogen, compressed biogas (CBG) and isobutanol blending with diesel, while proposing the transformation of sugar mills into integrated bio-energy hubs producing ethanol, gas, hydrogen and green power.

ISMA argues that with surplus ethanol capacity, established production infrastructure and technologies already validated in India, biofuels offer an immediate pathway to reduce emissions, cut fuel imports and stabilise rural incomes. As Budget 2026-27 approaches, the sugar industry is looking to the government to balance short-term relief with long-term clean energy policy support to ensure that a strong production season does not translate into financial stress for mills and farmers.",https://i0.wp.com/a2ztaxcorp.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sugar-industry-seeks-GST-relief-on-biofuels-as-sugar-output-jumps-22-this-season.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:56:50.088587

The report said Mexico’s energy ministry is expected to outline targets and possible pathways for biofuel production and consumption in sector plans scheduled to be released in 2026.

It noted that these policy efforts, together with initiatives related to sustainable aviation fuel and other biomass-based fuels, could increase demand for US ethanol as well as sorghum and other raw materials.

Mexico is also considering changes to an existing technical standard that limits ethanol blending in petrol to 5.8 per cent and currently does not allow ethanol blending in major cities such as Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey.

According to the report, Mexico produces only a small volume of ethanol, mainly from sugarcane, and depends on imports to meet more than 90 per cent of its ethanol consumption.

The report added that the use of fuel ethanol in Mexico remains low because of regulatory restrictions and the limited scale of domestic ethanol production.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ethanol-pump.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 08:57:01.478890

Many hydrogen projects, too, are “grey”, with hydrogen generated from methane, which releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Hokkaido, however, is home to multiple “green” hydrogen projects – with the gas produced entirely through clean energy sources.
“For 10 years from fiscal 2014, Japan CCS conducted a survey of potential storage sites offshore from Japan,” Mr Sawada said.
Still, despite the progress of Hokkaido’s green efforts, stakeholders admit to challenges.","– Many would think of whisky or fresh milk when it comes to Hokkaido-made beverages.

Add wine to the list. Mr Takahiko Soga’s pinot noirs, meticulously crafted in the terroir of Yoichi that is better known as the home of Nikka Whisky, have achieved cult status among connoisseurs.

The limited-production wines are so popular that one bottle of Domaine Takahiko wine can command thousands of dollars in Michelin-starred restaurants worldwide. The annual harvest in October draws an international pilgrimage of oenologists and sommeliers eager to volunteer on his 4ha field.

The 52-year-old is not native to

Hokkaido’s burgeoning wine country

. Born into a wine-making family near Nozawa Onsen in mountainous Nagano prefecture, Mr Soga packed his bags for Yoichi in 2009 with nothing but conviction that the town’s potential for high-end wines will only grow as climate change pushed the so-called “wine belt” northwards.

“I took a gamble, and in a sense, I won,” he gamely said.

His wager has paid off spectacularly as a pioneering vintner in Hokkaido, where the number of wineries has tripled to 73 in the decade to May 2025. One in four of them is located in Yoichi, the rapid expansion being a direct consequence of climate change creating surprisingly favourable viticultural conditions.

This is part of the changing face of Hokkaido caused by global warming, altering the types of produce from the island and also affecting the seasons, with more instances of extreme weather events like intense “guerilla rainstorms”, as the Japanese call it, and droughts, especially during summer. Hokkaido endured

an exceptionally brutal summer in 2025

, with the mercury 3.7 deg C higher than average.

And that is where Mr Soga’s ebullience has given way to concerns that the drastic temperature fluctuations have impacted the quality of his wines. In 2025, he took out a loan to construct a barrel cellar to ensure wine can be stored in cooler conditions.

The Straits Times visited Hokkaido twice in late 2025 to observe the impact of climate change on what has traditionally been Japan’s breadbasket.

Salmon and scallops

Warmer climes are starting to leave an indelible impact on the prefecture’s prized agriculture and fisheries industry, which means the food it produces and exports are changing even as experts are racing against time to protect farming livelihoods by creating heat- and pest-resistant cultivars.

Aquaculture, meanwhile, has become more important to mitigate the effect of warmer seas on wild fishing.

And as seasons start to change, there is a clear risk to its hospitality industry. Hokkaido, often associated with cooler summers, has suffered sweltering summers with the mercury surging to 39 deg C in the eastern city of Kitami in 2025. Warmer winters, too, would threaten the volume and quality of snow that winter sports enthusiasts flock to the island for.

Warmer temperatures could also well trigger more intense blizzards that can cause travel chaos, like

the one in December 2025

.

While it is now more conducive to grow crops such as wine grapes, rice and eggplants, the quality of other produce like potatoes, onions and beans has been affected by warmer weather.

Tropical and subtropical marine species like amberjack and puffer fish are now being caught in the warmer waters off Hokkaido.

Meanwhile, catches for seafood like mackerel and squid are declining, as are those for salmon, for which the 2025 autumn catch was its worst on record at 5.6 million, down 64.1 per cent from a year ago, according to prefecture figures on Jan 13. Salmon prices on the market are now 1.5 times of previous years’.

Production of Hokkaido’s famous scallops, while previously stable with moderate fluctuations, is likely to decline 17 per cent to 336,000 tonnes for the year ending March 2026, according to Hokkaido Fisheries Association forecasts.

These changes matter not just to Japan’s food security, but also the island’s global image. Food is one of the things that make Hokkaido popular among Japanese and the 2.83 million international visitors it saw in 2024.

There are other changes at work. Global warming is also an engine of reinvention, giving impetus for the prefecture of five million people to establish itself as a dynamo for clean energy.

Hokkaido’s vast untouched expanses and favourable climate conditions have resulted in renewable energy comprising 40.4 per cent of the prefecture’s energy mix, outpacing the 26 per cent nationwide.

This would not translate into any direct impact for visitors to Hokkaido today, beyond how they will notice more wind and solar farms and batteries for electricity storage as they travel from New Chitose Airport to destinations like Niseko, Biei or Asahikawa.

But this is a statement of how Hokkaido sees its responsibility towards protecting its rich natural environment. Only by taking steps towards carbon neutrality can irreversible changes to the climate be prevented, thus ensuring that in the long run, generations of future visitors will still be able to continue enjoying its powder snow in winter and excellent produce.

And Hokkaido believes it has the potential to boost Japan’s overall woeful energy self-sufficiency rate of 15.2 per cent.

“I believe that Japan cannot achieve carbon neutrality without the success of Hokkaido’s clean-energy projects,” averred Ms Kaori Nishiyama, Sapporo’s director-general of green transformation (GX) promotion.

GX is how Japan describes its key policy to reform its economy and social systems to achieve decarbonisation and economic growth simultaneously.

“Hokkaido ranks first among Japan’s 47 prefectures for its wind, solar, hydropower energy generation, and second for geothermal,” she said, adding that there are plans to build power transmission lines that will allow Hokkaido to directly share power with the Tokyo Metropolitan Region.

Mr Sean Kidney, chief executive of non-government organisation Climate Bonds Initiative that aims to mobilise global capital for green projects, said: “The challenge for Japan is whether it can transition and phase out fossil fuels fast enough, and Hokkaido is central to this as the powerhouse of energy security going forward.”

He added: “There’s no technological barrier; there’s no pricing barrier. The barrier is policy in Japan.”

Dual ambitions

Hokkaido’s aspirations to be a clean energy powerhouse dovetail with its ambition to be Japan’s digital economy hub.

It hosts a semiconductor foundry and is actively wooing data centres, both of which are notorious for their huge appetites for energy.

Mr Yasumitsu Okazaki of the next generation energy department at Hokkaido Electric Power Company (HEPCO) said: “The power demand in Hokkaido had been expected to gradually decrease (due to its declining population), but now everyone is staking their expectations on its renewable energy potential as the energy demand is forecast to rise 1.5 times by 2040.”

But stakeholders believe Hokkaido can meet rising energy needs in a green way, given its rich potential for renewable energy. The cooler temperatures, relative to elsewhere in Japan, also make it more energy- and cost-efficient to host semiconductor foundries and data centres.

The city of Chitose is home to Rapidus, the government-backed chipmaker that hopes to mass-produce advanced 2 nanometre (nm) semiconductors by 2027 and, subsequently, 1.4nm and 1nm chips. This would put it on a par with other global manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), Samsung and Intel.

Hokkaido also aims to add to the 45 data centres spread out across the prefecture as at June 2025.

One facility in the coastal city of Ishikari, 15km from Sapporo, has trail-blazing potential for being Japan’s first zero-emission data centre.

Managed by Kyocera Communication Systems, the site that opened in October 2024 is powered entirely by a nearby commercial offshore wind farm, as well as the company’s own solar panels and batteries.

Site manager Tetsu Ogata said: “We combine the two fluctuating renewable energy sources to cover our needs, and when this is insufficient, we have storage batteries that can fill the gap.”

He added: “This is the first 24/7 carbon-free energy consumption data centre in Japan, and while it’s still very gradual right now, I think this will become a long-term trend as more data centres are built.”

Japanese tech and investment giant Softbank, meanwhile, has announced that its new Tomakomai AI Data Centre, which will open by March 2027, will likewise be fully powered by renewable energy.

‘Shaking’ things up

All this would arguably be more difficult if there were no national backing for Hokkaido and Sapporo to establish a clear niche for themselves.

Japan is targeting 150 trillion yen (S$1.22 trillion) in public-private GX investment over 10 years from 2023, of which at least 40 trillion yen is earmarked for Hokkaido.

That led to the formation of the Team Sapporo-Hokkaido (TSH) consortium in June 2023, comprising 21 institutions from industry, academia, government and finance.

The consortium identified eight key areas of focus: offshore wind, next-generation semiconductors, data centres, hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), battery storage, submarine DC power lines, and cargo ships transporting renewable energy batteries and hydrogen.

Subsequently in June 2024, Japan designated Hokkaido and Sapporo jointly as a “national strategic special zone” for financial and asset management businesses with a GX focus, offering deregulation, tax incentives and streamlined support.

The Sapporo Transnational Expansion and Partnership has since fielded inquiries from more than 200 overseas companies looking to expand into Hokkaido.

To further woo institutional investors and channel capital into sustainable projects, the Hokkaido ESG Pro Bond Market was launched at the Sapporo Securities Exchange in September 2025 as Japan’s first sustainability bond market.

And set to be launched in February 2026 is the SPARX Sapporo-Hokkaido GX Fund, a public-private investment vehicle managed by asset management company SPARX Group, with an ultimate goal of reaching 10 billion yen for start-ups and new innovations.

There is also growing excitement in Hokkaido’s start-up ecosystem. Hokkaido University has been going big on environmental research, with ongoing projects such as the development of a direct air capture coating that can transform concrete into a carbon dioxide absorber, with commercialisation planned for 2026.

The incubator Startup Hokkaido is now supporting nearly 200 start-ups, mainly in the fields of agriculture, space and energy. Come February 2026, it will host its first global start-up accelerator event, SHAKE-H, a pun on the prefecture’s ambitions to “shake things up” with salmon (sha-ke), the famous seafood catch.

A green future

Japan is staking its decarbonised future on nuclear energy, as it fires up atomic plants that were mothballed after the 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima. One of the seven reactors at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant – the world’s largest – will be restarted on Jan 20.

Tomari Nuclear Power Plant, which has three reactors, is Hokkaido’s only nuclear facility. Unit 3 was on Dec 10 given the green light to restart by Governor Naomichi Suzuki.

While Japan’s largest prefecture has plenty of space to host more nuclear plants, Hokkaido sees other clean energy sources as playing a far larger role – even if they have run into problems elsewhere.

The island now leads Japan in solar power generation, although mega-solar projects have caused a backlash, given their negative impact on wildlife ecosystems and their destruction of pristine scenery. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s government has said it will end subsidies for such projects, and instead boost incentives for next-generation solar cells and rooftop solar systems.

While one of the projects that has attracted criticism is a development near the Kushiro Wetlands in eastern Hokkaido, Sapporo’s GX chief, Ms Nishiyama, believes in the need to separate the wheat from the chaff.

The Team Sapporo-Hokkaido consortium, she said, does not back such mega solar projects that are deemed to harm the environment, instead only supporting projects with proper environmental impact assessments and which have won local understanding.

Hokkaido also leads Japan in wind power generation, although this has been no small feat.

At Ishikari Bay New Port Offshore Wind Farm, which began operations in January 2024, 14 turbines produce enough electricity to theoretically power 83,000 households. On site are 240 storage batteries to mitigate intermittency.

The plant counts among its clients Kyocera Communication Systems’ zero-emission data centre in the city.

Ms Kumi Sakaida of Green Power Investment Corporation, which oversees the farm, said it took 17 years for the Hokkaido farm to come to fruition, as it had to conduct feasibility tests, overcome regulatory hurdles and woo investors, among other things.

But she said the efforts had been worthwhile. She declined to comment on whether the farm has turned a profit, citing confidentiality.

Yet Green Power’s achievement belies headwinds surrounding wind power after Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp pulled out of three planned projects off the coasts of Chiba and Akita prefectures due to swelling material and labour costs. The retreat prompted the government to look at ways, such as subsidies, to help ensure that offshore wind power operators can avoid massive losses.

Ms Sakaida argued that it was necessary to bite the bullet and seek ways to overcome challenges. She said: “Even if there are headwinds, I believe we should make efforts to introduce renewable energy by facing matters outside our control head-on and overcoming them.”

Hydrogen strategy

In 2017, Japan formulated the world’s first national hydrogen strategy. But the country has not made much commercial progress on this front, given the universal criticisms that the gas is too expensive to produce and too difficult to store and transport.

Many hydrogen projects, too, are “grey”, with hydrogen generated from methane, which releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Hokkaido, however, is home to multiple “green” hydrogen projects – with the gas produced entirely through clean energy sources.

Japanese industrial gas company AirWater opened a hydrogen refuelling station in the centre of Sapporo in April 2025, which can accommodate large commercial fuel cell vehicles like buses and trucks.

It has a stake in a “hydrogen farm” in the town of Shikaoi, where there are about 100 dairy farms that raise 21,000 dairy cows. The farm converts livestock manure into biogas and then hydrogen, with the residual heat generated in the process used to raise sturgeon and even grow mangoes in winter.

In a separate project, HEPCO runs a 1MW electrolysis facility as a demonstration project to create hydrogen from water using renewable energy. The company intends to scale up and build a 100MW plant that would be the largest in Japan.

And SPARX Green Energy and Technology, a subsidiary of SPARX Group, uses a mix of solar power and biogas generated from a nearby waste disposal facility for round-the-clock hydrogen production in Tomakomai.

It supplies the power to a nearby municipal hot spring, and chemical factories, and to heat gyms and showers at Toyota Motor’s Hokkaido factory.

“We are building a supply chain for production, transportation and use, and we are working to strengthen the cost competitiveness of hydrogen,” said Mr Masaya Kobayashi, vice-president of business development at SPARX Green Energy and Technology.

Current production is relatively low, enough to power about 300 households. But he added: “We’d like to transport hydrogen more often, and our operating rate is still below 50 per cent because it’s still a demonstration.”

Tomakomai is also home to an offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration project, which is Japan’s first such sizeable showcase of a technology regarded by some as critical for carbon neutrality.

The site is managed by Japan CCS, which was set up in 2008 to conduct trial projects for the government. It captured 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide generated from an adjacent oil refinery and injected the gas to be permanently stored in geological formations deep beneath the seabed.

“After storage, the gas eventually mineralises,” said corporate adviser Yoshihiro Sawada.

Such injections were conducted between April 2016 and November 2019, with the company still monitoring for anomalies. None has been found so far.

Elsewhere, the company is involved in trials to transport carbon dioxide by ship, as it tries to identify the best conditions for liquefaction, storage and transportation to achieve larger volumes and lower costs.

“For 10 years from fiscal 2014, Japan CCS conducted a survey of potential storage sites offshore from Japan,” Mr Sawada said. “It was estimated that suitable geological formations for carbon dioxide storage exist at 11 locations, with a total capacity of 16 billion tonnes.”

Among these was a Tomakomai site, which can accommodate the injection of 1.5 million to two million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, and has been earmarked by the Japanese government for a commercialised CCS project.

Still, despite the progress of Hokkaido’s green efforts, stakeholders admit to challenges.

Ms Nishiyama noted that Hokkaido’s weakness is its hitherto lack of large manufacturing industries, which had meant less demand for electricity than other industrial areas.

“We are just at the starting line as compared with other regions around the world,” she said, noting that generating positive momentum was critical for the success of Hokkaido’s GX ambitions.

Mr Hideki Takada, director of the Finance Ministry-affiliated GX Acceleration Agency, is so convinced of Hokkaido’s potential that he made nine trips there in 14 months.

But he was concerned by global trends. He said: “Every day there is negative news somewhere in the world about decarbonisation and sustainable finance, or political backlash against sustainability, or some sort of regulatory fatigue. And then there are rising prices, all of which are making GX projects harder.”

Living with nature

Yet the impact of climate change is increasingly being felt – never as a linear, steady rise in warming but an increase in variability with more frequent and intense episodes of heatwaves, downpours, droughts and other extreme weather events.

“If the temperature rises steadily and in a predictable way, we can somehow adapt. Rather, the variations are getting worse,” said Dr Eiji Goto of the Hokkaido Research Organisation’s Central Agricultural Experiment Station.

He added that his agency was urgently trying to grow cultivars that are resistant to crops and heat, while maintaining quality and yield.

Mr Soga of Domaine Takahiko cannot help but wonder if things will get worse for him.

While Yoichi has gained a reputation for its pinot noirs, newcomers are instead growing grapes for chardonnays and merlots, which can thrive in warmer climates, Mr Soga said.

He has focused solely on producing the best quality pinot noir he can, knowing that diversifying would be too challenging for a small business like his, which makes only 25,000 bottles a year.

“Even if I decide to switch varieties, it is not as if everything can change overnight. Grapevines take three or four years to bear a good harvest,” Mr Soga said, adding that he hopes to learn how other wine-producing regions afflicted with climate change have adapted.

The father of three children aged 15, 12 and six, mused: “No one knows what the future holds. Everyone has to face nature, so it’s important to use intuition – in Japanese, we call it sensitivity – when working with the environment. And this is something that must be passed on to the next generation.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a3a52cba0f307588f1b4db8a00efff819304ae7ca1ce8e2c6937702423462675,N,,2026-01-17 08:57:07.369512

• Washington State University Tri-Cities is leading a multi-million dollar regional initiative backed by $20 million in combined state funding and private investment to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel development

• The university's Sustainable Options in Aviation Research lab positions the region as a national leader in developing ""drop-in"" fuels that work with existing aircraft, addressing a major industry challenge

• While sustainable aviation fuel adoption is growing rapidly, it still represents less than 0.1% of total jet fuel usage, creating massive opportunities for the Tri-Cities research hub

RICHLAND, Wash. — Washington State University Tri-Cities has emerged as a central player in a multi-million-dollar statewide effort to expand sustainable aviation fuel production, positioning the region at the forefront of a global industry transformation that could reshape aviation's environmental impact.

The university serves as a lead research partner in the newly launched Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, supported by $10 million in state funding and matched by $10 million from an anonymous private donor. The program represents Washington's major step toward reducing aviation emissions while maintaining current flight operations.

WSU Tri-Cities' Sustainable Options in Aviation Research lab, known as SOAR, positions the region as a national leader in developing sustainable aviation fuels. The lab leverages partnerships with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and local agriculture to create a bio-based energy hub that attracts tech talent and supports Washington's clean energy goals.

The initiative builds on earlier state investment, including $6.5 million allocated by the Washington State Legislature in the 2023-2025 Transportation Budget to establish a sustainable aviation fuel Research & Development Center at Snohomish County's Paine Field. Federal support has also bolstered the effort, with the Federal Aviation Administration awarding $38 million in 2024 to four Washington projects, including efforts involving WSU's partners, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.

The accelerator was unveiled earlier this month at Boeing's Future of Flight facility in Everett, bringing together state leaders, industry partners, and researchers from around the world. WSU Tri-Cities faculty attended the event, showcasing the testing and analysis conducted in the Tri-Cities.

At the heart of the university's contribution is the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, which operates as one of the most comprehensive SAF testing facilities in the United States. The lab has evaluated nearly 500 fuel samples from North America, Europe and Asia, focusing particularly on converting agricultural waste into fuel.

The collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory creates powerful synergy, combining WSU's expertise in biotechnology with PNNL's strengths in catalysis and thermal processing for bio-based fuels. This partnership drives economic development by fostering high-tech manufacturing jobs and boosting the competitiveness of the Northwest's agriculture and forestry industries by finding value in waste streams.

""We play a critical role in facilitating companies that, as they go through that scaling process from really low volumes to commercial gallons of millions and billions, that their process remains consistent and aligns with the expectations of airlines and airframers,"" said Josh Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab.

The facility focuses on ensuring new fuels can perform safely under real-world flight conditions, with researchers leading efforts in testing, finishing, and scaling SAF production. The work directly supports other state initiatives, such as the SAF Center at Paine Field, by providing the testing and validation needed for commercial-scale blending and scaling.

""Most of our tests revolve around safety, safety first, safety last, safety everywhere in between,"" Heyne said. ""These test results, normally, are shared directly with producers. We are under material transfer agreements, NDAs. Those institutions that we conduct the testing for, then take that information and maybe tweak their process or have the confidence to move forward.""

The research focuses heavily on developing ""drop-in"" fuel innovation, particularly lignin-based fuels and other processes that aim to create 100% SAF fully compatible with existing aircraft. This addresses a major industry challenge and advances Washington's clean energy leadership by developing cost-effective, low-impact production methods.

The initiative operates on an ambitious timeline, with major production expected to ramp up around 2030 for regional goals. Industry partners like SkyNRG are targeting 50 million gallons per year, while the broader Cascadia region aims to reach a billion-gallon goal by 2035. National targets call for 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel to be produced by 2030.

The work comes at a critical time for the aviation industry. While sustainable aviation fuel adoption is growing rapidly—production doubled in 2023 and over 50 airlines now use SAF—it still represents less than 0.1% of total jet fuel usage, according to industry analysts. This creates massive opportunities for research facilities like those at WSU Tri-Cities.

Major carriers like Delta, United, and Lufthansa have pledged to use substantial amounts of SAF, recognizing its potential to reduce emissions by up to 65%. However, airlines face significant challenges, including high costs—often two to four times conventional fuel—and limited supply.

Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from renewable sources such as agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and other organic materials. Unlike traditional jet fuel derived from petroleum, SAF can reduce aviation emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle while requiring no modifications to existing aircraft engines or fuel infrastructure.

Key obstacles to widespread adoption include high production costs, insufficient feedstock availability, and the need for robust global policies to drive investment and scale production. Industry experts from McKinsey & Company and the International Air Transport Association say SAF represents the most viable path to achieve net-zero aviation by 2050.

The development promises substantial economic benefits for the Tri-Cities region. University leaders say the sustainable aviation fuel initiative will generate high-skill jobs in research, engineering, and production, attract millions in research funding, and bring global attention to the area. The program positions the region as a key hub in the emerging clean energy aviation sector.

As part of the accelerator program, WSU Tri-Cities is partnering with others to establish a new sustainable aviation fuel research and development center at Paine Field. The facility will include the world's first global SAF fuel repository, or ""fuel bank,"" which will store and test experimental fuels from around the world.

The researchers are particularly focused on testing new lignin-based fuels and on creating a comprehensive testing nexus to serve the global aviation industry. Key milestones include a 2023 business plan for the R&D center and ongoing work to meet national production targets.

The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator represents a coordinated effort to address climate concerns in the aviation industry while maintaining the economic viability of air travel. The program leverages Washington's existing aerospace industry expertise and research capabilities to advance sustainable fuel technologies.

The initiative comes as the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact. Traditional jet fuel contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, making sustainable alternatives a priority for airlines, manufacturers, and regulators worldwide. The slow but steady rise in SAF adoption signifies the aviation industry's serious commitment to sustainability, moving beyond carbon offsetting to tangible fuel changes.

WSU Tri-Cities' involvement in the program builds on the university's established reputation in energy research and its strategic location in a region known for scientific innovation.

Dekarbonisasi kini semakin sering dipresentasikan sebagai agenda global yang seragam dan mendesak. berbagai negara didorong menurunkan emisi secepat mungkin, dengan asumsi bahwa satu jalur kebijakan dapat diterapkan di semua konteks pembangunan.

Dalam narasi ini, pengurangan emisi ditempatkan sebagai tujuan utama, sementara industrialisasi, penciptaan lapangan kerja, dan pertumbuhan ekonomi kerap diperlakukan sebagai variabel penyesuaian. Pendekatan semacam ini menyimpan persoalan serius bagi negara berkembang. Tanpa desain kebijakan yang cermat, dekarbonisasi justru berisiko mendorong deindustrialisasi dini.

Bagi negara berkembang, industri bukan sekadar sektor ekonomi tambahan. Industri adalah fondasi transformasi struktural, sumber utama nilai tambah, serta penyerap tenaga kerja dalam skala besar. Melalui industrialisasi, produktivitas meningkat, basis pajak diperluas, dan ketahanan sosial diperkuat.

Mengorbankan industri demi target dekarbonisasi yang tidak kontekstual berarti melemahkan kemampuan negara untuk tumbuh dan meningkatkan kesejahteraan. Karena itu, tantangan kebijakan publik sesungguhnya bukan memilih antara dekarbonisasi atau industrialisasi, melainkan memastikan keduanya berjalan simultan dan saling memperkuat.

Pengalaman negara maju sering dijadikan rujukan dalam perumusan kebijakan iklim, padahal konteksnya sangat berbeda. Negara-negara maju tersebut melakukan dekarbonisasi setelah basis industrialisasi mereka matang, dengan infrastruktur, teknologi, dan kapasitas fiskal yang kuat.

Mereka memiliki ruang untuk mengalihkan sumber daya ke teknologi bersih tanpa mengorbankan kapasitas produksi. Sebaliknya, negara berkembang masih menghadapi pertumbuhan kebutuhan energi, struktur industri yang belum mapan, serta keterbatasan fiskal. Dalam kondisi ini, dekarbonisasi yang tidak mempertimbangkan kebutuhan industri berisiko memperlambat pertumbuhan dan memperdalam ketimpangan.

Pelajaran penting datang dari sejumlah negara berkembang yang berhasil mengelola transisi secara lebih seimbang. China, India, dan Vietnam tidak menunda industrialisasi demi mengejar target emisi jangka pendek.

Mereka justru memanfaatkan transisi energi untuk memperkuat basis manufaktur domestik, membangun rantai pasok teknologi, dan meningkatkan daya saing industri. Penurunan emisi dilakukan bertahap melalui peningkatan efisiensi, modernisasi teknologi, dan perubahan bauran energi, bukan dengan menutup kapasitas industri secara prematur.

Kesalahan umum dalam kebijakan iklim adalah memandang emisi semata sebagai persoalan sektor energi. Dalam realitas negara berkembang, emisi sangat terkait dengan struktur industri dan pola pembangunan.

Industri semen, baja, pupuk, petrokimia, dan pengolahan mineral merupakan tulang punggung industrialisasi sekaligus kontributor emisi utama. Menurunkan emisi dari sektor sektor ini membutuhkan investasi besar, teknologi baru, serta waktu adaptasi yang panjang. Pendekatan berbasis larangan atau pembatasan administratif sering kali menimbulkan dampak ekonomi signifikan tanpa penurunan emisi global yang berarti.

Dekarbonisasi tanpa deindustrialisasi menuntut pendekatan yang menekankan efisiensi energi, modernisasi proses produksi, dan substitusi teknologi secara bertahap. Banyak negara berkembang menggunakan gas alam sebagai jembatan transisi untuk menurunkan intensitas emisi industri sebelum teknologi rendah karbon yang lebih maju menjadi layak secara ekonomi. Pendekatan ini bukan penyangkalan terhadap agenda iklim, melainkan strategi transisi yang realistis dan berbasis sistem.

Kebijakan publik juga harus mengakui bahwa biaya dekarbonisasi tidak terdistribusi secara merata. Industri di negara berkembang menghadapi biaya modal lebih tinggi, keterbatasan akses teknologi, dan risiko pasar yang lebih besar dibandingkan negara maju.

Jika standar emisi ketat diterapkan tanpa dukungan kebijakan yang memadai, hasilnya bukan penurunan emisi global, melainkan relokasi industri atau penyusutan kapasitas produksi domestik. Dalam kedua skenario tersebut, negara berkembang menanggung kerugian ekonomi dan sosial, sementara emisi global tidak banyak berubah.

Pelajaran lain yang tak kalah penting adalah perlunya integrasi kebijakan iklim, energi, dan industri. Dekarbonisasi tidak dapat dilepaskan dari ketersediaan energi yang andal dan terjangkau. Industri membutuhkan kepastian pasokan untuk berinvestasi dan berkembang.

Transisi energi harus dirancang untuk mendukung kebutuhan industri, bukan membebani atau menghambatnya. Energi terbarukan memiliki peran strategis, tetapi efektivitasnya sangat bergantung pada kekuatan dan fleksibilitas sistem kelistrikan.

Pengalaman berbagai negara menunjukkan bahwa dekarbonisasi yang dipaksakan tanpa kesiapan sistem kerap melahirkan kontradiksi kebijakan. Target emisi ditetapkan secara ambisius, namun ketergantungan pada energi fosil tetap tinggi demi menjaga pasokan listrik dan aktivitas industri.

Ketidakkonsistenan ini menciptakan ketidakpastian kebijakan dan menghambat investasi. Negara berkembang yang relatif berhasil adalah mereka yang jujur terhadap keterbatasan sistem dan merancang peta jalan transisi yang kredibel serta bertahap.

Dimensi ketenagakerjaan juga tidak bisa diabaikan. Industri manufaktur dan pengolahan menyerap jutaan tenaga kerja dengan keterampilan menengah. Dekarbonisasi yang mengabaikan dampak ketenagakerjaan berisiko menciptakan pengangguran struktural dan resistensi sosial.

Karena itu, kebijakan transisi harus mencakup peningkatan keterampilan, diversifikasi industri, dan penciptaan lapangan kerja baru yang realistis. Transisi yang adil bukan sekadar narasi, melainkan prasyarat keberlanjutan kebijakan.

Dalam konteks global, negara berkembang menghadapi tantangan keadilan. Banyak negara maju mendorong standar iklim ketat dan mekanisme penyesuaian karbon lintas batas, meski jejak emisi historis mereka jauh lebih besar.

Jika dekarbonisasi dijadikan syarat akses pasar atau pembiayaan tanpa mempertimbangkan perbedaan tahap pembangunan, tekanan tambahan justru jatuh pada industri negara berkembang. Pengalaman forum internasional menunjukkan bahwa transisi berkelanjutan membutuhkan pembagian beban yang adil serta dukungan nyata terhadap transformasi industri.

Indonesia berada pada posisi yang sangat relevan dalam diskursus ini. Di satu sisi, Indonesia mendorong industrialisasi berbasis sumber daya melalui hilirisasi dan penguatan manufaktur. Di sisi lain, komitmen terhadap target iklim jangka panjang terus ditegaskan.

Tantangan kebijakan publik adalah memastikan kedua agenda ini saling menguatkan. Dekarbonisasi harus diposisikan sebagai sarana meningkatkan efisiensi, daya saing, dan ketahanan industri, bukan sebagai pembatas pertumbuhan.

Pelajaran dari negara berkembang menunjukkan bahwa urutan kebijakan sangat menentukan. Investasi pada efisiensi energi, modernisasi industri, dan pengembangan teknologi domestik perlu didahulukan sebelum pembatasan emisi yang ketat diterapkan. Pendekatan ini memberi ruang bagi industri untuk beradaptasi, berinovasi, dan menyerap teknologi baru tanpa kehilangan daya saing, sehingga penurunan emisi berjalan seiring dengan peningkatan produktivitas.

Pada akhirnya, dekarbonisasi tanpa deindustrialisasi bukanlah kompromi lemah, melainkan strategi pembangunan yang rasional dan berimbang. Pendekatan ini mengakui urgensi krisis iklim sekaligus menghormati realitas pembangunan negara berkembang. Dengan kebijakan iklim yang terintegrasi dengan agenda energi dan industri, penurunan emisi dapat dicapai tanpa mengorbankan penciptaan nilai tambah dan lapangan kerja.

Dalam dunia yang semakin menuntut aksi iklim, keberhasilan tidak diukur dari seberapa cepat emisi turun di atas kertas, melainkan dari seberapa kuat ekonomi dan masyarakat bertahan selama proses transisi. Inilah saatnya pemerintah menempatkan dekarbonisasi sebagai instrumen penguatan industri nasional, merancang peta jalan yang realistis, dan memastikan transisi energi menjadi motor ketahanan ekonomi jangka panjang Indonesia.

Unveiled Jan. 8 at the Boeing Future of Flight in Everett, the accelerator will bring together state leadership, private-sector partners, research institutions, Tribal representatives, labor and community stakeholders to rapidly scale the production and adoption of low-carbon aviation fuels. Funded through a 2025 legislative appropriation and additional philanthropic support, CSAA is the most comprehensive initiative of its kind in the Pacific Northwest.

Two WSU Tri-Cities faculty from the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab — BSEL Director Josh Heyne and Research Assistant Professor Harrison Yang — were on-hand during the launch event to demonstrate and discuss their lab’s SAF testing programs with other guests. WSU system President Besty Cantwell was an invited speaker, and more than 210 government and industry leaders — including Washington Governor Bob Ferguson attended the event.

WSU Tri-Cities research driving real-world impact

WSU is a in CSAA, leveraging more than a decade of national leadership in sustainable aviation. Much of that work is happening at WSU Tri-Cities, home to one of the the Sustainable Options in Aviation Research (SOAR) Lab and BSEL.

“WSU Tri-Cities provides the applied research and testing capabilities that make this work real,” said WSU Tri-Cities Chancellor, Sandra Haynes. “From validating fuels to supporting certification and commercialization, our researchers are helping the industry bridge the gap between promising science and commercial scale.”

Directed by Heyne, BSEL operates in partnership with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and serves as . Since 2024, the SOAR Lab within BSEL has supported emerging energy solutions by providing specialized testing methodologies and equipment to industry and academic partners.

To date, BSEL researchers have tested nearly 500 SAF candidate samples from roughly 40 institutions across North America, Europe, and supporting supply-chain validation, performance evaluation and federal policy efforts. Heyne was recognized last year as the most cited and most published researcher in the field, as well as the most productive author in SAF research from 2001 to 2023. He also holds the highest connection strength among researchers in the discipline — illustrating the breadth of his collaborations — contributing to WSU’s designation as the most collaborative institution in sustainable aviation research.

As part of CSAA, is partnering with Snohomish County to establish a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Research and Development Center at Paine Field Airport. The center will house the world’s first SAF repository, where fuel samples will be collected, tested, indexed and distributed globally to support research and commercialization efforts. WSU Tri-Cities experts will play a key role in fuel testing, design of novel SAF compositions, while collaborating with government, industry and academic partners to foster innovation, workforce development and economic growth in the region.

WSU’s SAF research also contributes to ASCENT, the Federal Aviation Administration’s Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment, co-led by WSU and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Looking ahead

With aviation accounting for an estimated 2 to 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, leaders emphasized that SAF represents one of the most promising near-term strategies for reducing emissions while maintaining safety, affordability and reliability.

Zurich and Geneva Airports Top Pre-Covid Passenger Numbers While Cutting Flights

New traffic statistics released on 15 January by the Board of Airline Representatives in Switzerland (BAR-CH) reveal that the country’s two main hubs handled more passengers in 2025 than in any year before the pandemic even as aircraft movements continued to fall. Zurich Airport welcomed 32.6 million travellers (103.4 % of the 2019 level) on 270,116 flights—still 1.9 % below the 2019 movement count—while Geneva processed 17.85 million passengers on 177,288 flights, down 4.7 % from 2019. (bar-ch.org)

Higher-capacity aircraft, stronger load factors and a tariff structure that discourages low-yield rotations allowed both airports to deliver record throughput with fewer take-offs, a trend hailed by the Federal Office of Civil Aviation as proof that efficiency and sustainability goals can align. Night-time departures after 22:00 at Geneva dropped a further 24.6 %, and latest-generation jets now make up 34 % of its traffic mix.

For mobility managers the headline is resilience: seat supply into Switzerland has not only recovered but grown on key long-haul routes. Zurich added a Shanghai service on China Eastern, and both hubs expect additional North-American frequencies once the World Economic Forum (WEF) starts on 19 January. Nevertheless, parking stands at Zurich will be saturated during WEF week, and corporate flight departments are urged to lock in slots and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) allocations early.

Meanwhile, travellers and programme managers looking to stay ahead of Switzerland’s entry formalities can lean on VisaHQ’s digital platform, which consolidates the latest visa and transit requirements, offers step-by-step application support and even integrates with corporate booking tools—details are at https://www.visahq.com/switzerland/.

BAR-CH’s report also foreshadows higher airport fees for noisier aircraft from April 2026, a move that could influence fleet-planning decisions for carriers serving Switzerland and, by extension, corporate travel budgets. Companies should revisit travel-policy fare caps for the second quarter and brief travellers on likely terminal congestion spikes tied to the phased rollout of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) biometric gates beginning in March.

The fuel, known as TRISO, is configured differently from conventional nuclear fuel.
Views on nuclear energy remain more mixed, though they are evolving.
New nuclear technology is no longer purely theoretical, but it is still far from an established technology.","For much of the past half-century, nuclear energy in the United States has occupied an uneasy space between a technology of the past and a technology of the future — but not quite one of the present. That is beginning to change, and Alaska is part of that shift.

A couple of months ago, Project Janus, an initiative led by the Department of the Army, identified Fort Wainwright as one of nine candidate sites for deploying a new generation of small, advanced nuclear reactors. While the announcement received little public attention in Alaska, the program is significant. Janus is designed not only to support the energy security of military installations, but also to move advanced nuclear from isolated pilot projects toward repeatable, “nth-of-a-kind” deployments, where costs are expected to become more predictable and decline over time relative to first-of-a-kind efforts.

This follows on the heels of a June 2025 announcement that Oklo Inc. was selected to move forward on a planned microreactor deployment at Eielson Air Force Base. Taken together with other demonstrations and commercial proposals now moving through testing and licensing, these projects point to a broader shift: new nuclear is no longer hypothetical — it is beginning to move into real-world deployment.

Why nuclear stalled

Nuclear power in the United States generates roughly 20% of the nation’s electricity — about the same share as all renewable sources combined — yet it is often perceived as static and outdated. While wind, solar and battery storage have seen rapid, highly visible innovation and have dominated conversations about the energy future, nuclear has largely been associated with aging plants, long development timelines and high costs.

From time to time, talk of a nuclear renaissance has resurfaced. But for years, that renaissance seemed perpetually just out of reach — always promised, but not delivered. Large projects such as the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia came to symbolize this tension. Built around conventional, large-scale reactor designs developed decades earlier, Vogtle’s long delays and multibillion-dollar cost overruns ultimately hardened public skepticism about whether nuclear still had a role to play in the nation’s future energy supply.

For many observers, the question became not whether nuclear power could work, but whether it still made sense in an energy landscape increasingly shaped by shorter build times and greater flexibility in how capacity is sized and deployed. Wind, solar and natural gas plants can often be built quickly, with far less up-front capital and can be scaled incrementally. Against that backdrop, large, conventional nuclear projects increasingly appeared obsolete.

Reimagining nuclear

This new generation of nuclear technologies is not trying to solve old problems by building better versions of the same systems. Instead, it represents a fundamental rethinking of how nuclear power is designed, built and used. New designs emphasize smaller-scale, standardized systems that can be factory-assembled and rapidly deployed to a site. This shift reflects an effort to adapt nuclear technology to the practical realities of today’s energy landscape.

A major focus of this new wave of nuclear innovation has been safety. Traditional nuclear plants rely on multiple engineered systems, layers of redundancy and highly trained operators to manage risk. By contrast, many advanced reactor designs place greater emphasis on inherent or passive safety: Both the reactor and its fuel are designed to remain stable under extreme conditions.

These more accident-tolerant approaches are being put into practice. A major milestone occurred a few months ago, when the first fuel shipment designed specifically for these advanced reactors arrived at Idaho National Laboratory. The fuel, known as TRISO, is configured differently from conventional nuclear fuel. In TRISO fuel, uranium is encapsulated within multiple ceramic layers designed to withstand extreme heat and physical stress. As a result, a significant portion of the safety function is built directly into the fuel itself.

This initial production run will support the first advanced reactors to be tested at Idaho National Laboratory in several decades. Commercial demonstrations are expected to follow, with multiple vendors seeking access to the laboratory’s limited testing infrastructure, including Oklo Inc.

What Alaskans are saying

Surveys conducted by Strategies 360 on behalf of the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at UAF over several years show that Alaskans across a broad spectrum of communities and political views consistently favor greater diversification of the state’s energy systems. Respondents support expanding hydroelectric, solar and wind resources while reducing reliance on gas and coal.

Views on nuclear energy remain more mixed, though they are evolving. In the most recent poll, a slim majority of respondents said they would be open to greater use of nuclear energy in Alaska, while the share of those strongly opposed has dropped below 10 percent. Support increases when respondents are provided with additional information: Those who report greater familiarity with nuclear energy tend to be more supportive overall, and among less familiar respondents, interest rises substantially after hearing a brief, neutral description of advanced nuclear technologies. Taken together, these results suggest that many Alaskans are receptive to learning more and engaging on the issue as new information becomes available.

Taking stock: Where are we now?

While progress is encouraging, we still have a way to go before these technologies are available off the shelf. Even the vendors closest to market remain in design, licensing or early demonstration phases. New nuclear technology is no longer purely theoretical, but it is still far from an established technology.

There are also important unresolved questions: how these systems will perform over time; how they will be financed, owned and operated; how regulatory frameworks will adapt; and how issues such as waste management and emergency planning will be addressed. These questions can only be answered through experience — by moving projects from concept to operation and learning from them along the way. And that’s exactly what’s happening.

One reason this moment feels different is the level of sustained federal involvement and investment — an area of rare continuity in U.S. energy policy. Support for advanced nuclear has continued across both the Biden and Trump administrations, enabling momentum in addressing long-standing barriers that have kept these technologies from moving beyond paper studies and early prototypes.

Alaska is already playing an important role. Through defense-led demonstrations, research activities and early commercial proposals, it is reasonable to expect continued discussion and activity in the coming years. Decisions about how far Alaska ultimately leans into a new nuclear era will rest with Alaskans themselves. In the near term, the state clearly has a seat at the table. The question ahead is not whether nuclear can be developed, but when — and under what conditions — Alaskans will decide whether it belongs as part of the state’s future energy mix.

Neg8 Carbon’s electrostatic DAC technology works by drawing in air and passing it over a specifically designed sorbent system that attracts and captures carbon dioxide molecules. The captured molecules can then be permanently and safely stored underground or converted into climate-neutral carbon products, such as sustainable aviation fuel.

Dr John Breen, chief technology officer at Neg8 Carbon, said: “The 50 tonne per annum unit will serve to validate Neg8’s system as a leading engineered carbon capture technology that will support industries and governments in their drive to net-zero and beyond to negative carbon emissions.”

Michael Kent, director at Prochem Engineering, said: “This collaboration reflects the shared commitment of Neg8 Carbon and Prochem Engineering to deliver innovative, sustainable engineering solutions that support meaningful environmental progress and a lower-carbon future.”

“While the Trump Administration has gone as far as providing E15 waivers, Congress must now do its job to pass year-round nationwide E15 legislation to continue to drive domestic crop demand,” Rollins says.

Analysis from the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) indicates that would boost corn use by approximately 2.4 billion bushels annually and be one of the quickest ways to increase demand and chew through the record pile of corn in the U.S.

Is the Time Finally Right?

The political climate might finally be right to pass year-round E15 legislation. Biofuels leaders, including Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, are optimistic about attaching a bill to the mini-omnibus appropriations bill or the Continuing Resolution (CR) at the end of January.

“We know there’s going to be another CR bill at the end of January to hopefully avoid another shutdown, but the bottom line is we have to get it done,” Cooper says. “I don’t want to say it’s now or never, but the period between now and early 2026 is really our best shot at getting this legislation done.”

Bipartisan Support for E15

Cooper says there’s growing bipartisan support for E15 in Congress and even from the oil industry.

“We had 70 ag and biofuel groups at the state level, at the federal level, send a letter on that last week,” Cooper says. “It’s gotten a very good response. We’re hearing a lot more chatter on the Hill today about this being a priority. Senator Grassley’s been talking about this every chance he gets, but we also have Whip Emmer talking about E15.”

He adds that a year ago the biofuels industry was close to having that legislation done and across the goal line.

American Airlines Inc. introduces a new track into the evolving soundscape of ESG and fiduciary oversight. The decision may be read to send a clear signal through the mix: where a court concludes that fiduciaries allow social or political aims to influence retirement plan management, courts may treat the resulting dissonance as a breach of ERISA’s most fundamental obligations. In Spence, the court held, at the district court level, that ERISA fiduciaries must keep their decision-making aligned strictly with pecuniary interests. The opinion suggests that even passive, quiet acceptance of ESG activism can, in the court’s view, disrupt that required rhythm. According to the court’s reasoning, silence in the face of investment manager activism itself may create exposure to a breach of the duty of loyalty.

Background

Spence arose from a class action brought by an American Airlines pilot challenging oversight of about $26 billion in plan assets. The plan was overseen by the Employee Benefits Committee (EBC), the named administrator and fiduciary under the plan’s and the EBC’s governing documents. American Airlines also exercised significant discretionary authority, appointing and removing EBC members, interacting with advisers, and overseeing investment manager relationships, leading the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas to find that it acted as a functional co-fiduciary.

BlackRock Institutional Trust Co. served as the primary investment manager for all of the passively managed funds in the plan, with delegated proxy voting authority under the investment management agreements (IMAs). BlackRock’s IMAs required votes to be cast exclusively in participants’ “long-term economic interests.” Over the relevant period, however, BlackRock incorporated socio-political ESG-and climate-driven objectives into its stewardship guidelines and proxy voting practices, according to the court.

BlackRock’s “ESG activism,” as described in the opinion, included several nonpecuniary initiatives cited by the court as evidence of mixed motive, such as climate pledges (e.g., “net zero by 2050”), board diversity and decarbonization priorities, and proxy voting that advanced ESG goals without clear financial justification.

The defendants were aware of BlackRock’s nonpecuniary ESG interests and knew about the CEO’s public letters but, as the court noted, “no formal evaluation or assessment of BlackRock’s ESG crusade commenced.” The central question before the court was whether the defendants mismanaged plan assets by selecting and continuing to retain an investment manager that pursued nonpecuniary ESG policy goals — thereby potentially failing to ensure purely pecuniary returns for participants.

ERISA Fiduciary Duties of Loyalty, Monitoring, and Prudence

Duty of Prudence

ERISA’s prudence standard is objective and process-focused, requiring fiduciaries to act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence of a knowledgeable investment professional. The court found that the defendants’ oversight processes aligned with prevailing industry standards. It emphasized that industry practice commonly relies on investment managers’ self-reporting of proxy voting issues.

Duties of Loyalty and Monitoring

The court found that the defendants breached their ERISA fiduciary duty of loyalty by allowing what the court described as “impermissible cross-pollination of interests and influence” and by failing to act solely in the exclusive financial interests of participants. Specific failures cited by the court included insufficient monitoring of BlackRock’s ESGmotivated proxy voting, failing to determine whether such votes had any pecuniary basis, ignoring required attestations, remaining silent in the face of ESG activism, and allowing corporate ESG commitments (including DEI, net-zero emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel initiatives) to influence plan management.

Defining Themes

A throughline emerges across the court’s analysis: ERISA fidelity depends not only on outcomes but also on motives, process, and the structural separation of pecuniary and nonpecuniary aims. The opinion repeatedly returns to this theme, treating intent, oversight, and silence as interconnected elements of fiduciary responsibility.

ESG Defined by Intent

The court grounded its reasoning in the principle that ESG must be defined by purpose:

[A]n investment strategy assumes an ESG label when it is aimed at, in whole or in part, bringing about certain types of societal change. ... Investing that aims to reduce material risks or increase return for the exclusive purpose of obtaining a financial benefit is not ESG investing.

Additionally, the court highlighted its treatment of investment strategies influenced by both economic and noneconomic goals:

Even with mixed benefits, the presence of a non-pecuniary consideration reveals that the investment manager is not acting exclusively in an economic manner.

Silence as Approval

One of the most consequential aspects of Spence is the court’s treatment of inaction. This portion of the opinion forms a central pillar of the court’s reasoning, reinforcing that fiduciaries must actively safeguard pecuniary purpose rather than passively assume it.

The court stated that the “most obvious explanation” for the defendants’ silence and “lack of accountability” over BlackRock’s ESG activism and proxy voting activities in the Exxon matter was that the defendants “approved” and “endorse[d]” BlackRock’s ESG motivated conduct.

The opinion suggests that fiduciaries who “do nothing” in response to an investment manager’s ESG-motivated investing — whether using plan assets or in external contexts — may be viewed by a court as indicating

support for the manager’s actions.

Remedies – Final Judgment

On September 30, 2025, despite its harsh criticism of BlackRock and the defendants, the court issued its final judgment denying monetary damages after finding that the plaintiff had not proven losses. However, pursuant to ERISA section 409(a) and Fifth Circuit precedent, the court imposed “other equitable or remedial relief” to prevent future breaches. This included a permanent injunction limiting nonpecuniary-influenced proxy voting, appointment of two independent EBC members for five years, and annual reporting and certifications confirming pecuniary purpose and transparency, along with corporate disclosure of ESG-related memberships or statements.

These remedies, broad in scope and duration, reflect the court’s conclusion that fiduciary silence, mixed motives, and insufficient structural separation necessitated structural correction in this case.

Key Takeaways for Plan Sponsors and Management

Refrain From Mashups

Fiduciaries should maintain a firm separation between corporate ESG initiatives and ERISA fiduciary decision-making. When corporate sustainability goals overlap with plan oversight, courts may view such blending as evidence of disloyalty. Spence illustrates that even well-intentioned alignment can, depending on the facts and judicial interpretation, create the appearance of mixed motives when fiduciary and corporate priorities are not kept clearly separate.

Be the Ultimate DJ

Fiduciaries should implement and document robust processes for selecting, monitoring, and evaluating investment managers, including oversight of stewardship policies, proxy-voting guidelines, and any stated ESG frameworks. The court emphasized that monitoring should not be passive; fiduciaries may wish to show ongoing engagement with managers’ practices and rationales.

Oversee Daily Mixes

Investment managers may engage in ESG activism across multiple contexts. Spence highlights that activism outside the plan can still influence judicial assessment of fiduciary oversight. Fiduciaries may benefit from regularly reviewing public letters, stewardship reports, and voting trends, not just plan-specific communications.

External Signals Matter

Public commitments, ESG coalition memberships, climate pledges, and stewardship statements may reveal nonpecuniary aims. The court treated these external signals as relevant indicators of motivation, underscoring the importance of monitoring how investment managers frame their objectives. Fiduciaries may wish to assess whether these commitments meaningfully align with an exclusive pecuniary purpose.

Choose Charts Over Trending

Fiduciaries should seek to ensure that investment strategies and proxy votes rest on demonstrable financial rationales rather than social or political aims. Spence reflects the court’s view that silence or inaction in the face of known nonpecuniary activism can be interpreted as endorsement. Affirmative documentation of financial reasoning — and timely follow-up when concerns arise — may help fiduciaries maintain the required pecuniary focus.

Next Track

The defendants moved for reconsideration of the final judgment in the district court. The decision may ultimately be reviewed by the Fifth Circuit on appeal, and its reasoning or remedies could be modified or reversed.

Conclusion

ESG activism often seeks to steer investor behavior through value-based arguments and socially driven engagement strategies, tugging at the heartstrings of millions of investors worldwide. But in Spence, the court cut the serenade short, delivering a cautionary lyric: fiduciaries may face risk if nonpecuniary ESG objectives are blended into the management of retirement plan assets. Grounded in ERISA’s primacy of pecuniary purpose, the court’s decision underscores its view of the dangers of cross-pollination, silence, and lack of active oversight. As courts heighten scrutiny of proxy voting, investment manager selection, and corporate fiduciary overlap, plan sponsors may wish to ensure their processes stay precisely in tune with ERISA’s exclusive benefit rule.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.1499_5156.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 19:56:30.934530

2025 Alternative Power Survey findings and analysis

Following a turbulent year, the alternative power truck market appears to be entering a period of recalibration in 2026.

While it's impossible to predict the next 12 months with certainty, trends from the last few years suggest that electrification, both BEV and FCEV, is likely to remain in a delayed state.

TRC's Nate Springer, who leads the State of Sustainable Fleets project with support from Penske, Volvo, S&P Global Mobility, and Exelon, summarized the current landscape for Clean Trucking:

""We're seeing a reset and refocusing in the MD and HD EV markets after initial exuberance of 2020–2024. The foundations for future growth are still there, but I would expect a year or two of declining sales from 2024's record, product consolidation by manufacturers to focus on the best uses like yard tractors and delivery vans, and charging development in lowest-cost electricity markets with shared or behind the fence facilities. As those products and projects emerge, we'll also see growing data on use cases where EVs can cut costs for fleets even if battery costs remain flat.""

Tumultuous 2025

2025 brought several political and financial setbacks for commercial zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs)—including battery-electrics (BEVs) and hydrogen fuel-cell (FCEV) models—affecting manufacturers and some government bodies such as the California Air Resources Board (CARB), but overall momentum has not collapsed, but has rather entered ""peak uncertainty.""

[Related: 2025 State of Sustainable Fleets Report - What you need to know]

If anything, now is an ideal time for the industry and companies to recalibrate and adapt to new realities. For some companies, however, recovery is likely out of reach.

Once-promising startups like Nikola Motors, Bollinger Motors, and battery-swap specialist Ample filed for bankruptcy. Is this necessarily bad news? While the market has clearly spoken to a degree, legacy OEMs are far from abandoning ZEVs. If anything, they're taking a cautious wait-and-see stance as the second Trump administration enters its second year.

OEMs may also be waiting on the sidelines anticipating the market debut of the Tesla Semi, which is due to begin series production in Nevada later this year. China's Windrose Global E700, a Tesla Semi competitor, received homologation for the U.S. in December.

So, where do BEV and FCEV trucks stand today? Will natural gas—specifically Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) along with biodiesel and renewable diesel—continue to be the most effective way to reduce C02 emissions while electrification and infrastructure mature? What role will the federal and state governments play?

And how do CCJ, Overdrive, and Clean Trucking readers who took part in our annual Alternative Power Survey perceive the current landscape? The survey explored the state of electric commercial vehicle adoption and the reasons many fleets haven't made the shift yet. More on that shortly.

Battery-electric vehicles

BEVs may be down, but they're not out. In fact, the medium-duty commercial BEV industry, currently valued at around $23 billion, continues to show progress.

Late last year, for example, Workhorse and Motive Electric Trucks finalized their merger, and Harbinger Motors raised $160 million in funding co-led by FedEx.

The segment also shows promise thanks to proven use cases, such as electrified garbage truck fleets. Despite the challenges, legacy OEMs also continue to invest and launch new MD BEV offerings.

At the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), analysts from McKinsey & Company validated the view that the brightest spots for commercial zero-emission vehicles in North America are school buses, final-mile delivery, and yard and terminal tractors.

Unfortunately, there have been some notable disappointments.

Michigan-based Bollinger Motors collapse in late November was somewhat surprising, as the company had supposedly resolved earlier financial issues and emerged from court-appointed receivership after Mullen Automotive increased its ownership stake.

In another unexpected move last fall, GM pulled the plug on the Chevrolet Brightdrop last-mile delivery van—a direct competitor to the Rivian Electric Delivery Vehicle (EDV).

Quebec-based electric school bus manufacturer Lion Electric, since renamed LION, filed for bankruptcy in December 2024. Last spring, it was forced to ground its surviving 1,200-unit fleet in the Montreal area due to fire concerns. Although the issue was resolved quickly, other safety concerns—which continue to affect several U.S. school districts—remain unresolved. LION's new owners later declared U.S. warranties null and void, a controversial decision that has left districts in the lurch, forcing them to return aging diesel buses to service to pick up the slack.

The company is currently under investigation by several U.S. law firms for potential federal law violations.

Meanwhile, Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) and Trucking-as-a-Service (TaaS) business models—pioneered by companies like WattEV and Zeem Solutions—are gaining traction, particularly in Class 8 drayage operations. So far, these deployments are largely concentrated in California and have yet to expand to long-haul, cross-country routes typically handled by diesel and RNG/CNG-powered semis. The broader coast-to-coast rollout remains to be seen.

In summary, light- and medium-duty commercial BEVs continue to prove themselves across a range of applications, while long-haul, heavy-duty Class 8 BEVs still have significant ground to cover.

Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles

Nikola's bankruptcy was, without question, the most significant headline in the commercial FCEV space over the past 12 months. Clean Trucking covered several post-bankruptcy stories, including a Toronto-area hydrogen fueling station that received funding but ultimately never came to fruition.

Last August, Austin, Texas-based Hyroad Energy won the bankruptcy auction for Nikola, acquiring 113 Tre fuel-cell electric semi-trucks along with spare parts, software platforms, operational infrastructure, and related intellectual property. A few months later, the company confirmed plans to restore the trucks' subscription service, provide ongoing support and maintenance, and revive Nikola's hydrogen refueling network in California and Texas.

In an unexpected move at ACT 2025, Honda revealed its Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell truck concept powered by three fuel cell modules. The OEM confirmed the module will enter production in 2027 but no word yet whether it'll be paired with the semi.

Hyundai remains the only legacy OEM to mass-produce a road-legal heavy-duty FCEV Class 8 semi, the XCIENT, though sales have been limited. To date, 35 units have been deployed in California through the NorCAL ZERO Project, with an additional five trucks supported by the EPA's Targeted Airshed Grants program. Hyundai has also introduced 21 XCIENTs to support production at its Metaplant America facility in Georgia.

Further dampening hopes for hydrogen fueling was the DOE's October announcement canceling billions of dollars in green hydrogen production projects.

Despite some ongoing development, FCEV commercial vehicle technology has not achieved sustained momentum in North America, and the government's recent decision further complicates progress.

Alternative fossil fuels

While electrification continues to face significant hurdles, alternatives to traditional diesel—particularly RNG and CNG—are gaining momentum, along with biodiesel and renewable diesel. Traditional diesel remains the dominant fuel of choice for fleets, according to an ATRI survey, while liquefied natural gas (LNG) is also steadily growing in popularity.

As a quick refresher, RNG comes from organic waste like farms or landfills, making it renewable and often carbon negative. CNG is regular natural gas that's been compressed for vehicle use. LNG is natural gas cooled to a liquid state.

[Related: As electric truck demand slows, CNG and RNG-powered trucks accelerate]

RNG recently gained bipartisan support when the House and Senate proposed last April the Renewable Natural Gas Incentive Act of 2025, which would provide a $1.00 per gallon tax credit for RNG used in transportation through 2035. In addition, trucking groups applauded the Trump administration's ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" which restored tax parity between sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel.

The market launch of the Cummins X15N engine continues to further strengthen the business case for natural gas fuel options, attracting major customers such as Walmart and legacy OEMs like Peterbilt and Kenworth.

Also noteworthy is that six of the 13 vehicles that took part in the North American Council for Freight Efficiency's (NACFE) 2025 'Run on Less' event last summer either ran on biodiesel, renewable diesel, or natural gas. As fleets weigh the ongoing challenges of electrification, alternatives like RNG, CNG, biodiesel, and renewable diesel continue to gain popularity.

NACFE Executive Director Mike Roeth, however, flagged a potential challenge:

""I'm worried that truck OEMs are spreading themselves across too many technologies, which could reduce their scale,"" he warned.

2025 Alt Power Survey

As the push toward cleaner transportation accelerates, our annual Alternative Power Survey revealed how fleet operators are navigating the shift to electrified trucking, highlighting everything from charging challenges and infrastructure concerns to opinions on electric truck manufacturers, and offering a clear view of what's driving—and slowing—the adoption of electric trucks across the industry.

The Alt Power Survey, which ran from February 11 to February 26, 2025, asked respondents questions regarding their fleet size, truck counts, and operating regions. It also gathered viewpoints on fuel economy regulations, many of which have since been rolled back by the Trump administration.

Of course, special thanks goes out to our readers who took part in the survey. Your time and opinions are greatly appreciated.

General findings

The 2025 Alt Power Survey revealed that while the trucking industry, represented by a mix of owner-operators and fleet management, was concerned about new emission mandates from the previous administration, as well as continued reservations about adopting alternative fuels. The primary obstacles identified for both BEVs and FCEVs are the lack of robust fueling/charging infrastructure, high upfront costs, and inadequate vehicle range for demanding operations, specifically long-haul.

Despite these hurdles, 48% of respondents reported they are actively engaged in early-stage discussions and taking immediate steps to reduce emissions, such as maximizing diesel efficiency. However, the disparity grew between fleets and owner-operators with 68% of fleets more likely to be in the ""discussion"" phase compared to the latter at 38%.

The survey also highlighted the competitive landscape, revealing divided opinions on which company is leading the BEV and FCEV race, as well as varying levels of engagement with state and federal grants and infrastructure investments—underscoring the industry's cautious and fragmented approach to the gradual zero-emission transition.

In general, a ""wait and see"" stance dominated, particularly among owner-operators, nearly half of whom (45%) have not engaged in any discussions about transitioning away from diesel. While larger fleets appear more proactive, with 68% involved in early-stage talks, the vast majority remain in a research only phase, mainly because they're hesitant to commit to major transitions amid economic uncertainty.

Rather than making the immediate leap to BEVs or FCEVs, the industry is largely leaning on diesel efficiency. Most respondents prefer to maximize current technology as their most effective tool for emissions reduction, such as prioritizing the purchase of late-model Class 8 trucks, aerodynamic kits, and idle-reduction systems.

In today's economic climate, the general sentiment suggests that achieving cleaner diesel is a far more realistic and attainable goal for most carriers than zero emissions.",https://img.cleantrucking.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/truck-at-charging-station.pdbpYxNZ2k.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-16 15:57:25.397759

Accessibility is no longer a niche consideration in airport operations, it is a defining pillar of passenger experience, operational resilience and reputational trust. That message landed loud and clear during the accessibility panel at the International Airport Summit, where airport leaders from Europe and the U.S. unpacked the realities, risks and opportunities of assisted travel today.

With demand for assistance rising rapidly, driven not only by physical disabilities but also hidden and neurological conditions, the panel made one thing abundantly clear: airports that fail to adapt will struggle to cope with growth, while those that lead on accessibility will unlock better experiences, stronger efficiency and even new revenue streams.

Assisted travel at scale: a growing operational challenge

The discussion opened with a stark reality check on scale.

“If you get assisted travel wrong, the impact on the customer is huge, but the reputational impact on the airport is even harder to recover from.”

At Birmingham Airport, assisted travel customers now represent more than 2.5% of total passengers, rising above 3% at peak times, equating to around 400,000 passengers a year. Milan Malpensa, handling nearly double the passengers, supports around 200,000 assisted travellers annually. On peak days, individual long-haul flights can require assistance for more than 100 passengers.

This is not a marginal service. It is complex, resource-intensive, and expensive, yet essential. As Al Titterington, Terminal Ops Director for Birmingham Airport noted: “If you get assisted travel wrong, the impact on the customer is huge, but the reputational impact on the airport is even harder to recover from.”

Autonomy, not dependency, is the goal

A central theme throughout the session was autonomy. Passengers requiring assistance do not want to be rushed curb-to-gate or stripped of choice; they want to travel independently, on their own terms, just like everyone else.

“The demand for assistance is rising, and we cannot deploy an equivalent amount of workforce. Autonomy must be the key, for the passenger experience and for operational sustainability,” said Michele Parietti, Head of PRM Assistance at SEA Milan Airports.

One such way to promote autonomy is the deployment of innovative technologies, and Darrell Watson, Senior Vice President and Chief Experience Officer from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, shared how digital wayfinding technology for blind and low-vision passengers is helping deliver exactly that. Using infrastructure-free, LiDAR-mapped navigation apps, passengers can move through the terminal independently, with metre-level accuracy. Crucially, these tools benefit all passengers, not just those with disabilities, improving flow, reducing anxiety and enhancing overall wayfinding.

The commercial implications were also openly discussed. Data shared during the panel highlighted that passengers with disabilities actively want to spend money in airports on food, retail and experiences, but only if the environment allows them to do so independently. In the U.S, this group of travellers represents about $10bn in missed revenue opportunity. Accessibility, the panel argued, is not a cost centre alone; done right, it is an enabler of value.

Designing airports for everyone; not retrofitting later

From Milan’s perspective, the challenge is shifting from adapting legacy terminals to embracing a ‘design for all’ philosophy. Rather than creating dedicated infrastructure for specific needs, accessibility is being embedded into every design decision – from circulation routes and toilets to security layouts, digital systems and sensory environments.

Milan Malpensa is also among the first European airports to introduce dedicated quiet spaces for passengers with hidden disabilities, recognising that overstimulation at security and other touchpoints can be a major barrier to travel. These spaces are designed to support sensory regulation, reduce stress and improve the end-to-end journey.

The panel agreed: accessibility must now sit alongside lifts, escalators and vertical circulation as a core design principle in terminal master planning – not as an afterthought.

Technology, systems and the reality of integration

While innovation is accelerating, the panel was refreshingly honest about the challenges. Autonomous wheelchairs, for example, offer huge potential for independence, but only if they can be seamlessly integrated with security, border control, gate processes and human assistance where needed.

The future, the panel suggested, lies in blended journeys: autonomy where possible, human support where necessary. Achieving that requires airports to rethink systems, workforce models and operational ownership, not simply deploy new equipment.

There was also a strong call to improve accessibility across everyday interfaces that are often overlooked: airline kiosks, vending machines, retail technology and digital displays. In 2025/2026, panellists agreed, it should not be possible for a passenger to reach the final step of a transaction only to be blocked by poor accessibility design.

Beyond compliance: raising the bar

Perhaps the most provocative moment came when the panel addressed regulation head-on. Building codes and compliance standards, particularly in the U.S., were described as a minimum bar, one that is often far too low.

“If we treated all passengers the way we treat passengers with disabilities under current standards,” Darrell noted, “we’d have a riot on our hands!”

The takeaway was clear: true accessibility is about mindset, not box-ticking. And it is good to hold the industry to account, as Darrell went on to note: “We’ve got airports in the U.S. that are spending millions of dollars on artwork but are concerned about spending tens of thousands of dollars on accessibility.”

Airports are willing to invest millions in artwork, branding and aesthetics, yet comparatively modest investments in accessibility can transform experiences for hundreds of thousands of passengers.

Looking ahead: pressure, preparation and opportunity

With Milan preparing to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the panel also explored how major events act as catalysts for accessibility improvements. From levelling curbs and redesigning reflective toilets to stress-testing every failure point in the journey, preparation is driving a more integrated, cross-functional approach to accessibility than ever before. “We are identifying every failure point in the journey and fixing it, from curbs and toilets to reflections, lighting and circulation, because accessibility only works when it works everywhere,” said Michele.

Why this conversation matters

What made this panel stand out was not just the technology discussed, but the candour. Accessibility was framed not as a compliance burden, but as a strategic lever, one that touches passenger satisfaction, operational efficiency, staff workload, reputation and revenue.

As Al noted:

Accessibility isn’t about extracting value from passengers; it’s about enabling independence, dignity and a seamless journey for everyone.”

For airport professionals grappling with rising assisted travel demand, ageing infrastructure and evolving passenger expectations, this session offered practical insight, hard-earned lessons and a glimpse of what good can look like.

And if you weren’t in the room? Let’s just say this is one conversation you won’t want to miss next time.

VARO Energy announces that it has completed the Preem AB acquisition, marking the successful delivery of VARO Energy’s 2022 ONE VARO Transformation strategy. Following regulatory approvals, the formation of VAROPreem creates a new leading force in energy built on scale, capability and track record.

VAROPreem Key Highlights:

- Scale: With six strategically positioned manufacturing hubs and access to more than 120 terminals, serving business customers across 33 countries. Creates the second-largest European renewable fuels producer, and one of the top six globally, and Europe’s third-largest independent refiner, meeting 10% of European mobility demand for road and marine sectors.

- Capability: VAROPreem brings a significant integrated energy value chain across manufacturing, distribution, trading and customers, enabling disciplined execution.

- Track record: ONE VARO Transformation strategy completed ahead of schedule, with c.50% of 2025 pro forma earnings from sustainable energies and pro forma 2025 EBITDA expected to be three times higher than 2021. VAROPreem is now well positioned to deliver material synergies.

The creation of VAROPreem brings together two complementary companies, VARO Energy and Preem AB. With the acquisition complete, VAROPreem is now one of Europe’s most significant energy companies, combining deep industrial capabilities with global trading reach to serve mobility and industrial customers.

With extensive distribution infrastructure and access to more than 120 terminals, the new company owns six strategic manufacturing facilities. In Sweden, it operates Lysekil and Gothenburg. In Germany it holds a majority interest in both Neustadt and Vohburg. Finally, it owns Cressier in Switzerland and Coevorden in The Netherlands. Combined, these six manufacturing hubs have a processing capacity of 530 kbd of conventional fuels, 1.3mtpa of renewable fuels and 450 GWh of biogas. VAROPreem also owns 100% share in elexon, a leading European developer of commercial vehicle charging.

Recent investments underline the company’s transition growth pipelines, including the commissioning of the Synsat facility at Lysekil, enabling the co-processing of renewable feedstocks and the Coevorden site producing bio-methane and bio-LNG. VAROPreem will continue to operate Preem’s assets with a clear focus on security of supply, resilience, and continuity of service, reflecting their strategic role within Europe’s energy systems.

VAROPreem will build on the proven “twin-engine” strategy, supplying both conventional (“Engine 1”) and sustainable (“Engine 2”) energies to mobility and industrial customers. Introduced by VARO Energy in 2022, the five-year strategy targeted a tripling of EBITDA, with 50% of earnings from sustainable energies. Following the transaction, VAROPreem expects earnings to be balanced across the two engines, with approximately half generated from conventional energies and half from sustainable energies.

The combined company brings together the industrial scale of an established energy producer with the innovation and capabilities of a renewables leader. This scalable model supports disciplined investment and portfolio evolution in line with customer demand and market dynamics, while enhancing returns.

VAROPreem brings together strong financing and end-to-end delivery expertise to build and operate energy infrastructure in Europe. With conventional demand remaining strong and sustainable energies expanding, the company is focused on two priorities: keeping supply reliable and funding the next wave of transition investments. This approach supports energy security now and accelerates progress toward a lower-carbon system.

Dev Sanyal, Group Chief Executive Officer of VAROPreem, said:

“The creation of VAROPreem marks a defining moment for VARO and Preem. Together, we have created one of Europe’s most significant energy companies, built on the dedication of colleagues whose work has made this possible. VAROPreem combines industrial scale, critical infrastructure, financial strength, and deep operational expertise to support energy security and resilience across Europe. With EBITDA now three times higher than when we began our transformation, we are no longer developing scale; we have achieved it. VAROPreem is well positioned to deliver reliable, lower carbon energy across Europe. And while this completion brings one chapter to a close, it also lays the foundations for the next phase of our growth.”

The newly established Executive Board brings together senior leaders from both VARO and Preem, combining expertise across manufacturing, commercial strategy and operations, and reflecting the integration of the two businesses. It will comprise:

- Dev Sanyal as Group Chief Executive Officer

- Magnus Heimburg as Deputy Chief Executive Officer and EVP Markets & Customers

- Georges Menane as EVP and Group Chief Financial Officer

- Hugues Bourgogne as EVP Manufacturing, Projects & Technology

- Stewart Peter as EVP Trading & Optimisation

- Theo Pannekeet as EVP Sustainable Energies Value Chain

- Eric Westerholm as EVP Strategy & Transformation

- Susanne Stenman as EVP Data & Information Technology

- Gilles Vollin as EVP Integration, People & Communication

The transaction was fully financed through a debt package that attracted 15 new lenders, expanding VAROPreem’s lending syndicate to 30 institutions. With participation from banks across Europe, the USA, Japan, Southeast Asia, Middle East, and South Africa, the financing underscores broad market confidence in VAROPreem’s strategy and in the creation of the company through the combination of VARO Energy and Preem AB.

With its transformation complete and a new leadership team in place, VAROPreem enters its next chapter focused on growth, delivery, and long-term value creation.

Beyond this point, SAF compliance will depend on the adoption of emerging pathways with higher costs and lower technology readiness.
In markets without feedstock prioritisation for aviation, renewable diesel economics may displace SAF supply despite its lower long-term importance in decarbonisation.

For example, a SAF production route eligible for credits in the US may not meet EU sustainability thresholds.","The transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has become a structural necessity for the global aviation sector. Regulatory mandates introduced in 2025 removed market optionality and replaced it with binding compliance obligations. These policies, including ReFuelEU Aviation and the UK’s SAF mandate, established enforceable SAF blending quotas for airlines. As a result, there is a demand floor that scales annually, independent of oil prices or airline balance sheets.

IDTechEx projects the global SAF market will reach US$50 billion by 2036. This forecast is based on legal requirements designed to align aviation with broader decarbonisation targets. With the regulatory framework now embedded, the constraint has shifted from demand certainty to supply feasibility. The aviation sector must now solve a new set of interdependent problems around the limited availability of first-generation feedstocks, high capital costs of second-generation technologies, and global asymmetry in subsidy regimes.

First-generation SAF

The initial growth of SAF has depended on Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technologies. These use waste oils and animal fats to produce drop-in jet fuel. HEFA is technically mature and commercially available, and its fuel properties meet existing aviation standards, allowing airlines to integrate it without modification.

However, feedstock availability of HEFA is limited. The total global supply of used cooking oil and animal fats cannot support long-term SAF scaling. IDTechEx identifies 2030 as the approximate HEFA limit, when rising regulatory quotas will exceed what HEFA can supply. Beyond this point, SAF compliance will depend on the adoption of emerging pathways with higher costs and lower technology readiness.

Second-generation pathways

Technologies such as Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ), Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FT), and power-to-liquid (e-SAF) are the primary alternatives to HEFA. These pathways allow greater flexibility in feedstock sourcing, including biomass, municipal waste, and captured carbon with green hydrogen. They also carry higher capital intensity and more complex process risks.

The AtJ process has entered early commercialisation. LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility began operating in 2025, producing 9 million gallons of SAF and 1 million gallons of renewable diesel annually. It is the first plant of its kind at scale. However, unit production costs remain significantly above HEFA and conventional jet fuel, limiting uptake to jurisdictions with strong policy support.

FT and e-SAF face similar cost barriers. IDTechEx analysis indicates that production from these routes will remain commercially marginal without direct subsidy or regulated offtake. Without acceleration, a shortfall in SAF supply relative to legal mandates is likely in the 2030s.

Renewable diesel growth

The wider biofuels market compounds these pressures. Renewable diesel, which competes for the same HEFA feedstocks, is growing rapidly. The US has created overlapping incentive structures—such as the Renewable Fuel Standard, the 45Z tax credit, and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard—that reward renewable diesel production.

By 2036, IDTechEx forecasts total global production capacity for SAF and renewable diesel to exceed 67 million tonnes annually, growing at a compound annual rate of 8.1% from 2026. This expansion will intensify competition for waste oils and fats. Without feedstock allocation mechanisms, SAF availability could be undermined by economically stronger demand from the road transport sector.

In markets without feedstock prioritisation for aviation, renewable diesel economics may displace SAF supply despite its lower long-term importance in decarbonisation. This creates a risk that SAF obligations become technologically insolvent despite growing statutory demand.

Renewable methanol as SAF pathways

An additional development is the rapid scale-up of renewable methanol. Although its current role in SAF production is limited, it can serve as a future feedstock via the Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) pathway. MtJ remains at an earlier technology readiness stage, but its potential lies in the scalability of methanol production infrastructure.

China is positioned to lead global renewable methanol output due to its cost advantages in plant construction, established presence in the methanol value chain, and access to biomass and green hydrogen. Several facilities with production capacity exceeding 100,000 tonnes per year are under development.

While most renewable methanol currently targets marine fuel and industrial markets, its role in SAF will grow if MtJ pathways receive regulatory validation and capital support. IDTechEx notes that the flexibility of methanol production routes may offer long-term diversification options once lipid-based SAF feedstocks are exhausted.

Policy divergence

Although SAF mandates now exist across the EU, UK, and US, policy design remains inconsistent. Blending quotas, eligible feedstocks, certification criteria, and financial incentives differ significantly by region. These divergences affect project viability and global supply chain planning.

For example, a SAF production route eligible for credits in the US may not meet EU sustainability thresholds. Conversely, advanced biofuels prioritised under European frameworks may receive little or no support in US markets. IDTechEx highlights this fragmentation as a structural inefficiency that delays commercial deployment and raises compliance costs.

Without coordination on definitions, certification, and incentives, SAF developers must navigate non-transferable compliance regimes. This limits economies of scale and hinders capital allocation into technologies with global relevance.

Cross-sector coordination and risk

Reaching a US$50 billion SAF market by 2036 will depend on more than regulatory targets. It will require infrastructure investment, commercial risk absorption, and policy alignment across jurisdictions. The current model, where compliance mandates outpace supply capabilities, is unsustainable without systemic intervention.

IDTechEx positions SAF as a compliance product rather than a commodity. Its market growth is legally driven, but supply remains technologically contingent. To avoid a structural gap between obligation and capability, governments must extend financial instruments, certification clarity, and long-term offtake guarantees.

The shift away from HEFA is unavoidable. Emerging pathways must be operational at scale before feedstock ceilings are reached. That transition requires synchronised action between regulators, investors, and technology developers. Without it, SAF obligations will decouple from physical supply, and the credibility of aviation decarbonisation policy will weaken.

The SAF market now operates within a compliance economy. Its future depends not on real execution.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2026/01/16/Website-Features-Images151-1.png,N,,2026-01-16 17:57:13.996569

It also helps limit pollution from two sources: food waste and plane exhaust.
Those scraps create harmful air pollution when they are dumped in a landfill to decompose.
Net zero means that more air pollution is prevented, or removed through better processes, than is generated, according to the University of Oxford.
The Illinois method uses hydrothermal liquefaction — involving water, medium temperatures, and high pressure — to turn food waste into biocrude oil.","An innovative research group is turning food scraps into air miles.

That's because the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign team's process can convert the waste into sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, that meets industry performance standards without adding petroleum, according to a news release.

""This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,"" corresponding author Professor Yuanhui Zhang said.

It also helps limit pollution from two sources: food waste and plane exhaust.

The World Food Program reported that about 20% of food is wasted, or about a billion meals a day. Those scraps create harmful air pollution when they are dumped in a landfill to decompose.

For its part, aviation accounts for about 2% of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions, according to U.S. government data.

But the industry is working to operate more cleanly, and Illinois' circularly made SAF ""could help it meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,"" the experts stated. Net zero means that more air pollution is prevented, or removed through better processes, than is generated, according to the University of Oxford.

The Illinois method uses hydrothermal liquefaction — involving water, medium temperatures, and high pressure — to turn food waste into biocrude oil. Impurities like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur are removed, leaving crucial hydrocarbons (compounds of hydrogen and carbon).

Hydrogen and other catalysts are used to refine it into plane fuel. The team needed to test dozens of mixtures to find the right one.

Amazingly, the researchers said their technique mimics the natural creation of crude oil deep in the Earth without dinosaur bones.

""It uses high heat and pressure,"" lead author Sabrina Summers added. ""The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure.""

The researchers gathered scraps for their experiments from a nearby processing plant. They estimated that 30% of food is wasted worldwide at some point from farms to plates. The method can use other feedstock such as biowaste, manure, algal blooms, and sewage.

Other experts are pursuing cleaner flights as well. Hydrogen-powered and even electric planes are in development.

Battery power is already effective on the ground — electric vehicles prevent thousands of pounds of air pollution annually compared to gas-powered cars, per the U.S. Department of Energy. Air pollution creates smog that's harmful to human health. Eye irritation and cancer risks are concerns listed by the National Library of Medicine that worsen with longer exposure.

Drivers typically save about $1,500 a year in gas and service costs, thanks in part to nixing oil and other fluid changes. Those advantages could be realized for air travel, too, and Joby Aviation is among the companies bringing electric flight to fruition.

On the ground, Kelley Blue Book has a list of incentives for buying and charging EVs by state to get you started on making the switch.

At the University of Illinois, the researchers see their work as bending the traditional linear mindset when it comes to product use. And the process could also be leveraged to create petroleum-free compounds for other things, including plastic.

""We just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product,"" Zhang said.

The fuel has passed industry and government testing and has ""potential"" to be scaled for commercialization, per the release.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iStock-1496407525.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 11:58:02.904107

The report highlights China’s unique feedstock and manufacturing advantages, and projects long-term cost implications across different technical production pathways.
Notably, the Power-to-Liquid (PtL) pathway — best known for producing electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) — shows the greatest potential for long-term cost reduction.
Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: “As a vital player in global aviation and the SAF ecosystem, the Chinese Mainland’s development of its domestic SAF industry not only capitalizes on global momentum and supports national carbon targets, but also helps promote the availability and affordability of SAF needed by the global aviation industry.
Such progress will be essential for global airlines to realize further SAF usage in a commercially viable way.”","Cathay welcomes the release of Igniting the SAF Market: Policy Pathways for Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel in China, a research study published by Peking University’s National School of Development in late 2025. The in-depth analysis and recommendations outlined in the study offer actionable insights on scaling SAF adoption in the Chinese Mainland through market measures on both supply and demand fronts.

The study examines the challenges and untapped potential in scaling SAF in the Chinese Mainland, benchmarking global best practices while drawing parallels with China’s thriving solar photovoltaic industry. The report highlights China’s unique feedstock and manufacturing advantages, and projects long-term cost implications across different technical production pathways. Notably, the Power-to-Liquid (PtL) pathway — best known for producing electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) — shows the greatest potential for long-term cost reduction. The study notes that, with appropriate policy support, SAF produced locally via PtL may achieve price parity with conventional jet fuel (including China’s projected carbon price in 2030) when the cumulative eSAF output reaches 1.6 million tons.

In addition, the study recommends a multi-pronged approach to growing the national SAF industry and capturing long-term cost benefits, from policy integration and stimulating market demand to expanding international market access and establishing procurement mechanisms that ensure stable supply and demand.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: “As a vital player in global aviation and the SAF ecosystem, the Chinese Mainland’s development of its domestic SAF industry not only capitalizes on global momentum and supports national carbon targets, but also helps promote the availability and affordability of SAF needed by the global aviation industry.

“This study by Peking University is encouraging, as it demonstrates the long-term potential for cost parity between SAF and conventional jet fuel, provided there is sufficient support for the development of new technologies and large-scale SAF production, along with policies that support SAF deployment from both demand and supply sides. Such progress will be essential for global airlines to realize further SAF usage in a commercially viable way.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Cathay_Jan25_90ac7a7ae3.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 11:58:09.047966

The baseline year for reduction goals is 2019.
eBay’s climate transition plan provides an inside-out view of the company’s impact on climate change and an outside-in perspective on physical and financial risks that could impact eBay’s business as weather patterns change and the world warms.
It is meant to motivate eBay partners, sellers and employees by linking climate goals more explicitly to the company’s long-term business and financial growth strategy, Morin said.
eBay published a “carrier engagement guide” in 2024 that outlines its minimum expectations of shipping and logistics partners.","eBay, the world’s biggest resale company, has joined the growing cohort of companies that have published a climate transition plan outlining specific steps needed to meet corporate emissions reduction targets.

Delivering the goods sold by the 134 million sellers on its marketplace to their customers is eBay’s biggest greenhouse gas liability: it accounts for almost 84 percent of total emissions.

The 30-year-old company vows to cut that footprint by 27.5 percent by 2030 — it has already achieved a 21 percent reduction — and to reach a 90 percent cut across all emissions categories by 2045. The baseline year for reduction goals is 2019.

Those commitments were validated in 2025 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the 37-page roadmap published Jan. 14 is a “natural follow-on” to the many cross-function conversations and data-modeling exercises required to come up with the goals, said eBay Chief Sustainability Officer Renee Morin.

“This is not a report that came out of the blue,” she said.

Approximately one-quarter of companies that report greenhouse gas emissions to research firm CDP have published a climate transition plan, but that number is growing rapidly because of anticipated regulatory changes in Europe and potential requirements as part of the forthcoming overhaul of SBTi’s Corporate Net Zero Standard.

eBay’s climate transition plan provides an inside-out view of the company’s impact on climate change and an outside-in perspective on physical and financial risks that could impact eBay’s business as weather patterns change and the world warms. It is meant to motivate eBay partners, sellers and employees by linking climate goals more explicitly to the company’s long-term business and financial growth strategy, Morin said.

Certain sections of the plan are likely to be updated on an annual basis, but eBay hasn’t finalized a schedule.

“At the end of the day, when you can show the value of sustainability, the value of decarbonizing, the value of derisking systems, then businesses are going to lean into those outputs,” she said.

For example, eBay acknowledges in the report that shipping partners may be adversely affected by flooding, extreme heat or natural disasters exacerbated by climate change. It’s in their interest to collaborate with eBay on potential solutions, the report suggests.

Prioritizing carriers

eBay doesn’t own fleets or warehouses. But it is prioritizing relationships with carriers including DHL, UPS and FedEx that have explicit goals to decarbonize their operations through investments in electric delivery vehicles and procurement of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). FedEx, for example, has committed to shifting all of its new vehicle purchases to electric models by 2030. UPS and DHL have similar EV buying plans, and both aim to use SAF for 30 percent of their air operations before 2035.

Other strategies eBay is expanding: local delivery options and the use of ground shipping versus air freight, which generates higher emissions.

eBay published a “carrier engagement guide” in 2024 that outlines its minimum expectations of shipping and logistics partners. It requires all to set short- and long-term emissions reductions goals that are certified by an independent organization and to report annually on strategies for renewable energy, sustainable packaging and operational efficiencies.

In order to reach net zero by 2045, eBay estimates it will need to work with carriers to cut emissions from those activities by 46 percent.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ebay_DSC5412.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:56:39.799641

The Europe sustainable finance market size was calculated to be USD 276.75 billion in 2025 and is anticipated to be worth USD 1,807 billion by 2034, growing from USD 340.92 billion in 2026 at a CAGR of 23.18% during the forecast period.

Sustainable finance refers to the integration of environmental, social, and governance criteria into financial decision-making to redirect capital toward long-term ecological resilience and societal well-being. Unlike conventional finance, it embeds planetary boundaries and just transition principles into lending, investment, and risk assessment frameworks. The European Union has institutionalized this paradigm through binding regulatory architecture, including the Taxonomy Regulation, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. As per the European Commission, around 50000 companies across the EU are now required to disclose detailed sustainability performance data under the CSRD starting from 2025. Furthermore, the European Central Bank has already conducted a comprehensive climate-focused stress test across a wide range of significant institutions to evaluate their preparedness and the systemic risks related to climate change. According to sources, the European Union continues to work towards its ambitious climate neutrality goal, a target that experts and institutions suggest will require substantial, ongoing annual investment across various strategic sectors to bridge the funding gap. This systemic recalibration of capital allocation mechanisms positions Europe not merely as a market but as a regulatory laboratory for global sustainable finance standards.

MARKET DRIVERS

Mandatory ESG Disclosure Requirements Are Reshaping Capital Allocation Incentives

The enforcement of granular sustainability reporting obligations under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive has fundamentally altered how financial institutions assess risk and opportunity, which drives the growth of the Europe sustainable finance market. A substantial number of European entities must now provide extensive sustainability disclosures, including all scopes of greenhouse gas emissions, under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. This data transparency enables asset managers to align portfolios with the EU Taxonomy’s technical screening criteria, which define what constitutes environmentally sustainable economic activity. European asset managers are increasingly integrating EU Taxonomy alignment metrics into their reporting, driven by regulatory obligations and growing market demand. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority observes a general increase in the number of insurers incorporating climate-related physical and transition risks into their overall risk and solvency assessments. These regulatory mandates reduce information asymmetry and create a level playing field where capital naturally flows toward verifiable sustainability performers rather than self-declared greenwashers. Consequently, demand for sustainable financial instruments, from green bonds to sustainability-linked loans, has shifted from voluntary preference to compliance-driven necessity.

Integration of Climate Risk Into Prudential Regulation Is Amplifying Institutional Demand

European financial supervisors have embedded climate considerations directly into capital adequacy and risk management frameworks, which propels the expansion of the Europe sustainable finance market. This compels banks and insurers to internalize long-term environmental externalities. In 2023, European authorities conducted simultaneous stress tests across a wide representation of the banking sector to assess resilience to economic and climate-related challenges. Recent European climate scenario analyses indicate that a sudden, disorderly shift to a green economy, combined with negative economic conditions, could lead to significantly elevated credit risk and increased potential losses in bank loan portfolios. As a result, the ECB now requires significant institutions to develop multiyear climate risk management plans as part of their Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. Similarly, European regulatory bodies are consistently enhancing transparency requirements, mandating extensive annual public disclosures from banks regarding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and the carbon footprint of their lending activities. The Network for Greening the Financial System has expanded to include a substantial majority of central banks and financial supervisors globally, including the European Central Bank and many national central banks across the European Union. This regulatory pressure cascades into client engagement as banks adjust credit pricing based on borrowers’ decarbonization trajectories. Major private financial institutions are increasingly implementing innovative financial products, such as sustainability-linked loans, which adjust lending rates based on borrowers achieving specific, independently verified environmental performance targets. This systemic recalibration ensures that sustainable finance is not a niche product but a foundational component of financial resilience.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Persistent Data Fragmentation Undermines Comparable ESG Assessments

The region faces acute problems in data quality consistency and interoperability across sustainability metrics, despite ambitious disclosure mandates, which in turn impedes the growth of the Europe sustainable finance market. Investment fund documentation often displays a lack of uniformity in how environmental alignment is measured and reported. Variations in calculation methods can lead to differing sustainability profiles for funds with comparable investment objectives. Corporate reporting frequently lacks comprehensive, verified data regarding indirect emissions within the broader supply chain. A significant portion of a company's environmental impact often stems from these indirect sources rather than direct operations. The absence of standardized disclosure practices complicates the ability of stakeholders to compare the ecological footprints of various market participants. This data gap forces financial institutions to rely on estimates, proxies, and third-party ratings that often lack transparency and exhibit low correlation. Mandated sustainability disclosures may just become a 'box-ticking' exercise without standardized digital reporting formats and public verification infrastructure, ultimately obscuring actual performance and eroding market integrity and investor trust.

Risk of Regulatory Arbitrage Due to Divergent National Implementation Timelines

The EU's sustainable finance framework is in place, but its inconsistent adoption across member states is causing fragmentation and compliance uncertainty, which limits the expansion of the Europe sustainable finance market. European Union member states have consistently worked toward a unified, phased implementation of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation's detailed disclosure requirements across the entire bloc. This discrepancy enables firms to relocate fund domiciliation or reporting functions to jurisdictions with lighter supervisory scrutiny. Additionally, non-EU financial centers like Switzerland and the United Kingdom are developing parallel but non-equivalent standards. The United Kingdom and the European Union have developed distinct approaches to classifying sustainable economic activities, resulting in a divergence in the scope of their respective green taxonomies. This regulatory asymmetry complicates cross-border capital flows and increases compliance costs for multinational asset managers who must maintain multiple reporting systems. Jurisdictional inconsistency will continue to partially constrain the single market for sustainable finance until the ESAs achieve supervisory convergence through binding technical standards and on-site inspections.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Scaling Transition Finance for Hard-to-Abate Sectors Presents a Structural Opportunity

The region’s industrial decarbonization imperative has caused demand for transition finance mechanisms tailored to sectors where zero-emission technologies are not yet commercially viable, which provides new opportunities for the growth of the Europe sustainable finance market. Heavy industries have historically been underrepresented in sustainable financing relative to their emissions contribution. A new legislative framework in the region now explicitly supports industrial transition pathways, making them eligible for sustainability-linked financing instruments. Central banking institutions have started accepting transition bonds from heavy industry entities as collateral, provided these bonds align with specific, verifiable environmental targets. Industry groups project the potential mobilization of significant private capital for industrial transition projects, contingent upon the adoption of standardized performance indicators and verification protocols. This structured approach transforms high-carbon sectors from sustainability liabilities into investable transition opportunities, thereby expanding the market beyond renewable energy and electric mobility into the core of Europe’s industrial fabric.

Digital Infrastructure for Verifiable Impact Tracking Is Unlocking New Product Innovation

The emergence of secure digital platforms for real-time sustainability data exchange is enabling novel financial instruments with dynamic pricing linked to verified environmental outcomes, which is expected to fuel the expansion of the Europe sustainable finance market. Several countries are piloting digital registries that link corporate environmental reporting with financial systems to automate compliance. Industrial networks are connecting manufacturers and suppliers to share audited supply chain carbon data, which banks are using to adjust lending rates. Regulatory authorities have endorsed the use of distributed ledger technology for verifying the impact of green bonds, potentially reducing reliance on third-party attestations. Tokenized sustainability-linked bonds issued on regulated platforms have experienced significant growth, driven by demand for transparent impact attribution. This digital layer transforms sustainable finance from static label-based categorization to continuous performance-based capital allocation, thereby enhancing credibility, scalability, and investor confidence in measurable environmental returns.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Greenwashing Allegations Are Eroding Market Credibility and Consumer Trust

The proliferation of unsubstantiated sustainability claims continues to affect market integrity and deter mainstream capital participation, which challenges the growth of the Europe sustainable finance market. A significant number of reviewed product claims relating to environmental benefits have been found to lack clear substantiation or rely on general, non-standardized terminology. Moreover, a notable portion of investment funds marketed under the most stringent sustainability category have demonstrated limited alignment with established environmental criteria in initial portfolio evaluations. Discrepancies identified in the marketing and actual integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices have led to regulatory enforcement measures against specific asset managers. There is a developing trend of public caution, as recent surveys indicate that a minority of individual investors express confidence in the current labeling systems for sustainable investment funds. This credibility deficit increases due diligence costs for institutional allocators and discourages retail participation, and thereby constrains the market’s ability to achieve the scale necessary for systemic impact.

Talent Shortage in Interdisciplinary Sustainability Finance Expertise Is Constraining Implementation Capacity

There is a critical need for professionals with a versatile blend of financial acumen, climate science data analytics skills, and regulatory knowledge to successfully put the region's sustainable finance framework into action, a shortfall which hinders the expansion of the Europe sustainable finance market. A notable pattern across the industry indicates that few financial institutions have established fully staffed departments dedicated solely to sustainable finance initiatives or the granular verification of alignment with common sustainability frameworks. Across many financial institutions, a perceived gap is consistently noted in the number of employees possessing the specific training needed to interpret complex environmental scenario data for credit assessment. There appears to be an observed lag in the development of dedicated, specialized academic programs within higher education to support the growing workforce demands in sustainable finance. This human capital bottleneck delays product development, increases reliance on external consultants, and heightens compliance risks as institutions struggle to interpret evolving technical standards from the Platform on Sustainable Finance. Europe's ambitious sustainable finance goals risk outpacing actual capacity unless we invest together in reskilling and education reform.

REPORT COVERAGE

SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS

By Investment Type Insights

The fixed income instruments segment dominated the Europe sustainable finance market by accounting for a 58.6% share in 2024. The dominance of the fixed income instruments segment is driven by the maturity, reliability, and regulatory alignment of green and sustainability-linked bonds. A notable preference exists among specific large-scale investors for fixed income instruments, driven by their stable and foreseeable cash flow characteristics and suitability for matching their long-term financial obligations. The inclusion of certain green bonds within a major central bank's asset purchase initiatives has contributed to increased market depth and liquidity for these types of financial products. New regulatory measures establishing a regional standard for green bonds, which includes requirements for independent verification and specific alignment criteria, are strengthening investor confidence and mitigating concerns about misrepresentation of environmental claims. There has been substantial issuance of green bonds by regional entities, with the majority of proceeds directed toward financing renewable energy and energy efficiency projects that satisfy stringent technical criteria. This convergence of regulatory credibility, institutional demand, and transparent use of proceeds solidifies fixed income as the backbone of Europe’s sustainable capital markets.

The mixed allocation strategies segment is anticipated to witness the fastest CAGR of 18.7% from 2025 to 2033 due to investor demand for diversified sustainable portfolios that combine equities, fixed income, and alternative assets under unified ESG mandates. New sustainable investment funds are increasingly adopting diversified strategies that combine different asset types to manage risk while pursuing positive environmental or social impacts. This shift is being accelerated by the regulatory environment, which encourages managers to define and categorize products based on sustainability objectives. Consequently, a growing share of funds with high sustainability classifications are utilizing mixed-allocation strategies. Innovations in ESG data integration platforms enable real-time portfolio rebalancing based on corporate decarbonization progress, enhancing responsiveness. Mixed allocation is becoming the primary vehicle for mainstream retail investor adoption, which offers a way to gain comprehensive sustainability exposure while maintaining portfolio diversification.

The green bonds segment led the Europe sustainable finance market by capturing a 42.5% share in 2024. The leading position of the green brands segment is attributed to standardized frameworks, strong sovereign issuance, and corporate climate commitments. There is a significant and growing volume of green bonds in circulation within the region. Public sector entities represent a substantial share of the total market volume. A key pattern is the allocation of proceeds from specific public bond programs exclusively to climate and biodiversity initiatives. The market shows a movement towards enhanced standards and increased transparency. The vast majority of regional green bonds currently meet advanced transparency benchmarks, a higher rate than typically seen in the global market. This regulatory rigor, combined with central bank eligibility and strong secondary market liquidity, has made green bonds the default instrument for institutional investors seeking verifiable environmental impact without compromising credit quality.

The ESG investing segment is likely to experience the fastest CAGR of 21.3% during the forecast period, owing to mandatory disclosures and the integration of sustainability into core investment processes rather than as a niche overlay. Following the implementation of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) Level 2 in the European Union in early 2023, an extensive majority of asset managers have incorporated ESG factors into their fundamental investment analysis processes. This shift moves beyond exclusionary screening toward active ownership, including voting on climate resolutions and engaging with portfolio companies on decarbonization roadmaps. The number of ESG-focused shareholder resolutions in Europe has increased significantly in recent years, demonstrating growing investor activism on sustainability issues. Furthermore, the European Commission’s MiFID II amendments require financial advisors to assess clients’ sustainability preferences during suitability tests, directly channeling retail capital into ESG-integrated products. Unlike labeled bonds, ESG investing permeates the entire capital allocation system, making it a structural rather than thematic driver of market evolution.

By Industry Verticals Insights

Here he shares his perspective on how current trends may play out over the coming year and beyond.

Low-Cost Carriers Continue to Drive Airline Growth

Through to the end of this decade, expect most growth globally to be generated from the low-cost airline sector. Major low-cost operators are due to receive their latest aircraft orders and will expand their networks further. And for many of those airlines we should expect to see an ever-greater focus on ancillary product revenues and maybe even some premium products coming to the market.

Smart Airlines Will Gain an Advantage with AI

Expect lots of stories around AI and its increasing use in the industry with many of the developments in operational areas. Every slight efficiency gained by using AI should result in a cost benefit to the airlines and improved margins for those clever airlines that test thoroughly and adopt early.

Record Revenues For Many Airlines?

Based on current demand and capacity trends, 2026 looks set to be a good year with the potential for record levels of profitability for most airline CEOs with the potential for record levels of profitability. Even some of the less efficient national airlines could break even. Demand continues to be strong Ddespite concerns around economic growth and consumer confidence d, emand continues to be strong, and a weakening of the US Dollar would be a positive for many airlines.

Expect More Longer Narrow-Bodied Flights

In 2025, there were some 44,400 narrow-bodied flights - an increase of over 18% compared to 2024 - that lasted in excess of more than seven hours and thirty minutes, an increase of over 18% on the 2024 number. We expect that to comfortably break the 50,000 mark in 2026 with many transatlantic services added.

Airlines Will Adapt to Geo-Political Events – at a Cost

Sadly, the reach of geo-politics will never be far away and is always outside the control of the airlines that are inevitably impacted. Airlines and their management teams are very skilled at flipping capacity when necessary, but it always takes a lot of effort and cost.

Sustainability Will Improve, But Targets Remain Hard to Reach

Progress will be made on many sustainability fronts from Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through to airport facilities and operational vehicles, but meeting the industry’s targets remains almost impossible given where we are today.

Highlights intensifying race for industrial firms to shape climate, energy and policy pathways

Rolls Royce has appointed former bp Chief Sustainability Officer Ivanka Mamic as Global Head of Government Relations and Chief Sustainability Officer. The new post places sustainability and government engagement within a single leadership portfolio at one of Britain’s most strategically important industrial technology companies.

A Strategic Hire at a Geopolitical Moment

Rolls Royce has been positioning its civil aerospace, defense, and emerging energy systems businesses for a decade defined by decarbonisation, industrial security, and techno-political competition. The decision to combine sustainability with government relations is notable for a firm that operates across regulated markets, sovereign-level procurement, and long-duration climate and energy transition cycles.

Mamic joins after five years at bp, where she led the design and execution of the company’s global sustainability strategy. Her tenure coincided with bp’s public push into low carbon energy and investor engagement on climate transition through 2020 to 2023, followed by a strategic rebalancing last year. That shift included a larger allocation of capital to oil and gas and reduced capex for low carbon investments to below five percent.

Before bp, Mamic spent nearly a decade in sustainability-focused roles at Target, including oversight of global responsible sourcing. She has worked across decarbonisation strategy, supply chain accountability and corporate governance, and has engaged with regulators and investors on the materiality of climate risk.

Personal Statement as Transition Marker

In a public statement announcing her move, Mamic said she was motivated by mission focus and industrial heritage. She noted: “As someone with a strong interest in enduring, mission-driven companies, I am proud to join this iconic British organisation and be part of a team focused on excellence and innovation to drive real-world solutions to complex challenges.”

On LinkedIn, she added: “I’m excited to start 2026 by joining Rolls-Royce as Global Head of Government Relations and Chief Sustainability Officer.” She described her bp experience as “highly formative and rewarding” and continued: “I am deeply thankful for the experiences, the trust, and most importantly the people I had the pleasure of working with. To the teams, colleagues and partners across bp, my best wishes in the year to come.”

Implications for Governance, Policy and Investors

The appointment lands at a time when industrial firms are facing simultaneous demands: accelerate decarbonisation, secure supply chains, manage cost of capital, and navigate proliferating disclosure and taxonomy regimes across the EU, UK and US.

Rolls Royce has been exploring next generation small modular nuclear reactors for both national energy security and export markets. It has also been working on sustainable aviation fuel pathways and propulsion efficiency for the civil aviation sector. All three arenas are reliant on public policy, regulatory certainty and government procurement.

For institutional investors with exposure to aerospace, defense and energy transition infrastructure, the combined government relations and sustainability role may streamline engagement on climate transition, industrial policy, and regulatory risk. It could also signal that high-emitting and strategically sensitive industrials expect climate and energy transition outcomes to be decided as much in parliaments and negotiating rooms as in capital markets.

What to Watch

C suite leaders and sustainable finance professionals will be looking for clarity on how Rolls Royce integrates climate strategy with policy advocacy. The company sits at the intersection of NATO country defense spending, net zero aviation debates, nuclear energy innovation, and industrial competitiveness. Each features distinct timelines, stakeholders and capital needs.

Waste-based sustainable aviation fuel could generate 62.5 billion liters of jet fuel annually while reducing emissions by 80-90%.

Scientists have found a way to turn everyday trash into jet fuel that produces 80-90% less carbon than traditional aviation fuel. The breakthrough could transform the 2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions that come from air travel.

Research published recently in Science Direct shows that waste headed for landfills could produce 62.5 billion liters of jet fuel annually. This waste-based sustainable aviation fuel would cover a significant portion of aviation’s fuel needs while keeping organic waste out of dumps where it would decompose and release methane.

The aviation industry faces a major challenge in reducing its carbon footprint. Unlike cars or trucks, which can switch to electric power, airplanes require fuel that packs tremendous energy into a small, lightweight package. This makes the industry one of the hardest to clean up from a climate perspective.

Current alternative fuel options, called sustainable aviation fuels, face their own problems. Growing crops specifically for fuel can displace natural habitats or divert land from food production. This creates new environmental problems while trying to solve old ones.

Enter waste-based sustainable aviation fuel. Michael McElroy, an environmental studies professor at Harvard University, notes that organic waste offers an overlooked opportunity. Cities already collect garbage regularly, and the supply stays consistent throughout the year. These factors make municipal solid waste an attractive starting material for fuel production.

Until now, no one had crunched the numbers on trash-based jet fuel at a global scale, using real data from actual production facilities. An international research team from the United States and China calculated that incorporating waste-based fuel into aviation could reduce the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions by 16%. This would mean the emissions from roughly one out of six flights would be eliminated.

The process isn’t simple. Garbage contains everything from food scraps to paper to yard waste, creating a literal mixed bag of materials. This variety requires more processing steps and more energy to convert trash into usable fuel compared to using a single crop type.

The biggest hurdle happens right at the start. Ming Zhao, an environmental engineering professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, explains that gasification technology remains a core challenge. This process converts solid waste into a mixture of gases that can then be refined into fuel. Getting it to work reliably and efficiently determines whether the whole system succeeds.

Scientists continue making progress on these technical challenges. A separate team at the University of Illinois focuses specifically on food waste, which makes up the largest portion of what most households discard. They developed a faster method using a process called hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts food scraps into a thick, energy-rich liquid.

The catch with this biocrude oil is its inconsistent chemical makeup. Jet engines require fuel with very specific, uniform properties for safety and performance reasons. The Illinois researchers tested dozens of chemical catalysts to refine the biocrude and found a cobalt-molybdenum combination that works in a single step.

The waste-based sustainable aviation fuel meets current industry standards and can be used directly in airplanes without mixing it with conventional fuel. This marks the first time researchers have achieved this milestone with food waste as the starting material. The same biocrude can also be refined into gasoline and diesel for cars and trucks.

Despite these advances, both research teams acknowledge an important limitation of the waste-based sustainable aviation fuel. Neither food waste nor municipal solid waste alone could completely replace conventional jet fuel. This reality highlights the substantial amount of fuel consumed by the aviation industry and the numerous solutions needed to fully decarbonize air travel.

The waste-based sustainable aviation fuel approach offers several advantages beyond emissions reduction. It addresses two problems at once by diverting organic material from landfills while creating a valuable product. Cities spend a significant amount of money managing waste, so converting garbage into fuel could help offset some of these costs.

The technology also avoids competing with food production and does not require new land to grow fuel crops. The collection infrastructure already exists in most cities worldwide. These factors could make trash-based fuel easier to scale up compared to other alternative fuel options.

However, building the processing facilities and refining operations requires substantial investment. The technology needs to prove itself at a commercial scale, not just in research laboratories. Fuel made from waste must also compete on price with conventional jet fuel, which remains relatively cheap.

Airlines have committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but they need viable alternatives to make this goal a reality. Sustainable aviation fuels derived from various sources, including waste, are likely to play a crucial role in meeting these targets. Regulatory support and financial incentives may help accelerate the adoption of these cleaner fuel options.

The research demonstrates that waste materials previously considered worthless can become valuable energy resources. As gasification and refining technologies improve, waste-based sustainable aviation fuel may become increasingly practical and affordable. This could help make air travel more compatible with climate goals while improving waste management.",https://happyeconews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bao-menglong-FhoJYnw-cg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 11:00:07.434051

The aviation sector’s shift towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) continues to be a hot topic with ambitious goals for decarbonization. However, a closer look reveals that although production of SAF is projected to nearly double this year—from 1 million tonnes in 2024 up to 1.9 million tonnes in 2025—the growth rate is already showing signs of tapering off. This slowing momentum poses challenges in meeting the airline industry’s ambitious carbon reduction targets and raises questions about the pace at which sustainable fuels can replace conventional jet fuels.

Why Has Growth Slowed?

Policy choices, especially in Europe, appear to be key culprits in holding back the scale-up of SAF production capacity. Despite the potential for SAF to significantly cut carbon emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels, regulatory frameworks have sometimes been misaligned or too slow to adapt. This has resulted in slower investments and hesitant production expansion.

Efforts by sustainable aviation fuel advocates stress that progress depends not only on ramping up production but ensuring the fuel remains economically viable and scalable without disrupting other sectors such as agriculture. The preferred feedstocks for SAF often include waste products like used cooking oil, algae, and non-food crops, which don’t compete with food supply chains.

Implications for Air Cargo and Global Logistics

The repercussions of SAF production trends stretch beyond just the commercial passenger airlines; freight and cargo logistics are closely tied to the aviation fuel market. Sustainable fuels could reshape the cost structures and environmental impact of air freight, which remains a vital artery for global supply chains—especially for time-sensitive and high-value items.

When SAF production growth slows, the sector risks missing critical environmental targets, keeping carbon emissions from air freight and courier services higher for longer. This creates a ripple effect throughout industries reliant on quick and reliable global distribution, from electronics to pharmaceuticals.

Year Estimated SAF Production (million tonnes) Growth Rate Decarbonization Goal Alignment 2024 1.0 Baseline Initial scaling 2025 1.9 ~90% increase Growth slowing, falling short Beyond 2025 Limited projections Uncertain, below targets Potential gap in meeting targets

Challenges Facing the Aviation Fuel Transition

There are no shortcuts here—transforming the aviation fuel industry is like turning a massive ship; it can’t happen overnight. SAF production involves complex supply chains and requires substantial capital investments in new facilities and technology. The current mismatch between policy ambitions and practical on-the-ground realities slows infrastructure growth and investor confidence.

Moreover, it’s critical to ensure that SAF production does not inadvertently create new environmental or social issues, such as land use conflicts or biodiversity loss, which some traditional biofuel sources have been criticized for. The aviation industry, including groups like the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG), advocates for fuels that minimize negative side effects and integrate seamlessly with existing aircraft engines and fuel distribution networks.

Impacts on Logistics Providers and Freight Forwarders

For logistics operators, air freight remains an essential part of global distribution, especially when speed is of the essence. The current plateauing of SAF production means that reliance on traditional jet fuel will persist longer than anticipated, forcing freight companies to keep factoring in rising costs and environmental concerns. This could pressure logistics strategies to diversify transportation modes and seek greener alternatives where feasible.

Heading Toward Sustainable Transport Solutions

While SAF is a promising piece of the broader green transport puzzle, it highlights a key lesson: sustainability transitions in logistics and transportation require coordinated policy, technology, and market support. Companies engaged in cargo delivery, moving, and freight forwarding must stay informed about these fuel shifts as they can influence pricing, availability, and compliance demands globally.

Key Takeaways:

SAF growth is strong but losing steam, which may affect meeting climate goals in aviation.

Policy misalignment in major regions like Europe contributes to slower production scale-up.

Air freight logistics could face persistent challenges, as SAF supply lags demand growth.

Focus on sustainable feedstocks helps balance environmental and economic objectives.

Logistics operators need to stay agile, incorporating sustainable fuels and planning for evolving supply chains.

Formula 1 thrives on change. The cars evolve constantly – but for 2026, revolution rather than evolution is the order of things with wholesale changes to both chassis and engine regulations.

After 11 seasons, the original hybrid F1 power unit spec has been retired, while after a brief, four-season foray into ground-effect, the sport will also undergo an aerodynamic reboot. There’s a lot to unpack: fresh philosophies, new jargon, and a lot of numbers. We’ll get into all of that over the next few months, but for the moment, here are the top notes for the all-new 2026 F1 Championship.

Let’s talk horsepower. What’s changing with the power units?

After 11 seasons with, in essence, the same power unit architecture, F1 has had a rethink for 2026. The 1.6L V6 turbocharged internal combustion engine (ICE) remains, but the MGU-H (which used the flow of exhaust gas to spin a turbine and reclaim energy) has been removed. The MGU-K (which reclaims energy while braking) will be beefed up to harvest and deploy about three times as much energy as its predecessor, with the goal of the new power unit having a roughly 50:50 split between power supplied by the ICE and from the electric system.

With the MGU-H – viewed as complicated and less road-relevant – removed, the new ’26 power units are being hailed as a simplified hybrid system. The reality is a little more complex: this is – as always with F1 – cutting-edge technology, attempting to do something that’s never been done before.

We’re also having an aerodynamic reboot. Isn’t it unusual to do both at the same time?

It isn’t the way F1 usually operates – but this aerodynamic reboot is designed to complement the new power unit… while also addressing a few of F1’s long-standing issues. The new power units are expected to produce a little less power than their predecessors, but to keep lap times in a similar range, the cars have reduced drag and a lower minimum weight, aided by narrower floor and tyres, and a shorter wheelbase.

What are the most prominent aero changes?

The front wing is of a much simpler design with fewer elements, though the endplates have a little more scope for exotic solutions. The ‘eyebrow’ winglets over the front wheels have also been deleted, with new bargeboards appearing. Less noticeable but fundamental to the design is the removal of the Venturi tunnels under the car. Ground-effect goes back into the box as flat(ter) floors return, with a larger diffuser, and the beam (i.e. lower) wing deleted.

Is the new aero package going to impact racing?

Certainly, it is intended to. As has been the case with the previous two aerodynamic iterations, the regulations have been written with the intention of improving racing and increasing overtaking, by enabling cars to be able to follow each other more closely.

The car’s front wheels punch a big hole in the airflow. Designers like to push that turbulent air out to the side of the car (out-washing), allowing smoother air to infill and make the aerodynamic surfaces more effective… but out-washing creates a bigger turbulent wake that makes it much more difficult for the car behind to close in. 2022’s regs were designed to combat the creation of this wake and were initially very successful before teams began clawing back their outwash-generating aerodynamics. These regs have taken that learning and will make it much harder to generate an outwash. Not that teams won’t try…

Beyond controlling the wake, the new regs are also creating a stronger, safer car and, it is hoped, one that is a little more nimble. Roll hoops have a new test to pass that raises the load from 16g to 20g, while the nose now has a two-stage impact structure. The latter is to deal with the issue of secondary impacts – i.e. those times when the front of the car has a heavy impact, spins and then has another heavy impact.

In terms of making a car that is more nimble, the 2026 regs specify a wheelbase that is 200mm shorter, a floor 100mm narrower and a minimum weight reduced from 798kg to 768kg. Whether or not anyone can get close to that minimum remains to be seen.

These cars have active aero. What’s that?

DRS no longer exists… but the cars now feature an adjustable rear wing that will open like DRS on all straights to reduce drag, irrespective of the race situation. The front wing will also move, working together with the rear wing to better trim the car. They’ll close again before corners to maximise downforce – in much the same way DRS did.

What are these modes we are hearing about?

There’s quite a bit of jargon floating about this year. The active aero modes were originally labelled X mode and Z mode. These will now be called Straight Mode and Corner Mode… you can probably extrapolate from context when those are to be used.

If a car is within one second of the car ahead when it passes a detection point (usually the final corner) Overtake Mode will be activated on the following lap. This will provide a speed boost, but also a lap in which it can recover more energy. This looks like it will be the primary overtaking device in the new formula. In ‘normal’ mode, the electrical energy that can be deployed begins to taper off at 290km/h. With Overtake Mode activated, the maximum 350kW will be available up to 337km/h, then tapering off up to 350km/h.

Other words you may hear flying around are Boost and Recharge. A boost button allows the driver to manually deploy electrical energy, in much the same way they’d done in the current generation of cars, while Recharge is the energy recovery function. It’s similar to what’s gone on before, but with a few more options than during the 2014-2025 era.

Will sustainable fuels make a difference?

Moving to 100 per cent advanced, sustainable, carbon-neutral fuels is part of F1’s roadmap to a net-zero carbon footprint. F1 had been running with a 10 per cent bioethanol fuel, but now converts fully to either an e-fuel or something created from waste biomass. The fuels used in F1 are complex creations tailored to their engines: designing any new fuel for the 2026 regs was going to be challenging - doing it with a sustainable fuel, doubly so. The expectation is that the new blends will be slightly less calorific than their fossil predecessors… but development will be rapid over the next few years. Expect this to be a more competitive arena than it has been recently.",https://mclaren.bloomreach.io/delivery/resources/content/gallery/mclaren-racing/formula-1/2026/editorial/explainers/new-regs/explaining-f1-regs-2026-hero-desktop.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:57:39.810608

In the European energy sector, 2022–2025 became a period of rethinking. Just yesterday, the world was trying to find a balance between cheap gas, the growth of green energy, and the logic of the electricity market. But today, Europe is already building new networks, introducing digital rules for trade transparency, and preparing space for industries that are sharply increasing demand for electricity, starting with data centres and ending with electric transport.

During this same time, Ukraine has lived several “energy lives”. It lost energy infrastructure facilities after missile strikes and simultaneously synchronised with the European network, put into operation the largest energy storage systems in the region, and reshaped the investment optics of business. It is painful, but productive: the war forced us to move from the “theory of transition” to the “practice of sustainability”.

The World and the EU in 2022-2025: New Rules, New Networks, New Consumers

The European Union responded to the energy shock with packages of new rules and investments. The electricity market reform consolidated stable long-term instruments and reduced the impact of gas price fluctuations on the price of electricity. In parallel, the modernisation of energy trade supervision increased transparency and responsibility of players. At the infrastructure level, a plan for the rapid completion of networks and interstate connections appeared. And, finally, a new major consumer entered the European agenda – artificial intelligence with its data centres, which in a few years will add dozens of terawatt-hours of demand and force the acceleration of investments in networks, flexibility and demand management.

A separate trend for 2022-2025 is the return of hydrogen from the plane of slogans to the plane of rules and investments. The EU has launched the European Hydrogen Bank with production support auctions, defined green criteria for electrolyser hydrogen (RFNBO) and low-carbon hydrogen, and enabled the phased development of hydrogen infrastructure within the framework of projects of common interest. This loop is connected to transport: at sea, requirements to reduce the carbon intensity of fuel on ships have come into force, in aviation, minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), opening the door to e-methanol and “green” ammonia as energy carriers in these areas.

Europe’s hydrogen ambitions are no longer an abstraction. In 2025, the world’s first commercial e-methanol plant, powered by renewable electricity and captured CO₂, opened in Denmark. The maritime industry has also accelerated contracts for the new fuel. This does not yet solve all the cost problems, but it is already shaping a market with forecasted demand.

Ukraine in 2025: Networks, Imports and Internal Flexibility

After emergency synchronisation with the European network in March 2022, Ukraine not only kept its power system operational, but also opened commercial trade. For the autumn-winter period of 2024-2025, European operators increased the limit on electricity imports to Ukraine to 2.1 gigawatts (GW). This volume was agreed not within the framework of a preferential regime, but determined by the technical capabilities of the system, which has been tested by war and, in this regime, fulfils the conditions of a stabilisation nature.

Ukraine’s response to the electricity shortage and the destruction and decommissioning of energy infrastructure due to Russian shelling was the need to create internal flexibility. In 2025, private investors introduced a portfolio of energy storage systems with a total capacity of 200 megawatts and a capacity of 400 MWh. These are six sites optimised for balancing and emergency modes, which are already undergoing commercial testing and will operate under contracts with the transmission system operator. To put it simply, two hours of reserve for hundreds of thousands of households, exactly when it is needed most.

This did not arise in a vacuum. Back in 2023–2024, the business was massively diversifying towards gas-piston plants and small-scale cogeneration. Cities were buying mini-CHPs based on Jenbacher engines, international partners were importing modular gas turbines, and state-owned companies were launching peak decentralised production programs. All this is a forced pragmatic reaction to blackouts and shortages of energy resources.

In parallel, the regulator adjusted the rules to the new reality. Separate procedures for ancillary services auctions appeared, where storage systems and fast generation can compete for long-term contracts. For wartime, this is a conservative, but timely and reliable innovation, according to which the market receives a clear signal, the operator receives a resource for system control, and the consumer can count on a stable energy supply and a decrease in the number of outages.

Hydrogen, ammonia and methanol: European logic – Ukrainian opportunities

The EU has laid the basic conditions for a large hydrogen market. Support for production through auctions, unified methods for confirming the origin of “green” hydrogen and recognition of low-carbon hydrogen are the market rules that were missing yesterday. Further, regulation covers transport: shipping receives an obligation to reduce carbon fuel intensity, aviation – minimal shares of sustainable fuels. At this stage, hydrogen derivatives – e-methanol and “green” ammonia – come into play.

E-methanol is synthesised from hydrogen and carbon dioxide using renewable electricity, while ammonia is produced from hydrogen and nitrogen from the air. These are liquid energy carriers that are easier to store and transport using the existing bulk infrastructure, so in the transitional years, they become a practical bridge between hydrogen producers and consumers, starting from the chemical industry and the agricultural sector and ending with shipping and aviation.

Ukraine can integrate into this chain from two sides. The first is infrastructure: we have port and chemical assets on the Black Sea, including the Odessa Port Plant, which traditionally worked with ammonia. Its privatisation track in 2025 creates a platform for a restart for “green” products after the war, and not only for classic fertilisers. The second is hydrogen derivative production projects in the logic of future export flows. Investors should make decisions about this, and the regulatory background is already clear, thanks to European rules and Ukrainian policies in the field of hydrogen energy.

For general clarity, it should be noted that we are not ahead of events. Even in Europe, e-methanol projects are only moving from pilots to industrial scales this year. But right now, a “demand funnel” is forming – from ports and logistics to shipping and aviation. Entering it with the right timing means getting a solvent buyer and financing for the export logistics.

Investment instruments in war: what works in practice

Classical investment instruments continue to operate, but with a risk adjustment. Project financing with guarantees from international financial institutions, political risk insurance, blending grants and loans, long-term power purchase agreements and system services are what drive new projects even under fire. When it comes to critical infrastructure, banks and donors are becoming co-investors in resilience, not just lenders. For example, package financing for peak generation and storage systems, which international development banks approved in 2025, was precisely a response to the lack of flexibility and winter risks.

An important nuance remains the networks. The development of data centres and electrification in Europe has already raised the bar for connection requirements and demand management. Demand is growing, and the window for connections is narrowing. For Ukraine, this is also a signal that every new megawatt of wind or solar must immediately receive a place in the network and a contract for flexibility. Otherwise, investors will not pay for generation, but for downtime.

Corruption scandals: not verdicts, but risk premiums

Recent months have given the market several high-profile stories with the arrests of top officials in the energy sector. Together with our lawyer colleagues, we do not give legal assessments and do not substitute for the court. We look at this as a risk factor. For international partners, this adds a premium to the cost of capital, complicates the structure of deals and increases the role of prior conditions: audits, compliance, and transparency of procurement. If a country shows that investigations are going to the top and are being completed procedurally correctly, investors take this into account and return to the project figures. If the turbulence is systemic, the share of grant components increases, and debt resources become more expensive. This is the logic of investment and the mathematics of risk in wartime.

Lessons from the Balkans: What the experience of Croatia and its neighbours says

After the wars of the 1990s, the countries of the former Yugoslavia went through a very similar cycle. First, stabilisation and large-scale intergovernmental initiatives like the Stability Pact, which, under pressure from the EU and international banks, opened up financing specifically for infrastructure. Then came privatisation and the long, sometimes painful modernisation of utility and energy assets, which attracted private capital only after the emergence of clear rules and regulatory safeguards. Croatia came to this through institutional reforms and European integration requirements, and investments in networks and generation were a consequence, not a cause. This is not idealisation, but a useful road map for us, focused on a different paradigm, based on the principle of “first rules and networks, then large-scale investments”.

Forecast for 2026: more networks, more flexibility, more hydrogen

A realistic scenario for Ukraine for 2026 consists of three mandatory elements.

The first is networks and connections. Europe is doubling down on interconnectors and internal lines because, without them, it will not be able to sustain either renewables or data centres. We need our own accelerated grid reconstruction plan with a priority for the rapid connection of new generation and storage facilities, like the Energy Infrastructure Plan for Europe. In the long term, this is cheaper than chronic outages.

The second is flexibility as a business. Portfolio storage systems, fast peaking stations, demand management and new ancillary services markets are not a temporary solution for wartime, but a new reality. Transmission system operator contracts, a clear auction schedule and seamless integration with European regulations, that’s where the difference between projects on paper and commissioned capacities lies.

Third – hydrogen derivatives, ammonia, e-methanol, as an export strategy. We should not compete for the “greenest hydrogen in the world” tomorrow. It is worth laying the foundation for the export of products that are easier to export and for which buyers are already appearing, namely e-methanol and “green” ammonia. This requires solutions that ensure transparent privatisation and reprofiling of port and chemical assets, transparent access to networks, and contractual bridges with European consumers. The rules in the EU already exist, and our strategies are currently under open discussion. Time is pressing, but it does not punish those who act systematically and consistently.

What this means for business and politics

For investors, the signal is simple. Ukrainian energy after 2025 is about networks and flexibility in connection with long-term contracts, plus niche industries based on hydrogen derivatives, where the region can become the production arm of the EU. The cost of capital will depend on the quality of risk management, not just on the scale of assets. The key for politicians will be to quickly create a regulatory framework between national and European legislation, protect competition in auctions and make export logistics predictable.

For citizens, the most important thing is the availability of energy resources and the ease of commissioning energy-efficient solutions. Everything else is just a way to achieve this. Ukraine enters 2026 with the experience of survival and a set of working solutions. Europe is shaping the demand for green electricity, diversifying its sources of natural gas and oil, and developing new markets for hydrogen and its derivatives. At the intersection of these two trajectories lies what we call an opportunity, which Ukraine has a chance to seize.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/wind-renewables.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 03:56:29.612760

Dehydration of ethanol on the way to produce kerosene Ethanol is an alcohol based on two carbon atoms.","The conversion of methanol and ethanol to hydrocarbon fuels has been done for many years. The two dominant pathways are methanol to gasoline (MTG) and ethanol to jet (ETJ), which is also known as ethanol to kerosene (ETK), writes Stephen B. Harrison, Managing Director at sbh4 consulting, Germany.

.The smaller methanol molecule is ideal to produce the lighter gasoline fraction for cars. The larger ethanol molecule yields the heavier kerosene fraction that is required for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Plant-based bio-ethanol

Traditionally, bioethanol has been produced from fermentation of sugary broths at industrial scale. The process is essentially the same as making beer from grain and then distilling the beer to make whisky.

In Asia and the Americas, the most widely used crops for bio-ethanol production are maize and sugar cane. Rice, sorghum and cassava are also used in secondary quantities. In Europe, these crops are generally replaced by wheat and sugar-beet.

Considering these crops, it is evident that agricultural land and food crops are being diverted to the production of biofuels as affordable energy vectors. At a global level, the price of these nutritional commodities is being driven up by their competing use as a fuel. For the rich, a few cents more for a kilo of wheat or rice will not drive a family into starvation. For impoverished nations, the same is not true.

The need for alternative non-food sources of sustainable ethanol is a global imperative. And, if it can also be produced from industrial emissions, this will surely be a win-win scenario.

Industrial ethanol from recycled carbon

The US company LanzaTech utilises anaerobic acetobacter bacteria in a fermenter to convert carbon monoxide (CO) rich feed gases, such as syngas, to ethanol and a range of biochemicals. The term CCT or ‘Carbon Capture and Transformation’ has been used to describe the LanzaTech fermentation process.

The ideal feedstocks for the LanzaTech fermenter are CO-rich. Syngas derived from biomass gasification is CO-rich and is an ideal feedstock for the LanzaTech process.

Iron and steel making also yields CO-rich flue gases. Blast furnace gas (BFG) contains 20% CO and converter gas (also known as basic oxygen furnace gas or BOFG) contains 60% CO.

At present, the energy rich BOFG (LHV 3 kWh/Nm3) is often utilised on the iron and steel making facility for heat or power generation on a gas engine. Alternatively, it is flared. BFG has a lower energy value because it contains less CO (LHV 0.9 kWh/Nm3). It can also be utilised for heat and power generation, or is sent to the flare.

As an alternative to power generation or flaring, utilisation of the BFG and BOFG in the LanzaTech process can generate ethanol. Subsequently, the complimentary LanzaJet process can be used to convert the ethanol to SAF in their proprietary ETJ process.

Lifecycle analysis

The LanzaTech bioreactor utilises CO from syngas to grow bacterial biomass in the fermenter. Some gases are emitted from the fermenter. This biomass from the fermenter is subsequently converted to biomethane in a separate anaerobic sludge digester. This energy-rich biomethane which is used to fully combust the main fermenter off gases to CO2. This CO2 can either then be emitted to the air or captured.

Life cycle analysis (LCA) of the LanzaTech process shows that CO2 emissions reduction is primarily due to the substitution of fossil fuels or crude-oil derived plastics with biomaterials produced from ethanol or other co-products recovered from the fermentation broth.

Also integral to the LanzaTech LCA is consideration of whether the feedstock, such as iron and steel making flue gases are flared, or utilised. If they are flared, their recovery and conversion to ethanol is a significant environmental benefit. However, if they are utilised to make heat and power, they already avoid the use of fossil fuels and the overall CO2 reduction in the LCA is reduced.

Scaling up successfully

LanzaTech’s process was demonstrated at pilot-scale in 2008 using flue gases from the BlueScope Steel mill in Glenbrook, NZ. Since then, LanzaTech has successfully deployed its technology at two 300 tonne per annum demonstration facilities at Baosteel Shanghai and Shougang Steel Caofeidian in China. These LanzaTech fermenters are fed with a range of iron and steel making off gases including BOFG, BFG, and coke oven gas (COG).

LanzaTech also operates the Freedom Pines Biorefinery in Soperton, Georgia which uses bio fermenters to generate ethanol and other chemicals. The LanzaJet ETJ SAF production process has also been implemented at that location.

Dehydration of ethanol on the way to produce kerosene

Ethanol is an alcohol based on two carbon atoms. As an alcohol, it contains an oxygen atom. Kerosene, on the other hand, is a long paraffinic hydrocarbon with between 10 and 14 carbon atoms that contains no oxygen.

Conversion of ethanol to kerosene takes place in two separate stages. The first is dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, or ethene. This effectively removes the oxygen atom and builds a highly reactive double bond linkage between the two carbon atoms.

The dehydration reaction is effected using a zeolite type catalyst such as H-ZSM-5 at between 250 and 300 °C. Low pressure operation is preferred to enable the production of gaseous ethylene. The reaction requires a very high heat input. This is a parasitic load on the process that consumes some of the energy of the feedstock to enable the conversion to kerosene.

Ethylene oligomerisation

The ethylene produced by the dehydration of ethanol is like a mouse trap, waiting to spring open. As the double bond between the two carbon atoms bond snaps open, it reaches out for another ethylene molecule to build butene a longer hydrocarbon containing four carbon atoms.

The conversion of ethylene to butene takes place over a nickel-based catalyst and releases a significant amount of heat, which can support the dehydration reaction.

Butene also contains a highly reactive carbon double bond. When several butene molecules are combined, very long hydrocarbons are created in a polymerisation reaction. If this reaction were left to proceed, the product would be polyethylene, a plastic polymer. To produce kerosene, the reaction must be initiated and then curtailed. This partial polymerisation is known as oligomerisation.

The oligomerisation proceeds using another zeolite catalyst such as ZSM-5. If it is conducted at high temperature, branched isomers of kerosene can be produced. These are desirable because they allow the fuel to be used at low temperatures (such as those at altitude) without freezing.

Hydrotreating and fractionation

The synthetic crude (syncrude) produced by oligomerisation may still contain some residual oxygen atoms from the ethanol feedstock. These must be removed to prevent corrosion of materials handling and storing the kerosene, and to prevent polymerisation of the fuel.

Hydrogen is reacted with the syncrude to remove oxygen and convert it into water. The deoxygenated syncrude is then distilled into fractions such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene for SAF.

The economics can be optimised by tailoring the process conditions to produce the most valuable fuel, which is SAF.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SAF-refuelling-768x512.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 02:56:14.951099

With the rapeseed processing volume expected to reach around 24.68 million tonnes, it also makes the EU less dependent on imports.

Cumulative imports into the EU-27 in the first half of the crop year 2025/26 amounted to approximately 1.85 million tonnes, representing a nearly 43 per cent decline from the previous year's level of 3.23 million tonnes.

Ukraine remains the leading supplier country with just over 1.06 million tonnes to date and a 57 per cent share of imports. Nevertheless, the country's shipments remain clearly below the previous year's volume of 2.02 million tonnes.

The second wave of imports from Australia will increasingly come into focus later on in the season. By January, Australia had placed 249,869 tonnes of rapeseed on the EU market, ranking second among the major countries of origin with a share of just under 14 per cent, but trailing well behind Ukraine. According to investigations conducted by Agrarmarkt Informations-Gesellschaft (mbH), deliveries remained approximately 71 per cent below the level recorded in the reference period.

Canada continued to lose market share.

The country delivered 140,915 tonnes of rapeseed to date, which compares to 161,347 tonnes the previous year.

Because Canadian farmers grow genetically modified varieties, the use of rapeseed oil derived from Canadian rapeseed is restricted in the EU. As a result, imports from Canada are primarily used for biofuel production.

The event was open to the public and included six presentations by researchers and market experts.

Doors opened at 8:30, and after a welcome from KDIX Radio’s Mike Renner, Chris Augustin, director of the Dickinson Research Extension Center, took the floor for his presentation, “Acid Soil Management in North Dakota No-till Soils.”

During his talk, Augustin gave a rundown on the basics of soil acidity and pH, mainly differentiating soil salinity or solidicity from soil acidity, which has to do with the concentration of hydrogen. Augustin explained that as soil pH decreases, that means that soil acidity increases. One of Augustin’s main points was that when soil pH measures as low as 5.5, that should register immediate concern. According to his research, incorporating lime into acidic soils helps to neutralize it.

Following Augustin was Chandler Mazour, who is a Nebraska native and product manager for GEVO and Verity Tracking. Mazour’s talk was titled “Carbon Intensity Counts: Monetizing Farm-Level Data.”

Mazour’s company acquired the Red Trail Energy facility in Richardton last year, and part of his presentation updated the crowd on that project, including the “carbon capture and sequestration efforts,” Mazour said. In the long term, it is GEVO’s goal to produce sustainable aviation fuel at their Richardton location. Mazour also said that his company is building out a grower program, working directly with farmers who want to track the carbon intensity of their own grain.

For the last presentation of the morning session, the forum welcomed Tommy Grisafi as its keynote speaker. Grisafi is a Risk Advisor and Commodity Broker for Advance Trading Inc., and is the owner of Ag Bull Media, which produces a popular agricultural podcast by the same name. Grisafi’s presentation was geared toward the risk management side of farming.

In addition to his own musings on stocks and market prices, Grisafi shared some observations he has made over the years of successful grain marketers and offered some practical advice for emulating their tactics, such as not second guessing one’s decisions, and not being afraid to invest in new technologies or equipment.

Following lunch, Frayne Olson, Crops Economist for NDSU, opened the afternoon session with his talk, “Buckle Up! 2026 Crop Market and Trade Outlook.” Olson shared several tables and graphs with the crowd, specifically focusing on the outlook for corn, soybean and wheat growers, comparing projections for the US market. He also covered US exports, with major buyers of US grains found in China, Mexico, Japan and Egypt.

The final two presentations were given by Joe Ikley, NDSU Extension Weed Specialist and Kevin Sedivec, who presented his talk entitled, “Is Virtual Fence the Future of Grazing Management: Pros and Cons.” Ikley went through the weed guide for this year during his presentation, “Herbicide Resistant Weeds and Best Practice Strategies for Control.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/41796eb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4272x2848+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc4%2F2c%2F9084ece54a5995aece1173efff86%2Fdsc-2040.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 00:56:31.980928

“The Soil Management Summit is a great opportunity for farmers, ag professionals and scientists to get together and talk about sustainability and protecting our soils,” said Cabello Leiva, who joined MSR&PC in spring 2025.
The MN Organic Conference was unique in that it spearheaded conversations and interactions with a different group of soybean producers who share similar production concerns, such as weed management.

–Minnesota Soybean Research & Promotion Council","MANKATO, Minn. — The Minnesota Soybean Research & Promotion Council (MSR&PC) has been on the road in the northern half of the state to begin 2026, interacting with farmers and sharing information on the latest checkoff research, including stops at the Soil Management Summit and DIRT Conference, MN Organics Conference and Small Grains Update Meetings.

For MSR&PC Director of Research Sergio Cabello Leiva, the northern Minnesota ramble was a return to his research roots.

“It’s a very exciting time of year because it’s an opportunity for us at Minnesota Soybean to deliver information to our audience of farmers and ag professionals all throughout the state,” said Cabello Leiva. “I love the northern part of the state as I spent several years working in North Dakota and northern Minnesota, so it’s good to be back.”

The Soil Management Summit and DIRT conference, a combined effort of the University of Minnesota and North Dakota State University, puts an emphasis on farmer experience and applied science on the topic of soil health and sustainability. The conference, which was held Jan. 14-15 in Fargo, N.D. on Jan. 14-15, featured presentations, Q&As with researchers, farmers and ag professionals, trade show and ample learning and networking opportunities.

“The Soil Management Summit is a great opportunity for farmers, ag professionals and scientists to get together and talk about sustainability and protecting our soils,” said Cabello Leiva, who joined MSR&PC in spring 2025. “The way I see things is that if we have a healthy soil, we have high organic matter; basically we are saving money for our future. We are giving more nutrients to our crops, more healthy crops, more healthy balance. It’s a win-win situation.”

As a sponsor of the event, MSR&PC hosted a table talk at the conference, providing a chance for producers and researchers to have an informal, roundtable discussion about research and agronomic practices.

“The presenter at the table doesn’t have a PowerPoint, maybe a small handout, but it’s meant to be informal, meant to stimulate discussion, and it’s meant for researchers and farmers to learn from one another,” said Dr. Angie Peltier, U of M Extension Educator who hosted the table talk on behalf of MRS&PC. “Everyone at the table has an equal voice and can share their own experiences. The learning that happens during those interactions is tremendous.”

Peltier spoke at her table talk about some of the latest checkoff=supported research projects and how that research can drive yield and long-term profitability for Minnesota farms.

“We chatted a lot about soybean cyst nematode and knowing that risk, because a lot of producers still have no idea that their field could be infested and that is our No. 1 yield impactor in soybean fields,” said Peltier. “We also discussed one of the newest pathogens found in the state called Red Crown Rot, so it’s important that farmers keep an eye out for that and other emerging threats and that we collaborate to come up with workable management practices to address those threats.”

In addition to the Soil Management Summit, MSR&PC also sponsored and participated in the MN Organic Conference Jan. 8-9 in St. Cloud, followed by Small Grains Update meetings throughout northwest Minnesota. The MN Organic Conference was unique in that it spearheaded conversations and interactions with a different group of soybean producers who share similar production concerns, such as weed management.

“We have a lot of tools for weed control from the conventional side that apply to organic soybean producers,” Cabello-Leiva said. “It’s a good partnership and there are a lot of mutual benefits for our food-grade soybean producers, of which we are developing new varieties for right here in the state with the University and Minnesota Soybean together.”

The Small Grains Update meetings made stops all throughout the Red River Valley, including Dilworth, Halstad, Crookston, Lancaster, Roseau and St. Hilaire. In a time where market prices are low and inputs are high, Cabella Leiva spoke to producers on how they can get the best bang for their buck through utilizing available research, applying only what farmers need and staying on top of agronomic issues that impact yield.

“A good variety, a good seed treatment, good fertility in our soils and just apply the absolute necessary to obtain the biggest yield and best quality,” he said. “There’s an opportunity to improve by just applying what we need. We have a lot of research about that, and we invite people to take a look at our research book for those solutions.”

Throughout the slate of conference and meetings, farmers had the opportunity to pick up MSR&PC’s latest research report, From Seed to Solutions. The publication can be viewed online here. Cabello Leiva and checkoff researchers will also be in attendance to visit with producers Jan. 20-21 at MN Ag Expo in Mankato.

Julie Bushell of Global Sustainability Developers, LLC (GSD) and DG Fuels CEO Mike Darcy were on site to also address any concerns from Phelps County residents. The Phelps County Development Corporation (PCDC) hosted the town hall meeting at the Phelps County Ag Center on Wednesday, January 14.

A lot of those concerns addressed the use of corn stover and how the facility may affect resources in the area. On more than one occasion, Darcy and Bushell assured the audience that great care is being taken to ensure the SAF facility would not cause many difficulties for Phelps County residents. Darcy made it clear that a SAF facility runs cleaner than a conventional petroleum refinery, while producing an environmentally friendly product.

Following the wave of disapproval from local residents regarding the initial plans to bring fresh water in by train, Bushell announced that an environmental study was being conducted on the state’s surface water sources and the Ogallala Aquifer. The study is expected to be completed and made available to the public by the end of March.

Members of local public power districts were also in attendance. Courtney Dentlinger of NPPD and Chad Waldo of Southern PPD assured residents that they were behind the project, noting that the facility would not be a drain on the area’s electrical resources.

Bushell confirmed that a location in Phelps County has been chosen but will not be made public out of respect to the landowner’s privacy.

PCDC executive director Jeff Hofaker recognized that while there a few things that still need to be worked on, he remains enthusiastic about the project. The news of the pellet facility was especially welcome to Hofaker. He said it was exciting to know that local farmers would now have the opportunity to benefit from the project before the Phelps County SAF plant is complete.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/1352-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:56:54.038716

The Challenge will invest a total of $1.75 million in selected companies and is supported by twelve leading U.S. corn grower organizations: Colorado Corn Promotion Council, Corn Marketing Program of Michigan, Illinois Corn Marketing Board, Iowa Corn Promotion Board, Kansas Corn Commission, Kentucky Corn Promotion Council, Missouri Corn Merchandising Council, National Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Corn Board, Ohio Corn Marketing Program, South Dakota Corn Utilization Council and Tennessee Corn Promotion Board.

The Radicle Corn Challenge is designed to support startups that are building new uses for corn by helping discover additional sources of demand across industrial, material, chemical and fuel applications. In addition to capital, selected companies will benefit from Radicle’s commercialization expertise, scientific and technical diligence, and connections across the corn and broader bioeconomy ecosystem.

“Corn has long been a foundational feedstock for food, feed and fuel,” said Kirk Haney, managing partner at Radicle Growth. “The next opportunity is expanding how corn is used across new products and markets. Through the Radicle Corn Challenge, we’re looking to support companies that can translate innovation into real-world demand.”

The Challenge seeks applications from startups and growth companies worldwide that are working on technologies converting corn and corn-derived streams, such as sugar (glucose), ethanol and other byproducts, into higher-value products. Areas of interest include bioplastics and materials, corn- and ethanol-derived chemicals, valorization of corn byproducts and emerging fuel pathways, including marine fuels and sustainable aviation fuel.

“Advances in chemistry, catalysis, and biological conversion are opening up new, practical pathways for corn-based products,” said Neal Gutterson, partner and chief technology officer at Radicle Growth. “What’s particularly compelling today is how many of these technologies are becoming technically and commercially viable at scale.”

Historically, corn growers have played an active role in building and growing new markets, including the early development of the ethanol industry. The Challenge explores how similar alignment between innovators, investors and growers can help scale the next generation of corn-based technologies.

“As corn production continues to expand, we must develop new and diverse uses for our crop beyond Nebraska’s renowned Golden Triangle, the interconnected system of corn, livestock and ethanol that powers our state’s economy and helps fuel the world,” said Brandon Hunnicutt, Nebraska Corn Board chair and farmer from Giltner, Nebraska. “The Radicle Corn Challenge represents a vital opportunity to uncover innovative, breakthrough solutions that benefit farmers and consumers alike. In 2025, we witnessed exciting advancements in corn utilization, and we look forward to supporting forward-thinking companies that will continue driving new demand for Nebraska and U.S. grown corn.”

Investment decisions will be made following a comprehensive due diligence process, with selected winners announced at the Bio Innovations North America conference on September 9, 2026, in Omaha, Nebraska.

“I’ve always tried to reframe climate change to be more personal and to recognize it is literally the biggest health challenge of our lives,” the former official said.
Are you in transportation, logistics, manufacturing?” “You're in a business,” they added, “there is no climate business.” Not everyone hated “climate” quite as much — but others mentioned a phrase including the word.
But perhaps the most distinctive ban suggestion came from Todd Stern, the former chief U.S. climate diplomat, who negotiated the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.
Among our “innovator” respondents — venture capitalists, founders, and executives working at climate tech startups — the overwhelming majority said that AI and data centers are not slowing down decarbonization.","You can see whether insiders think data centers are slowing down decarbonization and what folks have learned (or, at least, say they’ve learned) from the repeal of clean energy tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.

But from many different respondents, a mood emerged: a kind of exhaustion with “climate” as the right frame through which to understand the fractious mixture of electrification, pollution reduction, clean energy development, and other goals that people who care about climate change actually pursue. When we asked what piece of climate jargon people would most like to ban, we expected most answers to dwell on the various colors of hydrogen (green, blue, orange, chartreuse), perhaps, or the alphabet soup of acronyms around carbon removal (CDR, DAC, CCS, CCUS, MRV). Instead, we got:

“‘Climate.’ Literally the word climate, I would just get rid of it completely,” one venture capitalist told us. “I would love to see people not use 'climate change' as a predominant way to talk to people about a global challenge like this,” seconded a former Washington official. “And who knows what a ‘greenhouse gas emission’ is in the real world?” A lobbyist agreed: “Climate change, unfortunately, has become too politicized … I’d rather talk about decarbonization than climate change.”

Not everyone was as willing to shift to decarbonization, but most welcomed some form of specificity. “I’ve always tried to reframe climate change to be more personal and to recognize it is literally the biggest health challenge of our lives,” the former official said. The VC said we should “get back to the basics of, are you in the energy business? Are you in the agriculture business? Are you in transportation, logistics, manufacturing?”

“You're in a business,” they added, “there is no climate business.”

Not everyone hated “climate” quite as much — but others mentioned a phrase including the word. One think tanker wanted to nix “climate emergency.” Another scholar said: “I think the ‘climate justice’ term — not the idea — but I think the term got spread so widely that it became kind of difficult to understand what it was even referring to.” And one climate scientist didn’t have a problem with climate change, per se, but did say that people should pare back how they discuss it and back off “the notion that climate change will result in human extinction, or the sudden and imminent end to human civilization.”

There were other points of agreement. Four people wanted to ban “net zero” or “carbon neutrality.” One scientist said activists should back off fossil gas — “I know we’re always trying to try convince people of something, but, like, the entire world calls it ’natural gas’” — and another scientist said that they wished people would stop “micromanaging” language: “People continually changing jargon to try and find the magic words that make something different than it is — that annoys me.”

Two more academics added they wish to banish discussion of “overshoot”: “It’s not clear if it's referring to temperatures or emissions — I just don't think it's a helpful frame for thinking about the problem.”

“Unit economics,” “greenwashing,” and — yes — the whole spectrum of hydrogen colors came in for a lashing. But perhaps the most distinctive ban suggestion came from Todd Stern, the former chief U.S. climate diplomat, who negotiated the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.

“I hate it when people say ’are you going to COP?’” he told me, referring to the United Nations’ annual climate summit, officially known as the Conference of the Parties. His issue wasn’t calling it “COP,” he clarified. It was dropping the definite article.

“The way I see it, no one has the right to suddenly become such intimate pals with ‘COP.’ You go to the ball game or the conference or what have you. And you go to ‘the COP,’” he said. “I am clearly losing this battle, but no one will ever hear me drop the ‘the.’”

Now, since I talked to Stern, the United States has moved to drop the COP entirely — with or without the “the” — because Trump took us out of the climate treaty under whose aegis the COP is held. But precision still counts, even in unfriendly times. And throughout the rest of this package, you’ll find insiders trying to find a path forward in thoughtful, insightful, and precise ways.

You’ll also find them remaining surprisingly upbeat — and even more optimistic, in some ways, than they were last year. Twelve months ago, 30% of our insider panel thought China would peak its emissions in the 2020s; this year, a plurality said the peak would come this decade. Roughly the same share of respondents this year as last year thought the U.S. would hit net zero in the 2060s. Trump might be setting back American climate action in the near term.

The Heatmap Insiders Survey of 55 invited expert respondents was conducted by Heatmap News reporters during November and December 2025. Responses were collected via phone interviews. All participants were given the opportunity to record responses anonymously. Not all respondents answered all questions.

Hyperscalers with sustainability goals are already reporting higher emissions, and technology companies are telling investors that they plan to invest hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars, into new data centers, increasingly at gigawatt scale.

And yet when we asked our Heatmap survey participants “Do you think AI and data centers’ energy needs are significantly slowing down decarbonization?” only about 34% said they would, compared to 66% who said they wouldn’t.

There were some intriguing differences between different types of respondents. Among our “innovator” respondents — venture capitalists, founders, and executives working at climate tech startups — the overwhelming majority said that AI and data centers are not slowing down decarbonization. “I think it’s the inverse — I think we want to launch the next generation of technologies when there’s demand growth and opportunity to sell into a slightly higher priced, non-commoditized market,” Joe Goodman co-founder and managing partner at VoLo Earth Ventures, told us.

Not everyone in Silicon Valley is so optimistic, however. “I think in a different political environment, it may have been a true accelerant,” one VC told us. “But in this political environment, it’s a true albatross because it’s creating so many more emissions. It’s creating so much stress on the grid. We’re not deploying the kinds of solutions that would be effective.""

Scientists were least in agreement on the question. While only 47% of scientists thought the growth of data centers would significantly slow down decarbonization, most of the pessimistic camp was in the social sciences. In total, over 62% of the physical scientists we surveyed thought data centers weren’t slowing down decarbonization, compared to a third of social scientists.

Michael Greenstone, a University of Chicago economist, told us he didn’t see data centers and artificial intelligence as any different from any other use of energy. “I also think air conditioning and lighting, computing, and 57,000 other uses of electricity are slowing down decarbonization,” he said. The real answer is the world is not trying to minimize climate change.”

Mijin Cha, an assistant professor of environment studies at the University of California Santa Cruz, was even more gloomy, telling us, “Not only do I think it’s slowing down decarbonization, I think it is permanently extending the life of fossil fuels, especially as it is now unmitigated growth.”

Some took issue with the premise of the question, expressing skepticism of the entire AI industry. “I’m actually of the opinion that most of the AI and data center plans are a massive bubble,” a scientist told us. “And so, are there plans that would be disruptive to emissions? Yes. Are they actually doing anything to emissions yet? Not obvious.”

We also asked respondents to name the “best” and “worst” hyperscalers, large technology companies pursuing the data center buildout. Many of these companies have some kind of renewables or sustainability goal, but there are meaningful differences among them. Google and Microsoft look to match their emissions with non-carbon-power generation in the same geographic area and at the same time. The approach used by Meta and Amazon, on the other hand, is to develop renewable projects that have the biggest “bang for the buck” on global emissions by siting them in areas with high emissions that the renewable generation can be said to displace.

Among our respondents, the 24/7 “time and place” approach is the clear winner.

Google was the “best” pick for 19 respondents, including six who said “Google and Microsoft.” By contrast, Amazon and Meta had just three votes combined.

As for the “worst,” there was no clear consensus, although two respondents from the social sciences picked “everyone besides Microsoft and Google” and “everyone but Google and Microsoft.” Another one told us, “The best is a tie between Microsoft and Google. Everyone else is in the bottom category.”

A third social scientist summed it up even more pungently. “Google is the best, Meta is the worst. Evil corporation” — though with more expletives than that.

Francisco Brown (FB): With Autodesk’s rapid growth in cloud computing and AI, how do you reconcile the increased energy demands of data centers that power these technologies with the company’s commitment to environmental impact?

Joe Speicher (JS): We’ve been investing in what would now be considered AI capabilities for over a decade, and we feel well prepared to deal with both the opportunities and challenges this presents.

We procure cloud service providers and AI capabilities upstream from our vendors. We subsequently provide those same vendors with Autodesk technology and tools to design, build, and manage their cloud infrastructure . We are aware of the energy and emissions associated with the rise of AI, and we are leveraging all of our capabilities to help reduce that overall, by using some of our tools for energy modeling, materials optimization, and data management in these same servers .

The Role of Data in Sustainable Design

FB: You released Autodesk Forma, which features embodied carbon analysis and materials insights. What have you heard from your customers about these new options, and is it changing sustainability practices?

JS: It’s a broad spectrum. We have some customers who are incredibly advanced in their thinking about sustainability and others who are beginning to get their heads around these issues and are starting to address them .

As you mentioned, we created Forma, a platform that connects all phases of project delivery . At the moment, what is designed is not necessarily what gets built . We know this just from change orders alone, right? Now, with this integrated approach—from the architect’s original model, to construction, to the owner, to the [building] operator—they get a live digital twin of the project model to validate performance against the original design and specifications .

As we transition to this data-driven, end-to-end offering, we’re also becoming a platform company, which, by definition, means interoperability of data across the markets we serve, particularly in the built environment, because, for us, sustainability is a data problem . But, yes, we’re getting positive feedback from our customers overall, and interestingly, I will say, over the last few years, our customers are pushing us to do more .

Corporate Sustainability Targets

FB: What are the biggest challenges that Autodesk faces in meeting its own sustainability targets on time?

JS: We have three goals that we focus on from a sustainability perspective. The first: Reduce emissions associated with running our own business.

We have an SBTI [Science Based Targets initiative]-validated goal across scopes 1, 2, and 3 by this decade. Second: We subsequently commit to powering our business with 100 percent renewable energy. And thirdly, we address the residual emissions associated with our operations.

We are a technology company, so we don’t own much of anything, and we essentially ship only code . We have a relatively light footprint. We meet all our commitments with our customers in mind . What are the things that the industry needs that our customers need overall?

For instance, thinking about reducing carbon emissions, one of the really challenging things is business travel.

Aviation is a hard sector to abate. Therefore, we invest in a couple of sustainable aviation fuel companies and procure sustainable aviation fuel because we think the best thing we can do as a business is to drive the cost curve down so others can participate in this market.

Instead of buying a renewable energy credit, we invest in something called virtual power purchase agreements, which enable us to underwrite the development of renewables on the grid . Bringing more renewables onto the grid helps our industry overall by decarbonizing the grid itself and, lastly, by addressing residual carbon emissions . We invest in a rigorous carbon offsetting program because, again, if we can bring down the cost curve, others—including our customers—can participate in this market .

Workplace Strategy as Inspiration

FB: What are some internal design and workplace strategies that you have implemented that architects and designers might find inspiring in their own offices?

JS: Having an attachment to a workplace and wanting to be in the office are productivity enhancers for us as a business. One of the best ways we do that is by looking to lease office space that is LEED certified, meets the WELL standard, or meets the BREEAM standard.

We know that employees prefer working in office spaces when there’s a sustainability certification . For instance, in our Platinum LEED-certified San Francisco headquarters, we ensured our employees had the best possible experience .

For us, it’s all about the opportunity to move toward outcomes-based thinking, or as we call it, outcome-based BIM [building information modeling] . Rather than just square footage, architecture firms can start thinking about [spatial] utilization and the number of folks in the building in order to improve people’s lives in the future .

The Future of Creative Automation

FB: That is a fantastic lead to my last question, which is about the future. When we think about the future of design tools, what excites you most about the role Autodesk plays in making sustainable design easier, faster, and more creative?

JS: I’m excited about how AI can let designers focus more on the creative side of their work . We’re using AI to automate repetitive tasks and simplify workflows—the parts no one enjoys doing .

Some worry AI might be threatening, but the reality is there’s far more work than there are people or tools to handle it . Technology like ours helps bridge that gap. I often get asked how much carbon Autodesk has offset with our tools . The truth is, the process has traditionally been very siloed—architects design, builders construct, and data gets lost in between .

As we connect those stages through platforms like Autodesk Construction Cloud and Forma, we’ll be able to track a building’s lifecycle, validate its performance, and see measurable carbon reductions . That’s what really excites me—proving that sustainable design isn’t just an ideal but a quantifiable outcome .",https://metropolismag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gallery-SanFrancisco-6445-30-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 15:57:08.324051

Clean fuel projects are moving from pilots to industrial scale, proving that innovation and collaboration can deliver real impact, yet progress remains too slow.

A World Economic Forum white paper shows how business, finance and policy can turn ambition into investable projects and scale the market.

Clean fuels play a vital role in addressing the energy trilemma by providing secure, affordable and cleaner sources of energy. They offer pathways to make hard-to-abate sectors such as transport, industry and parts of power and heat generation cleaner, while simultaneously enabling competitiveness and driving innovation across the energy system.

Building on the momentum of the Belém 4x pledge, clean fuels are poised to scale and deliver tangible economic and social benefits. They can create two to three times more jobs than conventional fuels (particularly in rural areas) while reducing fossil fuel import dependence by 5-15% through domestic biofuels production. With fuels expected to meet 40-55% of global energy demand by 2050, scaling clean-fuel supply is essential to secure affordable energy and industrial competitiveness. Mobilizing the $100 billion in annual investment needed by 2030 can unlock this potential.

As the World Economic Forum's Future of Clean Fuels initiative marks its one-year milestone with the release of its white paper and digital playbook, members of the initiative’s steering committee share below how collaboration between business, policy and finance is already turning ambition into action – and what lessons can guide the next phase of scale-up.

1. Industrial innovation is proving that different clean fuels can scale

J.J.Imaz, Chief Executive Officer, Repsol

Industrial innovation is proving that clean fuels can scale and deliver real impact. Across Europe, companies are investing in technologies that turn ambition into reality, creating new value chains, reducing emissions and strengthening energy security. From biofuels to e-fuels, these initiatives show that clean fuels are not just a future promise, but a present solution. Repsol is at the forefront of this transformation, driving projects that demonstrate how low-carbon fuels can be produced at an industrial scale while supporting competitiveness and quality jobs.

""At Repsol, we believe clean fuels are indispensable for the energy transition. They not only reduce emissions, but also strengthen Europe’s energy security, industrial competitiveness and quality jobs. This is why we are investing across all pathways. Biofuels are already a reality and we are producing 250,000 tons per year in our Cartagena plant. We have approved the Final Investment decision of Ecoplanta, which will convert municipal solid waste into 240,000 tons of renewable methanol, cutting millions of tons of CO₂ emissions. We are building a demo-plant with a production capacity of 8,000 litres per day of synthetic fuels that will be located in the port of Bilbao.

Clean fuels are a real alternative for road transport, maritime, aviation and industry and they can scale using existing assets while creating new value chains. There is no single solution: biofuels, e-fuels and other low-carbon fuels all have a role to play.

Technological neutrality is key: let science and competitiveness decide the winners, not policy. For example, cars running exclusively on sustainable fuels can reduce emissions beyond 2035 and should be recognized in EU framework. By building the market, technology and infrastructure today, we ensure that Europe remains competitive and that the transition is both sustainable and realistic.""

2. Clean fuels can help reduce emissions using existing infrastructure and established value chains

Hans Olav Raen, Chief Executive Officer, Yara Clean Ammonia

Clean fuels can be integrated to today’s industrial and energy infrastructure, rather than replacing it entirely, which reduces costs and accelerates adoption.

""To scale clean fuels, we need real projects delivering real molecules, and we are proving that it can be done. In Porsgrunn (Norway), we now operate one of Europe’s largest renewable-hydrogen-based ammonia facilities, showing how industry, policy and technology can work together to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors. At the same time, we are building a major carbon capture and storage facility at our Sluiskil plant in the Netherlands, which will be operational in 2026 and further reduce emissions from one of Europe’s largest fertilizer and ammonia hubs. But a single plant, or even two, is not enough. What we need next is coordinated global demand, clear certification frameworks, and accelerated investments in logistics and bunkering so clean fuels can move from pilot to global market. We can build this system together.""

3. Scaling clean fuels can only be done through more collaboration and investment

Hans Kobler, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Energy Impact Partners

Investments into clean fuels projects face a unique set of challenges and market risks, given that the value chains are complex, interdependent and often spanning multiple feedstocks. Global clean fuel ambitions require annual investments in production to quadruple from $25 billion per year today to $100 billion per year by 2030. Unlocking that scale depends on aligning investors, industry and policy-makers to share risk and build confidence in new value chains.

“At Energy Impact Partners, we are advancing the future of energy by bringing together incumbents, innovators and capital to find and scale innovative energy solutions. Clean fuels have a critical role to play in decarbonizing the global economy. Together with our partners, we invested in companies such as Electric Hydrogen, constructing one of the largest electrolyzers in the US or Metafuels, new sustainable aviation fuel pathways.""

Cate Hight, Partner Energy & Sustainability, Bain & Company

“At Bain & Company, we work with leading companies and investors to advance their clean-fuels ambitions. Our experience shows that those who succeed in clean fuels are often disruptive thinkers, exploring new business models and investment strategies to balance risk and reward. Because these markets and projects differ from conventional commodities, we work with clients to develop resilient commercial plans, build strategic partnerships, manage capital and risk with discipline and shape flexible operating models. These elements are essential to navigating the uncertainty and unlocking viable project economics in clean fuels.”

4. Accelerating innovation in first-of-a-kind projects will be critical

Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer, Occidental

Scaling low carbon fuels will rely on investing in scalable feedstock pathways today. In the US, Occidental’s first commercial Direct Air Capture (DAC) project – named STRATOS – is designed to capture up to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 annually, once fully operational. The captured carbon can create value in several ways, including combing the atmospheric CO2 with clean hydrogen to produce synthetic low carbon transportation fuels, like Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Occidental can also leverage 50+ years of experience safely and securely using carbon dioxide (CO₂) in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) operations, which injects CO₂ into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs to encourage flow, unlocking previously inaccessible hydrocarbons. When paired with CO₂ from carbon capture solutions, like Direct Air Capture (DAC), CCS-EOR can enable low-carbon fuels while using existing sites more efficiently.

“When we think about addressing emissions, we need to be firm in low-carbon performance and flexible in approach so we can achieve reductions at an accelerated pace and meaningful scale. Our team has used CO₂ for enhanced oil recovery for over 50 years, which can store more CO2 underground than what is emitted during the product’s lifecycle. It's low-carbon fuel technology that works and is compatible with today’s infrastructure and value chain.

Moreover, we believe that innovative technologies, like DAC, will be instrumental in shaping the future energy landscape. STRATOS is a major first-of-a-kind energy infrastructure project, offering a valuable example of how industry can turn excess carbon into value and fuel a lower-carbon future. Our teams at Carbon Engineering continue to innovate the process so that advancements that drive costs down and make the technology more accessible can be introduced at scale.”

5. Policy is a catalyst for developing the clean fuels market

Policy will be a critical lever in developing the clean fuels market, particularly given the current cost premium compared with conventional fuels. As illustrated in our Playbook of Solutions, Brazil has shown how integrated measures ranging from blending mandates to carbon credit trading – under its RenovaBio programme – can stimulate private investment, create jobs and strengthen energy security. By advancing the Belém 4x pledge, Brazil is taking a leading role in promoting clean fuels globally and demonstrating how coherent national strategies can turn ambition into tangible market growth.

The way forward

From Europe to Brazil, these case studies show that scaling clean fuels is already underway, but progress must accelerate. The next step is to extend this momentum through coordinated investment, supportive policy and cross-sector collaboration. The Future of Clean Fuels initiative aims to accelerate this transition – explore our white paper and digital playbook to see how leading projects are already turning ambition into action.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_xxYRBo0Jit1Qpf7u6dLOchREYuVlyjBhggEx7DpIbtA.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 13:56:54.370929

We have sessions dedicated to sustainability reporting, compliance with key standards and climate target-setting – including Scope 3 (indirect) emissions.","The 37-page document sets out the steps eBay will take to decarbonise its own operations and energy, as well as its downstream transport and logistics. It additionally details plans for policy engagement and external partnerships.

The Climate Transition Plan provides more details on eBay’s 2045 net-zero target and interim 2030 climate goals, which have been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (eBay).

By 2030, the business is aiming for a 90% reduction in absolute Scope 1 (operational) and Scope 2 (energy-related) emissions by 2030, against a 2019 baseline.

Within the same timeframe, it also wants to deliver a 27.5% reduction in absolute Scope 3 (indirect) emissions from downstream transportation.

These goals support a 2045 net-zero ambition under the SBTi’s Net Zero Standard for corporates. This standard mandates a 90% reduction in absolute emissions across all scopes. High-quality carbon offsetting should be used to address residual emissions.

eBay’s chief sustainability officer Renee Morin said the new Climate Transition Plan “reflects eBay’s long-standing commitment to climate resiliency, creating enduring value for our customers and community”.

Strategic priorities

The new Climate Transition Plan document states that eBay’s emissions would be likely to increase by 11% by 2030 with no interventions, due to growth. But this can be more than offset by the measures set out to improve energy efficiency, integrate renewable energy, adopt circular economy processes and collaborate with the downstream transport industry.

The document elaborates that the business’s low-carbon transition should be “inclusive and equitable”, creating new opportunities for SMEs, social enterprises and nonprofits.

It also emphasises the importance of engaging staff with the plan and “embedding sustainability into how we work and connect”.

It commits eBay to working with external partners to improve carbon data accuracy and industry standards for carbon accounting and carbon offsetting.

Solving the Scope 3 challenge

As is the case for most larger businesses, the bulk of eBay’s total climate impact is indirect. The business will have a different approach of managing Scope 3 emissions than traditional retailers which procure and sell new goods.

The Transition Plan document elaborates: “eBay does not own fleets, warehouses, or delivery networks, so our progress depends on influencing carriers and partners to invest in and adopt cleaner practices and technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs) or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which are currently limited in availability.

“The global parcel delivery system is, by the nature of our business model, highly fragmented with public and private carriers operating across diverse infrastructures, regions, and incentives. We are achieving meaningful progress through collaboration, data transparency, and shared accountability across every link in this chain.”

Stated priorities for measuring and reducing Scope 3 emissions include enhancing data completeness and quality; aligning with evolving best-practice standards and methodologies; re-evaluating assumptions based on changes in policy, technology and consumer behaviour; supporting the uptake of low-carbon technologies; collaborating with external partners and incentivising sellers to use low-carbon logistics options.

eBay’s plans for engaging with policymakers to decarbonise the systems in which it operates, while fostering business growth, are also set out.

The firm will continue to back the EU in producing the Circular Economy Act and the US in running the Congressional Recommerce Caucus. It will also advocate for regulations that reduce barriers to recommerce for small businesses; that promote the scaling of low-carbon logistics solutions; and that enhance the affordability and accessibility of renewable energy.
