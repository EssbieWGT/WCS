Once operational, DRAGON II is expected to deliver around 80,000 tonnes of SAF, about 1% of UK jet fuel requirements, and 8,000 tonnes of renewable diesel annually, supporting around 300 skilled jobs during its construction and 150 in operation. Saltend Chemicals Park is owned by px Group, part of the Ara Partners portfolio of companies specialising in industrial decarbonisation investments. px Group offers world-class infrastructure, utilities, deep-water jetty access, and fully managed site services platform, and was selected after an exhaustive assessment of sites across the UK.

Development of the DRAGON projects has been aided by strong UK government support. In July 2025, LanzaTech was awarded a £6.4 million grant from the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), which is helping to accelerate both DRAGON I and DRAGON II projects. Project DRAGON—which stands for Decarbonizing and Reimagining Aviation for the Goal Of Netzero - features two complementary initiatives that both use the LanzaJet® Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process: DRAGON I in Port Talbot, South Wales; and DRAGON II, in Humberside. LanzaTech also plans to produce in total 50kt of the ethanol to be processed at these facilities from sites in Milford Haven and Saltend using LanzaTech’s gas fermentation technology. This will convert waste carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into ethanol that will then leverage LanzaJet’s technology to convert that ethanol to produce a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF. The use of green hydrogen is dependent upon amendments to current rules for SAF production due to the high cost of the hydrogen required.

The planned facility is scheduled to begin construction in the second half of 2027 and be operational during 2030. It represents a significant contribution to the UK’s net-zero ambitions, national energy security, and the creation of high-value jobs and industrial growth across the region. LanzaTech is exploring opportunities to collaborate with local partners and utilise the region’s extensive supply chains and emerging CO2 pipeline infrastructure and hydrogen production to maximise benefits to the region to reinforce Humberside’s position as a leader in industrial decarbonisation. This opportunity aligns with Saltend Chemical Park’s vision and strategic drive to support the transition, diversification, and decarbonisation, including the development of a low-carbon hydrogen industry, whilst maximising economic value, industrial synergies, and long-term sustainability.

Mr Jim Woodger, LanzaTech Managing Director for EMEA and Americas, said, “We are excited to bring LanzaTech’s carbon recycling technology paired with our partner LanzaJet’s world-leading SAF production technology to Humberside. We anticipate we will create around 300 high quality, skilled jobs both during construction and in operation.” He added, “We selected the px Saltend Chemicals Park because it offers exceptional infrastructure for SAF production and the future prospect for hydrogen and CO2 pipelines and storage. The skills of the px Group team also provides an excellent fit with LanzaTech.”

Geoff Holmes, CEO of px Group, added:

“This major investment from LanzaTech demonstrates Saltend’s continued attractiveness for world-first, low-carbon projects. Our plug-and-play model, deep technical expertise, and unmatched site infrastructure allow pioneers like LanzaTech to deploy innovative projects at speed and scale. DRAGON II will further strengthen the Humber’s status as the UK’s Energy Estuary, delivering jobs and a resilient, net-zero future for the region.”

“Asian governments are now making regulatory commitments to SAF,” Mifsud, who oversees the firm’s sales and trading in renewable fuels for the EMEA and APAC regions, told Fortune.
Last July, national carrier Bangkok Air began using a 1% SAF blend last July, cutting about 128 kilograms of carbon emissions per flight.
SAF has been one way that the carbon-intensive aviation industry—responsible for 2.5% of global emissions—has tried to go green.
A lack of feedstock is also holding back SAF production.","Built by Finnish fuel producer Neste in 2010, the facility underwent a $1.9 billion expansion in 2019. Reopened in 2023, it now produces up to a million tonnes of SAF annually. Most of Singapore’s sustainable jet fuel is exported to Australia and Europe, but Neste executive Mario Mifsud says Asia is the “next big frontier” for SAF.

“Asian governments are now making regulatory commitments to SAF,” Mifsud, who oversees the firm’s sales and trading in renewable fuels for the EMEA and APAC regions, told Fortune. “We’ve seen this in Europe—one or two countries start, and other countries will follow.”

In November, Singapore mandated that, by 2026, SAF make up 1% of all jet fuel used at its Changi and Seletar airports, with further plans to raise the quota to 5% by 2030, in line with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)’s goal to have net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

“The 1% target doesn’t seem like a massive goal, but it will start the ball rolling,” Mifsud explains. “Neighboring countries will look and follow.”

Thailand also plans to reveal national SAF standards this year. Last July, national carrier Bangkok Air began using a 1% SAF blend last July, cutting about 128 kilograms of carbon emissions per flight. (On average, flying from London to New York generates about 493 kilograms of carbon per passenger, according to German nonprofit Atmosfair.)

Last May, South Korea became one of the first countries in Asia to mandate SAF on international flights, with the ruling slated to kick in by 2027. The country aims to scale up the proportion of SAF to between 7% and 10% by 2035.

Globally, Europe leads in SAF adoption, with the region’s 2025 ReFuelEU policy mandating a 2% SAF blend. (The EU has a 70% SAF mandate which will kick in by 2050.)

SAF has been one way that the carbon-intensive aviation industry—responsible for 2.5% of global emissions—has tried to go green. Now, with governments getting serious about pushing airlines to use sustainable fuel, the industry may finally be starting to get off the ground.

Ramping up production

Demand for SAF in Southeast Asia is projected to grow from 15,000 barrels per day in 2030 to over 700,000 barrels a day by 2025, according to the ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook report. Production is likely to surge too, with ASEAN projecting daily production as high as 8.5 million barrels of SAF per day.

On Jan. 26, Hong Kong-based energy firm EcoCeres opened Malaysia’s first commercial-scale SAF production facility in the city of Johor Bahru, just across the border from Singapore. It can produce up to 420,000 metric tonnes of SAF each year.

During the launch of EcoCeres’ Tanjung Langsat plant, Noraini binti Ahmad, Malaysia’s minister of plantation and commodities, said Malaysia would soon have its own SAF targets.

“Under the National Energy Transition Roadmap, an initial SAF blending target of 1% is important to create demand and support market growth,” Noriaini said. “This plan reflects our strategy to position Malaysia’s commodity sector as a responsible player in the global energy transition, and by using certified waste-based biomass, we are adding value to our resources, strengthening supply chains and supporting higher value downstream activities.”

The Johor plant is EcoCeres’ second, following its factory in China’s Jiangsu province, which generates 350,000 metric tonnes of SAF per year.

Matti Lievonen, the CEO of EcoCeres, said the Malaysia plant marks the firm’s first step to expanding internationally. “This place in Johor is excellent, because you have feedstock from Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries, a really good seaway to pop out deliveries and a strong workforce in Malaysia.”

Scaling up

Aviation accounts for roughly 2.5% of global carbon emissions, yet ways to decarbonize the sector are still in the stage of development and are unfeasible for long-haul flights.

Electric aviation, for example, may work for only very short trips, as it’s constrained by the energy storage capacity of batteries. (Jet fuel holds 30 times more energy per kg than the most advanced lithium-ion battery.)

A lack of feedstock is also holding back SAF production. The International Energy Agency is urging industry players to explore alternative feedstock sources apart from used cooking oil and animal fats.

“Renewable fuels are very much at the start-up phase,” Mifsud of Neste says. “When you’re in oil and gas, you drill a well and get your oil out—it’s very simple. But when you’re in renewable fuels, the collection of waste materials brings significant complexity.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Neste_Refinery_030_rgb_full-2.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-28 03:57:51.984979

But no one was playing from the same score.

The first World Economic Forum without Klaus Schwab at the helm did not merely lack its conductor. It revealed an orchestra that has forgotten why it ever assembled in the first place.

A forum built for dialogue has drifted into a staging ground for dominance. This year in Davos felt less like a meeting and more like a mirror, reflecting the very dysfunction it was created to repair.

The WEF is easy to mock: the queues of black limos, the status-coded badges, the sense of a rarefied elite debating the state of the world from a mountain resort. Yet for half a century it has served a more practical role: as a stress-test for coordination among the political and economic elites who shape global markets, institutions and rules of the game.

When alignment among governments, major corporations and financial power centres is strong, it tends to surface here. When it weakens, Davos becomes one of the first places where the breakdown is visible.

This year, the fractures were so pervasive that Davos felt like a hall of broken glass, each shard reflecting a different power, priority and reality.

The significance lay not in any single speech or walkout, but in what the splintering itself exposed lying beneath the surface drama.

The pattern playing out in Davos is the same pattern stalling climate action, hollowing out multilateral agreements and leaving the Sustainable Development Goals dangerously adrift.

It is not a failure of knowledge. We know what needs to be done. It is not a failure of resources. Global capital has never been more abundant.

It is a failure of collaboration and collective action. A failure of governments to align around shared interests rather than narrow advantage; of businesses to act as system-shapers rather than short-term competitors; and of leaders across sectors to share risk, and act in service of a common good.

In his much-praised speech, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney named it directly: the rules-based international order has ruptured. Middle powers can no longer rely on the protection of stable institutions. His conclusion was not resignation but redirection. If the old architecture cannot hold, those outside its centre must build new coalitions capable of acting without permission from above. This is more than geopolitics. It is the logic of every major transition in history.

We carry a comforting myth that there are people in charge who know what they are doing, who understand the system and who hold the power to fix it.

It’s a story we learn early in childhood: when problems become overwhelming, someone in authority will step in and solve them.

But we are not children. And watching leaders at Davos only reinforces what we learn when we become parents ourselves: those in charge are often far less in control than they may appear. The better lesson lies not in childhood instinct, but in history.

The abolition of slavery did not begin with empires. Universal suffrage did not originate with kings. Civil rights did not start in palaces. Systemic change happens when coalitions form in the middle and make the old order economically, socially and politically untenable.

Those in middle positions, whether nations, businesses or citizens, consistently underestimate their collective power. Alone, each feels constrained. Together, they constitute a force no single actor can match. This is the multiplier effect of collaboration, the only lever capable of moving systems when concentrated power has stalled.

Progress comes not from pleading with the powerful, but from making new coalitions so effective that resistance becomes irrelevant.

And this is why the most important story of Davos 2026 was not in the Congress Centre, but on the margins – in side rooms, informal gatherings and unlikely partnerships.

That’s where we saw coalitions forming around regenerative agriculture and nature restoration; serious conversations about redirecting the $2.6 trillion in subsidies that destroy ecosystems; investors working with policymakers to bring nature onto balance sheets; countries and companies aligning on clean infrastructure, food system reform and long-term resilience.

Davos has not lost its relevance. Bringing the world’s political and economic leaders together still matters. But credibility is no longer built by a small group at the top.

So, the question facing the World Economic Forum is simple: can it reclaim the cooperation that has migrated to its periphery and bring it back to the centre where it belongs?

About Ethanol-to-Jet (EtJ)

The EtJ pathway involves converting bioethanol into SAF through a series of established chemical processes such as dehydration, oligomerisation, hydrogenation and fractionation. This approach presents a promising solution for reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector. By using feedstocks from biomass or waste materials, the proposed facility will produce SAF that complies with CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) standards.

As one of Asia’s first purpose-built ethanol-to-jet sustainable aviation fuel facilities, it will support both Singapore’s national sustainable aviation fuel target and the growing needs of regional airlines, added the companies.

They noted that the use of ethanol-to-jet fuel will enable the plant to draw on a range of bioethanol feedstocks while retaining flexibility to adapt as regional bioethanol markets evolve.

Cindy Lim, CEO of Keppel’s infrastructure division, said: “Sustainable aviation fuel is one of the most practical and impactful levers available today to decarbonise air travel, and demand from airlines and passengers is growing rapidly.

“This project aims to deliver a bankable, scalable end‑to‑end solution to produce sustainable aviation fuel close to where airlines need it.”

It will do this by combining Aster’s refining and chemical expertise with Keppel’s capabilities in developing, integrating and operating complex energy and environmental assets, she added.

Locating the proposed plant on Jurong Island also allows the project to leverage existing industrial infrastructure and logistics, while creating new opportunities for sustainable fuels in the region, said Keppel and Aster.

The developments are not expected to have any material impact on the net tangible assets per share or earnings per share of Keppel for the current financial year.

A holistic climate approach NEATS represents a major move toward a more formalised and coherent approach to addressing aviation’s full climate impact.","The European Commission and EUROCONTROL have released an updated version of their digital system designed to assess aviation’s non-CO2 climate effects

Known as NEATS, the Non-CO2 Aviation Effects Tracking System, the new Version 2 marks a significant step toward more comprehensive climate accounting in the aviation sector.

While aviation emissions have traditionally focused on carbon dioxide, scientific evidence increasingly shows that non-CO2 effects such as contrails and nitrogen oxides (NOx) play a major role in aviation’s overall climate impact. NEATS aims to bring these effects into a structured monitoring and reporting framework.

What NEATS Version 2 delivers

NEATS V2 allows aircraft operators to calculate the non-CO₂ climate impact of individual flights using operational data they already collect. At this stage, the results are indicative and reflect the evolving nature of climate science and modelling techniques. However, the tool provides valuable insights into how specific flights contribute to warming beyond CO2 emissions alone.

The system integrates a range of scientifically established models that assess per-flight climate effects. A core component of NEATS is the PyContrails Python library, which is widely used to model contrail formation and persistence. Contrails are among the most significant non-CO₂ contributors to aviation’s climate footprint, particularly at high altitudes.

Preparing for EU ETS reporting

The release of NEATS V2 is closely tied to upcoming regulatory requirements. Further refinements to models, functions, and data parameters are already underway in preparation for Version 3. NEATS V3 is expected to play a huge role in supporting the EU Emissions Trading System reporting for 2025 emissions.

Unlike the current version, V3 will introduce dedicated user interfaces tailored for aircraft operators, independent verifiers, and competent authorities. This will make the monitoring, reporting, and verification process quicker and more accessible across the aviation sector.

Collaboration across Europe

NEATS has been developed under a cooperation agreement between EUROCONTROL and the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Climate Action.

Its development demonstrates collaborative efforts with airlines, aircraft and engine manufacturers, and technical partners.

Key contributors include To70 and AerLabs, as well as Germany’s national weather service (DWD) and aerospace research centre (DLR). In addition, the system has been developed in collaboration with Swiss authorities, ensuring that NEATS also covers flights reported under the Swiss Emissions Trading System. This alignment strengthens cross-border consistency in climate reporting.

A holistic climate approach

NEATS represents a major move toward a more formalised and coherent approach to addressing aviation’s full climate impact. By automating and standardising the monitoring of non-CO₂ effects, the tool helps bridge the gap between scientific research and regulatory implementation.

The system supports the broader goals of the EU ETS by expanding climate accountability beyond carbon dioxide alone. It also reinforces the European Union’s position as a global leader in climate policy and digital innovation, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/iStock-1776557168-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 23:57:15.823661

The partners on Tuesday revealed they began ground testing a hybrid engine demonstrator that is designed to burn 10 percent less fuel compared to best-in-class engines for single-aisle, narrowbody aircraft. NASA and GE had previously tested individual components and systems, but December marked the first time they brought everything together and put the modified GE Passport engine on a mount.

“We’re getting close to the payoff on work that’d been in progress for a long time,” said Anthony Nerone, manager of NASA’s Hybrid Thermally Efficient Core (HyTEC) project during the demonstrator’s development, in a news release.

HyTEC aims to leverage NASA’s resources to mature the hybrid engine technology, which the space agency believes could appear on commercial aircraft as soon as the 2030s. As part of the effort, it developed a compact engine core that is designed to improve fuel efficiency while providing the same thrust as single-aisle aircraft engines.

The high-bypass commercial turbofan engine is powered by GE’s electric motor and generators, with the assistance from electric power allowing it to use less jet fuel. It is designed to work with or without batteries or other energy storage systems.

Per NASA, the engine “extract[s] energy from some of its operations and insert[s] that supplementary power into other parts.” Similarly, some commercial hybrid-electric concepts—such as Electra’s EL9 or VoltAero’s Cassio—rely on electric power for takeoff and landing but use a gas turbine to recharge their batteries during the less demanding cruise phase.

“Turbines already exist. Compressors already exist,” said Nerone. “But there is no hybrid-electric engine flying today. And that’s what we were able to see.”

NASA and GE conducted the test at the latter’s Peebles Test Operation site in Cincinnati. GE said it demonstrated power injection, extraction, and transfer and exceeded performance benchmarks that NASA developed with private sector input. The space agency described the test as “successful” and estimated it to be one of the most complex demonstrations GE has ever undertaken.

“They had to integrate equipment they’ve never needed for previous tests like this,” said Laura Evans, acting HyTEC project manager.

NASA said the partners will analyze test data and work toward a compact engine test later this decade. In 2024, it predicted that would happen by 2028.

“This will be the first mild hybrid-electric engine and could lead to the first production engine for narrowbody airliners that’s hybrid electric,” Nerone said at the time.

NASA earlier this month also completed high-speed taxi testing of a scale model test article for a wing that is designed to reduce drag through laminar flow—another efficiency-minded technology. The space agency is studying an array of future aviation technologies—from hybrid-electric propulsion to uncrewed traffic management (UTM) systems—alongside other government and commercial partners.

GE’s Hybrid Ambitions

GE has produced conventional engines since the early 20th century. But in the future, it will look to sell megawatt-class, hybrid-electric power systems for military and commercial single-aisle aircraft, offering improved fuel efficiency and reduced emissions. The company in 2021 committed to achieve carbon neutral operations by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.

The company said December’s test supports its efforts under RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines)—a technology demonstrator project it coleads with Safran Aircraft Engines through Safran’s CFM International venture. More than 2,000 engineers are working on the program, which aims to achieve fuel savings of 20 percent.

Unveiled in 2021, the RISE demonstrator has completed more than 350 tests of open fan engine systems, hybrid-electric propulsion, and technology for compact engine cores—like the HyTEC demonstrator’s, but also compatible with hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). GE said it is performing aircraft and engine integration and will target ground and flight testing this decade.

Much of the company’s electric and hybrid testing takes place at the University of Dayton in Ohio, where it has poured nearly $100 million into a 138,000-square-foot research and development hub. It also has several demonstrators that are designed to test the integration of electrical power systems with turboshaft, turboprop, and turbofan gas engines.

Beyond HyTEC, GE is working with NASA, Boeing, and other partners such as BAE Systems toward ground and flight tests of a hybrid-electric powertrain by 2030. A $197 million NASA contract will support installation of GE’s CT7-9B turboprop on a Saab 340B testbed, modified by Boeing with a nacelle, flight deck software, and other integrations. NASA aims to introduce the technology to commercial aviation fleets by 2035.

The U.S. Army is exploring GE’s hybrid engines through its Applied Research Collaborative Systematic Turboshaft Electrification Project (ARC-STEP), which conducted an initial demonstration in late 2024. GE under a $5.1 million contract will research, develop, and test a megawatt-class, electrified powerplant to gauge how it would perform on military rotorcraft.

The CT7 turboshaft and GE’s electric motor and generator will also be integrated on Sikorsky’s Hybrid-Electric eXperimental (HEX) demonstrator—planned as a precursor to a scaled-up commercial model.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/2025-geaerospace-pex-3b-peebles-9173a.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 21:56:46.068851

In Indonesia, the government and several airlines are also preparing to adopt bioavtur through the use of used cooking oil. To what extent will this plan be realized globally and nationally?

The International Civil Aviation Association (IATA) estimates on its official website that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could contribute around 65 percent to the emissions reductions needed by aviation. The industry is targeting net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. To achieve this target, massive clean energy production is needed to meet the aviation industry's demand.

SAF is a liquid fuel made from plants or animals rather than fossil fuels. This type of fuel has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel, as cited by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

SAF is classified as sustainable because the raw materials do not deplete food supplies or water resources. This fuel also reduces forest degradation. Meanwhile, fossil fuels increase CO2 levels by emitting carbon.

According to analysis by The Guardian, a single long-duration flight can produce more carbon emissions in a few hours than the average emissions of one person in 56 different countries over a year.

The excessive emissions from aviation have led many parties to consider SAF as a fuel for the aviation industry in the future. The number of agreements to purchase SAF continues to increase. The trend, as reported by WEF, has been evident since 2013. The peak occurred in 2023 with 42 SAF purchase agreements.

Despite its promise, obstacles are encountered in the development of SAF. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that there is no sustainable aviation fuel whose costs are as competitive as traditional jet fuel. This includes the high costs associated with the adoption of new technologies and their production methods.

Another issue is that SAF has a lower density than traditional jet fuel. This means that 1 liter of conventional jet fuel contains more energy than 1 liter of SAF.

Thus, an aircraft can fly further using conventional jet fuel than SAF with the same amount. If SAF is used, the aircraft must carry a larger volume of fuel to operate long-distance flights.

""SAF production growth has slowed below expectations due to poorly designed mandates that stalled a fledgling industry. If the goal of SAF was to slow progress and raise prices, policymakers have succeeded,"" said IATA Director General Willie Walsh.

To boost production, stakeholders in the aviation sector, particularly the government, need to collaborate with industry players in the aviation business. Learning from failures and collaborating with airlines to design incentives will be beneficial in accelerating the adoption of SAF.

In Europe, for example, the promotion of the use of sustainable aviation fuel has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and an oligopolistic supply chain.

Fuel suppliers are widening their profit margins, causing airlines to pay five times higher than conventional prices or double the market price. This occurs without any guarantee of supply.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks affects airlines that will need to pay 2.9 billion USD for 1.9 million tons of SAF available in 2025. As a result, the standard price of SAF remains above that of conventional fuel.

The failure to accelerate SAF production capacity will impact the reassessment of SAF targets by many airlines. ""Many airlines committed to using 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be forced to evaluate this target,"" said Walsh as quoted from the IATA website.

He added that SAF is not produced in sufficient quantities to support these airlines in achieving their ambitions. These commitments were made in good faith, but cannot be fulfilled.

Government efforts

Indonesia has begun to follow the global trend in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). At least two airlines have tested the use of SAF in commercial flights. Garuda Indonesia experimented with it in 2023 on a commercial flight covering a distance of 455 kilometers with a total duration of 60 minutes. The journey utilized a blend of 2.4 percent SAF provided by Pertamina.

Furthermore, Pelita Air plans to use SAF for the Jakarta-Bali route in August 2025. Its fuel will utilize used cooking oil or waste oil from restaurants, households, and micro, small, and medium enterprises.

In its development until 2026, the government assesses that there has been progress in the adoption of SAF, although it is still in the early stages of widespread implementation. The government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, has issued Ministerial Decree Number 4 of 2025 concerning the Management and Utilization of Biofuels. This regulation serves as the legal basis for the production and use of SAF domestically.

From the regulatory side of the aviation sector, the Director General of Air Transportation at the Ministry of Transportation, Lukman F Laisa, stated that they have issued a Circular Letter regarding the Use of Renewable Fuel for Turbine Engine Aircraft.

This means that the government provides legal certainty for national air transport enterprises in using SAF. This was marked by the flight of Pelita Air last August.

Subsequently, the government established the National SAF Team in November 2025. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, assigned as the coordinator for the demand sector, is currently formulating demand pillar policies, including stimulus and incentive schemes. This effort is aimed at encouraging the involvement of all stakeholders in the SAF ecosystem collectively.

""In accordance with the national SAF roadmap, mandatory SAF implementation is targeted to begin in 2027, with an initial national blending rate of 1 percent. Priority will be given to international flights at the two largest international airports, Soekarno-Hatta and I Gusti Ngurah Rai,"" Lukman said in a written statement.

Separately, the Director of Air Transportation Agustinus Budi stated that the adoption and use of SAF in commercial aircraft must still consider the readiness and availability of its stock. This aspect will affect fuel prices, which could potentially drive up ticket prices.

""Ultimately, it will impact ticket prices. High ticket prices will become another problem. Well, that's a dilemma. However, whatever decision the government makes regarding the implementation of SAF, all stakeholders must be ready, operators must be ready, and the public must be ready,"" said Agustinus.

Many considerations

The plan for the adoption and implementation of SAF needs to be designed and carefully planned. This is because forced utilization without a comprehensive design can lead to high costs, rather than attempting to reduce expenditures.

Indonesia AirAsia Acting President Director Achmad Sadikin Abdurachman revealed that his company remains focused on carbon offsets, arguing that this mechanism is easier to implement and strengthens the Indonesian government's commitment to sustainability.

Carbon offsets are schemes where individuals or companies compensate for greenhouse gas emissions, including those from aviation, to fund environmental projects that absorb or reduce carbon elsewhere. Two examples are reforestation and waste management.

""For SAF itself, it is still within a longer timeframe because it requires several preparations and also readiness from other parties. This is because, apart from the oil refineries that exist in Indonesia, there is also the readiness regarding price determination, which I believe is not insignificant,"" said Sadikin.

Sadikin hopes that all stakeholders have thoroughly calculated the use of SAF so that it does not become a burden. Nevertheless, he does not deny that several countries have begun to implement SAF.

A similar statement was made by aviation expert, Alvin Lie. The mandatory use of SAF will certainly drive up the operational costs for airlines. Pertamina's capacity to produce SAF also needs to be assessed in terms of its ability to meet demand when the policy is implemented.

In the past, palm oil-based SAF was developed, but the international community did not recognize the contribution of this raw material in reducing emissions. Therefore, Pertamina is now developing used cooking oil as a raw material for SAF. However, the procurement ecosystem is considered not yet stable enough to supply in large quantities.

""Currently, Pertamina is capable of producing the national avtur needs independently. We do not import. Let us not end up having to import due to SAF,"" he said.

The government's initiative to begin organizing the SAF ecosystem indeed requires support. However, this effort needs to be accompanied by careful planning and schemes, both in terms of production capacity, demand, and its impact on airline operating costs. It is only fitting that all stakeholders prepare for this change in order to contribute to global targets.

In Indonesia, the government and several airlines are also preparing to adopt bioavtur through the use of used cooking oil. To what extent will this plan be realized globally and nationally?

The industry is targeting net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050. To achieve this target, massive clean energy production is needed to meet the aviation industry's demand.

SAF is a liquid fuel made from plants or animals rather than fossil fuels. This type of fuel has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel, as cited by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

SAF is classified as sustainable because the raw materials do not deplete food supplies or water resources. This fuel also reduces forest degradation. Meanwhile, fossil fuels increase CO2 levels by emitting carbon.

According to analysis by The Guardian, a single long-duration flight can produce more carbon emissions in a few hours than the average emissions of one person in 56 different countries over a year.

The excessive emissions from aviation have led many parties to consider SAF as a fuel for the aviation industry in the future. The number of agreements to purchase SAF continues to increase. The trend, as reported by WEF, has been evident since 2013. The peak occurred in 2023 with 42 SAF purchase agreements.

Despite its promise, obstacles are encountered in the development of SAF. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that there is no sustainable aviation fuel whose costs are as competitive as traditional jet fuel. This includes the high costs associated with the adoption of new technologies and their production methods.

Another issue is that SAF has a lower density than traditional jet fuel. This means that 1 liter of conventional jet fuel contains more energy than 1 liter of SAF.

Thus, an aircraft can fly further using conventional jet fuel than SAF with the same amount. If SAF is used, the aircraft must carry a larger volume of fuel to operate long-distance flights.

""SAF production growth has slowed below expectations due to poorly designed mandates that stalled a fledgling industry. If the goal of SAF was to slow progress and raise prices, policymakers have succeeded,"" said IATA Director General Willie Walsh.

To boost production, stakeholders in the aviation sector, particularly the government, need to collaborate with industry players in the aviation business. Learning from failures and collaborating with airlines to design incentives will be beneficial in accelerating the adoption of SAF.

In Europe, for example, the promotion of the use of sustainable aviation fuel has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and an oligopolistic supply chain.

Fuel suppliers are widening their profit margins, causing airlines to pay five times higher than conventional prices or double the market price. This occurs without any guarantee of supply.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks affects airlines that will need to pay 2.9 billion USD for 1.9 million tons of SAF available in 2025. As a result, the standard price of SAF remains above that of conventional fuel.

The failure to accelerate SAF production capacity will impact the reassessment of SAF targets by many airlines. ""Many airlines committed to using 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be forced to evaluate this target,"" said Walsh as quoted from the IATA website.

He added that SAF is not produced in sufficient quantities to support these airlines in achieving their ambitions. These commitments were made in good faith, but cannot be fulfilled.

Government efforts

Indonesia has begun to follow the global trend in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). At least two airlines have tested the use of SAF in commercial flights. Garuda Indonesia experimented with it in 2023 on a commercial flight covering a distance of 455 kilometers with a total duration of 60 minutes. The journey utilized a blend of 2.4 percent SAF provided by Pertamina.

Furthermore, Pelita Air plans to use SAF for the Jakarta-Bali route in August 2025. Its fuel will utilize used cooking oil or waste oil from restaurants, households, and micro, small, and medium enterprises.

In its development until 2026, the government assesses that there has been progress in the adoption of SAF, although it is still in the early stages of widespread implementation. The government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, has issued Ministerial Decree Number 4 of 2025 concerning the Management and Utilization of Biofuels. This regulation serves as the legal basis for the production and use of SAF domestically.

From the regulatory side of the aviation sector, the Director General of Air Transportation at the Ministry of Transportation, Lukman F Laisa, stated that they have issued a Circular Letter regarding the Use of Renewable Fuel for Turbine Engine Aircraft.

This means that the government provides legal certainty for national air transport enterprises in using SAF. This was marked by the flight of Pelita Air last August.

Subsequently, the government established the National SAF Team in November 2025. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, assigned as the coordinator for the demand sector, is currently formulating demand pillar policies, including stimulus and incentive schemes. This effort is aimed at encouraging the involvement of all stakeholders in the SAF ecosystem collectively.

""In accordance with the national SAF roadmap, mandatory SAF implementation is targeted to begin in 2027, with an initial national blending rate of 1 percent. Priority will be given to international flights at the two largest international airports, Soekarno-Hatta and I Gusti Ngurah Rai,"" Lukman said in a written statement.

Separately, the Director of Air Transportation Agustinus Budi stated that the adoption and use of SAF in commercial aircraft must still consider the readiness and availability of its stock. This aspect will affect fuel prices, which could potentially drive up ticket prices.

""Ultimately, it will impact ticket prices. High ticket prices will become another problem. Well, that's a dilemma. However, whatever decision the government makes regarding the implementation of SAF, all stakeholders must be ready, operators must be ready, and the public must be ready,"" said Agustinus.

Many considerations

The plan for the adoption and implementation of SAF needs to be designed and carefully planned. This is because forced utilization without a comprehensive design can lead to high costs, rather than attempting to reduce expenditures.

Indonesia AirAsia Acting President Director Achmad Sadikin Abdurachman revealed that his company remains focused on carbon offsets, arguing that this mechanism is easier to implement and strengthens the Indonesian government's commitment to sustainability.

Carbon offsets are schemes where individuals or companies compensate for greenhouse gas emissions, including those from aviation, to fund environmental projects that absorb or reduce carbon elsewhere. Two examples are reforestation and waste management.

""For SAF itself, it is still within a longer timeframe because it requires several preparations and also readiness from other parties. This is because, apart from the oil refineries that exist in Indonesia, there is also the readiness regarding price determination, which I believe is not insignificant,"" said Sadikin.

Sadikin hopes that all stakeholders have thoroughly calculated the use of SAF so that it does not become a burden. Nevertheless, he does not deny that several countries have begun to implement SAF.

A similar statement was made by aviation expert, Alvin Lie. The mandatory use of SAF will certainly drive up the operational costs for airlines. Pertamina's capacity to produce SAF also needs to be assessed in terms of its ability to meet demand when the policy is implemented.

In the past, palm oil-based SAF was developed, but the international community did not recognize the contribution of this raw material in reducing emissions. Therefore, Pertamina is now developing used cooking oil as a raw material for SAF. However, the procurement ecosystem is considered not yet stable enough to supply in large quantities.

""Currently, Pertamina is capable of producing the national avtur needs independently. We do not import. Let us not end up having to import due to SAF,"" he said.

The government's initiative to begin organizing the SAF ecosystem indeed requires support. However, this effort needs to be accompanied by careful planning and schemes, both in terms of production capacity, demand, and its impact on airline operating costs. It is only fitting that all stakeholders prepare for this change in order to contribute to global targets.",https://assetd.kompas.id/jU00ccQb1HYNLqokZ2t1VK-T1sg=/1024x683/smart/filters:format(webp):quality(75)/https://cdn-dam.kompas.id/images/2025/12/27/af131f067c7ffc35c8ab5185c5d178d5-US_WINTER_STORM_SNARLS_AIR_TRAVEL_IN_CHICAGO_134422581.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 23:57:39.937044

""We have done so in a measured way and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.""","Travelers flying out of Singapore in 2026 will see a slight increase in their airfare, but it's for a good reason.

Singapore is introducing a sustainable aviation fuel levy on all flights departing the country, according to Euronews. The cost helps subsidize the transition to 1% SAF use in 2026. The amount of tax varies depending on the country passengers are flying to, as destinations are divided into tiered bands.

For example, for those flying to Southeast Asia (closer to Singapore), the cost can be as much as four Singapore dollars ($3.11) depending on cabin class. Meanwhile, flights to North America are in band five, meaning levies range from 10.40 and 41.60 Singapore dollars ($8.10-32.28).

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) introduced the fee to help the aviation industry reduce pollution. While some people might chafe at the extra cost, it's worth considering it a way to support eco-friendly business initiatives.

An additional fee is annoying now, but it's a small price to pay for securing a stable, healthy future for the planet. If we don't make the switch from dirty fuel now, we risk paying trillions later to address health issues, extreme weather damage, and rising energy costs.

One study found that using sustainable aviation fuel could cut airline pollution by 80% to 90%. It can also be made from food scraps, potentially addressing two major areas of waste.

Food waste costs retailers and businesses $540 billion annually. When these scraps lands in the dump, they even contribute to the gases that pollute the atmosphere and warm the planet. A rising demand for SAF could mean a new purpose for this waste and a greener future for flying.

Director-General of CAAS Han Hok Juan acknowledged that the new SAF levy might take some convincing. However, it is a necessary step forward in making air travel more sustainable.

""We need to make a start,"" Han Hok Juan told Euronews.

HS: Business aviation isn’t just private jets.
My goal is to leave the association in an even stronger position, ensuring that business aviation continues to thrive and grow.
Whether you’re in commercial aviation, business aviation, a large airline, a small operator, or a flight training school, we all share the same goals.","Skies: Why did you decide to pursue this role? What appealed to you about leading this organization?

Harlan Simpkins: The CBAA is a tremendous organization, representing the interests of business aviation while also supporting the broader business landscape across Canada.

Stepping into this role felt like a natural next step for me. My experience lines up well with where the association is headed and the needs it’s working to address.

Skies: How has your past experience prepared you for this?

HS: I’ve had a long and varied aviation career that began with ab initio training and flight instructing. From there, I worked my way through day freight operations, including specialized cargo flights out of Chalk River with a Mitsubishi MU-2, before moving into night freight flying a Beech 1900 and Falcon 20 on contracts with FedEx and Airborne Express.

I then spent a period with the Ottawa Police in surveillance and special missions operations. After that, I joined Bombardier’s Commercial Aircraft Division, primarily on the Dash 8 program. My responsibilities expanded to include the CRJ, and I was also involved in the development program for the CSeries — now the Airbus A220.

That role gave me the opportunity to work closely with international customers, support training programs, and help establish operational and training organizations around the world. I also lived in several countries while conducting consolidation training for pilots transitioning from simulator to line operations.

When Bombardier divested its commercial aircraft division to focus on business aviation, I moved to De Havilland Canada. There, I helped establish systems for both experimental and production flight testing, including the DH-6 Twin Otter, CL215/415/515 waterbombers, and the Shorts Sherpa.

Throughout this time, I developed strong working relationships with Transport Canada and built deep operational regulatory experience. At De Havilland, I also led the process of establishing a private operator certificate. This was necessary as we prepared to operate a corporate shuttle and conduct aircraft ferry and delivery flights, which fall under a different regulatory framework than production flying.

Looking back, the progression feels very natural — from special missions and freight operations to commercial programs, and into business aviation and private operator certification. Taken together, it’s given me hands-on experience across nearly every facet of aviation operations.

Skies: What do you think is the biggest benefit of business aviation here in Canada?

HS: Business aviation isn’t just private jets. It spans everything from single-engine piston and turbine aircraft to twin-engine turboprops and turbojets — and even some repurposed commercial aircraft flying in business roles.

These aircraft are essential tools for companies, helping them move people and equipment efficiently and operate at the pace business requires.

Skies: What are your top priorities for the year ahead, and for your term as CEO?

HS: My 30-60-90-day plan is really about listening. I want to meet with board members, operators, and as many members as I can to understand what we’re doing well, where we’re really strong, and where there’s room to improve. It’s basically a cross-country listening tour to make sure we’re focused on what matters most to members.

The first 30 days will be full-on. We have chapter meetings happening across the country, so I’ll be travelling quite a bit and meeting operators in different provinces. Then, before you know it, we’re into the 90-day mark and right up against our convention in Calgary in June — so it’s definitely a “drinking from a fire hose” kind of start.

At the same time, there’s no shortage of active files. We’re working closely with Transport Canada and Nav Canada, dealing with airport access and slots, and coordinating with Canada Border Services on cross-border processes and airport entry. Those relationships are critical for our members’ day-to-day operations.

And of course, with the 2026 FIFA World Cup coming to Canada, we’re expecting a major influx of aircraft. We want to make sure key gateways like Vancouver and Toronto are ready to handle that level of traffic smoothly.

There’s a lot going on, but for me, the top priority right out of the gate is simple: Get out there, meet members, and build the trust and confidence that I’m here to lead and represent them well.

Skies: Are there any major issues on your radar right now?

HS: We’ve had some real advocacy wins in the past. One of the big ones was successfully removing business aircraft from the federal luxury tax. Now we’re focused on pursuing measures similar to what our neighbours in the U.S. have, particularly around accelerated depreciation for aviation assets.

Those U.S. incentives can influence where companies choose to do business — where they buy aircraft, and where those aircraft are registered. When that activity shifts south of the border, Canada loses out. Keeping those investments here supports our own economy and generates important spin-offs like maintenance, skilled labour, fuelling, and hangarage.

We’re also putting more emphasis on the turboprop community. It’s a fast-growing segment in Canada, and we want to make sure those operators see the CBAA as their home and their voice.

Those are key priorities, but at the end of the day, the most important thing is getting out and listening to members. Understanding their most pressing issues and advocating on their behalf is exactly what CBAA is here to do.

Skies: Another focus in the past has been sustainability, particularly via the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Is that another of your priorities, going forward?

HS: Yes, it’s definitely a priority. We’re part of the Climbing Fast initiative, and we’re watching developments around sustainable aviation fuel very closely. A big part of the challenge is scale — having enough supply, the right production capacity, and reliable distribution networks. All of those pieces need to come together.

It would be great to say we can move to 100 percent SAF tomorrow, but without that supporting infrastructure in place, it’s very difficult to make that a reality.

That said, being environmentally responsible is absolutely important to us. It’s something the industry is taking seriously, and we want to be part of the solution as the ecosystem continues to develop.

Skies: How do you plan to ensure the CBAA is a truly national organization that represents the needs of the community?

HS: We’re seeing really strong growth in business aviation across the Prairie provinces. There are more operators now in places like Winnipeg, Regina, and Saskatoon, and Calgary is continuing to grow as an aviation hub — especially with De Havilland establishing operations there. So in many ways, that national footprint already exists.

At the same time, the major airports — Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax — remain key centres for larger business activity, and that’s reflected in our membership as well.

With upcoming chapter meetings, I’ll be travelling across the country in April to connect directly with members and make sure every region feels equally represented and heard.

Skies: Your predecessor, Anthony Norejko, was on the job for about seven years. Is your time as CEO a fixed term, or is it open-ended?

HS: Yes, it’s open-ended. I’ll continue in the role for as long as the board and the membership feel I’m the right person to lead.

Anthony has done an outstanding job, and I’ve been working closely with him over the past couple of weeks to ensure a strong transition. He’s been walking me through the key files and making important introductions with the various boards and partners we work with.

His support has really helped set me up to hit the ground running.

Skies: You mentioned the CBAA convention is coming up in June. Is there anything special we can look forward to there?

HS: It’s a really big annual convention; we’re expecting over 600 people to attend. We kick things off the day before the show with our golf tournament, which supports Hope Air.

The first day is all about education. We bring in topics that our members have told us they want to hear about, whether it’s AI, new rules, or regulations for flying around the world.

Of course, we also have a static display and a trade show. It’s really a chance for everyone to come together, network, and make the connections that help their businesses run more effectively.

Another key focus is sharing best practices. You can’t reinvent the wheel at every company; there’s real value in learning from other people’s successes and even their mistakes.

It’s an incredible opportunity to learn and grow, and we’re excited to keep that tradition going this year.

Skies: Have you started thinking about how you’d like to be remembered?

HS: It’s only my second week, so I’m still getting my feet wet, but I already have a good sense of the organization’s history and where it’s come from. I also have some ideas about where it’s headed. My goal is to leave the association in an even stronger position, ensuring that business aviation continues to thrive and grow.

Skies: What is your final message to the industry, for now? Is there anything you’d like them to take away from this piece?

HS: Aviation in Canada — and really, worldwide — is a small, close-knit family. We’re all in this together: Advocating for our industry, promoting safety, and looking for efficiencies. Whether you’re in commercial aviation, business aviation, a large airline, a small operator, or a flight training school, we all share the same goals.

Let’s keep that family mentality alive, and work together to maintain a safe, efficient, and thriving industry.",https://assets.skiesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Harlan-Simpkins-wide-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 17:58:03.896323

In our recent webinar, “2025 Wins and Trends in State Climate Policy,” Clean Air Task Force (CATF) staff from across the country shared insights on where states are making progress, the headwinds they face, and what opportunities lie ahead in 2026.

Below are key takeaways from that conversation, drawing on examples from each region of the United States.

State climate action is critical

State governments make daily decisions that shape both near-term and long-term emissions outcomes—through legislation, permitting, regulatory implementation, and grant programs. States develop policy innovations that can spread to other states and scale to the federal level.

State leadership is especially critical during periods of federal uncertainty and gridlock. State policy supports market stability, provides long-term signals for investment in clean technologies, and continues progress on emissions reductions. U.S. states also have an important role internationally through collaborations with national and subnational governments, participation and presence in international climate conferences, and demonstration of continued progress on emissions reductions.

Dynamics affecting state climate policy

Across the country, several dynamics are shaping state climate and energy policy:

Affordability: Rising costs for electricity, housing, healthcare, and food have made affordability a central household and political issue.

Rapid load growth: Data centers, AI, and electrification are driving unprecedented demand for electricity, requiring additional generation and transmission.

Federal uncertainty and funding cuts: Legal challenges to regulations, funding cuts, and potential limits on state authority are complicating long-term planning across industries.

Political polarization: Climate and energy policy must contend with an environment of ongoing political polarization and strengthened skepticism toward government and institutions.

National trends in state climate policy

Despite these challenging dynamics, states continue to act, and in many cases, lead. Several trends emerged across regions in 2025, which provide a strong foundation for climate policy in 2026.

Continued state leadership, as many governors and legislatures continue to advance policies that reduce emissions.

Deployment of innovative technologies, with many state leaders in both parties supporting zero- or low-emission technologies such as nuclear, geothermal, and carbon capture.

Growing support for clean firm power, including nuclear, geothermal, and carbon capture, as states confront reliability and affordability challenges.

Increased focus on renewable energy deployment, through improved state/local siting frameworks, permitting reform, and pushes to utilize expiring federal tax credits.

Renewed momentum on nuclear energy, including repealing moratoria, increasing state funding, investing in workforce development, and planning new projects.

Affordability-centered climate framing, with climate policies framed in the context of affordability, reliability, and economic competitiveness.

Budgetary challenges, resulting from federal funding cuts to states, which may limit new state funding and jeopardize traditional funding streams.

Regional highlights

The following regional highlights cover topics that CATF or CATF Action was involved in. These highlights are meant to be illustrative, not comprehensive, as there have been important state policy actions on building efficiency, electric vehicles, resilience, and other topics not discussed here.

Northeast: Recalibration and clean firm focus

In New York, ambitious climate targets collided with cost pressures and federal barriers to offshore wind. While the state is now expected to miss its 2030 renewable target, the state’s latest energy plan shows it remains on track for a 100% clean grid by 2040—largely due to a renewed emphasis on nuclear power. For the first time, New York explicitly assessed nuclear power in its power system modeling, and it found that adding additional nuclear capacity could make it easier and less costly to meet the 2040 target. The state is supporting existing reactors, planning new nuclear capacity, investing in workforce development, and developing a statewide nuclear master plan that will be finalized by the end of 2026.

Pennsylvania faced legislative gridlock and ultimately withdrew from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, leaving a policy gap for grid decarbonization. The state environmental agency launched a federally funded $396 million industrial decarbonization grant program that may catalyze one of the largest industrial clean energy clusters in the country.

2025 saw increased interest in nuclear power in many states across the Northeast. For example, New Jersey worked on legislation to advance nuclear and other clean technologies and newly elected-Gov. Mickie Sherril has indicated she will continue to pursue those goals; Massachusetts is developing a nuclear roadmap that will be finalized in April 2026; and several states are engaged in a multistate coordination effort on advanced nuclear, led by the National Association of State Energy Officials.

Southeast: Load growth drives the conversation

Climate and clean energy policy in Virginia and North Carolina, much like the rest of the region, was shaped by projections of surging load growth. Forecasts of increased electricity demand, driven largely by data centers, have made reliability and system planning central policy concerns. Across the region, policymakers are increasingly open to clean firm resources as part of a balanced, affordable clean energy mix. At the same time, utilities like Duke Energy and Dominion are pushing for new natural gas peaker plants to meet demand.

Virginia took steps to classify fusion energy as carbon-free and reformed utility rate structures to better allocate costs from large energy users. North Carolina, however, passed a law eliminating the state’s requirement for 70% carbon dioxide emissions reductions by 2030, while preserving the 2050 carbon neutrality requirement.

Gulf Coast: Economic leadership on innovation

In Louisiana and Texas, clean energy policy is driven by economic competitiveness, industrial leadership, and reliability interests. In both states, political and local opposition to various clean energy technologies continues to impact the energy discourse. Often this opposition is premised around safety concerns, property rights, and public trust, which has led to several state policies that are more restrictive of some clean technologies such as solar, wind, and carbon capture and sequestration. But there has still been meaningful progress.

Louisiana advanced clean hydrogen policy through a bipartisan task force, issued its first Class VI CO2 storage permit, reorganized energy governance, and moved to streamline permitting for advanced nuclear projects.

Texas enacted one of the most ambitious nuclear policy packages in the country, establishing a dedicated nuclear office, permitting officer, and a $350 million deployment fund. The state also made major progress on geothermal policy through financial and regulatory support, and Texas recently was granted primacy over Class VI carbon sequestration wells from the EPA.

Midwest: Nuclear resurgence and industrial decarbonization

Illinois saw nuclear energy become politically viable again, driven by affordability, reliability, and a 100% carbon free energy requirement by 2050. The state fully lifted its nuclear moratorium, passed a major grid reliability and affordability package, invested heavily in public transit, and advanced protections for critical aquifers amid carbon capture debates.

Michigan experienced slower legislative progress due to divided government, but nuclear and carbon capture gained bipartisan traction. The restart of the Palisades nuclear plant – the first reactor restart in U.S. history – symbolized the region’s renewed nuclear momentum. The legislature also began considering a low carbon fuels standard.

West: Implementation and infrastructure take center stage

Colorado passed several clean energy-related bills during the 2025 session. This includes legislation to support the deployment of advanced nuclear technology to meet the state’s clean electricity goal and to modernize state regulation to accommodate next-generation geothermal and carbon capture technologies. Another new law seeks to accelerate transmission buildout by co-locating new transmission lines along existing rights of way, like highways, to avoid potential conflicts with private landowners and wildlife habitat.

New Mexico passed bills during its 2025 legislative session that advanced carbon capture rules, increased geothermal funding, modernized the grid, and leveraged its energy revenues to fund climate programs, including a newly established $210 million Community Benefit Fund for climate projects.

Washington’s new governor hit the ground running by signing bills that streamlined permitting for fusion and updated the state’s low-carbon fuel standard. Washington has a 100% by 2045 clean electricity standard but is facing budget constraints and other obstacles such as transmission bottlenecks and other grid infrastructure issues. The state advanced important administrative steps on sustainable aviation fuel, forest carbon offsets, and a geothermal energy collaborative process.

California: Balancing climate ambition and affordability

California had one of its most consequential climate years in recent memory, despite intense federal pressure and scrutiny of its climate programs and regulatory frameworks. This year’s legislative session was defined by efforts to pair climate ambition with affordability, with major bills aimed at cutting costs, stabilizing markets, and advancing clean energy deployment. Policy wins included transmission financing reform to lower costs, regional grid coordination, reauthorization of the cap-and-invest program through 2045, streamlined geothermal permitting, and lifting the moratorium on intrastate carbon dioxide transport. The 2025 legislative session showed that California can sustain climate progress even in a challenging political and economic environment.

What to watch in 2026

As we look ahead to 2026, states will face a mix of headwinds and tailwinds when approaching climate and clean energy policy.

Ongoing concerns about affordability and the need to address it directly when discussing existing and new climate and clean energy policies.

Impacts of AI on load growth, electricity costs, and local economies, as well as public sentiment about AI.

Momentum gained by increased deployment of innovative technologies with bipartisan support (e.g., geothermal, nuclear, fusion, and transmission/grid upgrades) tempered with uncertainty for those technologies created by federal legislative and regulatory actions.

2026 elections, including 36 governors, thousands of state legislators, federal House and Senate, and utilities commissioners across nine states, including Louisiana.

Efforts to weaken state authorities for energy and climate policy.

Across regions, states are demonstrating that climate progress does not require uniform politics or unlimited budgets.

The most obvious elephant-not-in-the-room is Boeing. The US airframer has no commercial aircraft represented in either the static or flying displays. While it is understandable that Boeing has kept a low profile in the aftermath of the 737 MAX 9 mid-cabin door plug blowout two years ago, one might have expected a stronger showing in 2026 as it looks to regain momentum in one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets.

Boeing’s last major presence at the show was in 2022, when it flew its 777-9 demonstrator halfway around the globe. The manufacturer did subsequently send the aircraft to the Dubai Airshow in November 2025, where big spenders Emirates placed an order for 65 of the type.

With major Asia-Pacific carriers such as ANA, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines having already placed relatively modest orders for the delayed program and now awaiting deliveries, the decision not to showcase the aircraft to future passengers and clients in the region does leave a slightly sour taste.

Airbus, by contrast, maintained a steady presence. The European manufacturer brought two A350-1000s for the first time—a demonstrator for the flying display and a Starlux aircraft for static display—alongside an Air Nigini A220. Missing, however, was the A330neo, which had appeared at both the 2022 and 2024 shows.

COMAC, which grabbed headlines in 2024, returned with both the C919 and C909, including a C919 in the flying display. The Chinese manufacturer continues to view Southeast Asia as a key beachhead for pushing its portfolio into the international market.

Even as major carriers in the region prioritizes aircraft acquisitions from the US as a trade negotiation tool, Embraer, meanwhile, is still looking to carve a niche and pressing its regional aviation pitch with a single E195-E2 from Mongolian carrier Hunnu Air on display.

On the ground, aviation sustainability may finally be inching forward as a more concrete theme in 2026. Singapore is set to launch its sustainable aviation fuel levy later this year, a move that is drawing interest from regulators globally. In conjunction, an increased number of SAF refineries are becoming operational in the region.

Delta managing director of sales and distribution innovation Sara Reid, who demoed the platform for BTN, said some of the platform travel agency functionality will be developed through 2026.

Reid said 40 early pilot customers praised the new site's simplicity and functionality, and called it ""a significant improvement"" over Delta Professional.

The new site after customer login offers a dashboard, ""which is truly a one-stop-shop for a quick comprehensive view of your entire Delta Business experience,"" Reid said.

The dashboard includes a ""wallet"" that tracks three types of benefits:

Loyalty tokens, used to award medallion status

Amenity points, used for ticket purchases, changes or upgrades

Service points, used for unused ticket transfer fees and in the future to track agency actions ""as it relates to exceptions and things like that,"" Reid said.

As customers navigate through the site, the wallet will remain in the top right-hand corner.

Delta also introduced a ""partnership value"" figure that includes a customer's contract value—including global account savings, the total of a customer's service and amenity points—and their experience value. The latter figure includes loyalty tokens and experiences like corporate priority, preferred seats—which corporate customers have complimentary access to—and free Wi-Fi, ""which a lot of business travelers do pay for with other airlines,"" Reid said.

Delta is using the last 12 months of data to display in that area, Reid said.

Customers also will be able to complete ""quick actions"" to assess status, like unused tickets, for example, without leaving the dashboard. Eventually, Reid said, this feature could be used to resolve in-trip issues. In the future, ""you could as a travel manager or agency click to be able to give [a traveler at an airport] access to a drink voucher or something like that,"" Reid said. ""Our intent long-term is to upgrade the travel experience for customers through quick actions from the site.""

A new contract performance section allows users to track progress against their negotiated goals, including specific markets, Reid added.

""This is a level of transparency that we haven't really provided, but customers have been asking for, and we're really excited to be able to deliver it in a way that's very intuitive and actionable ... giving customers a clear view of performance and value,"" she said. ""We also want to shift into loyalty where they can get a deeper look into how their travelers are engaging with Delta and how they can strategically use this new wallet, specifically their loyalty tokens.""

In addition, customers will be able to see their travelers' loyalty status breakdown, including percentage who are SkyMiles members and their distribution across Medallion tiers. ""This is something that we've provided on reports before, but never alongside this wallet capability,"" Reid added.

The ability to use service points to waive the unused ticket transfer fee ""is one of the biggest wins"" for customers, ""as we heard a lot about the fee, so we incorporated that into the design,"" Reid said. Based on a customer suggestion, corporate clients now can choose to direct the value of unused tickets toward the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel.

Companies can use amenity points to support travelers with new tickets, ticket changes and see upgrades. ""This is the first time customers can initiate a seat upgrade without having to call into our global sales solutions center,"" Reid noted.

The new site also includes operational performance metrics for Delta and its major competitors, including completion factor, on-time performance and mishandled bags. Customers also can view their upcoming meetings and events, a section that ""we're looking to enhance even more this year,"" Reid said.

Reid acknowledged the data and reporting section of the site is ""still a work in progress,"" but said ""customers won't lose access to the reporting they have today"" while Delta invests in expanded analytics during the next 12 months.

As for support, customers will have the ability to chat directly with global sales solutions specialists from the homepage after login, Reid said.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTN/uploadedImages/2015_Site_Maintenance/BTN_Link_PreviewLogo.png?n=3260&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2026-01-27 14:57:24.797852

In October the UN body's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) put off a vote on its Net Zero Framework for a year after significant opposition to it emerged, throwing into doubt shipping's timeline for when it will be charged for its greenhouse gas emissions.

Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez spoke to reporters at the IMO's London headquarters last week to give an update on the organisation's thinking on the issue, among other topics.

Since October's delay there have been reports of some green fuel producers putting production investments on hold, or mulling whether to pivot towards other markets like sustainable aviation fuel instead of targeting the shipping industry.

""It's always difficult to attract investment into shipping,"" Domiguez told Ship & Bunker at the event on Friday.

""We have already started, and we are on our pathway to decarbonisation.

""We face some obstacles on the way; we need to stay positive and address those obstacles that happen in normal daily life, and we don't just stop, or collapse or abandon.

""The industry continues to drive into how we're going to be more sustainable, more efficient, and that is going to allow us as well to compete with other modes of transport.""

No New Timeline for NZF Vote

Dominguez declined to provide an updated timeline on when a new vote on the NZF might be scheduled.

The MEPC is due to hold its next meeting in April, and he said his focus for now was on meeting as many delegations as possible before then to gauge their thinking.

""I wouldn't focus on whether this is going to be an urgency or not,"" Dominguez said.

""We have a pathway, because we have recognised the need for us to address the negative impact of shipping on the environment.

By Steven Scheer

JERUSALEM, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Boeing and Israel's Technion university said on Tuesday they were beginning to develop Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ​feedstocks including green hydrogen and carbon dioxide to enable the aviation ‌sector's long-term growth.

SAF, made largely from waste or used cooking oil, can cut emissions significantly compared with ‌traditional jet fuel. However, it remains two to five times more expensive than conventional fuel.

Boeing and Technion said following the completion of an initial feasibility phase, development was set to begin and move towards ""competitive commercial production.""

Boeing has committed to delivering commercial ⁠airplanes capable of flying 100% ‌on SAF by 2030, while the commercial aviation industry seeks to achieve zero net emissions by 2050.

Although airline industry leaders have ‍pointed to a wave of new SAF initiatives they say will spark a boom similar to the rapid rise of electric vehicles and solar energy, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), ​a global body that represents 340 airlines, forecast SAF would account for ‌only 0.7% of total jet fuel in 2025, and the 2050 target could be missed.

Boeing said the process to develop SAF on a large scale could still take a few years. SAF can be made from a variety of sources such as cover crops and other non-edible plants, agricultural and forestry waste, non-recyclable municipal ⁠waste, industrial plant off-gassing and other feedstocks

Separately, ​Boeing and Israel's Ben-Gurion University said they were ​establishing a cybersecurity research centre for next-generation aviation and aerospace systems.

Boeing Global President Brendan Nelson, currently in Israel, said the company was ‍working to ""enhance energy security, ⁠support the growth of the civil aviation industry, and create new economic opportunities through sustainable aviation fuel and other technologies.""

Technion President Uri Sivan said ⁠it was on a mission to develop technologies for producing clean fuels that would make a ""significant ‌contribution to aviation—and no less importantly, to human health and the ‌environment.""

Ground testing of a modified Passport engine was completed in 2025 at Peebles Test Operation as part of NASA’s Turbofan Engine Power Extraction Demonstration project. Technical teams advanced understanding of the hybrid electric engine’s system integration and controls, beyond just standalone components.

GE Aerospace is developing a narrowbody hybrid electric architecture that embeds electric motor/generators in a gas turbine engine to supplement power during different phases of operation. The design optimizes performance and creates a system that can work with or without energy storage like batteries.

“Hybrid electric propulsion is central to how GE Aerospace is redefining the future of flight,” said Arjan Hegeman, vice president of future of flight for GE Aerospace. “Our latest milestone successfully demonstrated a narrowbody hybrid electric engine architecture that doesn’t require energy storage to operate. It’s a critical step to making hybrid electric flight a reality for commercial aviation with technologies that meet customer needs for greater efficiency, durability, and range.”

Testing exceeded NASA’s technical performance benchmarks. NASA based these measures on industry input about engine capabilities that would provide meaningful fuel cost savings for U.S. aviation while also meeting the power requirements of future aircraft.

RISE program testing

The Power Extraction Demonstration is one of several efforts GE Aerospace has underway to mature technologies for more electric aircraft engines through the CFM International RISE program.

Unveiled in 2021, the RISE program is one of the aviation industry’s most comprehensive technology demonstrators with more than 350 tests and more than 3,000 endurance cycles completed to date, including tests on advanced engine architectures like Open Fan, compact core and hybrid electric systems. The RISE program prioritizes safety, durability and efficiency, targeting more than 20% better fuel burn compared to commercial engines in service today.

CFM RISE program technologies are maturing toward ground and flight tests this decade with work underway on aircraft and engine integration in collaboration with partners.

Hybrid electric experience

GE Aerospace has achieved multiple hybrid electric milestones over the last decade, including a 2016 ground test of an electric motor-driven propeller. In 2022, GE Aerospace completed the world’s first test of a megawatt-class and multi-kilovolt (kV) hybrid electric propulsion system in altitude conditions up to 45,000 feet that simulate single-aisle commercial flight.

“In addition to delivering high-quality fuel-efficient airplanes to our customers, Boeing works globally and regionally to enhance energy security, support the growth of the civil aviation industry, and create new economic opportunities through sustainable aviation fuel and other technologies,” Nelson said in remarks provided by the partners.

Boeing’s delegation also included Maj.-Gen. (res.) Ido Nehushtan, president of Boeing Israel, and Haggai Mazursky, described as the head of the SAF project. They were welcomed by Technion President Prof. Uri Sivan and senior Technion leadership, including Prof. Noam Adir, executive vice president for research, and Prof. Yuval Garini, executive vice president for innovation and industry relations.

Technion leaders framed the project as a national-scale effort that could link academic research to industrial capability.

“This is a historic collaboration of national importance for the State of Israel,” Sivan said. He added that the partnership represented “a vote of confidence” in Technion researchers and their ability to develop cleaner fuel production technologies.

From feasibility to 'Power-to-Liquid' development

According to the Israeli Sustainable Aviation Fuel Knowledge Center (iSAF), the Boeing–Technion SAF Innovation Center’s work has centered on “electrofuels” produced via Power-to-Liquid (PtL) processes that combine green hydrogen with captured carbon dioxide. The partners said the next stage would push the process toward practical development that can support commercial production at a competitive cost.

The center has been led by Prof. Gideon (Gidi) Grader of the Technion’s Wolfson Department of Chemical Engineering, according to Technion faculty information. The partners said 11 Technion faculty members and dozens of doctoral students from five faculties have worked on fuel production and qualification topics, including catalytic processes, combustion, safety, life-cycle analysis, and an experimental fuel-testing facility.

Boeing’s Israel footprint and a growing SAF ecosystem

Nehushtan said Boeing’s relationship with Israel spans decades, including commercial ties with El Al and defense cooperation with the Israeli Air Force, alongside a supplier network that integrates Israeli-made systems into Boeing products. Boeing’s published Israel background material describes a relationship that goes back more than 75 years, alongside commercial and defense partnerships and local supplier activity.

The Technion-Boeing initiative has unfolded alongside government-backed efforts to accelerate SAF research and development. In February 2025, the Israel Innovation Authority announced a NIS 100 million investment to establish a national SAF research consortium, bringing together industrial companies and academic research teams to develop technologies for renewable aviation fuels.

Industry and academia have also convened around SAF-IL, a consortium referenced in the Technion-hosted iSAF conference agenda as part of Israel Innovation Authority activity.

Work continued after October 7

The partners said the Boeing–Technion announcement had originally been planned for October 2023, but the initiative continued after the October 7 attacks and the war that followed. Nelson was quoted in the material describing the center as a “project of resilience and innovation,” and argued that Israel had the capacity to tackle aviation’s emissions challenge through research and commercialization.

Boeing said sustainable aviation fuel remains a major lever for reducing aviation emissions, and in a separate Boeing sustainability statement the company has said SAF can reduce CO2 emissions over the fuel’s life cycle by up to 85%, depending on feedstock and production pathway.","https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/q_auto/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_720,w_1280/703666",N,,2026-01-27 11:09:09.516478

At the North Sea Summit on Monday, ministers from Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway signed an agreement to develop 100 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity in shared economic waters. That’s enough to supply more than 50 million households.

The deal builds on a 2023 pledge to construct 300 GW of offshore wind by 2050, conceived after the energy‑price shock triggered by Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent disruption of gas flows to Europe.

While this latest announcement is years in the making, it lands at a delicate moment for Europe’s relationship with the U.S., given the recent transatlantic spat over Greenland.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s transactional diplomacy and his pursuit of “energy dominance” have sharpened European concerns about their heavy reliance on U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), which replaced most of the volumes previously supplied by Russia.

U.S. gas accounted for 57% of all LNG imports into the EU and Britain in 2025 and around a quarter of the region’s total gas imports.

Wind power has long been the cornerstone of Northern Europe’s strategy to slash its fossil fuel dependency, with onshore and offshore wind generating 19% of EU electricity in 2025, according to industry group WindEurope. Yet the region currently operates only about 37 GW of offshore wind across 13 countries, meaning the planned 100 GW expansion would profoundly reshape Europe’s power market.

Investor enthusiasm for clean energy globally has waned in recent years due to rising capital costs, supply‑chain constraints and unease over China’s dominant position in renewables manufacturing. Trump’s explicit hostility toward green energy - especially wind power - further dented sentiment as the U.S. government scrapped numerous projects this past year.

Meanwhile, Europe’s cost‑of‑living crisis, which has been intensified by high energy prices, has turned climate policies into political flashpoints, fuelling resistance to net‑zero plans.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE

Cost concerns were clearly as much a driver of the European offshore wind pact as worries about overreliance on the U.S.

The new plan thus contains several elements that could reduce development costs and ultimately lower consumer electricity prices.

The most important of these is the scale of the commitment, which can help trim costs by providing the offshore wind supply chain with greater demand certainty. This, in turn, should encourage investment in homegrown manufacturing.

WindEurope says industry players have pledged to cut costs by 30% between 2025 and 2040, predicting the plan will create 91,000 jobs and generate 1 trillion euros ($1.19 trillion) in economic activity.

A key feature of the agreement is its blueprint for connecting wind farms to multiple countries through a network of bidirectional cables and interconnectors. This should allow power to flow where it is needed most, improving efficiency by giving operators flexibility to respond to changing supply‑and‑demand patterns across several markets.

Such cross‑border “arbitrage” should also help reduce episodes of “negative pricing” – periods when excess wind power forces operators to curtail output and governments to compensate them.

""When it is windy in Germany, it may not be windy in the UK, so if Germany can't use all of the power, the UK can take some instead of wasting it,"" said Jordan May, senior analyst at consultancy TGS 4C.

What’s more, the multi-nation plan will cover multiple time zones, meaning countries will peak at different hours. This should make it easier to match supply with demand, potentially reducing the need for gas‑fired power, May added.

Finally, Europe may gain from Trump’s antipathy toward wind. The U.S. sector has experienced a dramatic downturn under this administration. The International Energy Agency last year cut its 2030 U.S. offshore wind forecast by more than 50%. Reduced American demand for vessels, components and engineering services could ultimately lead to lower prices for European operators.

Still, unlocking these efficiency gains will require European governments to develop complex new regulations to align different national subsidy regimes and power market rules. That process could take years and face political resistance in some countries.

UNPREDICTABLE COSTS

The cost of switching to renewables has become a point of contention in Europe. But these costs are highly uncertain, as forecasting in this area is hardly a science, whether one is looking at fossil fuels or green energy.

Offshore wind demands heavy upfront investment but tends to have lower long‑term operating costs. Gas‑fired plants, on the other hand, are cheaper to build but are also exposed to volatile global gas prices.

Moreover, debates about the cost of renewables often fail to consider the cost of doing nothing, which is enormous. Europe’s power demand is expected to nearly double by mid‑century, meaning the region will need to upgrade and expand its aging transmission and distribution grids regardless of which technology dominates. The longer European leaders wait, the more expensive this is likely to be.

Europe’s joint offshore wind plan offers a pathway to building more homegrown power and industrial capacity while reducing reliance on foreign fossil fuels. While that’s important, its ultimate success will depend on whether it lowers electricity costs for European consumers.

SINGAPORE, Jan. 27, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Singapore Air Show -- Radia, the developer of the WindRunner™ aircraft, is advancing a new approach to commercial air cargo with a purpose-built platform designed to move extremely large payloads more directly and with fewer infrastructure constraints. Radia will highlight WindRunner at the Singapore Air Show, booth #C-W103.

As global supply chains increasingly depend on outsized, high-value systems, existing air cargo solutions are reaching their limits. Cargo often exceeds spatial constraints long before weight becomes an issue, forcing disassembly, multimodal transport, and reliance on ports, roads, and specialized infrastructure.

WindRunner overcomes these limitations by enabling airlift for cargo previously considered too large to fly. Payloads range from large aerostructures, including complete widebody fuselage sections, to the largest jet engines ever built, oversized power transformers up to 70 tonnes, ultra-long wind turbine blades exceeding 100 meters, and next-generation space hardware such as large rockets, satellites, and launch systems.

By prioritizing volume over weight, WindRunner provides more than 6,800 cubic meters of usable cargo space (10x bigger than 777 volume) and supports roll-on, roll-off transport of fully assembled cargo using standard ground equipment. The aircraft is designed to operate from semi-prepared or unpaved runways as short as 1,800 meters, extending commercial airlift access to locations where traditional infrastructure is limited or unavailable.

""Commercial cargo requirements have outgrown the logistics systems built to support them,"" said Mark Lundstrom, Founder and CEO of Radia. ""WindRunner expands what is possible for air cargo operators by removing long-standing constraints on size, access, and complexity. This is what is needed for existing industry, and it will also unlock many additional huge products that are currently constrained by transportation limitations.""

Designed for Real-World Commercial Operations

WindRunner is being developed under a civil certification pathway using proven, certified components to support reliable and repeatable operations at scale. Radia plans to operate WindRunner through a transport-as-a-service model, providing flexible capacity to commercial operators, governments, and humanitarian organizations rather than selling aircraft.

The platform supports a wide range of missions, including project and industrial cargo, aerospace and space systems transport, energy infrastructure components, humanitarian relief, and logistics into remote or infrastructure-constrained regions.

Working with the Global Cargo Ecosystem

Radia is collaborating with established cargo operators to ensure WindRunner integrates seamlessly into existing commercial workflows. In 2025, Radia announced a collaboration with Maximus Air to explore WindRunner's potential to expand access and efficiency for outsized air cargo missions.

By working directly with experienced operators, Radia is aligning WindRunner's design and operations with real-world requirements.

Expanding Access and Reducing Complexity

WindRunner enables more direct point-to-point delivery while reducing handling steps, infrastructure dependence, and overall project complexity. Its infrastructure-light approach also supports sustainability objectives by minimizing multi-leg transport and enabling compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

WindRunner is currently progressing through detailed design and supplier integration, with first flight targeted by the end of the decade.

About Radia

Radia is a dual-use aerospace company developing WindRunner™, the world's largest aircraft by volume. WindRunner is designed to enable direct transport of oversized cargo across commercial, energy, defense, aerospace, and humanitarian missions without reliance on specialized infrastructure. Radia is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado and Rome, Italy, with a growing global partner and supplier network.

Hydrogen is central to both the energy transition and the production of eFuels. From Dii’s perspective, what policy and infrastructure priorities are needed to accelerate green hydrogen production for aviation (and beyond) across the MENA region?

At an early stage, supporting policies play an important role in shaping markets. Dii always advocates for TLC policies, i.e. policies that are transparent, long-lasting and certain. Our industry partners have invested heavily in clean fuel projects over the years and stand ready to invest. But they can only do that when the rules of the game are clearly set and there is certainty they won’t change on a whim.

Another important pre-requisite is enabling infrastructure, i.e. ports, pipelines, water supply, grids, storage facilities etc. They often require long lead times and involve several partners, especially in the case of common user infrastructure. More urgency is required for enabling infrastructure.

Given Dii’s advocacy for regulatory alignment and energy diplomacy, what steps are needed to harmonise standards between the EU, GCC, and North Africa to unlock cross-border trade in clean aviation fuels?

Several elements such as harmonized standards, carbon pricing, globally recognised certificates, a common finance framework and infrastructure development are crucial to shape markets for clean fuels. Ideally, the world quickly unities around common agreements, but the reality is that global consensus around carbon pricing mechanisms or harmonization around standards and certificates requires time and, in some cases, may not materialize at all. We would therefor advocate for regional alliances around certain topics, for example the development of clean aviation and maritime corridors that connect regions that can align on standards and carbon pricing.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/69778e06973d360ce6862fe0/1769513126762/2.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-27 11:10:10.316752

This technological pathway represents a strategic investment in the future of sustainable aviation—a future where energy security and climate leadership are intertwined.","The global race to decarbonize aviation is entering a decisive phase. While conventional Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers a vital near-term bridge as a drop-in hydrocarbon, the industry’s long-term net-zero ambitions demand a fuel that is not only carbon-free but also scalable, cost-competitive, and independent of biomass constraints.

For the sun-rich nations of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the future of clean flying is written not only in the skies, but also on the ground through renewable energy and hydrogen. Liquid Green Hydrogen (LGH), produced from water using vast solar energy, represents a paradigm shift—a truly sustainable aviation fuel whose scalability is limited only by sunlight and engineering ambition. With its world-leading solar resources, existing aviation hub status, and forward-looking industrial strategy, the UAE is uniquely positioned to pilot this integrated value chain—from gigawatt-scale solar plants to cryogenic fuel loading at airport gates.

Two major issues challenge our vision of hydrogen-powered aviation: compared to conventional jet fuel and jet engines, liquid hydrogen has a low volumetric energy density, and aviation fuel cells have a low specific power. However, these are not dead ends, but rather engineering challenges with clear innovation roadmaps. The response is taking shape through parallel revolutions in airframe design and propulsion technology.

The low volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen means that aircraft need significantly larger fuel tanks, while also the fuel economy needs to improve. The industry’s most promising answer is the Blended Wing Body (BWB) design, actively pursued by major manufacturers and ambitious start-ups. This fundamental redesign transforms a volumetric challenge into an opportunity for greater efficiency. By merging the fuselage and wings into a single, wide lifting body, the BWB creates a much larger internal volume for cryogenic hydrogen tanks while improving the aircraft aerodynamics. The BWB design can improve overall fuel economy by up to 20%, partially offsetting hydrogen's inherent range penalty.

While hydrogen can be combusted in modified gas turbines-a more straightforward transition-the greater long-term efficiency prize lies in hydrogen fuel cells with electric propulsion. The challenge, as noted, is specific power. Today’s aviation-grade fuel cell systems are too heavy for mainstream commercial flight. Yet, the industry roadmap is aggressive and focused. Research is targeting High-Temperature PEM fuel cells (HT-PEMFC) with simpler thermal and water management, enabling a lighter design. The goal is to achieve a system-level specific power exceeding 3 kW/kg by 2035, a key threshold for making regional aircraft commercially viable. For longer ranges, hybrid propulsion architectures—such as integrating fuel cells with hydrogen gas turbines—are under investigation. These systems aim to exploit the high efficiency of fuel cells during cruise while using turbines to support high-power phases.

These parallel advancements represent the most promising pathway to closing the performance gap. If these technological and infrastructure challenges are met, hydrogen-powered flights over distances of 5,000+ km could become a commercial reality by the 2040s. This technological pathway represents a strategic investment in the future of sustainable aviation—a future where energy security and climate leadership are intertwined. In the UAE, LGH will become more cost efficient than SAF from biomass by 2050 and cheaper than conventional jet fuel by 2060.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/69724bfb0374c60bbe7a93c3/1769505712790/From+Solar+to+Wings.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-27 11:10:13.515655

What was long-term ambition is now translating into tangible project pipelines, policy signals, and cross-sector alignment that place the UAE firmly on the global SAF map.

Most notably, UAE is launching 13 new SAF projects as part of a national strategy to achieve 700 million litres of annual production and a 1% voluntary SAF blend by 2031. Taken together, these initiatives signal a clear shift: SAF is no longer a peripheral decarbonisation pathway in the region. It is becoming a strategic pillar of the national aviation and energy transition.

Why the UAE Is Uniquely Positioned to Scale SAF

The UAE’s advantage lies in the intersection of three critical factors: demand, infrastructure, and energy. As a global aviation hub, the country hosts some of the world’s busiest long-haul routes and largest international carriers. This concentration of aviation activity creates sustained, long-term demand for jet fuel, and increasingly for lower-carbon alternatives.

At the same time, the UAE’s energy system provides a strong foundation for SAF and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels. Abundant solar resources, competitive renewable power costs, and an existing industrial base make hydrogen-derived fuels increasingly viable. When combined with advanced refining capabilities, ports, storage, and logistics infrastructure, the region is well placed to support multiple SAF pathways: from HEFA and co-processing through to eSAF.

From Announcements to an Emerging Project Pipeline

The announcement of the 13 SAF projects is particularly significant. The projects are expected to span different technologies and feedstocks, indicating that the UAE is not betting on a single solution, but rather building a clearly diversified SAF ecosystem. This mirrors how other major energy transitions have successfully scaled. Through parallel experimentation, competition, and collaboration across sectors.

Crucially, these projects are being developed alongside broader national strategies on hydrogen, industrial decarbonisation, and energy diversification. SAF is not being treated exclusively as an aviation issue, but as part of a wider economic and industrial opportunity which can attract investment, develop local expertise, and support export-oriented markets.

Policy, Infrastructure, and the Speed of Scale

While momentum is clear, the next phase will determine how quickly projects move from announcement to execution. Policy certainty remains central - and crucially, is being developed. Investors and developers consistently emphasise the need for long-term clarity around sustainability criteria, lifecycle accounting, incentives, and market access. Clear, stable frameworks are essential to unlock financing and enable offtake agreements—particularly for capital-intensive facilities.

Infrastructure is the other critical enabler. SAF production cannot happen in isolation: it relies on hydrogen supply, renewable power, water availability, CO₂ sourcing, storage, blending facilities, and export or distribution routes. Coordinating these elements across multiple stakeholders requires early planning and alignment.

The UAE’s track record in delivering large-scale infrastructure quickly is a significant advantage, but timelines remain tight. Aligning aviation decarbonisation goals with infrastructure development cycles will be one of the defining challenges of the next five years.

A Regional Hub With Global Implications

With Europe advancing mandates and the aviation sector facing mounting pressure, demand for SAF will begin to outstrip supply in many regions. The UAE’s geographic position creates the potential for it to become a central hub in future SAF trade flows.

This raises questions on how sustainability standards align across regions, how certificates are recognised, how carbon accounting works for international fuel movements, and how cross-border offtake agreements are structured.

These are just some of the commercial questions that airlines, fuel producers, investors, and governments must grapple with today.

Why SAF MENA Is the Place to Engage

As the UAE’s SAF ecosystem moves from ambition to implementation, industry stakeholders align on these points.

The Sustainable Aviation Futures MENA Congress, taking place 10–12 February 2026 in Dubai, is designed for this alignment.

Bringing together government leaders, airlines, fuel producers, energy companies, investors, EPCs, and technology providers, SAF MENA focuses on the practical realities of scaling SAF, LCAF, and sFuels in the region.

With the UAE’s SAF announcements marking a clear inflection point, the Congress offers an opportunity to understand what is happening now, influence what comes next, and connect with partners driving projects forward.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/69778eea2034ec3e0b8cbdb8/1769507584750/1.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-27 11:10:18.266217

[3] In 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggested that SAF production could increase from 2,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 30,000 bpd if all announced capacity additions came online.
Our analysis considered SAF production using the pyrolysis and Fischer-Tropsch pathways.
While SAF tax credits were originally conceived under the 45Z legislation as technology-neutral support to decarbonize aviation, changes to this structure under the OBBBA diminish this effort.
Troy Carter) introduced legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives to restore the SAF premium credit, referred to as the ‘Securing American’s Fuels (SAF) Act’.","Clean energy advocates cite the role of policy and incentives as a necessity to advance the current energy transition and the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors (such as aviation). The reasoning is straightforward: nascent technologies often require a temporary policy boost to grow and reach economies of scale before they can compete with incumbent technology. Be it solar or wind or EVs or biofuels – all of these technologies have benefited from tax credits and have become more cost-competitive over time so they can stand on their own. While ‘free market proponents’ may sometimes decry this as an unfair support of renewables, fossil fuels are also subsidized by taxpayers in the U.S.[1] – energy (like food and feed) is understood to be a critical societal need and is considered worthy of taxpayer support.

Historically, policy support for biofuels in the United States has come in the form of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which has led directly to a boom in ethanol production from corn, and an increase in the use of biodiesel and renewable diesel from seed oils. These fuels have become an integral part of the transportation fuel network in the U.S. and have resulted in added co-benefits to the agricultural sector, particularly corn and soybeans. There are also valid criticisms of the impacts of these credits from an environmental and economic perspective, but these credits have allowed the U.S. biofuels industry to mature in the decades since they were introduced.

Along these lines, ambitious policy support was announced as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Section 45Z, Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC).[2] This credit incentivized production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by offering a $1.75 per-gallon incentive along with $1 per-gallon for other transportation biofuels (for pathways with carbon intensity was lower than 50 kg CO2e/mmBTU). This was bipartisan legislation that resulted in several large project announcements in the U.S., and a shot in the arm towards meeting the SAF Grand Challenge.[3] In 2024, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggested that SAF production could increase from 2,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 30,000 bpd if all announced capacity additions came online.[4] While SAF volumes are still relatively low in comparison to total jet fuel consumption in the U.S. (less than 2%), strong growth was predicted in the Other Biofuels category within which the EIA includes SAF.[5]

However, passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in 2025 resulted in decidedly mixed outcomes for biofuels growth in the near future. While credits for other transportation biofuels were retained at $1 per-gallon and the timeline for claiming these credits was extended from 2027 to 2029, the exclusive bonus for SAF was reduced to attain parity with other biofuels, at $1 per-gallon; this represents a 43% reduction in the SAF 45Z credit going from one legislation to the other, over a period of three years between policy, creating understandable uncertainty for project developers.

Our research shows that changes from the IRA to the OBBBA result in a slight reduction in the internal rate of return (IRR, %) for projects that produce SAF (and other biofuels) from agricultural residues and claim the 45Z tax credit. Our analysis considered SAF production using the pyrolysis and Fischer-Tropsch pathways. When feedstock-dependent inputs were held the same, IRA-era IRR was consistently greater than that under the OBBBA. Under the simulation conditions employed in our analysis, the decrease was limited to ~2% points. Though our preliminary research does not conclusively answer questions about SAF profitability under evolving policy scenarios at present, our models can illustrate to policymakers the financial impacts of changes to incentive structures. While SAF tax credits were originally conceived under the 45Z legislation as technology-neutral support to decarbonize aviation, changes to this structure under the OBBBA diminish this effort. This fact is not lost on policymakers—recently, a bipartisan group of policymakers (including Louisiana Rep. Troy Carter) introduced legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives to restore the SAF premium credit, referred to as the ‘Securing American’s Fuels (SAF) Act’.[6] The group cites emissions reduction in the transportation sector, while increasing demand for U.S. agricultural products as the basis for strengthening the American SAF industry.

Considering that our analysis was performed using technoeconomic simulations sourced from the literature, we welcome the opportunity to replicate this research using real-world data from active and announced projects. We also look forward to working with policymakers interested in independent, trusted assessments of potential policy legislation. The LSU Center for Energy Studies (CES) was established by the Louisiana Legislature in 1982 to serve as a resource for policymakers, industry leaders, and community members, to deliver timely insights on energy trends and policies which impact the state.[7] The newly-created LSU Energy Institute unifies and expands several longstanding programs under an integrated platform for applied research and analysis, and brings CES into this fold.[8] We encourage interest parties to get in touch with us.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/69779444f774870965396413/1769505912478/6.png?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-27 11:10:21.711688

Timothy Hodgson, participated in India Energy Week 2026 (IEW’26) in Goa, marking the first high-level participation of a Canadian Cabinet Minister at IEW. On the sidelines of the event, the two Ministers held a bilateral meeting and launched the renewed Canada-India Ministerial Energy Dialogue. During this meeting, the Ministers affirmed the immense importance that energy security and diversity of supply, has in the safety, wellbeing, and economic vitality of both countries.

This meeting is a follow up to the direction provided by the Prime Minister(s) of India and Canada during their interaction on the sidelines of the G7 Summit, held in June 2025 in Kananaskis, Canada, wherein both leaders underscored the importance of restarting senior ministerial, as well as working-level engagements.

Natural Resources Canada and India’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas recognized the complementary nature of their energy sectors, and the mutual value to be gained on sustained engagement on energy matters. Canada has stated its goal of becoming an energy superpower in clean and conventional energy, with export diversification as a priority while India, as the epicenter of global energy landscape, offers a natural and symbiotic partnership grounded in scale, stability, and long-term opportunity. Canada has current and emerging liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, is increasing production and exports of crude oil to markets in Asia via the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX) Pipeline and is advancing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) exports to Asia via the west coast of Canada. At the same time, India being the world’s third largest oil consumer, fourth largest LNG importer, third largest LPG consumer, and having fourth largest refining capacity, is projected to remain at the center of the global energy landscape, accounting for over one-third of the growth in global energy demand over the next two decades, largest contribution by any country. Even efforts are underway in India to substantially scale up domestic oil production, significantly expand refining capacity, increase use of natural gas in the energy mix. Thus, India and Canada have significant potential to emerge strong collaborators in area of energy fuels. In this context, the Ministers affirm to deepen bilateral energy trade including supply of Canadian LNG, LPG, and crude oil to India, and supply of refined petroleum products from India to Canada.

The Ministers recognize the importance of joint commercial and investment partnerships in each other’s energy sector. Canada is acting quickly to build energy projects and supply products to international markets, with Asia as a priority region. In 2025, the Government of Canada launched the Major Projects Office and announced the acceleration of several energy and resource projects and strategies, representing more than $116 billion in investments. India is also investing heavily in its own energy supply and prosperity. India highlighted the various policy reforms undertaken, including the huge investment opportunity of US$ 500 billion in overall value chain of energy sector. Recognizing this, the Ministers agreed to deepen long-term partnerships aimed at facilitating increased reciprocal investment in the Canadian and Indian energy sectors.

The Ministers also recognized the importance of climate-related objectives. This includes efforts to reduce emissions in conventional energy value chains, including through carbon capture utilization and storage, and support for the development and deployment of cleaner technologies as energy demand grows. Recognizing that there exists a huge potential for cooperation in clean energy value chains, the Ministers noted the opportunities for collaboration in renewable energy, including hydrogen, biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel; battery storage; critical minerals; clean technologies; electricity systems; energy supply chain resilience, and the application of artificial intelligence in the energy sector.

The Ministers noted the ongoing collaborative efforts to advance the global energy transition via the global development and deployment of biofuels through Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), where Canada is an observer.

Credit FAQ: What Does The UAE's Stablecoin Regulation Mean For Local Banks?

Stablecoin adoption and tokenization are expected to accelerate globally in 2026, driven by supportive regulation, notably in the US. The United Arab Emirates is contributing to this movement with its Payment Token Services Regulation, which governs the issuance, conversion, custody and transfer of stablecoins within the country.

Since the regulation became effective in August 2024, several dirham-backed stablecoins have or are expected to be launched, indicating growing adoption and integration into the national payment system. S&P Global Ratings views the regulation as more enabling than disruptive for banks, allowing them to participate in stablecoin innovation while managing potential funding risks.

The plant in Pasir Gudang, Johor, is Malaysia’s first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plant. It also produces hydrotreated vegetable oil and Renewable naphtha, with a combined maximum production capacity of 420,000 tonnes per year, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

Made from sources such as used cooking oil or agricultural waste, SAF can be blended with conventional jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without modification.

It could reduce air travel’s lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent and is expected to deliver the vast majority of the required decarbonization for the aviation industry’s net-zero emissions. Aviation accounts for 2-3 percent of global CO₂ emissions.

The European Union and the United Kingdom have imposed SAF mandates requiring 2 percent of total jet fuel at airports to be SAF in 2025, before increasing to 6 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in 2030. Singapore has also set a 1 percent SAF target for 2026, with a goal to raise it to up to 5 percent by 2030.

Despite a promising future, the biggest hurdles that prevent SAF, or many other new technologies, from being used at a large scale are supply and cost.

Scientists say that the world is unprepared for rise in heat

A new study explores different global warming scenarios and compares them to current data on temperatures considered uncomfortable. The result is alarming, with nearly 3.8 billion people projected to face extreme heat by 2050. That is, if global temperatures rise by 2°C. The research mentions that as heatwaves become stronger, the health risks, from dizziness to organ failure and death, increase. It argues that cooling infrastructure must expand rapidly for people to adapt. “New infrastructure, such as sustainable air conditioning or passive cooling, needs to be built out within the next few years to ensure people can cope with dangerous heat.” What is more interesting is that the cooler regions from Canada to Russia can be affected as well and will have to adapt as the heat rises.

These steps are being discussed through joint councils involving both government and industry, including the Public-Private Council for the Promotion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.
By helping airlines afford this fuel and encouraging its use at airports, Japan aims to take a leading role in cleaner aviation in Asia.","The Japanese government is working on a plan to subsidise sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for domestic airlines, as part of broader efforts to cut carbon emissions from air travel and promote cleaner flights, reports Travel And Tour World.

Under the proposed plan, fuel suppliers may be required to offer aviation fuel blended with sustainable alternatives at airports across Japan. The policy is being developed through official government councils and is expected to be completed by the 2026 financial year. It will be supported by changes to the Airport Law and other related rules.

Japan’s push for cleaner aviation fuel is based on government targets and policy discussions aimed at reducing emissions from the air transport sector. These include a goal of blending 10% sustainable aviation fuel into jet fuel by 2030, along with measures to encourage fuel production and investment in supply systems. These goals are outlined in official planning documents and policy proposals from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.

According to government sources, the developing framework could include financial support to help airlines manage the higher cost of sustainable fuel. It may also require fuel suppliers to mix sustainable fuel into the aviation fuel sold at Japanese airports. In addition, the government is looking to expand the collection of raw materials, such as used cooking oil, by working with local governments and industry partners.

These steps are being discussed through joint councils involving both government and industry, including the Public-Private Council for the Promotion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The councils form part of official policy discussions focused on increasing fuel supply and setting clear regulatory goals.

For passengers, the main benefit of the policy would be cleaner flights with lower carbon emissions. Using sustainable aviation fuel allows airlines to cut emissions without affecting aircraft performance. By helping airlines afford this fuel and encouraging its use at airports, Japan aims to take a leading role in cleaner aviation in Asia.

The move could also make Japan more appealing to travellers who value environmentally friendly travel options, especially those who consider carbon impact when choosing airlines and flights.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-1.png,N,,2026-01-27 03:57:46.504809

Explanatory statements published by Congress regarding the legislation included guidance on small refinery exemptions (SREs) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The House and Senate Appropriations Committee on Jan. 5 released the legislative package, which includes three bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills. The three bills include fiscal year 2026 appropriations for Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; and Interior, Environment and Related Agencies.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Jan. 8 voted 397 to 28 in favor of the appropriations package, H.R.6938. The U.S. Senate voted 82 to 15 to pass the legislation on Jan. 15. Trump signed the bill into law on Jan. 23.

H.R. 6938 includes language on policies related to biomass energy. Specifically, Section 429 of the bill directs the U.S. Department of Energy, the USDA, and the U.S. EPA to jointly ensure that federal policy relating to biomass energy is consistent across all federal departments and agencies and recognizes the full benefits of the use of forest biomass for energy, conservation and responsible forest management. The agencies are also directed to establish clear and simple policies for the use of forest biomass as an energy solution, including policies that reflect the carbon neutrality of forest bioenergy and recognize biomass as a renewable energy source, provided the use of forest biomass for energy production does not cause conversion of forests to non-forest use. Biomass policies are also expected to encourage provide investment throughout the biomass supply chain, including forest bioenergy production.

The Senate Appropriations Committee on Jan. 5 released an explanatory statement that accompanies the EPA appropriations bill. The report does not carry the force of law. Rather, it includes guidance on congressional intent regarding a variety of matters, including those related to the RFS and small refinery exemption (SRE) program.

Regarding the SRE program, the explanatory statement stresses that the EPA may exempt small refineries from compliance with the RFS in certain circumstances, and that small refineries “may at any time petition the Administrator for an extension of the exemption for the reason of disproportionate economic hardship.” The statement also directs EPA to develop policies and procedures for making SRE decisions consistent with a report published by the Government Accountability Office in November 2022.

That GAO report, titled ""Renewable Fuel Standard: Actions Needed to Improve Decision-Making in the Small Refinery Exemption Program,” was slammed as shoddy and obsolete by representatives of the U.S. biofuel industry.

Within the report, the GOA made seven specific recommendations. First, the agency recommended that the EPA reassess its conclusion that small refineries recover their RFS compliance costs in the price of gasoline and diesel they sell. Second, the GAO recommended the DOE develop an approach for consulting on SREs that provides EPA with useful information on disproportionate economic hardship. In addition, the GAO said the EPA should identify and communicate what refineries would need to submit to demonstrate disproportionate economic hardship; develop policies and procedures for making SRE decisions; develop policies and procedures to ensure the agency meets statutory deadlines; and assess the effect of SRE decision timing on the benefit provided to small refineries, as well as the effect on fuel markets, and reconsider petition requirements. The report also encouraged the DOE to develop policies and procedures for its consultation with EPA on SRE petitions.

The explanatory statement also directs the EPA to provide a briefing within 60 days on its proposed actions related to eRINs within the RFS program. In addition, the agency is directed to submit a report to lawmakers within 30 days that is focused on fuel derived from waste plastic or waste tires, including any plans the EPA may have to qualify such fuels as cellulosic biofuel under the RFS.

A separate explanatory statement released on Jan. 5 in conjunction with the portion of the legislative package providing fiscal year 2026 funding for the U.S. Department of Energy notes up to $5 million can be made available to continue supporting the development of new domestically manufactured, low-emission, high-efficiency resident wood heaters.

Lawmakers also specify that the appropriations funding agreement provides up to $5 million to support research and development aimed as advancing the supply of renewable natural gas (RNG), clean hydrogen, and other impactful products form syngas; up to $25 million for algae-related activities; and up to $10 million for research and development of the anaerobic bioproduction of 3-hydroxypropionic acid utilizing existing Midwest ethanol fermentation infrastructure and renewable whole-kernel corn feedstock.

Within the statement, lawmakers also encourage the DOE “to conduct research related to the development, pre-piloting, piloting, and demonstration scale-up of renewable liquefied petroleum gas or alternative fuels production, in parallel with the department’s focus on the scale-up of sustainable aviation fuel technologies.” In addition, the DOE is “encouraged to pursue the advancement and development of pre-commercial, advanced sustainable aviation fuel feedstocks and technologies to include non-biogenic feedstocks and technologies, such as hydrogen-based e-fuels.”

“It also demonstrates our commitment to reliable supply capability and high product quality as customers’ demand for renewable fuel solutions accelerates.
According to the SAF 2050 Outlook report, all the ASEAN countries examined could potentially have sufficient capacity to position themselves as net SAF exporters.
In addition to exporting SAF, ASEAN is predicted to become a significant market for SAF in its own right.","EcoCeres has officially launched its renewable fuel facility in Pasir Gudang, Johor, Malaysia, which the company says is the country’s first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plant. Commissioning and start-up of the plant were successfully achieved in October 2025. The facility also produces hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and renewable naphtha, with a combined maximum production capacity of 420,000 tonnes per year.

Dr. Peter Lee, Chairman of Towngas and Principal of Full Vision Capital, said: “EcoCeres has grown from a laboratory in Hong Kong into one of the world’s leading producers of SAF, and this new Johor plant shows how regional commitment to sustainability can feed into the global search for climate solutions. With supportive government policies and the dedication of all our partners, we can turn the tide on climate change for future generations.”

EcoCeres has developed its own proprietary waste to fuel processes in Hong Kong and successfully scaled them through its first facility in Zhangjiagang, China, which has helped the company become one of the world’s leading SAF producers by volume. “The Johor plant is a major step forward for EcoCeres’ regional platform and for Malaysia’s renewable fuel industry,” said Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres. “It also demonstrates our commitment to reliable supply capability and high product quality as customers’ demand for renewable fuel solutions accelerates. This facility supports Malaysia’s transition towards net-zero while strengthening Hong Kong’s strategic position as a regional hub for financing and scaling sustainable energy projects, enabling the supply of sustainable fuels to global industries. Our waste-to-fuel technology proves that economic growth and environmental stewardship can go hand-in-hand.”

ASEAN could produce 8.5 million barrels of SAF daily by 2050

With the pressing need to decarbonise aviation, ASEAN economies could generate as much as 8.5 million barrels per day of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2050, according to the ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook report.

Download the report here.

The report provides a regional supply chain assessment for 2030, 2040, and 2050, examining potential SAF demand and supply scenarios across Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, as well as import markets including Japan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea (ROK).

The report was developed by GHD through financial support provided by Global Affairs Canada from the Canadian Trade and Investment Facility for Development (CTIF) implemented by Cowater International (Cowater) in association with the Institute of Public Administrators of Canada (IPAC) and Global Affairs Canada, with Boeing as the knowledge partner, and supporting the ASEAN Secretariat.

According to the SAF 2050 Outlook report, all the ASEAN countries examined could potentially have sufficient capacity to position themselves as net SAF exporters. Viet Nam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand have the most abundant feedstock to support SAF production, while Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, may have the most cost-efficient distribution for markets in Japan, Singapore and ROK.

In addition to exporting SAF, ASEAN is predicted to become a significant market for SAF in its own right. The report projects that SAF demand in ASEAN will grow sharply from 15,000 barrels per day in 2030, to over 700,000 barrels per day by 2050. The largest SAF demands are expected to come from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, as well as other Asian economies such as Japan and ROK.

The report also examined different ways of producing SAF. Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) is the most prevalent technology for producing SAF today, costing about twice as much as jet fuel, with the largest cost contributor being feedstock. Alternative Gasification/Fisher-Tropsch (Gasification + FT), and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) pathways could be 4-7 times more expensive, but this gap is expected to reduce as technologies mature and scale up.

Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community, Satvinder Singh, said, “The ASEAN SAF 2050 Outlook confirms our region’s strong comparative advantage on the supply side, particularly in the availability of sustainable bio-feedstocks. At the same time, rising regional and global demand for sustainable aviation fuel presents a clear market opportunity for ASEAN. To fully capitalise on both demand and supply dynamics, ASEAN Member States should work together to scale up production capacity, deploy cost-effective technologies, and establish robust regional trade and market frameworks. By efficiently matching our abundant agricultural resources with growing SAF demand, ASEAN can position itself not only as a self-sufficient and competitive sustainable aviation hub, but also as a reliable energy supplier supporting the decarbonisation of the broader Asia-Pacific aviation and energy markets.”",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_0134.JPG-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-26 21:56:37.048981

Ultimately, Ned recognized that integration success had less to do with aligning systems and more with helping people feel respected, included and confident about their future.
Key insight: Employees commit to leaders who protect dignity and identity, and foster belonging.","Nearly a decade into his career at a fast-growing tech consulting firm, Ned had earned a reputation for discipline and strategic clarity, rising quickly by building the company’s highest-performing division. That success helped put the firm on a larger company’s radar and ultimately led to an acquisition. When the deal closed, Ned thought the toughest work was behind him. But as part of the acquisition, he was offered a generous retention bonus and asked to stay on to lead the integration of the two organizations. On paper, it looked like a straightforward assignment. In reality, it became the defining leadership test of the acquisition and of Ned’s career, revealing how quickly morale can erode when uncertainty and connection go unaddressed.

It began slowly, surfacing a week or so after the acquisition was announced. Employees, emerging from a fog of shock that the organization they grew to love was changing, peppered Ned with questions about what it all meant for their careers. Often, his answers felt inadequate, and Ned struggled to calm the growing angst on the team. In truth, many details of the integration were still in flux, and he didn’t have the information employees were seeking. He worried that telling them so would make things worse, so he avoided such conversations. Eventually, two of his most talented people accepted job offers from competitors. That was a wakeup call.

Key leadership shifts to make

The Seismic Shift in You, a new book by Dr. Michelle Johnston and Dr. Marshall Goldsmith, reinforces an important reality. Leaders who develop deep self-knowledge and strive to put others first are far better equipped to help their teams navigate disruption. The book examines seven important shifts in your leadership thinking and behavior and argues that leadership effectiveness begins with developing a strong internal connection, focused on understanding your priorities, reactions, blind spots and impact on others. This extends to how you structure your time and how you communicate and make others feel, a crucial factor in reinforcing positive morale. Leaders who lack this grounding are more likely to over-reassure, avoid uncomfortable uncertainty or hide behind scripted messaging. In high-pressure moments like acquisitions, those behaviors erode trust and accelerate disconnection.

By their very nature, acquisitions disrupt identity, predictability and a sense of belonging. Employees begin to wonder where they fit, whether their past contributions still matter and whether leadership can be trusted to navigate the uncertainty ahead. Research on post-merger integration shows that when these questions go unanswered, morale declines quietly, engagement weakens and valued talent begins to disengage before leaders ever notice a performance problem.

The lens of Johnston and Goldsmith’s work frames this dynamic as a connection challenge rather than a change-management problem. Simply put, you cannot sustain performance unless you first sustain connection, both within yourself as a leader and with the team depending on you. This is true whether you’re navigating an acquisition or pursuing daily business goals. Leaders who remain grounded in their own values, transparent about what they know and what they don’t and put their people first, create psychological stability for their teams. Leaders who mask their own uncertainty or retreat behind formal messaging accelerate disconnection rather than quell it. More than integration plans, org charts or strategy decks, these human behaviors shape morale and impact acquisition success.

5 lessons to lead better in an acquisition

While the acquisition assignment was tougher than Ned expected, he learned five important lessons that have made him a better leader:

1. You cannot stabilize others if you are not grounded yourself.

Ned realized that his team took emotional cues from him more than from formal announcements. When he felt pressured to project a confidence he did not fully feel, uncertainty spread. As he became more self-aware, acknowledging his own concerns and centering himself in his values, his team felt steadier and more confident.

Key insight: Leadership presence starts with internal stability, not external messaging.

2. Authenticity builds more trust than certainty.

Early on, Ned tried to protect morale by sounding decisive and optimistic. Over time, employees sensed the gap between what he said and what he truly knew or believed. When he shifted to honest, grounded communication, sharing both decisions and uncertainties, trust strengthened.

Key insight: Credibility grows as honesty grows.

3. Connection is a performance lever, not a “soft” priority.

Ned initially treated morale as secondary to meeting integration milestones. He later saw that when people felt disconnected or undervalued, productivity, initiative and collaboration weakened. When he focused on nurturing relationships, listening and creating a sense of belonging, performance rebounded.

Key insight: Sustaining connection is essential to sustaining results.

4. Leaders set the emotional tone, whether they intend to or not.

Ned’s reactions to ambiguity, pressure from the acquiring company, and internal conflict shaped the emotional climate of his team. When he learned to manage his own stress more intentionally, employees felt safer taking risks, raising concerns and staying engaged.

Key insight: Emotional self-management is a leadership superpower.

5. People follow leaders who help them feel seen, valued and secure.

Ultimately, Ned recognized that integration success had less to do with aligning systems and more with helping people feel respected, included and confident about their future. When he focused on recognizing contributions, advocating for his team, reinforcing identity and openly acknowledging the value of the culture they had created together, retention and morale improved.

Key insight: Employees commit to leaders who protect dignity and identity, and foster belonging.

Ned’s experience underscores the challenge of leading in today’s complex world. Acquisitions test not only strategy and execution; they test a leader’s capacity for self-awareness, authenticity and connection. Master that inner work and you’re far more likely to sustain morale and succeed.

The proposed rule was delivered to the OMB by the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service on Dec.17. The OMB website indicates the agency scheduled 16 meetings with industry stakeholders in January to discuss the proposed guidance, with the final meeting held Jan. 23. Representatives of Amp Americas, WM, Fuels America, Continuum Ag, Growth Energy, NATSO/SIGMA, Aemetis Inc., Renewable Fuels Association, POET, National Grain and Feed Association, Clean Fuels Alliance America, RNG Coalition, Pivot Bio, American Soybean Association and Gevo Inc. and were among those to meet with OMB staff regarding the proposed 45Z rule.

According to information posted to the OMB website, the proposed rule was modified during the review process and is now moving forward. The OMB website estimates a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is currently scheduled to be released for public comment in May.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly in 2025 when compared to the previous year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biodieselmagazine/posts/web/2015/05/omb-logo_14313847528429_14314399266097.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 19:56:30.255861

The new system does not directly produce jet fuel but converts carbon dioxide into ingredients that can be upgraded into low‑emissions jet fuel and other carbon‑based products using established industrial processes.
It offers another pathway to generate the materials needed for low‑emissions jet fuel and other carbon‑based products, particularly near large and difficult‑to‑abate sources of industrial emissions.
The next step is to build a 20‑kilowatt pilot system to further validate the technology and demonstrate how it integrates with real industrial carbon‑emission sources.
“This innovation has shown how emissions reduction could go alongside cost efficiency and better energy use,” he said.","The system combines carbon removal and conversion into a single process, reducing the energy use and complexity that limits many existing approaches. The technology is designed with real‑world industrial settings in mind.

Distinguished Professor Tianyi Ma from RMIT’s School of Science said carbon conversion had traditionally been treated as separate steps, increasing cost and slowing progress.

“Current approaches had often been inefficient and energy‑intensive,” Ma said.

“By bringing the steps of conversion together, we have been able to simplify the process and reduce unnecessary energy losses.”

The technology turns carbon dioxide from industrial exhaust gases into basic chemical building blocks that can be used to make jet fuel and other products that are currently made mostly from fossil resources.

The new system does not directly produce jet fuel but converts carbon dioxide into ingredients that can be upgraded into low‑emissions jet fuel and other carbon‑based products using established industrial processes.

A practical role in aviation’s transition

Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. Battery‑powered aircraft are unlikely to serve long‑distance routes at scale, and demand for sustainable aviation fuel continues to exceed global supply.

Rather than replacing existing fuel technologies, the RMIT system is positioned as a complementary option. It offers another pathway to generate the materials needed for low‑emissions jet fuel and other carbon‑based products, particularly near large and difficult‑to‑abate sources of industrial emissions.

Dr Peng Li, lead author of the study, said the research focused on improving efficiency and practicality.

“Our approach has reduced the number of processing steps and lowered energy demand compared with conventional systems,” Li said.

“The RMIT system operates without the need for highly purified carbon dioxide, which is important in real industrial environments.”

The research, published in the international journal Nature Energy, outlines a complete carbon‑conversion system. Independent expert Dr Federico Dattila, from the Polytechnic University of Turin, wrote in Nature Energy that the team’s advances brought industry a step closer to low‑energy systems that can convert CO₂ in a fully integrated process.

Scaling up with industry partners

To ensure the technology can operate outside the laboratory, the team has been working on scaling it up. They have designed and completed a three‑kilowatt prototype system to test performance under industrial conditions.

The next step is to build a 20‑kilowatt pilot system to further validate the technology and demonstrate how it integrates with real industrial carbon‑emission sources.

This scale-up effort is supported by growing industry engagement. The team is partnering with Viva Energy, Hart Bioenergy, T-Power, Aqualux Energy, CO2CRC, ViPlus Dairy and CarbonNet on pilot-scale development and future deployment pathways, helping ensure the technology aligns with emissions reduction goals and existing industrial infrastructure.

Ma said collaboration was essential to moving from research to impact.

“Scaling up has to happen hand in hand with industry,” he said.

“That is the only way to understand what would work in practice and what still needs improvement.”

The research team aims to develop a 100‑kilowatt demonstration system within the next five years and achieve commercial‑scale readiness in around six years. This timeline reflects a staged and realistic pathway for validating performance, cost and durability before wider deployment.

Hart Bioenergy’s chief executive Doug Hartmann said the technology offered both environmental and operational benefits.

“This innovation has shown how emissions reduction could go alongside cost efficiency and better energy use,” he said.

“It points to production processes that can benefit the environment without ignoring economic realities.”",https://www.rmit.edu.au/content/dam/rmit/rmit-images/news/2026/january/carbon-conversion/news-carbon-conversion-research-team-1220px.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 01:57:10.960491

The platform is rapidly advancing toward commercial readiness, positioning Kemvera to support U.S. farmers, underpin domestic manufacturing, and sustain the United States as a global leader in biobased chemical production.
Chemical manufacturing is one of the largest segments of U.S. manufacturing, yet much of the feedstock supply is derived from petroleum.
This, along with renaming to Kemvera, marks a defining moment for our company,” said Chern-Hooi Lim, founder and CEO of Kemvera.
Kemvera’s vision aligns with national priorities for domestic manufacturing, agricultural value-add, and U.S. leadership in advanced materials.","Kemvera, a sustainable chemical innovation company, today announced it has completed the process design package (FEL 1) for its planned 50,000 metric tons per year commercial-scale plant. To support scale-up for this commercial facility, Kemvera completed the design for a 500 metric tons per year pre-commercial demonstration reactor and recently commissioned its 20 metric tons per year pilot reactor and validated its robustness by demonstrating continuous operations. These key steps in process development represent significant progress toward commercialization of Kemvera’s biobased acetic acid and ethyl acetate manufacturing process.

Aligning with the company’s next phase of growth, Kemvera announces that it has been renamed from New Iridium to reflect its vision to scale biobased chemical solutions using domestic agricultural feedstock.

Kemvera’s proprietary catalytic platform converts biobased and CO₂-derived feedstocks, such as domestically sourced corn ethanol, into affordable, drop-in chemicals. The platform is rapidly advancing toward commercial readiness, positioning Kemvera to support U.S. farmers, underpin domestic manufacturing, and sustain the United States as a global leader in biobased chemical production.

Chemical manufacturing is one of the largest segments of U.S. manufacturing, yet much of the feedstock supply is derived from petroleum. According to a 2025 research report, the domestic green chemicals market is projected to reach USD 7.46 billion by 2033, representing a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 7.8% from 2025. To meet this growing demand, Kemvera’s approach integrates partnerships with ethanol producers and agricultural stakeholders to create a vertically connected and sustainable domestic value chain, from Midwest cornfields to industrial end users.

“Having reached these milestones, we are entering a new phase of development that brings us significantly closer to customer delivery. This progress represents the culmination of first-principles-based research and engineering into scalable, affordable chemical production using American-grown feedstocks. This, along with renaming to Kemvera, marks a defining moment for our company,” said Chern-Hooi Lim, founder and CEO of Kemvera.

“The Iowa Corn Promotion Board supports the continued development of biobased chemicals that use domestically grown corn as a feedstock,” said Joe Roberts, President of Iowa Corn Promotion Board, who farms in Belmond, Iowa. “Innovations like this help create new, high-value markets for corn, strengthen rural economies, and build on the success of corn ethanol by expanding domestic bio-manufacturing. Advancing solutions that convert corn into essential industrial products reinforces the role of U.S. agriculture in meeting growing market demand.”

Kemvera envisions the near-term usage of its flagship products, bio-acetic acid and bio-ethyl acetate, in footwear and disinfectants, and later, in a myriad of everyday consumer products. By producing materials from domestic biobased inputs, Kemvera offers chemical customers and brand owners reliable alternatives to fossil-derived products while reinforcing U.S. supply chain resilience.

Kemvera’s vision aligns with national priorities for domestic manufacturing, agricultural value-add, and U.S. leadership in advanced materials. To support this, the company is raising Series A funding and seeking partnerships with ethanol producers, chemical companies and consumer brands. By anchoring production in renewable American agricultural products, the company seeks to unlock new demand for chemicals made with domestically grown crops, like corn, while reducing reliance on imported and fossil-based chemical products.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Kemvera_Jan26_31038db884.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 17:57:24.497567

The orders came from 205 customers in 50 countries. The Company also saw a strong market momentum for its Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) in 2025. In terms of unit bookings, Airbus Helicopters secured a market share of 51% of the civil and parapublic market and its military market share rose to 28%. The Company delivered 392 helicopters in 2025.

“Airbus Helicopters’ outstanding performance in 2025, marked by an order intake increase close to 20% in units, demonstrates that our modern civil and military portfolios are delivering the precise mission capabilities required in today’s complex environment,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “Our focus on defence and security has never been sharper. Furthermore, we are leading the shift toward UAS by integrating Survey Copter into our core operations, establishing a comprehensive range of tactical drones. By combining drones with our advanced and unique HTeaming capabilities, we provide a seamless, networked ecosystem for the modern battlespace. I want to thank our customers for their unwavering trust as we continue to pioneer the future of aerospace,” he added.

The year was defined by major sovereign commitments, most notably from Spain, which placed a landmark order for 100 helicopters—including 50 H145Ms, 31 NH90s for all three branches of the armed forces, and the first orders for the H175M. Germany continued its modernisation by exercising an option for 20 additional H145Ms (bringing the total to 82), with the first helicopters already delivered. Meanwhile, the NH90 programme saw a renewed momentum: the Netherlands added three aircraft to their fleet, Greece signed a critical follow-on support contract, and Germany took delivery of its first NH90 Sea Tiger, the latest evolution for world-leading Anti-Submarine and Anti-Surface Warfare capabilities.

In the heavy segment, the Super Puma family proved its versatility as Greece ordered eight H215s for firefighting. The H225M reached new milestones with Morocco signing a contract for ten H225M helicopters, along with first deliveries to Iraq. The light twin segment was equally robust, with Spain placing an order for 13 H135 helicopters and the UK National Police Air Service ordering seven H135s. With 149 orders, the H145 has once again reaffirmed its position as the best seller on the civil and parapublic and military markets.

Airbus signaled a new chapter in vertical lift at VERTICON 2025 with the unveiling of the H140, a next-generation light twin-engine helicopter. Incorporating techno-bricks like the T-tail configuration, the H140 has already secured 61 firm orders. Innovation also reached new heights with Racer which surpassed its original performance targets to achieve a cruise speed of 440 km/h (240 kts), reaffirming Airbus’ ability to deliver speed with a simpler aerodynamically optimised architecture.

The Company also established a comprehensive tactical drone range by integrating Survey Copter into its core offerings. Airbus signed its first UAS contracts with Drone Forge and the European Maritime Safety Agency opting for Flexrotor and the French Ministry of Armed Forces ordering six VSR700s. Through HTeaming, Airbus is pioneering the crewed-uncrewed teaming with a standalone solution that allows crews to manage uncrewed systems in real-time, multiplying mission capabilities.

This technological leap is mirrored in the H160 programme, which saw its military version, the H160M “Guépard”, complete its maiden flight in July. The H160 confirmed its successful entry into service by securing approximately 50% of the civil and parapublic market share in the medium twin segment. The first H160 in a law enforcement configuration was delivered to the French Gendarmerie Nationale and the programme added firefighting to its mission profiles with a delivery to Hiroshima City Fire Services Bureau and an order from the Nagoya City Fire Bureau. The H160 also began offshore operations for the Energy sector in the U.S. with operator PHI Aviation. The H175 received 15 orders in 2025, solidifying its position in the super medium segment.

To support this unprecedented demand, Airbus Helicopters continued to expand its global industrial base. In 2025, work commenced on a new Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Vemagal, Karnataka, India. To be inaugurated in the coming weeks, this facility will become the world’s fourth H125 FAL, reinforcing Airbus’ commitment to the Indian market and global supply chain resilience.

The acquisition of the 50 jets increases ACG’s Boeing 737 MAX order book to 121, including 50 firm orders for the 737-10, Boeing said in a statement on Jan. 13 (NYSE: BA).
The 50-count order is split evenly between the Boeing 737-8 and 737-10 models, with deliveries scheduled for 2032 and 2033.
ACG says the new fuel can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional aviation fuel.
“All of our aircraft are capable of flying with up to a 50% blend of SAF,” said the environmental report.","Aviation Capital Group has placed an order for 50 Boeing 737 Max jets to be leased out to commercial airlines, as the company sees growing demand for fuel-efficient planes.

Chief Executive Tom Baker declined to specify the price for the 50 new jetliners, though he said a catalog price would be “well in excess of $7 billion.”

“We do not pay catalog list prices. We pay much less than that,” Baker told the Business Journal.

The announcement is another positive signal for the Newport Beach-based firm, which has significantly recovered from the pandemic years when the travel industry was decimated and the Ukraine war, where it recently reported recuperating $545 million in insurance claims after its planes were “stolen” by Russia.

Last year was a “strong market” when it delivered 46 aircraft, the company said at a December presentation at Goldman Sachs 16th Annual Aircraft Leasing Conference.

ACG, as it is commonly called, had approximately 470 owned, managed and committed aircraft as of Sept. 30 that were leased to roughly 90 airlines in approximately 50 countries. The term “committed” refers to aircraft on order.

“We’re about $14 billion dollars in assets under management right now,” Baker said. “We definitely want to be bigger than that.”

‘Our Children’

Baker considers his company’s billions of dollars’ worth of leased-out jetliners as more than just expensive flying machines.

“They’re our airplanes. They’re our assets. We love our children very deeply,” Baker said during a Jan. 20 interview. “We care about their condition and their health.

“We make sure that the lessee takes very, very good care of them and pays for proper maintenance, submits the proper records, keeps the airplane in good condition according to the terms of the lease.”

Its customers range from United Airlines to Air France, Hungary’s Wizz Air, Poland’s LOT, Italy’s ITA and Virgin Australia.

ACG calls itself a major global airplane lessor based in California. Baker said ACG’s biggest competitor is Los Angeles-based Air Lease, which analysts expected to report $3 billion in 2025 sales; it has a $7.1 billion market cap (NYSE: AL).

The acquisition of the 50 jets increases ACG’s Boeing 737 MAX order book to 121, including 50 firm orders for the 737-10, Boeing said in a statement on Jan. 13 (NYSE: BA).

The 50-count order is split evenly between the Boeing 737-8 and 737-10 models, with deliveries scheduled for 2032 and 2033.

The company also has commitments to another 73 planes from Airbus, the European consortium.

The typical first lease is for 12 years, according to the ACG CEO.

“We deliver them an airplane. We help them retrofit the airplane. We finance the costs of that retrofit in the lease,” according to Baker.

In turn, the airlines are responsible for leasing costs, maintenance, crew, insurance and related charges, he said.

Among recent jetliner deliveries, ACG announced on Dec. 26 the delivery of a new Boeing 737 MAX 8 to LOT Polish Airlines.

A month earlier, ACG announced the delivery of its first new Airbus A220-300 to Italian carrier ITA Airways, a new customer for ACG.

ACG says it also provides certain aircraft asset management services and aircraft financing solutions for third parties.

The company has about 135 full-time employees worldwide, with approximately 85 in Newport Beach.

ACG is currently located at 840 Newport Center Drive and will move to 520 Newport Center Drive this year, according to Baker.

Leasing Increasingly Popular

ACG was founded in 1989; Newport Beach-based Pacific Life Insurance Co. in 2005 took a majority stake and, for several years, floated a possible IPO for ACG. However, Pacific Life sold ACG to Tokyo Century Corp. in 2019, where it is now a wholly owned subsidiary.

While the practice of leasing jetliners may be little known to ordinary passengers, it provides more flexibility for the air carriers.

“Airlines have a choice between buying their aircraft or leasing them. Leasing has emerged as the preferred option, rising from roughly 10% of the total fleet in the 1970s to 58% at the end of 2023,” the International Air Transport Association said in 2024.

9-Month Revenue Up Slightly

On Nov. 12, ACG reported total revenues of $934.7 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2025, up slightly from $923.1 million a year prior.

Total pre-tax net income, excluding insurance proceeds, was $124 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2025.

ACG funds its purchases from various sources, including the U.S. bond market and loans from a syndicate of more than 50 banks, according to Baker. It has investment grade ratings of Baa2 from Moody’s and a BBB from S&P Global.

­ACG on Jan. 22 announced the closing of its sale of $1 billion of senior unsecured notes.

The company said it intends to use the net proceeds from the notes for general corporate purposes, including the purchase of commercial aircraft and the repayment of outstanding indebtedness.

ACG Collects $545M in Insurance After Russia ‘Stole’ its Planes

Aviation Capital Group said nine of its jetliners were seized in Russia after Vladimir Putin’s nation invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

ACG CEO and President Tom Baker said at the time that the loss was covered by insurance.

Now, several years later, some major insurance sums have been paid to ACG.

“The key message there is we got made whole, but it took us four years to do it,” Baker said, referring to the aircraft as having been “stolen.”

The company said in November that it had received a net benefit of $544.8 million from the “settlement of insurance claims related to our losses incurred from Russia exposure.”

ACG listed $574.7 million in its annual financial statements as Russia-related losses for 2022. The company also said in the statements that it had incurred “damages in excess of $700 million” from the Russian seizure.

Baker explained that the $700 million figure is the “fully loaded number to include the value of the airplanes, the costs of recovery, lost rent, so on and so forth.”

A Backpack Made from an Airline Seat?

Aviation Capital Group is doing its part to reduce airline pollution by recycling old airline seats into what it calls “stylish, high-quality backpacks.”

“The environmental impact is significant, as aircraft seat leather and life vests are made from durable, high-quality materials designed to withstand tough conditions,” the company’s 2024 annual environmental report said.

“By repurposing them, we extend their lifespan, reduce landfill waste and decrease the demand for new raw materials. This sustainable approach lowers the carbon footprint of traditional manufacturing and contributes to a circular economy.”

The company is also beginning to use “sustainable aviation fuel,” which is a renewable alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. The fuel, known as SAF, is produced from waste oils, agricultural residues and non-food crops.

ACG says the new fuel can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional aviation fuel.

“All of our aircraft are capable of flying with up to a 50% blend of SAF,” said the environmental report. “Both Airbus and Boeing are targeting 2030 for 100% SAF capability and certification.”

The Newport Beach-based company has also invested in the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund and obtained a $550 million senior unsecured term loan with “sustainability-linked terms.”

472, a bill establishing a clean fuel standard in New York, was referred to the state assembly’s environmental conservation committee on Jan. 7.","Dive Brief:

New Mexico’s Environmental Improvement Board voted on Thursday to approve rulemaking for the state’s Clean Transportation Fuel Program after an extensive public hearing process. With the new rules, the regulator threaded the needle between fuel producers eager for a boost to biogas produced on farms and environmental advocates concerned about concentrated animal operations.

The program was created by HB 41, which was signed into law in March 2024. The law required the average carbon intensity of fuels used in the state to decline by 20% by 2030 and 30% by 2040, compared with a 2018 baseline.

New Mexico will be the fourth state to implement a clean fuels program when the CTFP goes into effect on April 1. California was the first when its Low Carbon Fuel Standard took effect in 2011, followed by Oregon and Washington. ​

Dive Insight:

New Mexico is one of the country’s largest producers of fossil fuels, but its biofuels industry is relatively small. When HB 41 was passed, the state had just 16 biogas-producing facilities, according to the American Biogas Council.

The rulemaking process involved multiple public hearings as well as an extensive outreach campaign conducted by New Mexico Environment Department staff. Much of the debate concerning biofuels related to carbon intensity values for certain fuels. Food & Water Watch, one of the primary environmental groups involved in the process, urged regulators not to allow avoided methane crediting.

The policy boosts carbon intensity scores for biogas derived from on-farm manure digesters, which work by concentrating manure in lagoons that are kept in anaerobic conditions and produce methane that’s refined into a fuel-quality gas.

California has included avoided methane crediting in the LCFS for several years, leading to debate during the last update of the program in 2024. Industry groups say the practice is a fair way to acknowledge the methane avoided by capturing the greenhouse gases generated by large amounts of manure on farms, while environmental groups say it unnecessarily incentivizes concentrated animal farming and disincentivizes manure management practices that pollute less than digesters.

To address those concerns, NMED proposed guardrails that would help staff determine in the future if a biogas project seeking credits was actually avoiding methane emissions.

In a statement, Alexa Reynaud, Food & Water Watch’s factory farm organizing manager, offered measured praise for regulators and the guardrails included in the final program.

“New Mexico has taken seriously the reality that programs like the Clean Transportation Fuel Program can perversely incentivize factory farms to pollute,” Reynaud said. “Unfortunately, the risk remains for New Mexico’s program, and more programs like these are popping up every year across the country with even more incentives for factory farms to inundate our communities with even more pollution. No climate programs should reward factory farms for polluting.”

Fuel producers were more upbeat about the program’s finalization and its potential to spur other states to action. Clean Fuels Alliance America, an industry group representing the biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel sectors, praised the rulemaking in a release.

“As the first non–West Coast state to implement a clean fuel standard, New Mexico proves that states with strong energy economies can also lead on clean fuel deployment and market certainty,” said Jeff Earl, director of state governmental affairs for Clean Fuels. “This program adds real momentum to clean fuel standard adoption nationwide.”

Advocates for clean fuels programs have eyed the potential for additional states to adopt such policies in recent years.

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories.
In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said: “The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy.
It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices.
Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category.","The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Hong Kong’s central banking institution, announced the release of the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance Phase 2A, expanding its classification system for identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities to include transition activities, climate adaptation, and a significantly broader range of sectors and economic activities.

The release of the new update follows the launch by the HKMA in May 2024 of its initial Taxonomy, aimed at providing a framework to allow investors to identify and invest in activities that generate a positive impact on the environment, and to avoid those with a negative impact, as well as to align investments with climate goals, and reduce the risk of investing in assets that are not aligned with a low-carbon future.

At the time, the HKMA said that it aimed to use a phased approach to establishing the Taxonomy, adding more sectors and categories over time, and the central bank subsequently launched a consultation on its proposed “Phase 2A” in September 2025.

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories. With the update, the Hong Kong Taxonomy now categorizes climate mitigation activities as Green, indicating that they either already operate at net zero emissions or are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway; Transition, indicating that they are carbon-intensive activities that are on a time-bound decarbonization pathway to align with a 1.5°C trajectory that will ultimately reach net zero in 2050, or; Exclusion, indicating that they are not currently eligible under the Taxonomy, as they are either not aligned with Green or Transition criteria, are incompatible with a 1.5°C future, or are of low climate materiality, with minimal relevance to climate objectives.

In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said:

“The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy. It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices. By defining credible pathways for these sectors to align with net zero goals, the Taxonomy strives to minimise economic disruption in carbon-intensive industries and promote an orderly transition, with a view to balancing environmental imperatives with economic growth.”

The updated Taxonomy introduces two classifications under the Transition category, including “Transition Activity,” which refers to economic activities that are not yet aligned with a 1.5°C pathway but are progressing towards alignment, or enable significant short-term emissions reductions, and “Transition Measure,” referring to specific activity components that could partially improve the emission performance of the activity, such as the purchase of low-carbon energy for aluminum production.

Notably, the criteria utilized for the updated Taxonomy’s transition category include a requirement for the activity to be “time-bound,” with eligibility limited to a prescribed sunset date, which varies by sector and activity based on factors such as technological readiness, environmental impact, and regulatory policies, among others.

Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category. The new category initially includes “adapting measures,” or subcomponents of activities rather than complete standalone activities, such as technologies, processes, materials, practices, or services that positively contribute to the resilience and adaptation of broader activities. The category also launches with a “whitelist” approach, with a curated list of measures that are automatically deemed eligible without the need to meet specific criteria. The HKMA said that in the future, “as global and local understanding of adaptation improve and Hong Kong-specific criteria and thresholds are more robustly established, other more sophisticated assessment approaches… may be explored.”

The update also significantly expands the sectors covered under the Taxonomy from 4 to 6, adding Manufacturing, and Information & Communications Technology, and more than doubles the number of economic activities from 12 to 25, adding activities including transmission and distribution of electricity, district heating and cooling, and low-carbon transport infrastructure, among others.

The HKMA said that development of the next phase of the Taxonomy is already underway, with additional activities such as nuclear and natural gas-fired power generation, hydrogen for electricity generation, sustainable aviation fuel, among others being considered for future development, as well as sectors such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage and waste and wastewater treatment, alongside further work on adaptation and the exploration of the role of “Do No Significant Harm.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hong-Kong-MA.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:57:40.770914

Analysts attribute this trend to structural production inefficiencies and aging infrastructure, which also contribute to high levels of methane emissions and routine gas flaring.
However, emissions increases were still significant, and methane emissions reportedly grew by 25% due to increased flaring at new wells.
This context highlights the tension between maintaining production levels and pursuing emissions reduction.
Its efforts toward energy efficiency and emissions reduction are thus not just corporate priorities but key components of national climate strategy.","PEMEX reported a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency, part of broader efforts to align the NOC with Mexico’s climate commitments and the international energy transition. The plan, outlined in a press release issued by the company on Jan. 21, 2026, aims for a cumulative reduction in energy consumption of nearly 6.1% by 2030 and cuts in emissions of up to 1.8MMt CO₂e annually. These reductions, PEMEX says, would be equivalent to the annual carbon sequestration of roughly 80 million trees or removing more than 500,000 vehicles from circulation.

At the close of 2025, the company reported a total energy consumption of slightly over 500 petajoules (PJ), underscoring both the scale of its operations and the environmental impact associated with them. PEMEX’s strategy combines near-term operational optimizations with longer-term investments in cleaner technologies and energy diversification. It includes improvements in process efficiency, recovery of flare gas, integrated energy and water management, residual heat recovery, efficient cogeneration, and integration of modern thermal systems.

These actions are part of its evolving ESG strategy and are designed not only to reduce direct emissions but also to enhance operational safety and resources use, positioning PEMEX as a potential national leader in energy management. The strategy also incorporates diversification through solar, wind and bioenergy sources, including biofuels, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable natural gas, as well as natural climate solutions such as agroforestry projects and efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and land degradation.

PEMEX highlights a long-term vision that extends into advanced technologies such as electromobility, hydrogen (both blue and green), and carbon capture and storage. These initiatives are intended to support a more orderly energy transition consistent with Mexico’s national goals and PEMEX’s Plan Estratégico 2025–2035, which calls for improved sustainability while maintaining energy security.

Industry Context: Rising Emissions and Methane Challenges

Despite these stated ambitions, recent data paint a more nuanced picture of PEMEX’s environmental performance. The company’s carbon emissions climbed by 15.4% in the third quarter of 2025, reaching their highest levels in nearly three years. Between July and September, PEMEX emitted 16.5MMt CO₂e, following a significant increase in the previous quarter. Analysts attribute this trend to structural production inefficiencies and aging infrastructure, which also contribute to high levels of methane emissions and routine gas flaring.

Methane, a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential many times that of CO₂, has been a particular concern for environmental groups and climate policy advocates. PEMEX and the Mexican Petroleum Institute (IMP) took steps to address this in late 2025 by launching a national methane-reduction program in collaboration with the World Bank, under the global “Burning and Methane Reduction” initiative. This initiative focuses on building capacity for detecting, quantifying and mitigating methane leaks, as well as eliminating routine flaring.

The company’s own sustainability commitments, reaffirmed in 2025 with support from the Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Alliance, include pledges to avoid routine flaring in new oil field developments and to eliminate the practice entirely at existing sites by 2030. These pledges complement Mexico’s broader climate targets embedded in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.

However, achieving these goals remains difficult. High emissions have persisted alongside chronic flaring, often due to a lack of available infrastructure to capture and process associated gas. Industry observers have noted that PEMEX flares nearly 10% of the gas it produces, reflecting both technical bottlenecks and limited investment capacity.

Operational and Financial Pressures

Environmental pressures on PEMEX are compounded by the company’s enduring financial and operational constraints. In its 3Q25 operational report, PEMEX noted improvements in safety and a 4.2% reduction in energy consumption compared with prior periods. However, emissions increases were still significant, and methane emissions reportedly grew by 25% due to increased flaring at new wells. In the same report, industrial safety indicators improved, showing a 17% decrease in accident incidence and a 44% reduction in severity, but environmental concerns remain central.

This context highlights the tension between maintaining production levels and pursuing emissions reduction. PEMEX’s dual mandate — to sustain hydrocarbon output while improving sustainability, places it at the center of Mexico’s broader energy policy debates. Policymakers and industry stakeholders continue to wrestle with balancing energy security, economic priorities, and climate obligations, especially as global climate negotiations call for intensified action.

Mexico’s National Emissions and Climate Commitments

Mexico as a whole has made ambitious climate commitments, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 under its updated NDCs presented at COP30. These targets reflect the country’s pledge to mitigate climate change and transition toward cleaner energy systems. However, the robust growth of fossil fuel industries and continued reliance on hydrocarbon revenues pose challenges to realizing these ambitions.

PEMEX, as one of the largest industrial emitters in Mexico, plays a significant role in shaping the country’s emissions profile. Its efforts toward energy efficiency and emissions reduction are thus not just corporate priorities but key components of national climate strategy. At the same time, the company’s emissions trajectory, with recent increases, underscores the difficulty of reconciling fossil fuel production with climate goals.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/coal-power-plant-high-pipes-with-black-smoke-movin-2026-01-06-10-11-13-utc%20%281%29.jpg?h=62c404c8&itok=vN3Uhvcu,N,,2026-01-26 12:57:45.262087

Over the past year, the global energy landscape has shifted in meaningful ways. Liquefied natural gas, and natural gas overall, gained momentum, while growth in areas like petrochemicals and renewables slowed. Global policy developments shaped how governments and companies make investment and innovation decisions, reinforcing the need for stable, long-term policy frameworks to support next-generation energy solutions.

What became clear in 2025 is that the future will require more energy supply requiring all forms of energy, which includes making traditional fuels more efficient while adding innovative alternative fuels to the mix.

Growing energy demand and evolving regulations will continue to shape 2026. Meeting the global need for more power means expanding energy infrastructure worldwide, which is becoming more challenging. As these systems become increasingly complex, digitalization is emerging as the connective tissue that links infrastructure, data and people. The next phase of progress will be defined by how technology is deployed — not only to cut costs and boost efficiency, but to enable intelligent operations, advance modular solutions and strengthen energy security for responsible growth.

Here are four strategic shifts that will shape the energy sector in 2026.

Digital solutions help meet rising energy demand

Looking ahead, connected solutions — where AI-powered tools are integrated with digitally connected infrastructure — will accelerate the shift of energy companies toward intelligent operations. These tools help strengthen and augment workforce capabilities, extract more value from existing assets, and position energy leaders to meet rising demand with greater confidence. Early adopters are already seeing measurable gains in reliability and workforce efficiency.

Skilled labor constraints remain a challenge as experienced workers retire and turnover stays high. To address this, energy companies are turning to digital solutions that upskill the workforce, maintain reliability and scale operations. AI is playing a critical role, analyzing millions of data points across the plant and using predictive analytics to help optimize performance and prevent downtime in day-to-day operations. It is also empowering junior employees with expertise that would normally take decades to build, helping them handle complex scenarios safely and efficiently.

Digitalization is also helping companies extend the life of existing assets and avoid costly new builds. The focus is shifting toward maximizing reliability and efficiency through predictive maintenance and connected operations. Refineries and petrochemical facilities have spent the past decade laying the groundwork for digitalization, and now advances in 5G, AI and cloud computing are unlocking a new level of operational intelligence. By linking assets and processes across entire enterprises, companies can improve reliability, increase output, reduce energy consumption and minimize equipment wear.

The rapid growth of data centers to power AI is adding pressure to the energy system, driving significant demand for natural gas. But AI can help offset this strain by boosting efficiency and optimizing production. By integrating AI-powered solutions, organizations can better manage energy use, streamline operations and reduce emissions. In 2026, energy leaders will sharpen their focus on where and how to expand capacity. Upgrading and modernizing legacy infrastructure with AI and data-driven systems may prove even more critical than building new facilities to meet global demand.

Energy security moves to the top of the agenda

Connected solutions will play a significant role in supporting energy security, but geopolitical uncertainty — including economic tariffs, sanctions and evolving policies — is driving the need to expand energy sources and infrastructure globally.

To support this expansion, many new projects are being developed in regions where construction and execution can be challenging. Energy leaders are increasingly turning to modular solutions for everything from upgrading and expanding traditional refinery and petrochemical facilities to building new LNG and sustainable aviation fuel plants. Modular solutions are critical in regions where labor and materials are in short supply, but they are also widely sought because they provide certainty in project execution, timelines and budget.

While resources vary by region, advanced technology solutions enable regional expansion and localization efforts by allowing a wider range of feedstocks, like biomass, to be converted into energy sources, supporting global energy security.

LNG expansion offers path to boost energy supply

The global need for responsible energy expansion is driving demand for alternative fuel sources. LNG remains essential to energy security efforts, especially in countries that lack access to traditional fuels and those seeking stable, lower-carbon power options.

To meet this demand, LNG project developers are prioritizing proven, bankable solutions that streamline operations and reduce complexity. Energy producers and operators are investing in process innovation to optimize performance, including end-to-end and modular solutions that can reduce costs and accelerate approval and permitting. This reflects a broader push toward technology-driven efficiency across the value chain.

In 2026, LNG projects will balance increasing scale in the short term with long-term energy needs shaped by shifting global demand. With its lower-carbon profile and transportability, LNG will continue to play a critical role in supporting global energy security.

Regulation is shifting to balance sustainability with economic viability

Broad adoption of alternative fuels remains largely dependent on reducing the cost premium. Policy and technology alignment will be essential to accelerating progress in sectors such as shipping and aviation, where new fuels compete with traditional options on both performance and price.

Making energy alternatives economically viable will require a combination of factors, including technological innovation, lower project costs and supportive regulatory frameworks. Companies that can adapt quickly to changing rules and broaden their portfolio to diversify their energy mix will be well-positioned to lead in a more fluid, policy-driven energy environment.

It can be fraught with hidden trade-offs, making it difficult for ESG leaders to know whether they are truly backing the right solutions in pursuit of their climate goals.

Take aviation, for example. As one of the world’s most difficult sectors to decarbonize, its 2.5% share of global CO2 emissions represents a major challenge for nearly every corporate climate plan. To solve this, the industry developed a solution called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Unlike traditional jet fuel made from crude oil, SAF is produced from renewable sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, and other plant-based materials. Crucially, it’s designed to work with existing aircraft engines, allowing airlines to dramatically reduce their carbon footprint without having to build new planes.

While promising a dramatic reduction in air travel’s carbon footprint, the well-intentioned race to scale this “green” fuel has created a dangerous paradox, leading companies down a path that risks undermining the goals they are trying to achieve.

THE HIDDEN FLAW IN GREEN JET FUEL

SAF has quickly become the poster child for sustainable flight, as it cuts an aircraft’s lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. However, the way we scale SAF matters just as much as the volumes we achieve. Many of today’s biofuels rely on crops grown on arable land, creating direct competition with food production and increasing the risk of deforestation and biodiversity loss.

This is the hidden flaw in the first wave of green jet fuel. When the same land that could grow food or support forests is converted for use in jet fuel, claims of sustainability become less convincing. This approach risks incentivizing solutions that reduce carbon emissions on spreadsheets while increasing the social and environmental risks in reality.

At the same time, no one should underestimate the scale of aviation’s challenge. Industry roadmaps state that to align with net-zero targets by 2050, the sector will need hundreds of millions of tons of SAF per year, compared to only a few million tons produced per year today. We must choose the right path to close that gap over the next quarter-century.

The world generates an enormous amount of waste every year, from used cooking oil and animal fats to agricultural residues such as corn cobs, straw, and empty fruit bunches. Much of this material is mismanaged, leading to open burning, water contamination, and methane emissions as organic waste decomposes. Turning this waste into fuel tackles two problems at once: it avoids methane and pollution from unmanaged waste, and it displaces fossil fuels in sectors like aviation.

FROM PILOT TO SCALE: PROOF IN THE REAL WORLD

The key question for any sustainability solution is simple: Can it scale?

For waste-based SAF, the answer is increasingly yes. At EcoCeres, our first large-scale renewable fuels plant in Jiangsu, China—which launched in 2021—demonstrated that industrial-scale production of SAF from 100% waste oils is commercially viable, with a capacity of around 350,000 tons per year.

Now, that model is scaling. In January 2026, we officially opened our new production facility in Johor, Malaysia. With 420,000 tons of annual renewable fuel capacity, it’s one of the country’s first dedicated SAF facilities and it effectively doubles EcoCeres’ SAF production capability. The plant utilizes 100% waste-based feedstocks, supported by a strategy that secures used cooking oil and other residues across Asia. Its circular model is demonstrated by facilities certified under leading industry bodies like ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification) and CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). It has moved beyond pilots and is now delivering at industrial scale, proving the viability of truly circular SAF.

SAF AS A GATEWAY TO CREDIBLE NET-ZERO FOR BUSINESS

For many global companies, business travel and air freight form a substantial share of their carbon emissions. Without a scalable, credible source of SAF, corporate net-zero pledges risk becoming aspirational rather than actionable.

It’s clear that a more sophisticated standard for green fuel is needed. Three simple criteria can guide better decisions:

Feedstock integrity: Does the fuel rely on 100% waste and residue-based feedstocks that do not compete with food or high-value ecosystems?

Verified lifecycle impact: Does it achieve high lifecycle emissions reductions validated by robust, third-party certification schemes aligned with global standards?

Circular and local co-benefits: Does the solution tangibly reduce local pollution and create sustainable economic opportunities in the regions where waste is collected?

Applying these tests can differentiate between models that simply shift problems elsewhere and circular solutions that create compounded benefits.

CLOSE THE LOOP ON GLOBAL MOBILITY

The concept of a circular economy has successfully reshaped countless industries. For years, however, global aviation has remained a critical open loop. A truly circular, waste-based SAF model can help us finally close the loop on global mobility.

This is not a distant dream. As we’ve demonstrated, the technology is already proven and operating at scale. Global studies confirm that underutilized waste streams can support the production of hundreds of millions of tons of sustainable fuel, more than enough to bridge the current supply gap. As more of the world’s waste is brought into productive use, the idea of flying on circular fuel moves from promising pilot to practical reality.

For the business leaders and ESG teams asking, “How can we do better?” this presents a clear and actionable path. By championing a higher standard for the fuels they endorse, they can help transform one of the world’s most difficult climate challenges into a story of innovation and opportunity. If we can turn the world’s waste into the world’s jet fuel, then every business trip, shipment, and journey can be part of the solution, not the problem.

The plant is running at around 95% of its nameplate capacity, Ecoceres CEO Matti Lievonen said at an inauguration event for the plant, which opened in October.

Ecoceres, jointly controlled by Hong Kong's city gas company Towngas and U.S.-based Bain Capital, exported its first SAF cargo from the plant in December, to Europe, which Lievonen said accounted for the major part of demand.

It also has an eye on Asia as countries such as Singapore, South Korea and Japan start rolling out mandates for the green aviation fuel. Malaysia itself is exploring a possible 1% SAF blending mandate.

Ecoceres, which has operated a separate biofuel plant in east China since 2021, now directly supplies airlines such as Air New Zealand, Qantas, Air France and Lufthansa rather than going through traders, Lievonen said.

Feedstock has mostly been procured from China, Malaysia and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, he added.

Ecoceres' Zhangjiagang plant, which can produce up to 350,000 tpy of SAF and HVO, won government export quotas last year as China began regulating its nascent SAF market, Lievonen said.

What is Agentic AI and how does it differ from generative AI?

Since 2022, there has been an explosion in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) affecting how we work and communicate. Most people have become familiar with one form of AI called generative AI, encompassing chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini and image generators such as DALL-E, Midjourney.

These systems are fundamentally reactive, needing an input or a prompt to generate an output. A new system, however, is beginning to gain traction – agentic AI.

By contrast, agentic AI is a proactive system. Agentic AI, like generative AI, begins with a prompt; however, this is used to pursue objectives through multiple actions. All with limited human involvement, it acts like a proactive assistant rather than a reactive tool.

Airports and their complex operations are the reasons why Agentic AI”

The cycle of agentic AI follows as:

Perception is the starting point. The AI gathers information from its surroundings using sources such as sensors, application programming interfaces, internal databases or direct interaction with users. This ensures the system is working with current and relevant data before taking any action.

Reasoning follows once information has been collected. The AI analyses the data to understand meaning, context and intent. Using capabilities such as natural language processing, computer vision and pattern analysis, it interprets inputs, identifies relationships and determines what is happening within the wider environment.

Goal setting defines what the AI is trying to achieve. Based on user instructions or predefined objectives, the system establishes clear goals and outlines a plan to reach them. This planning stage may rely on decision logic, reinforcement learning or structured problem-solving methods.

Decision-making involves evaluating possible actions and selecting the most effective option. The AI compares outcomes based on criteria such as efficiency, accuracy, reliability and expected impact, using probabilistic models or machine learning techniques to guide its choice.

Execution is where decisions are put into action. The AI carries out tasks by interacting with external systems, triggering automated processes, updating records or responding directly to users as required.

Learning and adaptation occur after actions are completed. The AI assesses results, gathers feedback and adjusts its behaviour to improve future performance. Over time, this enables the system to handle similar tasks more effectively.

Orchestration ensures that multiple agents and systems work together smoothly. Orchestration frameworks manage workflows, co-ordinate resources, monitor progress and handle exceptions, allowing large numbers of agents to operate collaboratively at scale.

Watch an in-depth explainer here:

What impact will agentic AI have on airports?

Airports and their complex operations are the reasons why Agentic AI will transform the industry and boost efficiency. When a passenger travels through an airport, they are travelling through a highly interconnected system. There are many touch points they will come across: parking, checking in, baggage, security, retail, and boarding. These processes are all linked, though involve multiple independent stakeholders such as airlines, airports, ground handlers, regulators, and service providers, each controlling different parts of the passenger journey.

All with limited human involvement, it acts like a proactive assistant rather than a reactive tool”

On top of this, airports generate vast volumes of real-time event data, from check-ins and security throughput to aircraft movements, weather updates, and transport flows, which change continuously and require rapid responses. Delays of even a few minutes can disrupt, a challenge historically worsened by siloed data and limited information sharing. Agentic AI, leveraging modern cloud and data platforms, provides a way to connect these dots, enabling faster, smarter, and more coordinated decision-making across the entire airport ecosystem.

Below are some areas where agentic AI could impact and benefit the airport:

Highly dynamic environments: Airports manage constantly changing variables including flight schedules, passenger flows, baggage handling, and ground transport. Small delays can cascade into larger operational disruptions.

Multiple stakeholders: Airlines, ground handlers, security authorities, retailers, and regulators all operate independently, making co-ordination complex. Agentic AI can act as a bridge, aligning decisions across these groups.

Real-time data everywhere: Sensors, check-ins, baggage scanners, aircraft movements, and weather feeds generate massive streams of information. AI agents can process this data instantly to make timely, informed decisions.

Personalised passenger experience: Agentic AI can anticipate passenger needs by integrating airline preferences, travel history, and real-time conditions. Passengers could receive proactive guidance on security queues, gate changes, transport connections, and even personalised offers in lounges or retail areas.

Frictionless travel through automation: AI agents can orchestrate identity verification, boarding, and baggage handling using biometrics, reducing the need for paper documents and manual intervention.

Proactive disruption management: When delays or disruptions occur, agentic AI can automatically rebook passengers, optimise staffing, redirect flows, and communicate updates, reducing chaos and improving recovery times.

Connected, intelligent operations: By linking disparate systems and stakeholders, agentic AI transforms airports from reactive, siloed environments into adaptive, co-ordinated ecosystems that respond intelligently to real-world events.

Early adopters

Agentic AI is set to transform airports by turning complex, fragmented operations into connected, intelligent ecosystems. Airports that adopt these technologies early will gain a significant advantage, improving efficiency, resilience, and overall passenger satisfaction while redefining the travel experience.

Adani Airport Holdings Limited (AAHL), a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Limited and India’s largest operator of Public Private Partnership airports, is an early adopter, having already announced a strategic partnership with AIONOS, to implement a multilingual, omni-channel AI solution across its airport network.

The collaboration will see Agentic AI platform deliver personalised, real-time assistance to passengers via voice, chat, web and mobile interfaces. The system will operate in multiple languages, including English, Hindi and regional dialects, and will be available 24/7 to provide flight updates, gate information, baggage status, directions and other airport services.

Another early adopter includes VINCI Airports is trialling a virtual assistant powered by agentic artificial intelligence at Lyon Airport. Developed by startup Jumbo Mana, the 3D avatar provides real‑time information to passengers and responds to their questions. The system uses advanced AI and lifelike animation to create a realistic, human‑like interaction.

To explore these possibilities firsthand, join us at the International Airport Review Breakfast Briefing at Crowne Plaza, London Docklands on 18 March 2026. The event will showcase high-value use cases, demonstrate Agentic AI in action, and provide insights on how to implement these solutions effectively. Don’t miss this opportunity to network with industry peers, gain practical knowledge, and position your airport as a recognised innovator in the future of airport operations.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2671234705.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:58:02.712776

Although the binding term sheet provides that certain provisions are binding on the parties, it does not obligate the parties to consummate the proposed transaction.","HOUSTON & SACRAMENTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq: SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”), and DevvStream Corp. (Nasdaq: DEVS) (“DevvStream”), a leading carbon management and environmental-asset monetization firm, today announced that they have agreed to a binding term sheet to combine Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”) (together, the “Parties”) in a three-party merger.

If the Parties are able to successfully negotiate a definitive agreement, the Parties believe the combined entity will form an integrated platform of complementary assets, with the opportunity to deploy a disciplined and proprietary environmental attribute and credit generation strategy across North America and emerging markets. The binding term sheet establishes a framework for collaboration and mutual understanding among the Parties.

The proposed transaction is intended to reinforce the development of a low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF via HEFA, e-methanol, e-methanol-to-jet fuel pathways, expand domestic production capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering. As part of the evaluation and negotiation of the definitive transaction agreement, the Parties plan to explore opportunities for integrating small modular reactor (“SMR”) nuclear power with electro-sustainable aviation fuel (“eSAF”), AI data center power, and associated environmental attribute structures.

Entry into definitive transaction agreements is subject to review and approval by the Boards of Directors of the respective companies. As part of the binding term sheet, an investor has agreed to purchase shares of XCF to fund near-term operations and, critically, to complete targeted upgrades and modifications at XCF’s New Rise Reno refinery. These funds are intended to be used to:

complete required mechanical, electrical, and process upgrades,

procure catalyst, utilities, and supporting infrastructure,

finalize commissioning and reliability improvements, and

conduct certain shareholder relations activities related to the updates and modifications at XCF’s New Rise Reno refinery.

The ultimate objective of the incremental funding is to bring the New Rise Reno facility into sustained commercial production and support the ramp-up of SAF output.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF commented: “We are excited to formalize a proposed final structure with DevvStream and Southern on what we believe will be a very accretive and excellent opportunity. We believe this combination has the potential to further validate the value XCF brings to the SAF industry while increasing shareholder value and providing alternative clean fuel opportunities. If consummated, this merger has the potential to solidify our footprint in North America as the supreme SAF producer.”

Sunny Trinh, Chief Executive Officer of DevvStream commented: “We believe the next phase of SAF adoption will favor U.S.-based platforms that can move quickly, operate at scale, and better integrate environmental attributes into the fuel value chain to support project economics and customer confidence. If progressed, this merger would bring together complementary strengths—XCF’s scale and speed-to-market, Southern’s biomass feedstock focus, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset capabilities—with the shared objective of building a globally competitive low-carbon fuels platform grounded in real operating execution.”

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern Energy Renewables added: ""Southern’s approach is centered on sustainable biomass feedstocks and scalable fuel pathways, and we see meaningful potential in combining that focus with XCF’s production footprint and ability to accelerate commercialization. Subject to completing the necessary documentation, and approvals, we believe this collaboration could create a U.S.-based platform that can compete globally.”

He warned “without regulation, there is no market” for costly biofuels and criticised the jump from 2% SAF in 2025 to 6% in 2030 as “forcing overinvestment for a limited market.”

While airlines push for more SAF and accuse TotalEnergies of underinvesting, Pouyanné said the company could supply 10% SAF by 2030, but that would come at a cost. He fears weakened targets will strand biorefinery assets. He argued that solar and wind abatement costs around US$200 per ton of CO₂, compared with US$350–400 for biofuels, calling for a focus on “the most affordable and sustainable as possible.”

Power plant outages in eastern US during gas supply squeeze and freezing weather

A major winter storm and constrained gas supplies have forced about 21 GW of generation offline in the PJM interconnection (roughly 16% of an average Sunday demand), hence triggering pre‑emergency load curtailments and record‑high spot prices. Power prices in the PJM interconnection, New York and New England jumped to US$400–US$700/MWh, with Dominion’s Virginia zone briefly spiking above US$1,800/MWh compared to US$200/MWh the prior morning.

New England met nearly 40% of demand with oil-fired plants, while gas fell to 30%, resulting in rapidly eroding reserve margins. PJM now forecasts a new winter peak of 147.2 GW, surpassing the previous record of 143.7 GW set in January 2025, driven by data centre loads, leaving nearly 1 million customers without power across several Southern and Mid‑Atlantic states. Grids warned that prolonged cold and fuel logistics could deepen reliability risks.

Chilean regulator fines Antofagasta’s Centinela mine for “non-compliance”

Chile’s environmental regulator (SMA) fined Antofagasta’s Centinela copper mine ~$775,000 for “minor” violations of water management rules tied to its El Tesoro project following a prior inspection from 2019–2020. SMA found the company failed to properly track water resources, kept no records for the exploration well “LE-1”, and did not measure flows at the “La Cascada” spring as frequently as required under its environmental impact study and monitoring plan.

Antofagasta said it is reviewing the decision, stressing that the SMA resolution “marks the conclusion of a process in which Minera Centinela (Centinela Mine) has actively and transparently collaborated with the authorities” and “reaffirming its commitment to environmental compliance and the sustainable development of its operations.”

A review finds Bangladesh electricity deals add billions to power costs

Bangladesh’s National Review Committee has found that power contracts signed under the 2010 “Speedy Increase of Power and Energy Supply” Act entrenched “organised corruption,” contributed to ~25% higher electricity tariffs, and left the country with around 9,500MW of overcapacity and large annual fiscal losses.

In its review of the Bangladesh Power Development Board’s 25‑year 1,496MW power purchase agreement (PPA) with Adani Power, the committee reported “extensive corruption” indications, including “unusual transactions” to foreign accounts coinciding with the deal. It concluded that the coal pricing formula is based on Indonesian and Australian indices, resulting in Adani Power being 85% more expensive than other Indian imports in 2024.

The panel recommended either renegotiating the coal price or cancelling the Adani contract if talks fail, while leaving any final decision to the next elected government.

India’s leadership seeks to ensure that the global energy transition remains just, inclusive, and equitable.
India Energy Week has quickly established itself as one of the world’s most consequential energy platforms, and the 2026 edition will reflect India’s “energy abundance” mindset.
India Energy Week provides a space where policy, industry, technology, and investment converge.
It reflects the complexity of India’s energy transition and the confidence with which it is being managed, pragmatically, inclusively, and at scale.","India’s approach to a resilient energy future is centred on availability, affordability, and sustainability. As the world’s fastest-growing major economy, its energy demand is rising at nearly three times the global average, and India is expected to account for around 25% of global energy demand growth over the next two decades.

To manage this responsibly, under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India has built its strategy on four strong pillars. The first is diversification of supplies. The country has expanded its crude oil import basket from 27 countries in 2014 to over 40 countries today, insulating the economy from global volatility. The second pillar is affordability for the common citizen. Despite significant global price shocks, India is among the few countries where fuel prices have declined over the last three years. This has been achieved through calibrated tax interventions and proactive management by public sector oil marketing companies.

Third, India is steadily transitioning towards a gas-based economy. Natural gas is viewed as a critical bridge fuel, and efforts are underway to raise its share in the energy mix from about 6% today to 15% by 2030 through rapid expansion of pipelines, LNG terminals, and city gas distribution networks.

The fourth pillar is the biofuel revolution, which has emerged as a clear success story. India achieved 10% ethanol blending ahead of schedule and is firmly on track to reach 20% by 2025, five years ahead of the original target. Together, these measures enable rapid economic growth while keeping energy secure, affordable, and progressively cleaner.

India is no longer a passive participant in the global energy system. Today, it is a structural growth engine and an increasingly important stabilising force. India sees its role as that of a global bridge, connecting producers and consumers, the developed world and the Global South, and traditional energy systems with emerging clean technologies.

Initiatives such as the Global Biofuels Alliance, which now brings together over 29 countries and 14 international organisations, demonstrate how India is helping to create sustainable and circular energy economies at scale.

Similarly, the India–Middle East– Europe Economic Corridor reflects India’s vision of integrated energy, trade, and digital infrastructure, with clean fuels such as green hydrogen at its core.

Most importantly, India brings a balanced and realistic voice to global energy conversations. For 1.4 billion Indians, and for billions across the developing world, energy security is not solely about decarbonisation. It is about development with dignity. India’s leadership seeks to ensure that the global energy transition remains just, inclusive, and equitable.

Green hydrogen represents one of the most significant opportunities for India. Under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the country is targeting annual production of 5 million metric tonnes by 2030, with the potential to scale further as export markets develop. Capacities for electrolyser manufacturing and hydrogen production are already being awarded, positioning India as a competitive global hub for green molecules.

Beyond hydrogen, India is making strong progress across several other key areas. Compressed bio-gas is one example, with more than 130 plants already operational and many more under development, converting agricultural waste into clean energy while generating additional income for farmers.

India is also accelerating work on sustainable aviation fuel to decarbonise one of the hardest-to-abate sectors, as well as on second-generation ethanol and waste-to-energy projects that combine technological innovation with social and environmental benefits.

Digitalisation is another important enabler. The use of AI, data analytics, and advanced monitoring systems is improving efficiency across exploration and production, refining, and the rapidly expanding city gas distribution networks. When aligned with policy and scale, technology becomes a powerful driver of transition.

India Energy Week has quickly established itself as one of the world’s most consequential energy platforms, and the 2026 edition will reflect India’s “energy abundance” mindset.

The event will move beyond a simplistic division between traditional and renewable energy. Instead, it will showcase how India is greening its conventional energy sectors through efficiency improvements and emerging solutions, while simultaneously scaling up the fuels and technologies of the future.

India Energy Week provides a space where policy, industry, technology, and investment converge. It reflects the complexity of India’s energy transition and the confidence with which it is being managed, pragmatically, inclusively, and at scale.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/30lfauj2/170a4236-2.jpg?rxy=0.45709959623149393,0.12179717602203607&width=1200&height=628&v=1dc8c5883201200",N,,2026-01-26 03:57:15.096044

Airlines may be surprise beneficiaries of the popularity of weight loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro thanks to increased profits as a resut of lower fuel costs.

Analysts from Wall Street investment bank Jefferies have calculated that if weight loss trends continue, a 10 per cent slimmer society could yield an average 4 per cent increase in earnings per share among major US airlines.

“A slimmer society = lower fuel consumption,” equities analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu wrote. Fuel makes up 20 to 30 per cent of an airline’s cost, which is reflected in the price of the ticket.

Since 2022, the US adult obesity rate has declined to 37 per cent from about 40 per cent, as GLP-1 appetite and blood sugar regulator drugs reshape the population.

“With the drug now available in pill form and obesity rates falling, broader usage could have further implications for waistlines,” wrote Kahyaoglu, who noted that until GLP-1, passenger weight had been out of the control of many people.

Looking at airlines American, Delta, United and Southwest, her team calculated that a 10 per cent slimmer US society would mean a 2 per cent weight saving, which could trim fuel expenses by up to 1.5 per cent. This would add an average of 3.9 per cent in earnings per share across the four airlines.

Aviation company Honeywell estimates that every 450 grams of a plane’s weight, “including crew, passengers, baggage and the aircraft itself”, totals up to about $US10,000 ($14,436) in annual fuel costs on commercial aircraft.

Sydney-based Peter Harbison, chairman of GreenerAirlines.com, which promotes a greener aviation industry, said that when the GLP-1 drugs were rolled out, there was an expectation once-obese customers could begin to travel, leading to a rise in demand.

“Airlines had already factored in heavier passenger weight years ago,” he said.

“I think the drugs’ impact would be marginal for the weight of aircraft in the short-to-medium term, given there are so many other variables,” Harbison said. “But if you were getting up to 1 per cent of the cost of the flight, it makes a difference.”

In Australia, about 32 per cent of the population was obese in 2022, according to the Bureau of Statistics.

The reported use of the weight loss drugs in the US is higher as well, rising from 5.8 per cent of US adults in early 2024 to 12.4 per cent today.

As of 2025, about 2 per cent of Australians were taking Ozempic and similar GLP-1 drugs. Nearly half of the doses were bought privately.

Aviation lecturer Salim Hijazeen, of Melbourne’s Swinburne University, cautioned that GLP-1s were unlikely to make more than a scant difference to airlines.

“Generally, airlines would try and focus on fuel optimisation more than wanting to plan around what the potential health trends of the population are,” he said.

“It’s very unlikely that something like this could significantly impact the weight of the aircraft in terms of the passenger weight,” he said.

Jefferies’ analyst Kahyaoglu calculated her forecast by combining the weight of 178 passengers aboard a Boeing 737 Max 8, with average pre-Ozempic weight per person being 81.6 kilograms. Factoring in the number of people who take drugs such as Ozempic and their impact, the same passengers’ weight was tallied at an average of 80.7 kilograms.

The former yielded a maximum take-off weight of 82,190 kilograms vs 80,737 kilograms post use of weight loss drugs – a difference of 1453 kilograms.

What's happening?

A new study, published in the journal Environmental Chemistry and Ecotoxicology, examined the presence of Tire Wear Particles at the Milan Linate Airport in Italy.

Tire wear particles, or TWPs, are non-exhaust pollutants that shed from tires as they move across pavement.

Researchers found that the airport was a significant local source of hazardous organic compounds, specifically benzothiazole (BTH) components, which can be released from TWPs.

They discovered several types of BTH — which is used to produce antifreeze, de-icing solutions, and pesticides, among other industrial applications — in outdoor air, at levels comparable to those in cities with heavy traffic.

Why is this study concerning?

According to the researchers, this study provided the first evidence of benzothiazoles in atmospheric particulate matter at an airport.

They described the compounds as ""irritant, corrosive, and acutely toxic to living organisms.""

A summary of the research published by News-Medical.net noted that the risk of occupational exposure to BTHs at Milan airport was low.

However, this study helps researchers better understand the environmental impacts of air travel.

For years, scientists have known that airplane exhaust contains harmful air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

In fact, a 2010 study estimated that aircraft exhaust kills about 8,000 people annually.

Plus, air travel is a major contributor to the overheating of the planet, accounting for about 2.5% of global carbon dioxide pollution and about 4% of warming to date.

What's being done about it?

Airlines and experts have made several exciting advancements that could make air travel more eco-friendly in the future.

For instance, Delta is partnering with JetZero to overhaul its aircraft design, aiming to improve fuel efficiency by 50%.

And one group of scientists discovered that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel could reduce pollution by up to 90%.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pollution-1124240831.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 03:57:45.892578

by Senator Ken Rozenboom

Friends, occasionally I write a newsletter devoted to a single important issue facing us at the Capitol. This is one of those times, and the issue at hand is the ongoing controversy regarding property rights vs. carbon pipelines. Here is my view.

Pipeline Solutions

For several years we in Iowa have been pulled apart by policies established in Washington DC. In this case, I’m referring to massive tax credits for low carbon ethanol and the need for a carbon sequestration pipeline. Of course, that has led to a contentious five year debate over property rights in Iowa. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can find a way forward…we must find a way forward. I believe there is a win-win solution.

We are at an inflection point in Iowa. In 2004, American farmers raised the first 10 billion bushel corn crop. In 2025 American corn farmers produced a 17 billion bushel corn crop, a 70% increase in 21 years. Remarkable!

But in 2025 Iowa farmers lost over a dollar for every bushel of corn raised which translates to a $2.9 billion loss for Iowa farmers. Soybean prices also remain well under the cost of production, representing an additional $1 billion loss. And all that translates into an unhealthy agricultural economy and a large hole in the Iowa annual state budget.

So how do we sell 17 billion bushels of corn? Well, that can be a problem. Traditional markets for corn have been reliable over that last 25 years. Livestock feed markets remain strong in Iowa. Fructose syrup production has been steady, but recent policy changes in Washington relative to the American diet threaten that. Corn exports have been variable over the last 25 years. The only growing market since that first 10 billion bushel corn crop has been ethanol. Thankfully the ethanol market demand for corn has increased from around 1 billion bushels per year to 5.3 billion bushels. Over one half of Iowa’s corn production now goes into ethanol.

Meanwhile Brazil has greatly improved their agriculture infrastructure, and corn and soybean production has increased dramatically. Because their climate allows double-cropping, Brazilian farmers can produce corn and soybean 30% cheaper than we can. Those dynamics have allowed Brazil to become the dominant exporter of corn and soybeans, pushing American farmers into a secondary role.

It’s clear that Iowa’s farmers face a tough future unless we can find a way to develop new markets. And obviously, as Iowa agriculture goes, so goes Iowa’s economy. This is critical!

There are several potentially large new markets for low carbon intensity ethanol. The most promising new market is the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). But that requires ethanol that has the low carbon intensity score as established by the airline industry and the federal 45Z tax credits. Hence, the need for carbon sequestration and pipelines to move the carbon. Currently SAF is being made only from imported Brazilian ethanol which has the required low carbon score. Recently, the state of Nebraska has been aggressively gearing up to produce low carbon intensity ethanol that will allow it to develop a SAF industry, and their corn producers will benefit greatly. Iowans don’t like to lose to Nebraska on the football field. We certainly don’t want to lose the corn production battle to them!

There are other promising new value-added uses for carbon such as its use for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). It’s hard to imagine anything that is more in the public interest for the Iowa economy than a CO2 pipeline that allows our state to meet the demand of these new markets.

So how do we move forward? How do we restore profitability to Iowa’s farmers while providing even better property rights protections for landowners? What is the win-win solution?

Let’s update Iowa’s outdated property rights provisions. Let’s widen the corridor for possible projects so that they can obtain voluntary easements from willing landowners and go around unwilling landowners. These features are included in Senate File 2067.

Please remember that 74% of the Summit pipeline route has been obtained from 1400 landowners that do recognize the need for Iowa to produce low carbon intensity ethanol. Their property rights must also be respected.

Once we move forward with infrastructure that will allow for the capture and the transport of carbon, as Nebraska has, we can build some very significant value-added new markets for our corn.

Most Iowans dislike how much Washington meddles in our affairs. For example, I’ve never met a farmer that liked getting a subsidy check from Washington. I’ve also never met a farmer that didn’t cash the check. This time the subsidy is in the form of a tax credit for low carbon intensity ethanol. It’s time for Iowa to cash the check.

The essential question is this: Which sign do we put up on Iowa’s borders? “Open for Business” or “Going Out of Business”? For me, the answer is obvious.",http://oskynews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/45643633-ecf4-4854-9c8e-effa5929dad0.png,N,,2026-01-26 03:59:00.010300

Under this plan, fuel suppliers could be required to provide SAF‑blended aviation fuel at airports across Japan. The policy framework is being developed through official councils and is expected to be finalised by fiscal year 2026, backed by revisions to the Airport Law and related regulations.

Japan’s SAF initiatives are rooted in government targets and council discussions aimed at decarbonising the air transport sector, including a 10 per cent SAF blending target by 2030 and incentives for SAF production and supply chain investment. These targets and strategic frameworks are outlined in official government planning documents and policy proposals from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT).

What Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Is and Why It Matters

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced from biomass, used cooking oil, waste fats or other low‑carbon feedstocks. SAF has the same technical properties as regular aviation fuel and can be blended with conventional jet fuel without modifying aircraft engines or airport fuel infrastructure. Official documents show SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent, helping aviation meet international emissions commitments.

Even though SAF offers strong environmental benefits, its production costs remain approximately two to four times higher than fossil jet fuel. This price gap has historically limited wide adoption by airlines without policy support.

Government Policy Framework and Subsidy Plans

Japan’s government is advancing a policy framework that could:

• Subsidise SAF procurement costs for domestic airlines.

• Require fuel suppliers to incorporate SAF into aviation fuel blends offered at Japanese airports.

• Expand feedstock collection — including used cooking oil — through cooperation with municipalities and industry partners.

These plans are being developed through government‑industry councils such as the Public‑Private Council for the Promotion of SAF, which are part of official policy documents released by METI and MLIT discussing SAF supply expansion and regulatory goals.

Advantage: Reduced Carbon Emissions and Greener Flights

For travellers, the biggest advantage of Japan’s SAF support policy is cleaner aviation with lower carbon emissions per flight. SAF use helps airlines reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing flight performance. By subsidising SAF costs and potentially requiring blended fuel at the pump, Japan positions itself to lead in environmentally responsible aviation in Asia.

This also enhances Japan’s attractiveness as a destination for environmentally conscious travellers, particularly those who prioritise low‑carbon travel options when choosing flights and airlines.

Advantage: Strengthening Domestic SAF Production and Economy

Government backing could stimulate local SAF industry growth, encourage private investment, and create jobs in fuel production, feedstock collection and processing. Official policy discussions include capital investment support and tax incentives aimed at building domestic SAF facilities and supply chains. This could reduce dependence on imported fuel and stabilise fuel supply for airlines.

Disadvantage: Higher Costs May Affect Airfares

A key disadvantage for travellers is the potential rise in ticket prices. To cover subsidised SAF procurement, Japan’s proposal may require airlines to pass part of the cost to passengers as a fuel surcharge of several tens of yen per ticket. This means travellers could face slightly higher fares, especially on long‑haul flights where fuel costs are a larger share of expenses.

Disadvantage: Implementation Complexity and Timing

Policy development and implementation — including airport fuel blend mandates and legal revisions — could take time. Full rollout of blended SAF at all airports may be gradual, meaning travellers may not see immediate benefits. Regulatory complexity and coordination between airlines, refineries, and government agencies can slow progress, potentially delaying widespread SAF use.

Practical Tips for Travellers

• Be aware that ticket pricing may include SAF‑related fuel charges.

• Check airline sustainability initiatives to see if they use SAF blends on specific routes.

• For environmentally focused travel planning, consider airlines that prioritise SAF uptake.

• Stay updated on government announcements, as final policy details are expected by 2026.

In the two weeks since my last column, US president Donald Trump has really set his sights on Greenland, threatening tariffs on countries that don’t like the idea of his country acquiring the island, and then citing everything from his failure to win the Nobel Peace Prize to losing control of a critical archipelago in the Indian Ocean as reasons for his hyperfixation. And then he does a bit of a turn-around and says that a “framework” allowing the US to acquire the island has been agreed upon, whatever that means.

Meanwhile, the US’ erstwhile allies across Europe and the Pacific Rim scramble to figure out a response that would somehow keep the current international order – or at least allow them to move forward while recognizing that things will never be the same, judging from the speech made by Canadian prime minister Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos. In it, he called for “middle powers” to get their acts together to ensure international law and institutions are upheld as superpowers essentially throw their weight around more brashly. On the other side, there’s Trump spruiking his “Board of Peace” proposal, which some now see as intended to bypass the United Nations.

Now, these events may seem so far away from the Philippines, but apart from the possible geopolitical ripple effects outlined in my last column – particularly on China and the disputed territories within the South China Sea – these movements can affect, if not determine, efforts that our own government is making to ensure our competitiveness in the global stage. It is worth remembering that while we in the private sector have a significant role to play in building supply chain stability and resilience, it is the government that fosters a healthy investment environment and invests in the necessary infrastructure and institutions that ensures the continued working of these supply chains. In some matters, we can completely do nothing.

Where does the Philippines lie amidst this transition (or unmasking, as some argue this is just making private imperial ambitions public)? The Marcos administration has worked hard to strengthen its economic relationship with the United States, especially after its predecessor, the Duterte administration, all but favored China in its pursuit of a supposedly “independent” foreign policy. The government will point to at least two wins: negotiations that led to Liberation Day tariffs that are lower than Trump initially announced; and the continuation of American investment in the Luzon Economic Corridor program, which includes a potentially game-changing rail link between Subic, Manila and Batangas ports, as well as Clark airport.

However, China remains one of our biggest trade partners, with roughly USD 34.5 billion worth of Chinese goods entering the country in 2024. Alongside the territorial dispute and the military provocations within our exclusive economic zone, there remains a strengthening of our trade ties, and businesses from both countries entering each other’s markets.

In addition, the Philippines has set its sights beyond its immediate neighborhood, inking trade agreements with South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, and mapping out similar agreements with other countries around the world, including the United States. We have also seen the Marcos administration strengthen political ties with Japan and Australia, to present a counterweight of sorts to China’s territorial ambitions.

These efforts do not amount to nothing, but it does feel like the pace of events around the world would be faster than our ability to respond. Fostering stronger ties does not happen in a snap, and building more competitive infrastructure definitely doesn’t. Within ASEAN we are continuing to fall behind in investments, not helped by high energy and logistics costs as well as governance concerns – something definitely highlighted by the never-ending controversy surrounding flood control projects, which we all know is just the tip of the iceberg.

With a possible global realignment in full swing, we should stick closer to our neighbors to keep domestic consumption going and to give exporters access to outside markets. That said, are we in the best position to take advantage of these shifts? Can we turn these roadblocks to opportunities? I cannot answer that, but I do know… the government has some catching up to do, before we can do our own catching up.

Pegando nas palavras do presidente do Conselho de Administração do grupo, Pedro Quintela colocou a tónica na palavra “Ambição”, até porque “acreditamos que podemos fazer mais.
Voltando a 2025, ano em que a Abreu comemorou 185 anos, Pedro Quintela destacou o regresso ao “Mundo Abreu” ao formato evento presencial, assim como a Expo Abreu presença na BTL.
E depois há algumas surpresas”, salientou Pedro Quintela, sem avançar muito na última parte.
Num universo que compõe quase um milhar de pessoas, Pedro Quintela frisa que na Abreu a “lógica passa por melhorar a rentabilidade a partir da diferenciação”.","Jorge Abreu, presidente do Conselho de Administração da Abreu, já o tinha afirmado no discurso inicial da Abreu Summit 2026, que se realizou no sábado, 24 de janeiro, ao salientar que durante os dias 23 e 24 de janeiro: “os três pilares que sustentam a visão estratégica do grupo para o ano de 2026 são Ambição, Atitude e Ação”.

Pedro Quintela, diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu, reafirmou esta posição do líder do Grupo Abreu, não sem antes admitir à imprensa, à margem da Abreu Summit, que o evento “é importante por várias razões, porque ajuda a que se perceba o que o grupo fez em 2025, pomos toda a gente a conhecer tudo o que aconteceu nas diferentes áreas e, depois, lançamos o mote para mais um ano”.

Antes de avançar para 2026, Pedro Quintela fez um balanço de 2025, afirmando que “correu bem. Foi um ano positivo, em todos os negócios em Portugal, com uns cresceram mais do que outros”, dando o exemplo dos “Bed Banks onde a Abreu cresceu mais do que no Lazer, crescemos também mais no Corporativo, embora tenhamos crescido, também, no Lazer”.

Pegando nas palavras do presidente do Conselho de Administração do grupo, Pedro Quintela colocou a tónica na palavra “Ambição”, até porque “acreditamos que podemos fazer mais. E o que queremos transmitir às 700 pessoas que estão aqui, e às 1.300 que fazem parte do grupo, é que se todos tivermos lojas com resultados excelentes, tivermos pessoas com resultados excelentes, se passarmos do suficiente ao bom, vamos ter sempre os melhores anos de sempre”.

Por isso, se 2025 foi “suficiente”, queremos saltar para o bom em 2026”, admitiu o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu.

Grandes Viagens

E se 2026 começou logo com alguns condicionantes para as viagens, Pedro Quintela lembrou que, em 2025, por exemplo, “não se pôde viajar para Israel e vendíamos muito Israel. Agora no início de 2026, não está tão calmo na zona da Venezuela ou da Colômbia. As pessoas assustam-se, mas o certo é que as pessoas o que fazem é aquilo que temos sentido dos clientes, procuram outros caminhos e nós também”.

Assim, o que aconteceu na Abreu foi simples: “tivemos um trabalho muito incisivo em 2025 neste tema que passou por procurar destinos diferentes, formas até de vender diferentes daquelas que eram as mais tradicionais, como o online”, explicando Pedro Quintela que o canal de vendas por vídeo chamada mais que duplicou a equipa, de um ano para o outro, passando a ter 12 elementos, salientando, igualmente, a Abreu Experience.

Outro segmento que correu bem à Abreu foi o das Grandes Viagens, afirmando Pedro Quintela que “tivemos o melhor ano sempre”, esperando que 2026 seja “ainda melhor, porque é produto diferenciado e onde estamos a investir muito nestes últimos tempos”.

Até porque, considera o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu, “sabemos que a gestão das margens do produto mais massificado não é tão fácil“.

Voltando a 2025, ano em que a Abreu comemorou 185 anos, Pedro Quintela destacou o regresso ao “Mundo Abreu” ao formato evento presencial, assim como a Expo Abreu presença na BTL. E o certo é que, em 2026, estas iniciativas e ações mantém-se, com o “Mundo Abreu” a já ter datas marcadas para 14 e 15 de fevereiro próximo, enquanto a Expo Abreu terá palco em outubro.

E se fazer 186 anos não é a mesma coisa que fazer 185, Pedro Quintela revela que, ”eventualmente, as grandes surpresas estarão guardadas para quando atingirmos os 190 anos”.

Crescer, sim, mas com rentabilidade

O ano que fechou a comemoração do 185.º aniversário do Grupo Abreu permitiu, no entanto, “ficar bem acima dos 500 milhões de euros” em faturação na Abreu Viagens, com a Abreu Logistics a crescer “para mais de 100 milhões de euros”, sem falar nos negócios que a Abreu possui no Brasil, EUA, Espanha ou Angola.

Para 2026, e tendo “sempre uma visão consciente, mas otimista, vamos crescer outra vez, porque estamos a criar condições para que isso aconteça, seja porque continuamos a ter cada vez mais portugueses a viajar, seja porque conquistamos quota de mercado”.

Sem fixar nenhuma meta para este ano que agora começou, Pedro Quintela reconheceu, contudo, que “gostávamos de crescer, idealmente, 10% ao ano, mas há negócios que crescem muito mais do que isso, há outros que crescem menos do que isso”.

Contudo para o executivo do grupo de viagens mais antigo do mundo, o objetivo “não é só o crescimento ao nível das vendas, mas também sustentar um crescimento na margem”, porque para Pedro Quintela, “não adianta crescer muito em vendas se a margem não acompanhar esse crescimento”, referindo, igualmente, a “produtividade, as pessoas, os sistemas, as distintas parcerias, a Inteligência Artificial, os projetos de employer branding” como “fundamentais para a estratégia deste ano”.

“O maior investimento que vamos fazer, e que fazemos todos os anos, é nas nossas pessoas, seja pela premiação, seja no acompanhamento salarial. Em paralelo, a parte tecnológica vai ter alguns avanços, seja a nível da IA, ferramentas de booking, estamos a desenvolver algumas diferentes. E depois há algumas surpresas”, salientou Pedro Quintela, sem avançar muito na última parte. ,

Certo é que, também no desenvolvimento de produto haverá um forte investimento, admitindo o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu que “estamos cada vez mais a levar as nossas equipas de tour operação ou agência a viajar para conhecer o produto, para construir o produto, para acompanhar o cliente enquanto este está a viajar e sentir o feedback, para depois perceber o que é que ainda se pode ajustar no produto que foi lançado”.

Num universo que compõe quase um milhar de pessoas, Pedro Quintela frisa que na Abreu a “lógica passa por melhorar a rentabilidade a partir da diferenciação”.

Quanto à tendência que se regista com a compra antecipada das viagens, o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu admitiu que “veio para ficar. Nós em outubro, na Expo Abreu, já estávamos a vender viagens de verão. O cliente voltou a comprar mais cedo, porque sabe que consegue melhor preço, consegue disponibilidade”.

Antecipação não compra já não é “nova”

A quanto aos destinos para 2026, Pedro Quintela volta a destacar Cabo Verde, “que está sempre no topo”, enquanto nos charters o destaque mantém-se nas Caraíbas e Porto Santo. Nas grandes viagens, Quintela refere que “a Tailândia tem vindo a acentuar um crescimento que não tinha antes da pandemia, o Japão continua a ser um fenómeno”, concluindo que “as grandes viagens neste momento andam muito na Ásia”.

Se tudo aponta para um ano de 2026 em crescendo, o mês de janeiro confirma-o, com Pedro Quintela a revelar que “o nível de reservas para o ano está acima da mesma altura do ano passado [janeiro 2025]. “Por isso é que isto reforça o nosso otimismo de que vamos ter um ano exigente, vamos ter de trabalhar muito, mas se conseguirmos pôr em prática tudo aquilo que temos presente, provavelmente, vamos ter um ano melhor que 2025”, considera o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu.

A concluir, Pedro Quintela voltou a colocar a tónica na rentabilidade, até porque, “se pormos um preço que hoje o cliente vê como baixo, nunca mais vamos pôr um preço mais alto”. De resto, o diretor-geral de Vendas e Marketing da Agência Abreu quis deixar bem vincado que “as empresas não vivem de vendas, vivem de resultados. Se esmagamos as margens e até desgraduamos o produto, não vamos ter resultado”.

Aproveitando a deixa do presidente do Turismo de Portugal, Carlos Abade, no arranque do Abreu Summit 2026, onde referia que o objetivo de Portugal era “crescer em valor e não em volume”, Pedro Quintela terminou a salientar que “o objetivo é vender melhor, não necessariamente mais, porque se vendemos melhor, vamos ter melhores margens, vamos ter equipas melhores, vamos ter clientes mais satisfeitos”.

O Parlamento quer manter o direito dos viajantes a uma indemnização por um atraso de três horas, além da simplificação dos procedimentos de reembolso e da gratuitidade da bagagem de cabina.

Nesse sentido, o Parlamento Europeu adotou a sua posição (632 votos a favor, 15 votos contra e 9 abstenções) para a revisão das alterações das regras relativas aos passageiros dos transportes aéreos sugeridas pelos países da UE em junho de 2025. Os eurodeputados votaram, na passada quarta-feira, contra o esforço dos ministros da UE para enfraquecer os direitos dos passageiros dos transportes aéreos, em vigor desde 2004 e cujo objetivo é garantir que os passageiros tenham proteção suficiente em caso de perturbações nas viagens.

Os eurodeputados querem manter o direito dos passageiros dos transportes aéreos a serem reembolsados ou reencaminhados e a pedirem uma indemnização se um voo sofrer um atraso superior a três horas, se for cancelado ou se lhes for recusado o embarque.

Recorde-se que o Conselho Europeu pressionava para que a indemnização seja aplicada apenas após um atraso de quatro a seis horas, consoante a distância do voo.

O Parlamento opõe-se, assim, à redução dos atuais montantes de compensação por perturbações dos voos e propõe que sejam fixados entre 300 e 600 euros, consoante a distância do voo, enquanto os governos dos Estados-Membros pretendiam fixar uma compensação entre 300 e 500 euros.

Com a responsabilidade das companhias aéreas limitada a situações sob o seu controlo, o Parlamento pretende renovar a lista das circunstâncias extraordinárias que lhes permitiriam renunciar à sua responsabilidade de pagar indemnizações, circunstâncias que incluem, atualmente, catástrofes naturais, guerras, condições meteorológicas ou conflitos laborais imprevistos que afetam o operador aéreo, o aeroporto ou o prestador de serviços de navegação aérea.

Os eurodeputados querem que esta lista seja exaustiva e que a Comissão Europeia a atualize regularmente.

Além disso, os eurodeputados concordam com o Conselho que deve ser mantido em todas as circunstâncias “o dever das companhias de fornecer bebidas aos passageiros retidos a cada duas horas para além da hora de partida inicial, uma refeição após três horas e uma estadia máxima de três noites por longos atrasos”, considerando que “o limite de três noites ofereceria às companhias aéreas maior previsibilidade e pouparia custos financeiros indevidos”.

Os eurodeputados querem a introdução de formulários pré-preenchidos para os pedidos de indemnização e reembolso, de modo a “simplificar o tratamento destes pedidos e evitar que passageiros e companhias aéreas recorram a agências de reclamações”. De acordo com a posição do Parlamento, as transportadoras aéreas teriam de enviar aos passageiros afetados por perturbações da viagem (cancelamento ou atrasos) um formulário pré-preenchido no prazo de 48 horas após o incidente (a posição do Conselho exige um formulário pré-preenchido apenas após o cancelamento, e não após atrasos consideráveis). Os viajantes teriam então um ano para apresentar um pedido.

Os passageiros devem ter o direito de transportar consigo no avião, e sem custos adicionais, um artigo pessoal (como uma mala de mão, uma mochila ou um computador portátil que possa ser acondicionado sob o banco à frente do passageiro), bem uma pequena bagagem de mão com dimensões máximas de 100 cm (comprimento, largura e altura combinados) e cujo peso não seja superior a sete quilos.

Na comunicação do Parlamento Europeu pode, também, ler-se que “devem ser eliminadas as taxas adicionais que os viajantes são, por vezes, forçados a pagar pela correção de erros no nome do passageiro ou pelo check-in no seu voo, defendem os deputados”, acrescentando que “os passageiros devem ter o direito de escolher entre cartões de embarque digitais e em papel”.

A posição do Parlamento inclui disposições em específico para os passageiros com deficiência ou mobilidade reduzida. “Estes viajantes devem ter direito a indemnização, reencaminhamento e assistência por parte das companhias aéreas se perderem um voo devido ao facto de o aeroporto não os ter ajudado a chegar à porta de embarque a tempo, defendem os eurodeputados. Os passageiros com mobilidade reduzida, as mulheres grávidas, os bebés e as crianças num carrinho de bebé com um acompanhante devem ter prioridade ao embarcar, enquanto os seus acompanhantes devem estar sentados num lugar adjacente sem incorrer em custos adicionais”, lê-se no texto.

Há muito que o tema da aviação sustentável está lançado, com diversos objetivos e metas traçadas pela União Europeia. Contudo, no que diz respeito ao Combustível Sustentável de Aviação (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF sigla em inglês), são várias as vozes na indústria que apontam a reduzida produção e os preços (demasiado) altos para se conseguir atingir as metas definidas em Bruxelas. Na KLM, além da renovação da frota e das medidas operacionais, o SAF constitui um importante investimento. Mas não só. Jolanda Stevens, Program Manager Zero Emission Aviation da KLM, refere ao Publituris que a companhia está “empenhada em exercer um papel de liderança na construção deste futuro sustentável para a aviação” e, por isso, “está envolvida em diversas parcerias que contribuem para o desenvolvimento e a adoção da aviação movida a hidrogénio”.

No entanto, Stevens admite que é preciso criar um level playing field (ambiente com condições equitativas) em que os pioneiros não sejam penalizados por liderar. E isto requer “incentivos, subsídios e acesso antecipado em todo o ecossistema da aviação”.

A KLM tem assumido publicamente o compromisso de alcançar net-zero até 2050. Quais são os principais pilares desta estratégia e que metas intermédias foram estabelecidas?

A estratégia de zero emissões da KLM assenta em vários pilares fundamentais, nomeadamente, renovação da frota, eficiência operacional, uso de combustível alternativo de aviação (SAF) e inovação em tecnologias de emissões zero.

Até 2030, pretendemos reduzir as nossas emissões de CO2 por passageiro em 30%, face a 2019.

No imediato, que medidas estão a ser implementadas para reduzir as emissões, tanto ao nível da frota como das operações diárias?

A KLM está a investir sete mil milhões de euros na renovação da frota ao longo dos próximos anos. Para as rotas europeias, isto inclui o Embraer 195-E2, operado pela KLM Cityhopper, e as aeronaves Airbus A320neo e A321neo, 10 das quais já foram entregues.

Para os voos intercontinentais, a KLM adicionou recentemente novos Boeing 787 à sua frota. O primeiro Airbus A350 é esperado em 2026 e será seguido pela introdução dos A350F em 2027. Estes aviões também vão contribuir significativamente para a redução das emissões.

Operacionalmente, temos otimizado as trajetórias dos voos, reduzido o tempo de taxing (circulação da aeronave na placa) e eletrificado as operações em terra para minimizar o consumo de combustível.

Que papel terão os combustíveis sustentáveis de aviação (SAF) na redução da pegada de carbono da KLM? Considera que a disponibilidade e os custos de produção ainda são o maior obstáculo?

Além da renovação da frota e das medidas operacionais, o SAF é um objetivo importante de investimento para a KLM. Desde 2022, a KLM incorpora SAF em todos os voos com partidas de Amesterdão, e tem estado a aumentar a quota gradualmente.

Apesar da crescente utilização, o SAF mantém-se caro e escasso, o que limita o seu impacto. Para acelerar a sua adoção, a KLM colabora com parceiros como a SkyNRG e DG Fuels, e foi cofundadora do Sky Power, um projeto criado para escalar a produção de e-SAF. Todas as sobretaxas SAF dos bilhetes são reinvestidas na compra de SAF. A KLM também envolve os seus passageiros e clientes empresariais nesta contribuição, com o objetivo de tornar a aviação sustentável mais acessível e impactante.

Elétrico ou hidrogénio?

A indústria fala cada vez mais de aviões elétricos e a hidrogénio. A KLM está envolvida em projetos-piloto nesta área? Que perspetiva existe para a sua adoção a médio e longo prazo?

As aeronaves movidas a hidrogénio e elétricas a bateria podem tornar-se uma solução viável para as rotas de curto-curso até 2035. Para acelerar esta transição, a KLM participa ativamente na investigação e em projetos-piloto com parceiros de todo o setor da aviação, tanto nacionais como internacionais.

Estas colaborações centram-se na união de forças na cadeia de valor como, por exemplo, testar novas tecnologias em condições reais num voo de demonstração, construir planos detalhados para estratégias aeroportuárias a longo prazo, construir redes de voos com novas tecnologias para melhor compreender o impacto das suas características, etc..

Até 2035, o primeiro avião de emissões zero com cerca de 75 lugares poderá estar pronto para substituir os aviões regionais mais pequenos, com potencial para substituições de aeronaves de corredor único até 2040. A KLM está empenhada em exercer um papel de liderança na construção deste futuro sustentável para a aviação.

Como avalia a importância da digitalização e da otimização operacional (ex.: rotas, eficiência de voo) no processo de descarbonização?

A digitalização e a otimização operacional são absolutamente cruciais no processo de descarbonização da aviação. Com a introdução de novas tecnologias de propulsão, como os aviões elétricos ou movidos a hidrogénio, a energia disponível a bordo será significativamente mais limitada face aos combustíveis fósseis tradicionais. Isto significa que cada joule de energia contará e que otimizar todos os aspetos da operação de voo, como o planeamento de rotas, os perfis de voo e os processos de turnaround, vai ser mais importante do que nunca.

Ao permitir a recolha de dados em tempo real e análises avançadas, a digitalização desempenha aqui um papel fundamental. Através de ferramentas digitais, vamos ser mais capazes de otimizar as rotas de voo com base nos dados disponíveis. A manutenção preditiva e o apoio à decisão assente em IA podem reduzir ainda mais o uso desnecessário de combustível ou energia.

Em suma, a digitalização é o facilitador que nos permitirá otimizar ainda mais a eficiência das nossas operações, o que é essencial quando se trabalha com recursos energéticos mais limitados. Assim, num futuro descarbonizado, as soluções digitais serão uma parte importante da otimização operacional e energética.

Colaboração e partilha

A KLM tem vindo a trabalhar com universidades, centros de investigação e fabricantes. Pode dar exemplos concretos de projetos em parceria com a academia e a indústria que estão a marcar este caminho para a aviação zero emissões?

A KLM está envolvida em diversas parcerias que contribuem para o desenvolvimento e a adoção da aviação movida a hidrogénio. (ver caixa)

Existe algum trabalho de partilha entre as várias companhias aéreas ou grupos de aviação para antecipar as metas ou trabalhar-se para a redução de custos e preços?

Atualmente, não existem colaborações formais entre companhias aéreas focadas especificamente em voos a hidrogénio ou elétricos, já que estas tecnologias ainda se encontram numa fase inicial de desenvolvimento.

No entanto, a KLM tem explorado ativamente soluções futuras e partilha insights através de iniciativas mais amplas da indústria. Um bom exemplo é o Aviation Challenge, que incentiva as companhias aéreas a tornarem os voos comerciais regulares mais sustentáveis.

De resto, a SkyTeam convida as companhias aéreas participantes a criar um impacto tangível e a partilhar aprendizagens em todo o setor. A KLM testa as inovações durante as operações e partilha os resultados com os parceiros, construindo conhecimento coletivo, identificando soluções escaláveis e ajudando a reduzir o impacto ambiental e os custos a longo prazo.

A cooperação entre companhias aéreas, fabricantes e entidades reguladoras é fundamental. Como vê o papel da colaboração setorial para acelerar a inovação e ultrapassar barreiras regulatórias e tecnológicas?

A colaboração intrassectorial é essencial para escalar a inovação e garantir normas harmonizadas. Cada player precisa de fazer o que nunca fez antes. Ao construirmos relações de confiança, ao criarmos pontos em comum, ao trabalharmos em projetos conjuntos e ao comunicarmos sobre os assuntos em que estamos envolvidos, estamos a construir colaborações sólidas.

Nestas parcerias, cada parte contribui com a sua expertise, trabalhando com base no conhecimento comum e criando entendimento mútuo para enfrentar os vários desafios. Como lidar com a perceção pública, como ponderar os riscos, tendo sempre a segurança como fator mais importante. Isto ajuda-nos a todos a caminhar na mesma direção.

A Air France-KLM é hoje um dos maiores grupos de aviação da Europa. Como é que esta dimensão ajuda a impulsionar a agenda da sustentabilidade e a ganhar escala em projetos de futuro?

Como grande player na Europa, temos uma voz forte no debate sobre o futuro da nossa indústria, que utilizamos para colaborar dentro e fora do setor da aviação, para reduzir o impacto negativo do transporte aéreo no ambiente.

Em 2023, o grupo Air France-KLM foi o maior comprador de SAF do mundo e está a impulsionar o mercado de SAF através da celebração de acordos de compra com diversos players em todo o mundo.

Em termos de perceção pública e experiência do cliente, como é que a KLM comunica estes esforços de sustentabilidade e envolve os passageiros nesta transformação?

Os voos elétricos e movidos a hidrogénio podem parecer distantes para muitos, mas a KLM envolve ativamente os passageiros nestes desenvolvimentos através de uma comunicação clara e acessível. Utilizamos o nosso website e a revista de bordo Holland Herald para explicar os esforços de sustentabilidade e as tecnologias futuras. A publicidade gratuita ajuda a ampliar as principais iniciativas, tornando a inovação mais tangível. Ao partilhar exemplos reais, como o nosso trabalho com a ZeroAvia, procuramos inspirar confiança e consciencialização.

O papel das start-ups

Na sua opinião, qual será a tecnologia disruptiva que mais pode mudar a aviação nos próximos 20 a 30 anos?

Não existe uma solução mágica. São necessárias múltiplas soluções no caminho para o netzero. Estas soluções precisam de ser desenvolvidas em paralelo,

cada uma tendo um lugar próprio na linha de soluções e desafios tecnológicos específicos. Por isso, é muito difícil prever qual será a principal tecnologia “vencedora”. Mas o que vemos é o grande impacto das start-ups.

As start-ups estão realmente a romper o status quo e a enriquecer a aviação com soluções inovadoras que não teriam surgido apenas de players estabelecidos. Este fluxo de novas ideias e desenvolvimento ágil é relativamente novo na aviação, que tradicionalmente tem sido dominada por alguns grandes fabricantes e abordagens conservadoras.

Embora os processos de certificação continuem a ser demorados e possam dificultar a rápida entrada no mercado, o ritmo do desenvolvimento tecnológico impulsionado pelas start-ups é inconfundível. Estão a abordar conceitos que vão desde a eletrificação e a propulsão a hidrogénio até à digitalização e à eficiência operacional.

Ainda que seja improvável uma solução rápida, estes novos intervenientes estão a acelerar o progresso e a remodelar a abordagem do setor em relação à sustentabilidade.

Quais são os principais desafios e oportunidades que o setor enfrenta para garantir que a aviação continua a ser um motor económico e social, mas com impacto ambiental reduzido?

O setor da aviação necessita de reduzir o seu impacto ambiental, mantendo a sua relevância social e económica. Os principais desafios incluem a disponibilidade limitada e o custo elevado dos SAF.

As oportunidades estão na renovação da frota, na eletrificação das operações em terra e em melhorias operacionais. A inovação em aeronaves a hidrogénio e elétricas, juntamente com a circularidade e a redução de resíduos, pode contribuir ainda mais para as metas climáticas.

Alcançar a neutralidade carbónica até 2050 exige políticas estáveis, investimentos estratégicos e colaboração entre a indústria e os governos.

Que mensagem deve ser dada à indústria e aos decisores políticos sobre o caminho para uma aviação de zero emissões?

Precisamos de criar um level playing field (ambiente com condições equitativas) em que os pioneiros não sejam penalizados por liderar. Isto requer incentivos, subsídios e acesso antecipado em todo o ecossistema da aviação. A regulamentação desempenha um papel crucial e as pessoas só mudam de comportamento quando norteadas por leis ou incentivos financeiros.

Os governos devem também ajudar a ajustar a compreensão por parte do público, comunicando o impacto ambiental da aviação de forma contextualizada. A estabilidade nas políticas de aviação é essencial para o planeamento a longo prazo.

Por último, precisamos que os decisores políticos apoiem ativamente a inovação, criando espaço para experimentar, colaborar e escalar tecnologias como o SAF e as aeronaves de emissões zero, ajudando a aviação a tornar-se mais sustentável sem comprometer o seu valor social.

In South-east Asia, 3.3 per cent of the flight distance in 2019 left persistent contrails, said Dr Teoh.
According to a mapping tool by non-profit organisation Contrails.org seen on Jan 24, a number of flights form warming contrails in South-east Asia.
By 2030, the greener fuel is expected to contribute just 2 per cent to 5 per cent of jet fuel.
Dr Teoh said: “In rerouting the flights, it can be done today.","SINGAPORE - The white streaks left by planes as they zip through the skies make a pretty sight, but they can harm the planet at times.

These vapour clouds formed from planes’ engine exhaust are known as condensation trails – or contrails – and can contribute to global warming if they stay in the skies for long.

In aviation’s climate footprint, contrails are the lesser-known warming sibling of jet fuel.

The International Civil Aviation Organization warned in a 2025 report that warming caused by contrails is expected to increase over time due to the projected rise in air traffic and the expected upward shift in flight altitudes.

Singapore is also looking into contrails in the Asia-Pacific as part of a

recently announced Aviation Meteorological Programme

. It is one of five priority areas under the national programme, which aims to tackle the effects of weather on flight operations in Singapore.

Contrails are created when hot water vapour, soot and other particles released from the plane’s exhaust mix with the frigid air at high altitudes. Water vapour condenses around the soot and freezes, creating ice crystals visible as linear clouds.

In regions super-saturated with ice, contrails can appear like thin cirrus clouds, persisting for hours. While they reflect some of the Sun’s energy back to space, they also trap and re-emit Earth’s radiation and heat, preventing them from escaping into space.

Contrails can account for 30 per cent to 65 per cent of warming caused by the aviation sector, depending on the metrics and time horizon used to calculate the impact, said Dr Roger Teoh, an honorary research fellow at Imperial College London, whose research is focused on aviation’s impact on climate change.

The effect of persistent contrails is similar to an acute fever or infection. When they persist for hours or up to a day, the result is an intense, strong warming effect, until the man-made clouds dissipate.

When planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) is emitted from the burning of jet fuel, the greenhouse gas stays in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years, Dr Teoh said. CO2’s warming effect is gradual and consistent, much like a chronic disease.

“If you were to compare the total warming caused by CO2 with contrails over 20 years, the effect of contrails could be twice that of CO2. But over a 100-year horizon, CO2’s impact would be 1.5 times larger than that of contrails,” said Dr Teoh.

Not all smoky streaks lead to warming. Persistent contrails are more frequently found in colder regions in the higher latitudes of Europe and North America, and are less common in the sub-tropical regions.

“In Singapore and Malaysia, you don’t see many contrails in the sky, compared with Europe, where you can see them almost every day,” he added.

This does not mean that the issue should be overlooked in this region.

Globally, roughly a fifth of all flights form persistent contrails, and only 3 per cent of those flights are responsible for 80 per cent of the warming effect.

No persistent contrails form below 37,000 feet in the tropics, where the atmosphere is warmer.

In South-east Asia, 3.3 per cent of the flight distance in 2019 left persistent contrails, said Dr Teoh.

These contrails were most likely generated by flights that cruised above 37,000 feet, where it is colder.

Such flights typically involve larger aircraft with two passenger aisles. Short-haul regional flights involving narrower aircraft usually cruise at lower altitudes and are unlikely to produce such contrails.

According to a mapping tool by non-profit organisation Contrails.org seen on Jan 24, a number of flights form warming contrails in South-east Asia. They include a flight from Melbourne to Singapore, and another from Java to Bali in Indonesia.

Under the Aviation Meteorological Programme, which was announced in December 2025, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and National Environment Agency will deepen scientific knowledge on contrails in this region, where the atmospheric conditions differ from those in Europe and North America.

“Currently, there is scarce data and research on contrails in the Asia-Pacific region, compared with better studied regions such as North America, Europe, and the North Atlantic,” both agencies told The Straits Times in a joint statement.

The agencies are engaging partners to scope relevant projects related to contrails, and are hoping that the programme’s work will “help inform future mitigation strategies and contribute to global policy development”.

Currently, the most viable and scalable solution to reduce the impact of contrails is to reroute planes or adjust their altitude away from contrail-producing pockets of the atmosphere.

This requires the use of weather forecasts incorporated into flight-planning software. Flight dispatchers on the ground can then work with pilots to select routes and avoid areas in real time.

In 2024, after American Airlines rerouted 22 flights to avoid contrails, a first-of-its-kind study was published showing that those flights slashed contrail formation by 64 per cent.

Dr Teoh noted that there are a few trade-offs with rerouting, such as burning extra fuel and potentially higher overflight fees when flying over some airspaces.

But by rerouting planes, contrail-induced warming can be reduced by up to 50 per cent, and jet fuel consumption typically increases by no more than 1 per cent for a given flight, he added.

When ST asked Singapore Airlines if it has embarked on any projects to limit contrails, an airline spokesperson said the airline is unable to provide data on contrail generation or discuss specific initiatives at present, and will share more when appropriate.

Switching to

sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

– made from used cooking oil, animal fat and biofuel – is another solution to tackle contrails because it emits less soot particles when burnt. But SAF requires a longer timeline to scale.

By 2030, the greener fuel is expected to contribute just 2 per cent to 5 per cent of jet fuel.

Dr Teoh said: “In rerouting the flights, it can be done today. You don’t need any additional (major) infrastructure. Using SAF does not need rerouting, but there is not much supply now.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d0aa82b580c4784b9a5d441c396db123475d03adc3cb61c3307f10a768d5e424,N,,2026-01-25 16:56:56.212946

The Analytical Deep Dive: Global Giants and Market Dynamics

Global aerospace leaders such as Airbus and Boeing are demonstrating a deep commitment to India's growth narrative. Airbus is significantly expanding its local footprint, aiming to increase annual sourcing from India to $2 billion by 2030 and establishing final assembly lines for C-295 aircraft and H125 helicopters in partnership with Tata Advanced Systems. Boeing mirrors this strategy, sourcing over $1.25 billion annually from more than 300 Indian suppliers and investing in local manufacturing and skill development, aligning with the 'Make in India' initiative. Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) also plays a crucial role, though its Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio stands at approximately 45.0 as of January 2026, suggesting a premium valuation. The domestic market, however, is characterized by a strong duopoly. IndiGo commands over 64% of the domestic market share, while the Air India Group holds approximately 26-27%. Despite this market dominance, both major players have faced recent operational challenges, including disruptions from new Flight Duty Time Limitation (FTDL) regulations affecting IndiGo and financial pressures on Air India, highlighting the complexities of profitable operations in India's competitive environment.

Industry sources indicate the agreement may also include options for about 50 additional aircraft. An announcement could come soon, though both Airbus and AirAsia have declined to confirm details publicly. AirAsia stated it has no announcements to make at this time.

Talks around a high-density, 160-seat version of the A220 emerged ahead of the previous Paris Airshow. The variant would align with AirAsia’s low-cost model by increasing seat capacity while maintaining operating efficiency.

Brazilian manufacturer Embraer has also been in discussions with AirAsia, aiming to challenge Airbus’ dominant position within the airline’s fleet. Despite this competition, Airbus has renewed efforts to close the A220 deal, according to recent reporting.

Existing Airbus Commitments and Fleet Growth

AirAsia remains one of Airbus’ largest customers, with more than 350 A320 family aircraft already on order. In July, the airline added 50 A321XLR jets to support longer-range routes.

AirAsia co-founder Tony Fernandes previously stated that the airline was ready to introduce smaller aircraft to serve new destinations and strengthen regional connectivity. This position was reinforced by Deputy Group CEO Farouk Kamal, who confirmed ongoing discussions with manufacturers as the airline evaluates up to 150 additional aircraft.

AirAsia’s growth plans follow a challenging period caused by pandemic travel restrictions, which led Malaysia’s stock exchange to classify its parent company, Capital A, as financially distressed under PN17 status.

Fernandes, who also serves as CEO of Capital A, recently confirmed the group has completed its PN17 regularisation plan and is now working toward financial recovery. A restructuring that consolidates all AirAsia-branded aviation businesses under AirAsia X is expected to support cost reduction and operational focus, while Capital A concentrates on restoring financial stability.

About Airbus A220s

The Airbus A220 represents a new standard in the 100 to 160 seat aircraft category, blending advanced design with passenger-focused comfort. Built as a clean-sheet aircraft, it addresses modern airline needs while improving the travel experience.

With lower emissions, quieter operations, and a spacious cabin, the A220 delivers efficiency without compromise. It serves regional, transcontinental, and select international routes with consistent performance.

The A220 was designed from the ground up to redefine expectations for smaller single-aisle aircraft. Introduced into commercial service in 2016, it combines the economics of a regional jet with the comfort and capability of a larger narrowbody aircraft.

Originally launched by Bombardier as the C Series in 2008, the program achieved its first flight in September 2013. Airbus became the majority partner in 2018, integrating the aircraft into its global industrial and engineering ecosystem. This transition strengthened production scale, support infrastructure, and long-term development.

Today, the A220 is a core part of Airbus’ single-aisle portfolio. It supports routes ranging from short regional sectors to flights of up to 3,600 nautical miles, offering airlines flexibility across diverse networks.

A220 Program Growth and Service Record

Since entry into service, the A220 fleet has accumulated more than 3 million flight hours. It operates on over 1,800 routes connecting more than 480 destinations worldwide. Airlines value their fuel efficiency and reliability, while passengers consistently rate their cabin comfort and quietness highly.

The aircraft maintains approximately 99.0 percent operational reliability based on a three-month rolling average. This performance reinforces its role as a dependable asset for modern fleets.

The Mirabel production site in Canada reflects the program’s growth. What began with around 50 staff in 2008 has expanded to roughly 4,000 employees today, supporting large-scale manufacturing and continuous improvement.

Aircraft Variants and Performance Capabilities

The A220 Family includes two passenger variants with a common pilot type rating, allowing airlines to optimize crew flexibility.

A220-100

Capacity: 100 to 120 passengers

Range: Up to 3,600 nautical miles

A220-300

Capacity: 120 to 160 passengers

Range: Up to 3,450 nautical miles

A business aviation version is also available. The ACJ TwoTwenty offers over 12 hours of nonstop range and provides more than twice the cabin space of other ultra-long-range business jets in its class.

Passenger Experience Inside the A220

The A220 features the Airbus Airspace cabin, designed to maximize comfort and space. It offers the widest economy seats, the highest ceilings, and the largest cabin cross-section in its segment.

A 2-3 seating layout ensures most passengers sit by either a window or an aisle. Extra-large windows allow more natural light, while full-color LED ambient lighting enhances the cabin atmosphere. Overhead bins provide 20 percent more volume, improving boarding efficiency and personal storage.

Noise-dampening materials, advanced climate control, and a lower cabin altitude contribute to reduced fatigue and a calmer onboard environment.

Advanced Engineering and Aircraft Innovation

As a clean-sheet design, the A220 incorporates advanced materials and systems throughout the airframe. Approximately 40 percent of its structure uses advanced materials, including carbon fiber composites and titanium, reducing weight and improving fuel efficiency.

The aluminum-lithium fuselage increases corrosion resistance and structural durability. High-aspect-ratio wings, combined with advanced winglets, reduce drag and improve aerodynamic performance. Fly-by-wire controls allow real-time response to flight conditions, enhancing stability and comfort.

The aircraft is equipped with a modern avionics suite that supports optimized navigation, fuel management, and safety. Integrated systems enable real-time data sharing and predictive maintenance, reducing downtime and operating costs.

The cockpit layout uses intuitive flight systems, sidestick controllers, heads-up displays, and a single type rating across variants, reducing pilot workload and training complexity.

Environmental Performance and Sustainability

The A220 delivers a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions per seat compared to previous-generation aircraft. Its lightweight structure and latest-generation engines also contribute to a noise footprint that is about 50 percent smaller.

The aircraft is certified to operate with up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel, with a target of full SAF capability by 2030. These features make it suitable for operations at noise-sensitive and urban airports while supporting airline sustainability goals.

Designed for Long-Term Relevance

The A220 was built with future operations in mind. Its combination of advanced aerodynamics, efficient engines, and modern systems positions it well for evolving regulatory and environmental requirements.

Lower operating costs per seat, estimated at 25 percent less than previous-generation aircraft, allow airlines to operate profitably across a wide range of markets while maintaining high passenger satisfaction.

Πριν από 50 χρόνια, η Air France και η British Airways εγκαινίασαν ταυτόχρονα την έναρξη του τακτικού δρομολογίου της, ανοίγοντας ένα μοναδικό κεφάλαιο στην ιστορία της πολιτικής αεροπορίας: την εποχή όπου ο Ατλαντικός μπορούσε να «μικρύνει» χρονική διάρκεια σε λιγότερο από 3,5 ώρες.

Στο υπερηχητικό ταξίδι, η εμπειρία δεν ήταν μόνο ταχύτητα. Ήταν και πολυτέλεια: αστακός και σαμπάνια σε μεγάλo υψόμετρο που θύμιζε πολυτελή κρουαζιέρα των αιθέρων, με το αεροσκάφος να κινείται σε ρυθμούς που οι περισσότεροι επιβάτες γραμμής δεν είχαν καν φανταστεί.

21 Ιανουαρίου 1976: Η πρώτη μέρα των επιβατικών πτήσεων

Δύο αεροσκάφη απογειώθηκαν σχεδόν ταυτόχρονα το μεσημέρι της 21ης Ιανουαρίου 1976 (11:40 ώρα Λονδίνου): το ένα από το Παρίσι και το άλλο από το Λονδίνο. Δεν ήταν τυχαίο: το Concorde αποτέλεσε κοινή βρετανο-γαλλική ανάπτυξη.

Το Concorde της Air France πέταξε μέσω της πρωτεύουσας της Σενεγάλης, Ντακάρ, προς το Ρίο ντε Τζανέιρο.

Η British Airways από το Λονδίνο κατευθύνθηκε προς το εμιράτο του Μπαχρέιν στον Περσικό Κόλπο.

Οι θέσεις για αυτές τις πρώτες πτήσεις είχαν σε ορισμένες περιπτώσεις κρατηθεί χρόνια πριν, ενώ τα δρομολόγια μεταδόθηκαν ακόμη και τηλεοπτικά, δείγμα του παγκόσμιου ενδιαφέροντος που συγκέντρωνε το πρόγραμμα.

Ένα πρόγραμμα κύρους με επιδόσεις-σύμβολο

Το Concorde ήταν ένα πρόγραμμα κύρους της βρετανικής και γαλλικής αεροναυπηγικής βιομηχανίας. Πέταγε με περίπου 2.200 km/h, διασχίζοντας τον Ατλαντικό σε λιγότερο από 3,5 ώρες — δηλαδή σε λιγότερο από το μισό του χρόνου μιας συμβατικής πτήσης γραμμής.

Υπήρχαν και στιγμές όπου ήταν ακόμη ταχύτερη:

Στις 7 Φεβρουαρίου 1996, πέταξε από Νέα Υόρκη προς Λονδίνο σε 2 ώρες, 52 λεπτά και 59 δευτερόλεπτα.

Στο εσωτερικό, περίπου 100 επιβάτες απολάμβαναν μια εμπειρία σχεδιασμένη για το κορυφαίο κοινό της εποχής:

χαβιάρι, αστακό, φουά γκρα με τρούφα, και φυσικά σαμπάνια.

Από την ιδέα στο Mach 2: Η ανάπτυξη (1962–1970)

Γαλλία και Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο ξεκίνησαν στα τέλη του 1962 την ανάπτυξη του πρώτου υπερηχητικού επιβατικού αεροσκάφους και την υποστήριξαν με μεγάλη ένταση.

Μετά από έξι χρόνια εξέλιξης, ολοκληρώθηκαν οι δύο πρώτοι πρωτότυποι:

Concorde 001: πρώτη πτήση στις 2 Μαρτίου 1969

Concorde 002: πρώτη πτήση στις 9 Απριλίου 1969

Στις 1 Οκτωβρίου 1969, μια Concorde ξεπέρασε για πρώτη φορά το Mach 1. Λίγο πάνω από έναν χρόνο αργότερα, στις 4 Νοεμβρίου 1970, έφτασε το Mach 2.

Ενδεικτικά, αυτά αντιστοιχούν περίπου σε 1.200 km/h και 2.500 km/h αντίστοιχα (ανάλογα με συνθήκες/ύψος).

Το Concorde ως εθνικό σύμβολο: από προεδρικά πρωινά μέχρι βασιλικά ιωβηλαία

Το αεροσκάφος χρησιμοποιήθηκε ως «στολίδι» από τα δύο κράτη. Χαρακτηριστικά, το πλήρωμα της Air France προσκλήθηκε αργότερα από τον Πρόεδρο Valéry Giscard d’Estaing για πρωινό στο Μέγαρο των Ηλυσίων.

Τα ηγετικά πρόσωπα και των δύο χωρών πετούσαν συχνά με Concorde, ενώ μια πτήση επίδειξης εντάχθηκε το 2002 στο εορταστικό πρόγραμμα για το Χρυσό Ιωβηλαίο της βασίλισσας Ελισάβετ Β’.

Ταχύτητα που «έγραφε ιστορίες»: διπλή Πρωτοχρονιά, Live Aid και έκλειψη

Η ταχύτητα της Concorde επέτρεψε και επικοινωνιακά «απίθανα» σενάρια, όπως η διπλή αλλαγή έτους: επιβάτες γιόρταζαν Πρωτοχρονιά στο Παρίσι, έπειτα επιβιβάζονταν στην Concorde και την ξαναγιόρταζαν στη Νέα Υόρκη.

Άλλες εμβληματικές στιγμές:

13 Ιουλίου 1985 (Live Aid): ο Phil Collins εμφανίστηκε στο Λονδίνο, πέταξε με Concorde στις ΗΠΑ και έπαιξε ξανά στη Φιλαδέλφεια.

1999: δύο Concorde ακολούθησαν την ολική έκλειψη πάνω από τον Βόρειο Ατλαντικό, «επιμηκύνοντας» το θέαμα για τους επιβάτες.

Παρουσία ακόμη και στην Ανατολική Γερμανία (DDR)

Ακόμη και στην DDR το Concorde έκανε αισθητή την παρουσία της: τον Μάρτιο του 1986, δύο Concorde (μία γαλλική και μία βρετανική) προσγειώθηκαν στη Λειψία για την εκεί τεχνολογική έκθεση.

Μάλιστα, σε ένα τμήμα της διαδρομής επετράπη να πετάξει υπερηχητικά — κάτι που γενικά δεν επιτρεπόταν πάνω από την ευρωπαϊκή ηπειρωτική χώρα.

Ο «αντίπαλος» πίσω από το Σιδηρούν Παραπέτασμα: Tupolev Tu‑144

Υπήρχε ανταγωνισμός πέρα από το Σιδηρούν Παραπέτασμα, και μάλιστα προηγήθηκε χρονικά: τρεις εβδομάδες πριν από την Concorde, στις 29 Δεκεμβρίου 1975, το Tupolev Tu‑144 ξεκίνησε την πρώτη εμπορική της πτήση. Αργότερα, όμως, έγινε γνωστό ότι μετέφερε μόνο φορτίο και όχι επιβάτες.

Οι Σοβιετικοί ήταν πρώτοι σε ορόσημα

Το σχεδιαστικό γραφείο Tupolev ξεκίνησε εργασίες το 1963.

Η Tu‑144 απογειώθηκε για πρώτη φορά στις 31 Δεκεμβρίου 1968, περίπου τρεις μήνες πριν από την Concorde.

Στις 25 Μαΐου 1970 έφτασε ως το πρώτο πολιτικό αεροσκάφος διπλάσια ταχύτητα του ήχου.

Αισθητικά, ο σοβιετικός υπερηχητικός έμοιαζε εντυπωσιακά με τον δυτικό «αντίπαλο», γεγονός που οδήγησε σε υποψίες κατασκοπείας. Η Tu‑144 απέκτησε και παρατσούκλι: «Konkordski».

Concorde vs Tu‑144: ομοιότητες, διαφορές και γιατί κέρδισε το Concorde

Τεχνικά, η Tu‑144 θεωρήθηκε λιγότερο ώριμη από την Concorde. Και οι δύο είχαν πτερύγια δέλτα, όμως:

Στην Concorde, τα πτερύγια ήταν αεροδυναμικά πιο ευνοϊκά, προσφέροντας πλεονεκτήματα στην πτήση χαμηλής ταχύτητας.

Στην Tu‑144, το δέλτα ήταν πιο απλής μορφής. Για τις χαμηλές ταχύτητες αναπτύσσονταν πίσω από το κόκπιτ δύο μικρά canard. Αυτά βοηθούσαν, αλλά αύξαναν το βάρος.

Το Concorde διέθετε πιο σύγχρονους, ηλεκτρονικά/υπολογιστικά ελεγχόμενους κινητήρες, μεγαλύτερη εμβέλεια και χαμηλότερο θόρυβο σε σύγκριση με την Tu‑144.

Στο τέλος, η Tu‑144 δεν έγινε πραγματικός ανταγωνιστής:

Το 1973 το πρώτο μοντέλο σειράς, Tu‑144S, συνετρίβη σε πτήση επίδειξης στο Paris Air Show.

Η επόμενη έκδοση, Tu‑144D, πήρε φωτιά σε δοκιμαστική πτήση στις 23 Μαΐου 1978 και πραγματοποίησε αναγκαστική προσγείωση.

Η κυβέρνηση διέκοψε το πρόγραμμα μετά από μόλις 102 πτήσεις, εκ των οποίων 55 με επιβάτες.

Οι περιορισμοί της Concorde: θόρυβος, εμβέλεια και πραγματική οικονομία

Το Concorde συνέχισε να πετάει, αλλά δεν ήταν ένα «εύκολο» αεροσκάφος.

Θόρυβος και περιορισμοί υπερηχητικής πτήσης

Ο θόρυβος ήταν κρίσιμος: ήδη από την έναρξη του τακτικού προγράμματος, αρκετές χώρες αντιτάχθηκαν στο θορυβώδες αεροσκάφος. Έτσι, υπερηχητικές πτήσεις επιτρέπονταν κυρίως πάνω από θάλασσα, όπως τον Ατλαντικό.

Περιορισμένη εμβέλεια

Η εμβέλεια ήταν περίπου 6.000 km, περιορίζοντας τις απευθείας συνδέσεις σε σχετικά συγκεκριμένα ζεύγη πόλεων. Τα σημαντικότερα δρομολόγια ήταν:

Παρίσι ή Λονδίνο → Νέα Υόρκη

Η British Airways διατήρησε μέχρι τέλους και εβδομαδιαία πτήση προς Barbados.

Δίκτυο δρομολογίων και συνεργασίες

Κατά τις δεκαετίες 1970–1980:

British Airways: πτήσεις από Λονδίνο προς Μπαχρέιν και Μαϊάμι.

Air France: εκτός από Ρίο, και Καράκας (με ενδιάμεσο στις Αζόρες) καθώς και Ουάσινγκτον.

Και οι δύο είχαν επίσης τη Σιγκαπούρη μέσω συνεργατών.

Το Concorde χρησιμοποιήθηκε και σε charter, επισκεπτόμενη πάνω από 250 αεροδρόμια παγκοσμίως.

Το κόστος

Το πρόβλημα ήταν και οικονομικό: υψηλό κόστος αγοράς και λειτουργίας. Ακόμη και με εισιτήρια από υψηλές τετραψήφιες έως χαμηλές πενταψήφιες τιμές, η λειτουργία για Air France και British Airways είχε νόημα μόνο επειδή για μεγάλο διάστημα επιδοτήθηκε από κυβερνήσεις, για λόγους κύρους.

Άλλες αεροπορικές που είχαν κάνει προπαραγγελίες (συνολικά 17 εταιρείες για 76 αεροσκάφη) αποσύρθηκαν.

Τεχνικά ζητήματα και η «αχίλλειος πτέρνα» των ελαστικών

Το Concorde δεν ήταν πάντα τεχνικά άψογο. Σε ορισμένες περιπτώσεις, σε υπερηχητικές ταχύτητες αποκολλήθηκε τμήμα επένδυσης του κάθετου σταθερού/πτερυγίου διεύθυνσης. Όμως το μεγαλύτερο ρίσκο αποδείχθηκαν τα ελαστικά — και αυτά έμελλε να οδηγήσουν στο πιο καθοριστικό γεγονός της ιστορίας της.

Το δυστύχημα της 25ης Ιουλίου 2000 και οι αλλαγές

Στις 25 Ιουλίου 2000, μια Concorde, κατά την απογείωση από το Paris Charles de Gaulle, πάτησε ένα μεταλλικό κομμάτι που είχε πέσει από αεροσκάφος της τότε αμερικανικής εταιρείας Continental Airlines.

Το μεταλλικό τμήμα προκάλεσε έκρηξη ελαστικού. Θραύσματα εκτοξεύτηκαν, προκάλεσαν ζημιά σε δεξαμενή καυσίμου, το καύσιμο διέρρευσε και πήρε φωτιά. Το αεροσκάφος συνετρίβη φλεγόμενο σε ξενοδοχείο κοντά στο αεροδρόμιο.

Απολογισμός:

109 άνθρωποι (όλοι οι επιβαίνοντες)

4 άνθρωποι στο έδαφος

Αμέσως, όλες οι Concorde ακινητοποιήθηκαν. Μετά τον εντοπισμό της αιτίας, έγιναν αλλαγές:

ενίσχυση δεξαμενών καυσίμου

νέα, πιο ανθεκτικά ελαστικά από τη Michelin

Επιστροφή στις πτήσεις, αλλά σε λάθος εποχή

Στις 27 Νοεμβρίου 2001, Air France και British Airways επανεκκίνησαν τις πτήσεις προς τη Νέα Υόρκη. Όμως μετά τις επιθέσεις της 11ης Σεπτεμβρίου, η αεροπορία εισήλθε σε βαθιά κρίση.

Παράλληλα, τα πλέον ηλικιωμένα Concorde απαιτούσαν αυξημένη συντήρηση και τεχνική φροντίδα, καθιστώντας τη λειτουργία ακόμη πιο ασύμφορη.

Το τέλος της Concorde (2003)

Στις 10 Απριλίου 2003, οι Air France και British Airways ανακοίνωσαν ότι θα αποσύρουν την Concorde.

Τελευταίες τακτικές πτήσεις:

Air France: 27 Ιουνίου 2003

British Airways: 24 Οκτωβρίου 2003

Η τελευταία πτήση Concorde πραγματοποιήθηκε στις 26 Νοεμβρίου 2003: μεταφορά του αεροσκάφους με νηολόγιο G‑BOAF από το London Heathrow στο Filton, στο εργοστάσιο του κατασκευαστή.

Η γοητεία παραμένει: μουσεία, προστασία και νέα υπερηχητικά σχέδια

Η γοητεία της Concorde δεν έσβησε. Πριν από περίπου δέκα χρόνια, υπήρξαν προσπάθειες από ενθουσιώδεις να την «αναβιώσουν».

Εν τω μεταξύ, η Γαλλία έθεσε την πρώτη Concorde υπό καθεστώς προστασίας μνημείου το προηγούμενο έτος.

Σήμερα, 18 από τις 20 που κατασκευάστηκαν συνολικά, βρίσκονται ως εκθέματα σε μουσεία ή αεροδρόμια, μεταξύ άλλων σε Γαλλία και Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο.

Ένα τέτοιο μπορεί να θαυμάσει κανείς και στο Μουσείο Τεχνολογίας στο Sinsheim στη Βάδη-Βυρτεμβέργη, μάλιστα δίπλα σε ένα Tupolev Tu‑144.

Παράλληλα, βρίσκονται σε εξέλιξη αρκετά προγράμματα νέων πολιτικών υπερηχητικών αεροσκαφών. Η αμερικανική εταιρεία Boom Supersonic έχει κατασκευάσει πρωτότυπο, το οποίο σε δοκιμές στις αρχές του 2025 έσπασε το φράγμα του ήχου.

Το κανονικό υπερηχητικό επιβατικό της αεροσκάφος αναμένεται να είναι έτοιμο για υπηρεσία το 2029.

Τι μας έμαθε το Concorde και τι πρέπει να λυθεί για να επιστρέψουν οι υπερηχητικές πτήσεις

Το Concorde άφησε μια κληρονομιά πολύ μεγαλύτερη από την εικόνα της πολυτέλειας.

Πρώτα απ’ όλα, απέδειξε ότι η υπερηχητική μεταφορά επιβατών είναι τεχνικά εφικτή σε τακτική βάση, αλλά μόνο όταν συνδυάζονται τρία στοιχεία: ακραία μηχανική ακρίβεια, αυστηρή ασφάλεια και ένα οικονομικό μοντέλο που αντέχει το υψηλό κόστος καυσίμου και συντήρησης.

Η τεχνολογία της (υλικά, αεροδυναμική, θερμική διαχείριση σε υψηλές ταχύτητες) επηρέασε έμμεσα σύγχρονα προγράμματα αεροναυπηγικής, ακόμη κι αν δεν οδηγούσε άμεσα σε «Concorde 2».

Το βασικό εμπόδιο για την επιστροφή των υπερηχητικών πτήσεων παραμένει ο ηχητικός κρότος (sonic boom). Οι περιορισμοί που επιβλήθηκαν ιστορικά στις υπερηχητικές πτήσεις πάνω από ξηρά δεν ήταν απλώς γραφειοκρατικοί: συνδέονται με όχληση, πιθανές υλικές ζημιές και κοινωνική αποδοχή.

Γι’ αυτό και σήμερα βλέπουμε έρευνα σε σχεδιάσεις «χαμηλού κρότου», ώστε ο θόρυβος να μοιάζει περισσότερο με ένα μακρινό «χτύπημα» παρά με εκκωφαντική έκρηξη.

Σε αυτό το πλαίσιο, η NASA έχει επενδύσει σε πειραματικά προγράμματα που εξετάζουν πώς ο σχεδιασμός της ατράκτου μπορεί να μειώσει δραστικά την ακουστική υπογραφή.

Το δεύτερο μεγάλο στοίχημα είναι η βιωσιμότητα. Τα υπερηχητικά καταναλώνουν παραδοσιακά περισσότερο καύσιμο ανά επιβάτη-χιλιόμετρο.

Για να θεωρηθούν εμπορικά και κοινωνικά αποδεκτά, οι νέες προσπάθειες θα πρέπει να αξιοποιήσουν SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), καλύτερους κινητήρες και πιθανώς διαφορετικές επιχειρησιακές πρακτικές (π.χ. βελτιστοποίηση υψομέτρων/διαδρομών).

Παράλληλα, η αγορά-στόχος ίσως δεν είναι η «μαζική μετακίνηση», αλλά ένα premium κοινό που πληρώνει για χρόνο: στελέχη, κυβερνητικές αποστολές ή εξειδικευμένα charter.

Τέλος, η ιστορία της Concorde δείχνει κάτι απλό αλλά κρίσιμο: η τεχνολογία από μόνη της δεν αρκεί. Χρειάζεται ρυθμιστικό πλαίσιο, υποδομές αεροδρομίων και πραγματική ζήτηση.

Αν αυτά ευθυγραμμιστούν, η επόμενη εποχή υπερήχων μπορεί να είναι λιγότερο «μύθος» και περισσότερο καθημερινότητα — αλλά με όρους ασφαλέστερους και πιο βιώσιμους από ποτέ.",https://texnologia.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/concorde-50-chronia-yperichitikon-ptiseon-i-istoria-i-antipalotita-me-tin-tu-144-kai-to-telos-enos-thrylou.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 13:56:47.365447

The plans would require all airline passengers to shoulder an additional charge of several tens of yen while oil refiners and distributors would need to incorporate SAF, made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil, into aviation fuel. The government aims to promote domestically produced SAF from the perspectives of both supply and demand.

The government is expected to compile a basic policy framework to accelerate SAF adoption at an upcoming public-private council meeting, with an eye toward revising the Airport Law, it intends to finalize the details by fiscal 2026.

Compared with conventional jet fuel derived from crude oil, SAF can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 80%. However, procurement costs are widely believed to be 2 to 3 times higher, posing a major hurdle to broader uptake.

To address this gap, some airports in Italy and the United Kingdom subsidize the procurement of SAF with revenue from airport user fees. The European Union, meanwhile, requires SAF blending in fuel used at airports across the bloc and has set a goal of increasing the blending rate targets of a 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. The Japanese government plans to reference these examples when creating its own system.

The basic policy is also expected to specify robust capital investment support for suppliers along with cooperation with municipalities and collection firms to expand the recovery of used household cooking oil.

Amid the global tightening of regulations on CO2 emissions from air transport, SAF is increasingly seen as key to decarbonization in the aviation industry.

Introduction

When people think of Wisconsin, they often think of great cheese, the Green Bay Packers, brats, and, well, winter. What is often overlooked are the legacy industries – and their people – that built the state and underwrote America’s meteoric rise. These industries have provided great jobs and carried communities for over a century. Chief among these forgotten industries is forestry.

Wisconsin holds many advantages that do not get enough attention. Our proximity to the world via Lake Superior, Lake Michigan, and the Mississippi River as well as elite natural resources on and under our grounds. This isn’t just rocks and logs. They are critical advantages that we hold from our geography. In the 19th Century, Wisconsin’s lead mining boom, and proximity to transportation, helped the United States undercut European markets and American reliance upon them. This led to great economic gains and strategic independence making America a force to be reckoned with.

Timber may not seem pressing, but history has shown us that the raw materials required to build society are critical. In the early 1900’s, Japan had identified the large industrial value of timber by colonizing Korea. By rapidly feeding its imperial economy, Japan became an industrial powerhouse in the lead up to World War II. This is not to say that our forests will prepare us for war, but they can provide the economic opportunity and manufacturing dominance that could prevent one. Having industrial capacity and capability reduces leverages against our interests. For too long, we have neglected these advantages.

Our woods need more management. Conservationists who spend much of their time recreating and hunting our big timber tracts have commonly cited the presence of old-growth, or over-mature, forests that are becoming less hospitable to wildlife and more challenging for access. There is growing concern about the challenges of our state’s industry as well, including the impact on the state economy, rural prosperity, and health of forests in general.

State of the Woods

Wisconsin’s woods are large, and they are healthy. Almost 40% of Wisconsin’s landscape is covered in forests, a total equalling roughly 17 million acres. Further, our annual growth of forestland is double the volume we remove. This highlights the sustainability of forestry practices and the unrealized capacity to do more. Today, we cannot allow forests to renew themselves with fires. This requires active management to maintain productive forests. Forests that are growing are healthy while over-mature forests benefit no one. Our forests require management to remain healthy, reduce risk of forest fire, and continue providing exceptional habitat for wildlife.

State of the Forestry Industry

Wisconsin’s loggers and forestry industry have built and sustained whole communities and the families that inhabit them. Forestry, wood, and paper industries have deep roots in our rural economy and culture. A healthy forest industry is critical to our ability to sustain resilient forests, recreation, and wildlife habitat that underwrites our massive outdoor industry.

Wisconsin’s forestry industry and its related sectors account for over 11% of the state’s total manufacturing jobs.[8] Pound for pound, its reputable nationwide. For those working in the forest product industry, annual incomes average around $81,000 – ahead of the state average of $67,000. For the loggers, wages hover around $64,000 annually, below the state’s average. Plus, for every 100 jobs in the forest products sector there are an additional 122 jobs supported in other sectors of the economy. This multi-billion-dollar export industry is one to be proud of and one to protect.

The Bad News

Forestry and its related sectors are in decline. Since 2001, jobs have been consistently decreasing. In the paper industry 73% of jobs are gone, in wood building materials its 50%, and in sawmill employment, the figure is 27% over the last quarter century. In smaller communities and rural counties these losses are magnified. The loss of employment ripples through to sectors that are intertwined to forestry. As the jobs go, so too does population. These further strains smaller school districts, the viability of having a grocery store, and the literal survival of a town if new sectors do not emerge.

For example, in 2020 when the Verso plant closed in Wisconsin Rapids, 25% of pulpwood processing disappeared. That loss, among others, ripples through the entire state’s forestry economy. Between 2014 and 2021, there had already been a 20% harvest decrease in the Northern region, a negative trend before another plant had even closed.

The impacts on local and county budgets cannot be ignored. Faced with demographic challenges, rising costs of providing services, operating expenses, and infrastructure upgrades are placing high burdens on residents. Counties have traditionally relied upon timber sales as a consistent source of revenue. This revenue has been dropping, with an especially stark 22% decrease between 2022 and 2023. To adjust for these losses, state aid or property taxes become the only alternatives.

New Opportunities

Aviation Fuel

So, what is there to do? There are more options than one may immediately consider. A new market opportunity for our timber industry may be refining sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, to meet European demand. Aviation fuel used in European Union nations requires 20% of their aviation fuel to be sustainable by 2035. That percentage is expected to grow.

Wisconsin has been identified as a prime location to meet this need. A German organization is working to make Hayward the home of a $1.5 billion pulpwood facility. To finalize this investment, members of the Wisconsin Legislature introduced Senate Bill 456 – The Forestry Revitalization Act. Through a combination of tax credits and bonds paid through the already existing forestry account, Wisconsin could land this historic investment.

This bill would require that 80% of all wood material be sourced from Wisconsin forests. That means a new demand for Wisconsin’s loggers, truckers, operators, as well as their families and local communities. At the facility, which would be the North American headquarters, there would be an influx of over 150, well paying, new jobs.

The bill holds a significant amount of claw backs to protect taxpayers if the project stalls or funding from the company fails. It is estimated that the state, through credits and bonds, would need $200 million to secure this new investment. This is no small dollar amount but the bill deserves real consideration by the full legislature.

In 2023, Wisconsin passed a package that included over $500 million in public spending to upgrade American Family Field for the Milwaukee Brewers. In 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks secured $250 million in taxpayer funds for a new stadium as well. Over the span of 8 years, Milwaukee professional sports teams celebrated over $750 million in tax commitments. Northern Wisconsin deserves the same consideration, especially considering that the investment focuses on Wisconsin’s forestry workers and not billionaire sports owners.

Energy Production

More attention should be given to the viability of power generation from biomass. Arguably the state’s largest renewable resource, biomass accounts for a large percentage of Wisconsin’s renewable energy portfolio. As of 2017, biomass had accounted for a majority of renewable energy production here.[16] In many towns, biomass has powered schools and government buildings for decades. This type of energy use helps mitigate rising energy costs for taxpayers and reduces the unpredictable market swings of natural gas, propane, and grid upgrades.

Gundersen Health in La Crosse became the first known healthcare organization to achieve energy independence in 2014. Biomass played a significant role in this accomplishment. Creating heat and electricity with wood biomass has saved the organization around $500,000 per year. More efforts should consider the use of woody biomass to lower the costs of healthcare and public entity operating costs.

Processing and Manufacturing

As technology continues to evolve rapidly, manufacturing processes are becoming more efficient. Efforts to reshore industrial capacity to the United States also involves the expansion of intermediate and final processing of forestry products. Wisconsin and its universities should continue to study and welcome new opportunities in this sector.

Currently, much of Wisconsin’s forest harvest is exported in low-value form like logs to China. Tightening the supply chain of timber products can capture more value here at home. This type of opportunity brings more jobs and prosperity to our rural communities.

Conclusion

Wisconsin’s long legacy of the forestry industry is one to be proud and protective of. While our forests continue to grow at a rapid pace, our harvests and the associated jobs around it are consistently declining. This disproportionally impacts our northern and rural areas of the state. Opportunities do exist to welcome new investments and ideas to turn this tide. Our local communities deserve attention to flex their forestry industry once again before it’s too late.

Failure to capture new investments will cause permanent job losses and put our communities in a position that other areas of the state cannot imagine. From new fuel sources, energy production and manufacturing opportunities, the industry is ready for disruption.

Here’s the background.

In 2018 and 2023, the Legislature passed laws setting targets to achieve “net zero” CO2 emissions from ground, air and sea transportation in Hawaii by 2045. There was no plan, no cost estimates nor determination of feasibility.

In 2022, Oregon-based and Hawaii-based lawfare entities filed a lawsuit (“Navahine vs. HDOT”) on behalf of 13 Hawaii youth, alleging that the Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT) was making insufficient progress on the net zero target. At the time of the lawsuit, two of the children were ages 10 and 13. Some would say great that the keiki were involved; others would say they were exploited.

In 2024, the state entered into an out-of-court settlement agreement with the entities. It turns out that Our Children’s Trust has filed similar suits in all 50 states; Hawaii is the only state to have caved in. One observer commented, “This is monumentally undemocratic and elected officials had no business settling this suit. What the state agreed to is ludicrous.” Indeed, a Montana judge dismissed a virtually similar lawsuit in that state.

In 2025 and as mandated, HDOT somehow developed a plan strangely titled, “Hawaii Energy Security and Waste Reduction Plan.” The plan is 258 pages long, essentially drawing emission reduction line graphs for each transportation sector, making sweeping assumptions/mandates. Remarkably, the plan doesn’t quantify the economic costs.

The plan calls for the sale of new cars and trucks to reach 80% electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030 and 100% by 2035. Is this even remotely realistic given the current status of EV sales (12% of total), no doubt declining without the federal subsidy? The plan is silent on assuming that residents will voluntarily buy much more expensive EVs, but nowhere near those percentages will be achievable without state mandates. One can only imagine the statewide repudiation of such dictates.

For air transportation, the plan calls for converting from Jet-A to costly “sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF) for fueling both interisland and outbound airliners; fuel would be derived from plants, most likely grown in South America or Indonesia. By 2035, 50% of jet fuel uploads must be SAF, and 100% by 2045. By HDOT’s own admission, SAF currently costs three to five times more than Jet-A; the cost will no doubt be passed on to airline customers. Another cost-of-living blow to Hawaii residents.

For the marine sector, the plan targets cruise ships that self-power when in Hawaii ports and during transit, with an exception for homeported ships. A draft of the plan called for reducing cruise ship calls to Hawaii by 50% by 2030 and 75% by 2035; the final projects a 95% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2045, apparently achieved in large part by a de facto ban on cruise ships not powered by liquefied natural gas. Does it make any sense to inflict significant damage to local businesses from a tourism source with low impact?

So where does all of this leave us? In a pickle. Before spending taxpayer dollars for such things as $300 million for bikeways, the Legislature should hit pause, investigate and hold hearings. The plan states, “For the emission reduction strategy to be supported by the public, approved, and actually implemented, they must not be so economically extreme that they make Hawaii unaffordable for its residents.” We believe many residents are already there, and implementation of this plan will only worsen the problem.

Yes, we should all work to reduce transportation sector emissions to the maximum extent practical. But the plan clearly exposes the net zero laws to be both impractical and imprudent. Leaving the net zero laws on the books, without amendment, would be a huge disservice to Hawaii’s residents.",https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/web1_CTY-power-up-hi-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 14:56:32.334165

Nairobi’s evolution as a hub easily illustrates how strategic aviation infrastructure can amplify a country’s economic reach.
Ultimately, the direction of African aviation in 2026 will be shaped by choices made collectively.","By the end of 2025, Africa’s air passenger traffic was estimated at about 192 million, a number that is projected to exceed 411 million by 2044, as per data from the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA’s) 2026 outlook for Africa.

This 4.1 percent annual growth signals a structural shift, where Africa grows and integrates into global trade, with aviation becoming less of a luxury infrastructure and more of a foundational system for economic participation.

African aviation stands at a strategic inflection point anchored in robust demand fundamentals, including a rebounding tourism sector following a period of post-pandemic recovery. Business travel is thriving with air cargo underpinning key export sectors ranging from horticulture to textiles.

Together, these dynamics point to an African aviation future that is driven by strong structural demand.

However, sustaining this momentum will depend on how effectively growth is pursued, and this will include the development of a thriving intra-Africa travel environment.

Today, travel between African cities often involves longer routes, higher costs and more complex itineraries than comparable journeys in many other places across the world, reflecting regulatory fragmentation, infrastructure gaps and cost structures that constrain the development of efficient networks.

As Africa advances the objectives of the African Continental Free Trade Area, domestic aviation must evolve in parallel, enabling the movement of people and goods across borders with far greater ease.

In this context, the relationship between African carriers and international airline groups stands out. Top global airlines have long been part of the continent’s aviation ecosystem, providing connectivity and access to international markets. Their success in the region is closely tied to the strength of local partners and institutions.

In 2026 and going forward, the most durable growth will come from cooperation across countries and airlines that build capacity and align incentives. Code-sharing arrangements, joint ventures, training partnerships and maintenance collaboration can strengthen local aviation ecosystems while expanding choice and reliability for passengers.

Financial sustainability also remains a decisive factor with airlines in Africa operating in one of the most challenging commercial environments globally, facing high fuel costs, currency volatility, constrained access to financing and, in many markets, taxes and charges that exceed international norms.

And while several carriers have recently made impressive progress in restoring operational stability, balance sheets remain fragile. The return to loss of some airlines after periods of profitability underscores how narrow the margin for error remains. Strengthening airline finances, therefore, remains a prerequisite for growth, amidst toughening operational environments.

Meanwhile, sustainability will continue to shape investment decisions because although aviation’s climate challenge is global, Africa has the opportunity to engage with it from a position of foresight rather than reaction.

Several African countries are already exploring sustainable aviation fuel pathways linked to agriculture, waste and renewable energy, and with more support, the continent could play a meaningful role in the global transition to lower-carbon aviation, while safeguarding growth and connectivity.

Infrastructure will quietly determine whether these ambitions can be realised. Indeed, aside from being transit points, airports are platforms for trade, tourism and employment, with investments in terminals, air traffic management and cargo facilities yielding returns that extend far beyond aviation itself.

Nairobi’s evolution as a hub easily illustrates how strategic aviation infrastructure can amplify a country’s economic reach.

Ultimately, the direction of African aviation in 2026 will be shaped by choices made collectively. Governments will need to balance national interests with regional integration.

Airlines, both African and international, will need to invest with patience and partnership in mind, and investors will need to recognise that aviation infrastructure and networks take time to mature.

Be union,Not Available,,,,,https://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/article/reflections-wapping-employers-come-together-prepare-so-should-we-be-union,"The acts of betrayal and the violence launched against them by the state still leave a very bitter taste today.
It is never too early to prepare, and we have to recognise that in some instances there is nothing some employers won’t do and indeed some governments won’t do.
It is only the trade union movement that can collectively ensure workers get their piece of the pie.
We want to prepare for what is coming down the track in the next five to 10 years.
Unite will continue to tell the government that it needs to deliver the jobs for workers to transition into.","ON JANUARY 24 1986 over 5,500 workers at News International went on strike. They had been provoked by Rupert Murdoch, who planned to sack them “en masse” using Thatcher’s new anti-union laws.

Overnight, the production of the Times, Sunday Times, Sun and News of the World moved from Fleet Street’s hot-metal presses to a high-security site in Wapping. Planned, set up in secret, ready and waiting for these newspapers to be printed using new technology and a much smaller workforce under a no-strike deal and subsequently distributed under police protection.

There are many lessons that can be learnt from the origins of this dispute. The solidarity, determination and spirit of the striking workers and their supporters was without question. The acts of betrayal and the violence launched against them by the state still leave a very bitter taste today. There is also no doubt the co-ordination and planning between Murdoch and the government meant that when the dispute began many possible levers originally available to the workers had been taken away.

As trade unionists this is something we should keep at the centre of our minds when we try to address the challenges that we can see coming up for workers in the years ahead. It is never too early to prepare, and we have to recognise that in some instances there is nothing some employers won’t do and indeed some governments won’t do.

Planning for a response to what could happen when the employer takes on workers is the key to winning. Widening and deepening the collective. Strike ready, yes, but also using our brains as well as our brawn. Understanding where our levers are — where our power is. Who are the real decision-makers and how can they be moved?

Take the new wave of AI and automation. This will radically change the world of work, and it has the capacity to put millions of jobs at risk. Just think of the potential impact of autonomous vehicles on the one million people employed as professional road transport drivers in the UK. We cannot wait until employers have self-driving vehicles in place before we act. We need to anticipate the future realities of the labour market right now, while the power is in the workplace to fight back.

This can’t be done piecemeal — it must be done by sector, building combines, developing multiple areas of support and creating real co-ordination. Winning is based on hard work, not easy talk and idle opinions. No employer or politician will simply hand workers a good deal — we will have to fight for it.

We all know that technological change is inevitable. The question is whether it will be used to improve the lives of workers, or simply to concentrate wealth and deepen inequality.

The financial gains from technology are predicted to be measured in billions. It is only the trade union movement that can collectively ensure workers get their piece of the pie.

In Unite we have begun the work of building combines. Reps coming together by sector, locking in organisers to build collective strength if needed and lock in our industrial, legal, research and leverage teams. We want to prepare for what is coming down the track in the next five to 10 years. How can we widen and deepen the collective and get agreements now for the issues of the future?

Similarly, as we look at immediate issues like the transition to net zero. We of course understand the issues, but we can’t have a jobless transition. Where are the much-promised new green jobs for oil and gas workers?

We face a loss of around 30,000 oil and gas jobs in the North Sea by 2030. Unite has put forward plans to create jobs in the manufacture of our own wind turbines and to convert refineries to make Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). These plans would protect workers’ livelihoods and the environment.

However, the government has just sat on its hands while two of our six refineries have been shut and the new wind farms we see are being populated with turbines manufactured in Denmark and Germany.

Unite will continue to tell the government that it needs to deliver the jobs for workers to transition into. But we will also work with our oil and gas workers so we are ready to act industrially, if necessary, while the decision-makers are dependent on them.

As the great American union leader Joe Hill said with his final words “Don’t mourn — organise.” As we mark the 40th anniversary of the beginning of the Wapping dispute, his epitaph should be our guide.

It is clear the power of workers is in their trade unions. There is no knight on a white horse coming over the hill to save us, no matter the colour of their rosette.

It’s time to be union.
