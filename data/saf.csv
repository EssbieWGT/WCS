While the program was already revenue-based for Avios accrual, this latest overhaul eliminates the traditional Tier Points system entirely, moving to a fully dynamic, revenue-based model—with absurdly high spend requirements.

British Airways Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Contribution For Tier Points – Now Live

I’ve shared my experience of trying to squeeze in a few final Tier Point-earning flights before the change took effect.

My Journey To 35,000 British Airways Tier Points Before March 31, 2025, Program Massacre

My BA flight last Monday posted correctly under the old system. However, an earlier Finnair flight (part of the same itinerary) posted yesterday with bizarre new Tier Points:

British Airways Flight Posting Experience After the Switch from Executive Club to “The Club” with Lifetime Tier Points Conversion

This was the second-to-last leg of a round-the-world trip I booked last year, originating in Cairo at a great price.

Oneworld Business RTW Trip Frequent Flier Program Crediting Dilemma

The Finnair segment should have posted with the same (new) Tier Points as the BA segment—but it didn’t.

To make things even more confusing:

It shows 80 Tier Points earned toward next year’s status (which was the old amount).

Yet the incorrect number of new Tier Points was added to my lifetime tally.

These Tier Points should have been credited to last year’s earnings. That matters, because with just a few more, I could qualify for one more “joker”—a perk that lets you open award inventory even when it’s otherwise unavailable (earned after 6,000 old Tier Points).

The lifetime tally isn’t impacted for me personally, as I’m now over the 550,000 Tier Points required under the new rules. But I’ll never qualify for GGLfL (Gold Guest List for Life); the revenue requirements are, frankly, insane.

The Bigger Problem with Revenue-Based Programs

This is the issue with revenue-based loyalty schemes: you have to micromanage every itinerary to ensure correct crediting. What happened here with Finnair is a perfect example.

UPDATE: Reminder To Audit Your Finnair Flight Postings For Discrepancies: Case Helsinki – Doha (Resolved)

Conclusion

I’m certain I’m not alone—there are likely many “The Club” members who have received too few Avios or Tier Points, just as I’ve been credited with far too many.

If you reissue, change, or encounter irregular operations, revenue-based systems often fail to account for it accurately. You must audit every single flight post to ensure accuracy.

In my case, I received 17,612 excess New Tier Points (at least toward lifetime status). BA also appears unable to properly credit flights taken before April 1 but posted after—leading to major discrepancies across lifetime, last year’s, and current year’s Tier Point balances.

Regional airports and local governments across the country face these continuing challenges.","ALGA News recently sat down with aviation expert and Hales North Managing Director Sara Hales to discuss local government’s key role in the future of regional airports across Australia. Ms Hales highlighted that many regional airports, largely owned by local governments, are facing significant changes and challenges.

ALGA: As you know, local governments manage and maintain many regional airports around the nation. Tell us your thoughts about how the future is looking for these important aviation assets?

Sara Hales (SH): Over the next 20 years, regional airports must deal with unprecedented change. Hundreds of new aircraft types are under development, which range across fuel types, propulsion systems, mission types and crew requirements.

The promise of electric aviation to reduce operational costs suggests a possible resurgence of intra-regional aviation and growth in general aviation. This could drive increased demand on regional airport infrastructure.

However, the mix of fleet will change, and so will customer needs. Consideration must be given to provision of alternative fuels, electric recharging and battery storage, hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel infrastructure. Local governments must also assess the provision of aircraft pavements, movement areas, procedures and airspace protection to support emerging aircraft types.

Many regional airports must navigate these changes with constrained cashflow and often poor financial performance. While vital to their communities – supporting business, trade, investment, health, and emergency services – they often operate at a financial loss.

ALGA: We know councils are at the forefront of climate action so how will this issue affect our airports?

SH: Climate change will continue to impact this sector, presenting both risks and opportunities. Community dependence upon aviation and airport assets will compound as regions deal with increasingly frequent fires, floods and other severe weather impacts. Changing climate conditions will also affect infrastructure lifespan, requiring adaptive planning.

Importantly, the global aviation industry will continue its march towards net zero 2050, driving airports to adapt their asset renewal and investment strategies. Carbon emissions that are free today may come at a cost tomorrow, influencing financial and operational decisions.

Thought must be given to supporting airline customers to decarbonise their operations. Shifts such as move towards electric ground handling equipment, provision of pre-conditioned air and electricity to aircraft on bay, changes to flight procedures to reduce fuel burn and consideration to taxiway gradients that support single engine taxi are all themes that regional airports much seek to accommodate.

ALGA: Gazing into your crystal ball, what does the future of regional aviation look like?

SH: In the future, aviation will likely be more important to more people and communities. Regional aviation will likely increase.

Workforce availability and retention will be ongoing challenges, alongside new responsibilities like carbon accounting and reporting. The geopolitical environment remains uncertain, and long-term capital allocation decisions must factor in emerging risks. Meanwhile, digital transformation will accelerate, with smart technologies like digital twins and Internet of Things (IoT) devices increasingly adopted, and consideration given to heightened cybersecurity threats, including AI-driven risks.

While airports can be costly, they are critical infrastructure and local gateways: difficult to replace and essential to future economic and social wellbeing and community resilience of communities. This is the strategic planning landscape for many regional airports.

ALGA: How can local government manage the financial burden of running these important community assets? How can they improve financial sustainability, enhance climate resilience, support changing customer needs and strengthen community economic and social wellbeing?

SH: Strategic planning considers these impacts in the context of the community the airport serves, identifying opportunities and risks, and aligning infrastructure investment with financial realities.

Strategic planning also involves legacy infrastructure, future proofing assets, optimising operations, and strengthening financial performance through developing productive and collaborative relationships with others. It focuses on leveraging both aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue, managing risks, attracting investment, and identifying opportunities to improve cash flow.

Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter famously said: “The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do”. This is highly relevant to the airports, which, in our high-cost regulatory environment, cannot afford to be all things to all people.

ALGA: What is your expert advice for councils managing small airports and aerodromes?

SH: By focusing on core strengths and excluding distractions, resources can be effectively allocated to ensure success. A prime example is Virgin Australia’s remarkable turnaround, achieved through strategic clarity and disciplined execution.

Regional airports and local governments across the country face these continuing challenges.

Mayman Aerospace RAZOR VTOL achieves autonomous inaugural flight: Mayman Aerospace announced the successful completion of test flights for the RAZOR P100, which will be the first commercial aircraft in the company’s family of autonomous UAS. The achievement marks a major milestone not only for RAZOR but for the company’s strategic vision and market position. The test program, conducted at the US Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Centre located at Twentynine Palms, CA validated 18 months of meticulous engineering and development efforts. Most notably, the tests included the successful inaugural untethered flights of the RAZOR P100, which operated with complete autonomy while executing complex flight manoeuvres that demonstrated the sophisticated capabilities of RAZOR’s proprietary flight control software called SKYFIELD. SKYFIELD, the company’s advanced AI-driven autonomous flight control system, will enable numerous RAZOR aircraft to navigate complex environments without human intervention, making critical adjustments in real-time based on operational conditions. This autonomous AI-driven decision-making capability will also allow the platform to adapt to changing mission parameters and environmental factors with precision and reliability. In addition to the P100’s series of tests, the program featured the first extended range flight of the RAZOR TBX, while successfully carrying a payload of 50 pounds. This fully autonomous beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) operation marked the 26th flight for the TBX platform, which continues to serve as both a reliable workhorse and an invaluable testbed for ongoing research and development initiatives.

Avelo Airlines implements MINT Training Management System: MINT Software Systems announced the successful implementation of MINT TMS for the startup commercial airline Avelo Airlines. Avelo launched MINT’s solution in September of 2024, complete with third-party integrations, executing this project in just eighteen months. The first nine-month phase of this project was for Avelo’s flight crew, and the second nine-month phase expanded the project to cover the inflight crew and integrations. MINT TMS is a web-based training management system that helps aviation operators comply with regulations by simplifying every part of the training cycle. In addition to qualification management, MINT TMS uses intelligent decision-making in its algorithm to forecast, plan, and optimize training schedules to cut costs, reduce labor, and better utilize instructors, classrooms, and flight simulator time. MINT TMS’s robust reporting allows training departments to analyse layers of data and uncover important trends to improve training performance. Avelo Airlines also implemented MINT’s PRD add-on to automatically send required pilot training records directly to the FAA’s Pilot Records Database, saving time and reducing human errors. Using MINT’s Calendar Sync add-on, training schedules within MINT TMS are automatically synced with Avelo’s third-party calendar application, eliminating double booking and simplifying operations. Additional integrations between MINT TMS and Avelo’s internal systems improve efficiency by reducing data redundancies.

IATA SAF Registry goes live: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry with its release to the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organization (CADO). The Registry, now live under CADO management, will enable a global market for SAF that will accelerate the transition to net zero emissions by 2050. “Aviation’s decarbonization is a team effort. In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders. It ensures that all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain. The Registry will record the environmental attributes of SAF purchases in an immutable way, safeguarding against double counting. Airlines, their corporate customers, fuel producers, regulatory bodies, and all related organizations will be able to record and account for their SAF transactions in a global market for SAF. While this is of fundamental importance and a historically momentous advance, it is but one step along the way to a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market. The Registry cannot produce miracles on its own, but without it, no miracles can be produced,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

Implications for the Aviation Industry

Asiana Airlines and Korean Air’s merger will change the aviation landscape globally.

Increasing Market Share in Asia

The acquisition increases Korean Air’s market dominance in Asia and abroad. Korean Air is better positioned to compete with regional heavyweights like China Eastern Airlines and Japan Airlines. Incheon Airport in Seoul is anticipated to grow in importance as a worldwide hub and play a major part in international travel.

Advantages for Travellers

The merger will have several positive effects on travellers. A larger route network will give travellers more flexibility in terms of timing and connectivity. A wider network of clients can earn and redeem points. Furthermore, by pooling resources, the airline may make investments in modernised fleets, improved lounges, and enhanced in-flight experiences.

International Collaborations and Regulatory Obstacles

The merger’s effects on airline alliances and regulatory issues are important considerations. Asiana is a member of Star Alliance, and Korean Air is a founding member of SkyTeam. The agreement has been closely examined by competition regulators across several nations, who are worried about diminished competition and possible fare hikes. Reduced competition on some routes may help some rivals, but the merged airline will also be in a stronger position to take on leading carriers globally.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/cropped-142341008_3736125383109174_8967045553856800325_n.png?fit=32%2C32&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-05 22:56:37.045445

We have got in a bit of a habit of holidaying in Dubai every December. Going away during some of the Christmas chaos and getting some winter sun is perfect for us. We choose Dubai because it isn’t too far away, we can always use companion vouchers (as long as we book 355 days in advance) and we know what we are getting; great food, great service, and perfect weather. I know Dubai is 50/50 with a lot of people but I’m not sure what there isn’t to like when you manage expectations. If you want culture there are plenty of other places. If you want a great winter holiday with guaranteed weather, then the UAE is your place!

For the last few years, we have stayed at Le Royal Meridien (rated 11/850 hotels in Dubai), which is classed as being located in the Dubai Marina, but it is situated directly on JBR Beach too. The location works perfectly for us as Dubai Marina is a great place to explore with many restaurants and shops. It is also easy to access most other areas of Dubai by car. We stayed at the far end of The Palm once at the Waldorf Astoria and it just felt like it was a bit too far to get anywhere. It can sometimes take 20-30 minutes to leave The Palm alone.

Le Royal Meridien has been open since 1994 and is one of the original luxury Dubai hotels. You can tell how old it is purely by the fact that it isn’t a huge high rise and is on such a large plot. The good thing is that it doesn’t feel old; it has had numerous upgrades to the rooms and grounds over the years. It has 504 rooms and suites spread across three buildings. It is a Marriott Hotel and we have used points in the past to upgrade. You can also collect points on all spending in the hotel resort during your stay, which is great as the hotel has 14 different restaurants and bars with varying cuisines and styles.

Check In

The reception area is modern, grand and is always spotlessly clean. Every time we walk into this space for the first time, the very recognisable smell reminds us that we’re back to somewhere very familiar. I love that smell!

One downside to flying to Dubai with British Airways is that the two options of flights leave you checking in at either 2am or 10am. The latter is our preferred time, having had an overnight flight, but it does mean that the room is usually not ready, understandably.

The staff, however, are always very welcoming and helpful. During this stay we had two rooms, and one of them was ready, so we could dump our bags, get changed quickly and go and have a much needed nap by the pool whilst the other room was being prepared.

Room

We have stayed in a few different room types over our years of visiting. We were in the Tower Suites for our first year, which includes club access. However, these rooms have had a very large apartment block built in front of them, restricting nearly all sea views. The next year we booked a club room but asked to stay in the suites at the opposite side, which have refurbished rooms and the best views. This was much better for us, despite the fact that the walk to the club lounge was much longer.

Since having our little boy and travelling with Grandparents, we have opted for a larger, connecting room, which is the Super Deluxe 1 Bedroom Suite with Balcony and it is located in the main building.

A tip for this building is that you need to request to be on the far right hand side (if you are standing out the front of the hotel) as these rooms have the best sea view and you can see the big wheel and part of The Palm.

The room is really lovely and spacious and our favourite room we have stayed in so far. You enter into a main living area with a dining table, sofa area and mini bar/drinks station. To the left is a connecting door to the other room we had and straight ahead leads to a long balcony with the previously mentioned stunning sea views.

The bedroom is separate with a large open space, including a bigger bed which was the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in, a desk, sofa and a large wardrobe area hidden behind a wall behind the bed.

The bathroom is modern with a double sink, and plenty of storage, a bath, roomy shower, toilet and bidet. The amenities are Malin and Goetz, which aren’t my favourite, but they’re still a nice brand.

The house keeping staff need to be mentioned, as they really do an excellent job. We were fully stocked with everything we needed, including more water than we’ll ever need, which is so nice to have readily available.

When we were shown to our room by the check in staff, they did ask us what time of day we would like the rooms cleaned in the morning and for turn down service. I thought this was a really nice touch, however, the message wasn’t passed on. It didn’t bother us, but our house keeping clearly took note of our routine anyway and adapted to when he was fairly certain we wouldn’t be there.

Hotel Grounds

The hotel grounds are immaculately kept and regularly updated. As I mentioned before, the hotel is based on a large plot so everything is a little spaced out which is a good thing and doesn’t bother us at all, but for anybody with mobility issues, or just not that into moving too much on holiday, there is a buggy buzzing around to take you to whichever point you need, and there is never usually a wait for it, you can just ask any member of staff to call it for you wherever you are and it’ll arrive within minutes.

There are three pool areas: main pool, infinity pool and childrens pool. We have found with the pool areas that at the time of year we go, you have to chase the sun a little. The high rise apartment block next door casts shade over all of them in the afternoon.

The water is always a little cooler than we would want it to be as well, despite being advertised as heated. It clearly is but maybe not as much as it could be.

There is also an adults only area that is located on a grass area between the three pools, it is always quite quiet there, which I guess is the point.

We spend nearly all of our time on the beach at this hotel. Le Royal has direct access to Jumeirah Beach with a really large private section. Having walked down the beach many times, we’ve always noted how small the other hotels beach areas are, and the loungers are crammed into row upon row.

Le Royal has such a wide beach area, that they have permanent wooden gazebos for each group of loungers, which is usually four between them. Each gazebo has their own buzzer to be able to buzz for service.

The food and drinks menu on the beach and by the pools is extensive and it is usually very speedy, although we have been at busier times where they haven’t had enough staff and they just can’t keep up with the orders. It’s worth mentioning at this point, though, that the staff are the main reason we keep coming back to this hotel specifically. The service is beyond what we would ever expect, and we are treated so well by each and every member of staff we come across. So many of the staff have been there since we first started going to the hotel, which seems strange in what is usually such a low staff retention industry. From speaking to them, they say that they are very well looked after and you can tell they enjoy their jobs.

One important thing to note about the beach is the noise. There are planes constantly flying overhead as the skydiving centre is directly opposite, and there are two beach clubs to the right of the hotel that play music that gets progressively louder throughout the afternoon. It actually doesn’t bother us at all, it’s nice to have background music, and watching the sky divers all day is pretty entertaining, but I can see how some people would not like it, so if you sit much further over to the left of the beach, you can eliminate some of it.

Restaurants

Originally, when coming to Dubai, we would travel out of the hotel every night and explore all of the amazing (but increasingly expensive) restaurants Dubai has to offer. However, since having our toddler with us, we have been including Half Board to our stay and staying at the hotel for most of our dinners. Now, everybody is different, but we just can’t get on board with a buffet dinner. No matter how good the offering is. When we are on holiday we like dinners to be calm and sociable with great service. The buffet at this hotel, Brasserie 2.0, is very highly regarded, and we do hear good things, but we make the most of our half board by using the dine around option. This means that you can visit almost all of the restaurants in the hotel and they have set menus that are totally included, or you can go a la carte and use AED 150 per person towards your bill. Usually with other hotels, we have found the set menus to be limited and boring; however, at Le Royal, the majority of the time, it includes most of what we would have wanted to order anyway, which makes it a very cost effective way to eat in Dubai. They usually include a few premium orders, which is a nice surprise, so you don’t actually feel like you’re eating off a set menu.

Our favourite restaurants are Zengo, which is Asian cuisine and up there with one of the best Asian restaurants we have been to, La Strega an Italian with fantastic pizza and Geales a British fish restaurant. Unfortunately, on this visit Geales was closed as they are have been refurbishing and rebranding it to The Beam. We are hoping it is just as good as before, because it was an exceptionally good place to eat for not only fresh grilled fish, but really delicious fish and chips.

The Half Board can also be used in restaurants in the sister hotel just behind called Grosvenor House. This hotel is directly on the Dubai Marina and has some really excellent places to eat. Plus there is a free shuttle between the two hotels making it very easy to get to. In fact the Dine Around can be used at over 100 restaurants throughout Dubai.

As far as hotel breakfast buffets go, Le Royal do a very good one. Like a lot of these hotels, it can get very busy, especially at peak times. They have quite a good seating system, which means you never wait too long, but it does still feel a little chaotic. There are multiple stations, from pancakes and waffles, to any egg you want, to Middle Eastern Cuisine, so a huge amount of choice, somewhat overwhelming if you’re anything like me!

When Geales was still open, if you stay in one of the suites you can have your breakfast in there. It is much smaller, with less options, but still plenty for what you need and a much calmer environment. I do hope this will be included as part of the new restaurant.

Other Amenities

During our stays here, we have used the gym quite a lot. It’s a great gym, with a range of equipment and dumbbells up to 48kg, which is a big tick for Eugene. It can get busy first thing in the morning, but never to the point that you can’t do a full workout.

The spa is located near the gym and has recently been upgraded. We didn’t use the spa specifically, but Eugene did have a massage. He said the area was nice and calming. It wasn’t one of the best massages he has ever had, so he didn’t feel like it was excellent value for money, although spa treatments in hotels rarely are.

There is also a beautifully designed Beauty Bar.

I mentioned earlier in my review about the Club Lounge. We haven’t used it for a few years as in the evenings it is Adults Only. I would definitely recommend it if you don’t have kids with you though. You can have your Breakfast there, like Geales, it is much smaller than the main buffet but fully caters for what you would need and is very relaxed. They offer afternoon tea between 3pm and 5pm, we haven’t ever done this, as we like to stay on the beach until much later, but it would be nice if you needed to get out of the sun. The biggest benefit, though is the pre-dinner drinks between 6pm and 8pm. We all know that Dubai is very expensive for alcohol, so Eugene and I used to very much enjoy a couple of drinks before dinner and it felt like we were getting very good value for the extra we had paid for Club access. They also offer a small buffet in the evening of canapes and light bites which some people have told us they can feel like they have had a full dinner from.

The kids club is open 10am to 7pm for children between the ages of 4 and 12. We haven’t been able to use it as our boy is too young, but it looks like a lot of fun and a very safe environment.

Conclusion

We really do have the best time when we stay at Le Royal Meridien. The main reasons are that we feel taken care of by the staff and it’s also the convenience. The fact that it is located so close to Dubai Marina and easy to get to the rest of Dubai is a huge bonus, but also the fact that if you aren’t doing a really long holiday, you don’t need to leave the hotel at all because of the large range of restaurants and the value of the Half Board.

Whilst looking for other hotels in Dubai, we also haven’t seen a beach area that can compete with Le Royal’s unless you go a bit further out.

We are definitely keen to try some other hotels around Dubai, but the key thing for us to beat is the restaurant choice and beach area, so if you have any recommendations, let us know!

Na última sexta-feira (28), ocorreu a primeira reunião técnica do Grupo de Trabalho (GT) de Transportes do BRICS, por videoconferência. O encontro, que reúne representantes do Brasil, Rússia, Índia, China e África do Sul, focou em discussões sobre transporte sustentável e conectividade aérea, alinhando prioridades que serão apresentadas na cúpula prevista para julho, no Rio de Janeiro.

O Ministério de Portos e Aeroportos (MPor) do Brasil destacou suas iniciativas voltadas à sustentabilidade nos modais de transporte, com ênfase na mobilidade urbana. Entre os tópicos em pauta, a redução de gases poluentes e a promoção de energias limpas no setor aéreo foram destacados. O Brasil, que é precursor na produção de combustíveis sustentáveis para aviação, apresentou suas ações, como a implementação de fábricas de petróleo sintético para criar o Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

O GT também discutiu a descarbonização dos portos e do transporte marítimo, propondo a adoção de combustíveis de baixo carbono, alinhando-se assim às metas da Organização Marítima Internacional para diminuir as emissões de Gases de Efeito Estufa (GEEs). Uma das propostas que surgiu foi a criação de um sistema de suprimento energético diretamente dos portos para os navios, uma solução potencial para melhorar a eficiência energética na navegação.

Outro ponto significante da reunião foi a proposta de uma Aliança Logística Internacional do BRICS, destinada a promover uma logística mais ágil e eficaz em situações de emergência humanitária. O grupo se baseou em eventos recentes, como a tragédia no Rio Grande do Sul, para justificar a necessidade de uma resposta mais rápida em situações similares.

Com a presidência brasileira do bloco iniciada em janeiro, o GT de Transportes do BRICS tem mais duas reuniões programadas para abril e maio deste ano, culminando em uma reunião ministerial em Brasília que deve apresentar os resultados alcançados. Esta movimentação pretende preparar o terreno para a 17ª cúpula dos BRICS, que ocorrerá em julho. O Brasil definirá como tema central desta cúpula ""Fortalecendo a Cooperação do Sul Global para uma Governança mais Inclusiva e Sustentável"", buscando consolidar relações exteriores e promover iniciativas de inclusão social e sustentabilidade.

A cúpula não contará apenas com os membros fundadores – Brasil, Rússia, Índia, China e África do Sul – mas também com países convidados como Arábia Saudita, Egito, Emirados Árabes Unidos, Etiópia, Indonésia e Irã, além de diversos outros membros associados que compõem o grupo.

Now, over a decade later, the ongoing investigation has been temporarily suspended until the end of 2025.

Search Suspended due to Weather Complications

After an inconclusive initial four-year investigation, Ocean Infinity announced plans to resume the search for the missing flight in December of 2024. A few months since the promise of further exploration, the search has been put on pause due to weather limitations affecting the search area of the Indian Ocean.

“Right now it’s not the season” stated Malaysian Government Transport Minister, Anthony Loke. “I think they have stopped the operation for the time being and will resume the search at the end of this year”.

Loke made the statement at a press conference held at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, following the arrival of airline British Airways’ first flight to Malaysia after reinstating their Kuala Lumpur route.

A Timeline of Missing Flight MH370 – A Decade of Limited Discovery

Despite undergoing the largest search in aviation history, the missing Boeing 777 which carried 239 passengers is yet to be found. Here is a short summary of what we know after a decade of search efforts.

2014: Disappearance and Initial Search

On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 departed from Kuala Lumpur at 00:42 local time, set to land in Beijing. The last known voice contact records the aircraft’s captain stating “Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero”. Two hours after takeoff, the airline lost contact with the aircraft, and it had vanished from civilian radar. Malaysia Airlines issued a press statement announcing a loss of contact with the plane.

Search and rescue operations began, concentrating on the South China Sea and the Straits of Malacca. By the end of the following day, more than 40 aircraft and 24 vessels from several nations were contributing to the search. On March 10, the Royal Malaysian Air Force confirms the flight made a “turn back”.

As the search and rescue phase turned to efforts of search and recovery, a series of investigations were undertaken. A sonar search of the seafloor began on April 14 and concluded on May 28, finding no debris.

2015 – 2017: The Search Continues and Draws to a Close

Underwater searches continued to take place, and by January 28, 2015 after countless speculation, Malaysia declares the disappearance an accident.

After finding unrelated debris on Reunion Island, debris confirmed to be from the missing aircraft is found on the islands of Pemba and Mauritius in September and October of 2016. However, the discovery of this debris did not result in uncovering the location of the main body of underwater wreckage. The underwater search came to an end in January 2017.

2018 – Today: Private Company Ocean Infinity conducts Series of Searches

Searches resume in January 2018 under private company Ocean Infinity who agree upon a “no find, no fee” arrangement with Malaysia.

These efforts concluded in June 2018. The search was again announced to resume in December 2024, and is now on pause due to weather conditions.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/eugene-butler.jpg,N,,2025-04-05 18:56:11.824594

Going forward, retail success will depend on adopting a scalable, digital infrastructure capable of evolving alongside changing sustainability and compliance demands.","As governments enact sweeping regulations to eliminate forced labor, child exploitation, and environmental abuses, companies are under growing pressure to take full responsibility for every link in their global sourcing networks. From the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) to America’s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), these laws are reshaping how businesses monitor and verify the conditions under which products are made. Combined with increasing consumer demand for transparency on human rights and environmental practices, these forces are driving a fundamental shift in how companies oversee their supply chains. To navigate this new landscape, companies must embrace advanced digital tools that enable real-time visibility and accountability at every level of their supply chains. Increasingly, these tools extend beyond raw material sourcing to offer full visibility across a product’s entire life cycle, from design and production to delivery and disposal, enabling brands to address sustainability and labor concerns from start to finish.

Technology is making it possible to achieve the level of oversight that regulators and consumers now demand. Multi-enterprise supply chain platforms and new artificial intelligence innovations are playing an increasingly pivotal role in monitoring supplier networks, ensuring compliance, and mitigating risks before they escalate into legal or reputational crises. These tools offer capabilities that traditional compliance methods never could. Rather than relying on periodic audits that provide only a limited snapshot of a supplier’s conditions, AI enables continuous monitoring, alerting companies to potential labor violations in real time. With an estimated 50 million people trapped in modern slavery worldwide, including 28 million in forced labor, proactive oversight is critical.

While all industries are susceptible to labor abuses, fashion is uniquely vulnerable to them. The U.S. Department of Labor has identified countries including India, Turkey, China, Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Benin, Brazil, and Egypt as high-risk areas for child labor, particularly in the production of cotton and leather. Given the prevalence of child labor – 160 million children globally, according to the International Labor Organization – brands cannot afford to ignore what’s happening in the deeper tiers of their supply chains. AI-driven supply chain mapping tools help solve this problem by tracing every component back to its origin, identifying all parties involved in production, including subcontractors, and flagging any links to suppliers that have been associated with forced labor or environmental violations.

AI and automation are proving to be indispensable for achieving compliance at scale. By analyzing massive datasets, AI can detect anomalies that might indicate exploitative practices, such as sudden fluctuations in labor costs or unusual supplier turnover rates. These red flags allow brands to take corrective action before violations escalate into full-blown crises.

AI-powered document verification also streamlines compliance by building a complete chain of custody for each item and ensuring that suppliers’ certifications are legitimate, reducing the risk of fraudulent claims about ethical sourcing practices. These capabilities are critical as bad actors continue to falsify sustainability credentials, making it difficult for brands to separate trustworthy suppliers from those merely paying lip service to ethical sourcing.

Beyond regulatory compliance, investing in AI-driven traceability solutions is becoming a strategic imperative for brands looking to build consumer trust. Studies show that 66% of U.S. consumers consider sustainability when making a purchase, and many are willing to switch brands based on sustainability practices. Companies that can offer proof of ethical sourcing will gain a competitive edge, while those that fail to do so risk losing consumer confidence. The need for more sophisticated supply chain monitoring will only grow as new regulations come into force and consumer expectations continue to rise. AI’s role in this space will expand beyond compliance and risk mitigation to include predictive capabilities that help companies make smarter sourcing decisions. AI is increasingly able to anticipate potential disruptions, helping companies adjust their sourcing strategies in real time. The most forward-thinking brands are already leveraging AI to enhance their sustainability efforts, using machine learning to optimize procurement decisions, reduce waste, and lower their overall environmental footprint.

Leading supply chain platforms are integrating these AI-driven solutions into a single, seamless system that manages everything from supplier onboarding to compliance verification. These capabilities help companies monitor supplier risk, analyze compliance documents, and track the chain of custody for each order, creating a verifiable record of responsible sourcing.

Accountability in supply chains is intensifying. Governments are cracking down on unethical sourcing, and consumers are demanding greater transparency. The companies that embrace AI and traceability solutions now will be best positioned to thrive in this new reality. Companies that delay adoption, however, will find themselves vulnerable to regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and lost consumer trust.

“If a palm oil company is valorizing and upcycling palm biomass, it should be recognized and credited for such initiatives.","As Africa's palm oil industry continues to expand, innovative approaches to sustainability are becoming increasingly vital. Eur Ing Hong Wai Onn—a chartered chemical engineer, chartered environmentalist, and founder of the Research Institute for Sustainable Excellence and Leadership (RISEL), offers groundbreaking insights into how biomass valorization could revolutionize the sector across the continent.

Converting Agricultural Waste into Economic Opportunity

“We cannot continue to view palm biomass as waste,” Hong emphasizes. “Every strand of fiber, every discarded fruit bunch represents an untapped opportunity for innovation and sustainability.”

This perspective is particularly relevant for Nigeria, Ghana, and Ivory Coast, where palm oil production continues to grow as a vital economic sector. By implementing biomass valorization technologies, these countries could transform what is currently considered waste into valuable resources, effectively creating new revenue streams while simultaneously addressing environmental concerns.

A Dual Approach to Climate Mitigation

Hong's advocacy for biomass valorization extends beyond economic benefits to offer a concrete pathway for emissions reduction. “Biomass valorization is not just an industrial solution,” he explains, “it's a pathway to reducing carbon emissions and breaking our dependence on fossil fuels.”

The conversion of palm oil biomass into ethanol presents particularly promising opportunities. This bioethanol can be blended with conventional fuels, reducing fossil fuel consumption, or further upgraded through the Alcohol-to-Jet pathway to create Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

“This alternative route is becoming increasingly important,” Hong notes, “as the current focus on the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids pathway will eventually face feedstock limitations.” With used cooking oil supplies becoming fully utilized, ethanol derived from palm biomass offers a more scalable and sustainable alternative for SAF production.

Beyond Ethanol: Diversifying Value-Added Products

The potential for biomass valorization extends beyond ethanol. Empty fruit bunches can also be processed into butanol, which serves as a drop-in fuel for maritime applications. Research in this area has advanced beyond laboratory and pilot stages, with plans for semi-commercial production plants already underway.

For African palm oil producers, these developments represent an opportunity to leapfrog traditional production methods and establish more advanced, environmentally conscious industries from the outset.

Strengthening Sustainability Standards

Hong has played a key role in shaping the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) Standards. His deep insights and extensive experience, particularly in the upstream sector, have been instrumental in strengthening Malaysia's sustainability framework.

“I see MSPO as on par with internationally recognized certification standards like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). In fact, MSPO certification is mandatory in Malaysia, meaning that every single drop of palm oil produced in the country is sustainably certified,” he emphasizes. His commitment to advancing environmental and industry standards offers valuable insights for African producers developing their own frameworks.

Hong acknowledges that continuous improvement in standards is essential. “No standard is perfect or time-resistant. Continuous improvement is necessary, which is why standards need to be reviewed regularly,” he explains. One key area for enhancement could be strengthening carbon emissions accounting and carbon footprint reporting. “If a palm oil company is valorizing and upcycling palm biomass, it should be recognized and credited for such initiatives. Perhaps certification systems could explore closer collaboration with carbon credit mechanisms to incentivize sustainable practices,” he suggests.

Hong's recognition as the first Malaysian engineer granted the Freedom of the City of London underscores the global significance of his work. This honor reflects not just individual achievement, but the potential of sustainable development to transcend national boundaries.

The Freedom of the City of London is one of the oldest surviving traditional ceremonies still in existence today, and it has been bestowed upon notable figures such as Sir Winston Churchill and Nelson Mandela. Being admitted into this esteemed group places Hong among a distinguished list of individuals who have made impactful contributions to society, highlighting the international resonance of his efforts in advancing sustainability and engineering excellence.

Overcoming Implementation Challenges

Despite its potential, biomass valorization faces hurdles in implementation. “The high capital investment required can be a barrier at this stage,” Hong acknowledges. However, with economies of scale and appropriate government support, these obstacles can be overcome.

“Imagine a scenario where ethanol blending in petrol is mandated, and domestically produced ethanol from biomass qualifies for double-counting due to its low carbon intensity,” he suggests. “This could elevate ethanol prices to a level where biomass valorization becomes commercially attractive.”

Such policies would simultaneously reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower the carbon footprint of palm oil industries—""a classic case of killing two birds with one stone,” as Hong puts it.

A Vision for Africa's Palm Oil Future

Through RISEL, Hong Wai Onn continues to advocate for sustainable development approaches that could be transformative for Africa's agricultural sectors. “It's certainly not an easy journey,” he concludes. “We're paving the way for a new model of sustainable industrial development—one that supports nations in accelerating their progress toward net-zero emissions targets.”

For African palm oil producers, this vision offers a compelling alternative to conventional development paths—one that transforms environmental challenges into economic opportunities while positioning the continent's palm oil industry at the forefront of sustainable innovation.",https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/RnIktkqTURBXy82ZjQ0ZmRlYTUwYTI3ZjUzNTA1ZWNiZTQ4NzZmYTAyMi5qcGVnkpUDAADNA_HNAjiTBc0EsM0Cdg,N,,2025-04-05 14:56:28.947486

Dreams of the sparkling green hydrogen industry of the future are withering on the vine in the US, but they are still alive and kicking in other parts of the world. The EU, for example, is vigorously pursuing new opportunities to import the stuff from other countries. Too bad President Trump has blown up a chance for US producers to get a piece of the action, but them’s the breaks.

Pro tip: Next time, don’t vote for the convicted felon.

Green Hydrogen Imports Coming To The EU

Green hydrogen fans have had a tough row to hoe. The industry is still in the early stages, with stubbornly high costs, supply chain gaps, shifting public policies, and buyer resistance among the factors leading some stakeholders to pull back or leave the business altogether.

Still, the nations of Europe are among those depending on green hydrogen to decarbonize heavy industries. The additional attraction of pushing Russia out of the EU energy import picture is also at work.

In addition to domestic production, the EU is leaning on overseas markets to feed its green hydrogen hunger. Among the opportunities to surface on the CleanTechnica radar, Canada is laying plans to export its green hydrogen to Europe through Belgium, and stakeholders in northern Africa are eyeballing a pipeline to the EU through Italy.

In other news, Bloomberg reports that TotalEnergies is planning to import green hydrogen from Brazil to supply its petroleum refineries in Europe.

Then there’s Ukraine, which not a member of the EU — yet. The country officially became a candidate for EU accession in 2022, after Russia’s unprovoked invasion. Ukraine has an ample supply of wind and solar power, as well as copious stocks of biomass for producing green hydrogen. Even with the war raging into its fourth year, Ukraine is still pursuing plans to export hydrogen to the EU through an existing network of pipelines that sprawls around Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria, and Germany.

Another Loss For US, Another Gain For EU

The leading green hydrogen producer Air Liquide caused many a tear to shed in the US when it announced a pullback on its green hydrogen commitments. The French firm was initially involved in six new Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs organized through the US Department of Energy in 2023.

The Hydrogen Hubs program was funded by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law with a stipulation to include natural gas with carbon capture, as well as renewables. The law is the law, but the Republican majority in Congress has refused to hold Trump to any law, preferring to dump its responsibilities onto the judicial branch. As a result, nothing was done to stop Trump from suspending the program after he took office on January 20.

Air Liquide, for one, saw the writing on the wall. In February, the company let word slip that it is still committed to the two hubs that incorporate natural gas. However, the company adopted a wait-and-see stance on the other four hubs, in consideration of the abrupt shift in federal energy policy.

But, that was not the end of the green hydrogen story for Air Liquide. Last month the company resurfaced with plans for a 200-megawatt electrolyzer project in Rotterdam and a 250-megawattt facility in the Netherlands. Both projects are aimed at supplying green hydrogen for heavy duty transportation and other industrial uses, in addition to supplying TotalEnergies’ refineries.

Yet Another Green Hydrogen Loss For The US

The similarly named firm Air Products also packed up and took its business elsewhere after Trump took office, though for other reasons. On February 24 the Pennsylvania-based company with a global reach announced that it is shelving plans to build a 35-tonne-per-day liquid green hydrogen facility in Massena, New York, citing an unfavorable decision regarding tax credits and “slower than expected development of a hydrogen mobility market in the region.”

In the same announcement, Air Products also bailed on a sustainable aviation fuel project in California and a carbon monoxide project in Texas. “The decision to exit these three projects will streamline our backlog and focus Company resources on projects that drive value for Air Products’ shareholders,” the company explained.

Among those other value-driving projects is the company’s massive green hydrogen facility in Saudi Arabia, attached to the country’s ambitious NEOM planned city. “The NEOM green hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia is approaching 80 percent completion, with green ammonia production expected to commence at the end of 2026,” Air Products notes.

Saudi Arabia has already lined up Germany as an off-taker for its green hydrogen. Word of the deal with Germany surfaced in February, and last week it became official.

The Electrolyzer Angle

In another interesting development, on April 1 Reuters was among the news organizations reporting that Belgium tasked its Monarch, King Philippe, to travel to Vietnam with a large entourage for some deal-making in a number of areas including green hydrogen.

The leading Belgian electrolyzer firm John Cockerill took a preliminary step towards investing in a Vietnamese electrolyzer factory during the trip. “A spokesman for the Belgian firm said the agreements were the first step for a possible investment in a Vietnam factory to manufacture pressurised alkaline water electrolysers,” Reuters reported.

As for why all this overseas outreach is going on, that’s easy. There are not enough domestic projects in the pipeline to meet the EU’s ambitious green hydrogen targets.

The US-based energy transition think tank RMI ran the numbers and produced a report last month noting as much. “Executing this vision has proved difficult, with many early expectations — such as rapid progress, cost reductions, and broad offtake applications — now proven to be overly ambitious or unattainable in the short term,” RMI observed.

To get back on track, RMI advises drawing back on the idea of deploying green hydrogen for “low-impact” uses, like heating buildings or fueling light-duty vehicles, and focus instead on priority areas. “Public and private investments should be directed to steelmaking, fertilizers, refining, aviation, and shipping; sectors where hydrogen provides the most decarbonization value,” RMI states.

“Allocating resources to low-impact uses like heating and light-duty vehicles represents inefficient use of scarce public funds and risks delaying necessary transitions through electrification and energy efficiency measures,” they emphasize.

“It’s time to retire any lingering misconceptions of hydrogen as a Swiss army knife for economy-wide decarbonization,” they add for good measure.

RMI also indicates that the EU will have to import green hydrogen in order to meet its near-term goals, which it is doing. If you can guess how much of that imported product will come from the US, drop a note in the comment thread.

There are high hopes for the expansion of the SAF industry and the increased use of SAF in the aviation fuel mix.
The growth in SAF production is expected to support the decarbonization of the hard-to-abate aviation industry in the coming decades.","There is an increasing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as airlines worldwide strive to decarbonize operations. Aviation is a hard-to-abate industry, meaning that it is difficult to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with aviation activities. However, airlines around the globe are increasingly incorporating SAF into their fuel mixes to reduce emissions, with many planning to significantly increase the use of SAF in the coming decades. To achieve this, governments and private companies must invest heavily in SAF research and development, as well as production, to advance the industry in line with aviation decarbonization targets.

SAF is an alternative to conventional, petroleum-based jet fuel, produced using non-petroleum feedstocks. It can be blended with jet fuel, with limits between 10 to 50 percent at present, to help reduce aircraft emissions. More than 360,000 commercial flights have used SAF at 46 different airports, mainly in the United States and Europe, according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Aviation continues to contribute around 2.5 percent of all carbon emissions and 12 percent of the CO2 emissions from the transport industry. The ICAO aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which it will achieve primarily by increasingly using SAF to fuel flights. The 2021 Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge brings together multiple U.S. federal agencies for the purpose of expanding domestic SAF consumption to 3 billion gallons in 2030 and 35 billion gallons in 2050.

Some of the feedstocks used to produce SAF include the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, and fats, greases, or oils. SAF production is in the early stage of development, and there are only three known commercial producers in the U.S. at present; World Energy, Neste, and Montana Renewables LLC.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute around 65 percent of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The IATA expects new technology, electric and hydrogen, to contribute 13 percent of this reduction, infrastructure and operational efficiencies 3 percent, and offsets and carbon capture 19 percent. However, achieving this will require the significant scaling of production, which is expected in the late 2030s, as SAF becomes competitive with fossil kerosene and credible offsets become scarcer.

While there are high hopes for SAF to help decarbonize the aviation industry, a 2024 report from the think tank The Institute for Policy Studies found that the SAF industry is lagging behind climate targets. The report showed that there was “no realistic or scalable alternative” to conventional kerosene-based jet fuels and said SAF are well off track to replace them within the timeframe required to avert dangerous climate change, despite public subsidies. The report stated, “While there are kernels of possibility, we should bring a high level of scepticism to the claims that alternative fuels will be a timely substitute for kerosene-based jet fuels.”

Chuck Collins, the co-author of the report, said, “To bring these fuels to the scale needed would require massive subsidies, the trade-offs would be unacceptable and would take resources aware from more urgent decarbonisation priorities.” Collins added, “It’s a huge greenwashing exercise by the aviation industry. It’s magical thinking that they will be able to do this.”

In the U.K., 50 percent of all agricultural land would need to be given up to sustain current flight passenger levels if jet fuel was entirely replaced, according to the report. This demonstrates the significant difficulties in scaling SAF production.

By 2030, global demand for SAF is expected to reach 17 million tonnes per year, equivalent to between 4 to 5 percent of total jet fuel consumption, according to the World Economic Forum. This would require an estimated $19 to $45 billion in investment to achieve.

However, while some regions of the world are falling behind, others are making strides in SAF development. In Asia, the SAF supply is expected to outpace regional demand in 2025 and 2026 as new production facilities open. This is expected to drive down prices, something the aviation industry has long been waiting for. At least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have commenced or are expected to start production this year. However, the compulsory use of SAF in the jet fuel mix is currently non-existent across Asia, with the first compulsory use of SAF beginning in 2026, as Singapore and Thailand enforce a 1 percent mandate. South Korea will introduce a 1 percent SAF mix in 2027, and Japan has a 10 percent mandate for 2030.

There are high hopes for the expansion of the SAF industry and the increased use of SAF in the aviation fuel mix. The growth in SAF production is expected to support the decarbonization of the hard-to-abate aviation industry in the coming decades. However, while the aviation sector is optimistic about this shift, others are more doubtful that SAF can be scaled at the level required to significantly drive down emissions.

The Influence of Competition Even though Ryanair dominates the European low-cost travel market, it faces fierce competition from EasyJet, Transavia, and Vueling.","Ryanair is considering cutting flights to and from France in 2025, which would be a major change for low-cost travel in Europe.

Motives for the Choice

Several reasons are thought to be behind the airline’s plan to reduce French flight routes.

Rise in operating expenses

The growing expense of operating in France is one of the main elements determining Ryanair’s choice. Budget air travel has become less affordable due to new environmental charges on airline tickets imposed by the French government. Furthermore, rising fuel prices and airport taxes have made the economy more difficult for low-cost airlines like Ryanair.

Difficulties with Regulation

France’s stringent labour rules have caused conflict between Ryanair and regulatory bodies in the past. In France, airlines must adhere to strict employment laws, which raise staffing costs and increase the risk of labour strike interruptions.

Strikes by Air Traffic Control (ATC)

In recent years, France has experienced several air traffic control strikes that have caused several flight cancellations and delays. Due to these disruptions, Ryanair, one of the biggest low-cost airlines in Europe, has been disproportionately impacted, resulting in enormous financial losses and unhappy customers. The airline has advocated for reforms throughout Europe on several occasions to stop national ATC strikes from impacting aircraft that are merely flying over France.

The Influence of Competition

Even though Ryanair dominates the European low-cost travel market, it faces fierce competition from EasyJet, Transavia, and Vueling. Ryanair may find it more difficult to uphold its low-cost business model while adhering to local laws and taxes in France amid rising competition.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ryanair.jpg?fit=1024%2C603&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-05 13:56:50.376186

This is the second major aviation reform under his leadership. The bill aims to bring India’s aircraft leasing and financing system in line with global norms, helping attract more investment into the country’s fast-growing aviation sector.

The bill is based on the Cape Town Convention of 2001, which was designed to make international aircraft leasing deals more straightforward and consistent. Although India signed on to this convention in 2008, the lack of proper legal backing led to leasing costs being 8 to 10 per cent higher than in many other countries. This new law is meant to fix those legal loopholes, giving more assurance to aircraft lenders and lowering leasing expenses for Indian airlines.

Stressing the need for the new legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister outlined the goals behind the move and credited strong leadership for the aviation sector’s rapid growth. He shared striking numbers to back this up from independence until 2014, around 10.38 crore passengers flew annually in India. But by 2024, that number had more than doubled to 22.81 crore. The number of airports also saw a big jump, from 74 in 2014 to 159 in 2024, with two more expected to open soon. The fleet size followed a similar trend, rising from 340 aircraft in 2014 to over 840 by 2024. The minister noted that no other country has seen such fast-paced aviation growth in a short time.

The proposed bill aims to simplify aircraft leasing, attract more aviation investment to India, and boost the country’s compliance with the Cape Town Convention. These steps are expected to cut airline costs and make it easier for new players to enter the market.

During discussions on the bill, broader issues facing the civil aviation sector arose, especially the steep cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which makes up nearly 45% of airline operating expenses. The minister highlighted concerns about the varying ATF tax rates across states and encouraged more states to cut their taxes, as some already have. He noted that doing so would help improve regional air connectivity and make flying more affordable for passengers.

Looking ahead, the Civil Aviation Ministry has set bold goals focused on sustainability and expanding capacity. By 2025, it plans to produce 2.5 crore litres of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and shift more than 100 airports to renewable energy sources, showing India’s strong push toward eco-friendly aviation.

Another major challenge is the rising need for skilled pilots, with an estimated requirement of 30,000 to 34,000 in the next 10 to 15 years. To tackle this, the government is working on setting up more Flight Training Organisations (FTOs) and increasing the number of commercial pilot licenses issued each year.",https://myind.net/sites/default/files/field/image/d05f8b56_whatsapp_image_2025-04-05_at_12.28.56_399413b8.jpg,N,,2025-04-05 08:56:25.714370

The event brought together industry participants, experts, and various stakeholders to deliberate on strategies for enhancing ethanol production and the utilization of the existing assets with the addition of grain modules.

India’s commitment to the Ethanol Blending Program has led to significant policy measures aimed at augmenting ethanol production. To address the seasonal availability of sugarcane, the Government of India has announced financial assistance to support cooperative sugar mills with existing/running ethanol plants for conversion into multi-feedstock-based plants. The initiative includes interest subvention for those cooperative sugar mills that supply ethanol to Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) for blending with petrol to produce ethanol from various feedstocks, including cereals like maize and damaged food grains (DFG).

Looking beyond E20, the GoI is exploring higher ethanol blends such as E85 for four wheelers, E100 for two-wheelers, diesel blending, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to further reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy security.

Union Minister of Cooperatives, Amit Shah recently spoke in Gujarat at the groundbreaking ceremony of two cooperative sugar mills, highlighting that the Cooperatives Ministry has launched several initiatives to support over 60 crore farming families. He also emphasized that the Global Biofuel Alliance could help India become a major player in the international ethanol market and that, once domestic production surpasses local consumption, India could export ethanol globally, benefiting farmers and the economy.

Speaking at the workshop, Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Founder Chairman of Praj Industries, stated, “As we transition beyond E20 in India, the focus must be on expanding feedstock options, enhancing production efficiency, and tapping into global markets. With the Global Biofuel Alliance opening new avenues, Indian distilleries have the potential to become key players in the international biofuel trade. At Praj, we remain committed to pioneering sustainable solutions that drive India’s energy security while creating economic opportunities for farmers and industries alike.”

Atul Mulay, President – Bioenergy, Praj Industries, stated, “With our proven expertise and leadership in bioenergy solutions, Praj is committed to driving India’s next phase of ethanol expansion. By supporting the adoption of grain-based ethanol production, we are reinforcing our dedication to the nation’s energy security and sustainability goals.

Leveraging our advanced technologies and robust manufacturing infrastructure, we are strengthening India’s ethanol ecosystem, enabling year-round production, and paving the way for a more self-reliant and greener future.”

Rajesh Tope, a veteran cooperative leader and Former Minister for Public Health and Family Welfare of Maharashtra, who attended the workshop, commented, “Praj’s workshop was exceptionally insightful and timely for the industry, offering in-depth knowledge on advanced ethanol production technologies. By leveraging existing machinery and adopting grain-based modules, mills can ensure year-round operations, significantly enhancing efficiency and profitability. This addition can boost revenue margins by ₹300-₹400 per tonne of cane crushed, making it a transformative step for the sector. Availability of feedstock at right price will also be important for success of this program.

Water-saving and steam-saving technologies are the need of the hour, and it was encouraging to see solutions like air-cooled condensers showcased at the workshop. Furthermore, generating CBG from spent wash and press mud presents an effective way to manage hazardous spent wash while aligning with the waste-to-energy principle.

This forward-thinking initiative will not only strengthen ethanol production but also improve financial sustainability for mills and accelerate India’s biofuel ambitions.”

The workshop served as a platform for knowledge exchange, showcasing the latest advancements in ethanol production technologies and the strategic roadmap for achieving higher blending targets, while also addressing key concerns such as the availability and pricing of raw materials.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dr.-Pramod-Chaudhari.jpg,N,,2025-04-05 08:56:29.507262

Under the new terms, Microsoft will co-fund an additional 39,000 tonnes of SAF that will help reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by approximately 113,000 tonnes. The extension to the agreement enables Microsoft to address Scope 3 lifecycle emissions and is the largest and longest Scope 3 SAF agreement to date between an airline and corporate customer, according to publicly available data.

Scope 3 encompasses lifecycle carbon emissions that are not produced by a company itself, but that it is indirectly responsible for up and down its value chain. By partnering with its corporate customers, IAG is able to purchase more SAF and reduce its Scope 1 (direct) emissions. Corporate customers also benefit by lowering Scope 3 lifecycle emissions from the industry commensurate to a proportion of their corporate flying.

“We’re pleased to work with like-minded organisations such as Microsoft to expand efforts to reduce flying lifecycle emissions,” said Jonathon Counsell, Group Sustainability Officer, IAG. “Long-term agreements help encourage much-needed funding in SAF production, something that IAG is championing through our investment in global SAF projects such as LanzaJet.”

Microsoft is also co-funding SAF that is used by the Group’s airlines to ship data centre components globally, in partnership with Microsoft’s freight forwarders. Microsoft’s contribution to the cost of SAF production will support the airlines within IAG with the overall reduction of lifecycle emissions.

“We are taking our collaboration with IAG further, extending our SAF purchase agreement to bring Microsoft closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030, while ensuring a multi-year commitment to help drive greater SAF production,” said Julia Fidler, Environmental Sustainability Fuel and Materials Decarbonization Lead, Microsoft. “We are pleased to work alongside IAG on efforts to increase demand and make SAF more widely available through our shared long-term purchase agreement.”

Using alternative fuel sources – rather than newly extracted fossil materials – means SAF releases existing carbon, instead of adding new carbon from fossil fuels to the atmosphere. By the end of 2024, 1.9% of IAG’s total fuel usage for the year was SAF and total expenditure, including future commitments for SAF offtakes, exceeded $3.5 billion.

The SAF used as part of the IAG and Microsoft agreement will be produced from used cooking oil and food waste at Phillips 66’s Humberside refinery, and from sustainably source bioethanol at Georgia-based Freedom Pines Fuels, LanzaJet’s facility in the United States. Both fuels are certified by International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC).

The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, a $1 billion initiative supporting new climate technologies through investments, has previously invested in LanzaJet. LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines facility is the world’s first commercial-scale alcohol-to-jet production facility and will supply SAF to British Airways.

Business Insider got a look at the tech that might drive it.

At its recent summit in at its headquarters Toulouse, France, CEO Guillaume Faury told reporters it was developing a new single-aisle aircraft to succeed its A320 family and enter service in the second half of the 2030s.

He said the hydrogen-powered plane was canceled as it risked being ""a Concorde of hydrogen"" and not commercially viable at scale.

He said a next-generation plane would not come with ""incremental optimization"" but ""clean sheet designs."" He also predicted a ""gloves-off"" competition to build a next-generation airplane with Airbus' US rival Boeing.

This is the new tech it's developing.

Open-fan engines

Higher fuel efficiency is a major discussion point in aviation, but making it happen will require ""a fundamental change in the shape of the engine,"" said Mohamed Ali, GE Aerospace's chief technology and operations officer.

Turbofan jet engines work by taking in air. Some of this air enters the engine core where it is mixed with fuel and combusts to drive the turbines. The rest of the air is accelerated by the fan and bypasses the core.

Engines which have a higher proportion of bypassed air are more fuel efficient. However, this ratio is limited by the size of the intake duct.

""Here is the solution, and that's the beauty of physics. You can remove that duct and go to open fan,"" Ali said.

While today's engines have a bypass ratio of up to 12:1, Ali said current designs for an open-fan engine would improve that to 60:1.

Airbus and CFM — a joint venture between GE and Safran — plan to test open-fan engines on an Airbus A380 by the end of the decade.

They are also planning for the new engines to be able to operate entirely with sustainable aviation fuel. This can be produced from plants and cooking oil, but its takeup has so far been hindered by high costs and a lack of availability.

Folding wings

Airbus engineers are looking to longer wings to create more lift and reduce drag, which in turn means using less fuel. However, the size of a plane's wings is limited by the size of airport gates.

Yet if the wingtips can fold, planes can still have longer wings in flight and fit into airport gates on the ground.

If this sounds familiar, you might've seen something similar on the coming Boeing 777X, although Airbus is planning to first use it on narrow-body planes.

""If you think about the next generation of single-aisle aircraft, it will fly many times a day, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,"" said Sue Partridge, head of the Wing of Tomorrow program. ""That folding wing system needs to work reliably.""

New materials and some automation

Another step forward in fuel efficiency could be found in new composite materials.

The latest generation of airliners, like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, use carbon fiber-reinforced polymers in the wings and fuselage. These are stronger and lighter than aluminum, but more advances could be made.

""We are working on the next generation of composite materials, with our material suppliers working as partners with us,"" Partridge told the summit.

Just before the summit began, Reuters reported that both planemakers are looking at thermoplastics for future aircraft.

Single-aisle planes are more popular than widebodies, with Airbus eyeing a target of producing 75 a month.

""We need to be able to make our aircraft and our wings at high rate and at a cost that's actually sustainable for our business,"" Partridge said.

She added that the Wing of Tomorrow program was looking at robotic and automation technologies to see how they could speed up manufacturing.

Automation won't just take place in the factories, however.

At the summit, BI rode in a self-driving van testing Airbus' new autonomous technology, Optimate.

It's been testing cameras, radar, and lidar to help follow airport lines for autonomous taxiing and to avoid potential collisions. Near misses have been growing more common in recent years, and Airbus also predicts there will be twice the number of aircraft in 20 years.

AI could also be used to predict traffic and help pilots reroute around turbulence or bad weather.

There are still more than 10 years before Airbus sees its next generation of planes taking to the skies.

Faury, the CEO, compared the process to ""a caterpillar in a cocoon becoming a butterfly.""

""In this transition, there's a bit of paralysis,"" he said. ""There's a lot of forces at stake, it's painful, and then the butterfly takes off. We don't know what it looks like until we're there.""

""We remain committed to our purpose, which is to pioneer sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world,"" he added. ""We think it's a beautiful purpose, but it's not an easy one.""",https://i.insider.com/67e5434b63d72727e19861b1?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-04-05 04:56:31.906191

Dhaka: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has officially introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, now under the management of the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO).

This new platform aims to accelerate the global adoption of SAF and support the aviation industry's goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.""

Described as a“critical platform” by IATA, the SAF Registry enables airlines and industry stakeholders to track, verify, and claim their SAF usage in a secure and transparent way.

It ensures that environmental benefits from SAF purchases are recorded immutably, eliminating the risk of double counting – an essential step in building trust and accountability in the carbon reduction process.

“Aviation's decarbonisation is a team effort,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO, we have put in place a system that benefits all stakeholders, airlines, fuel producers, regulators, and corporate customers. It is a foundational tool for building a transparent, global SAF market.”

Thomsen, however, emphasised that the registry is only one piece of the puzzle. She also called on governments to urgently shift financial support from fossil fuel industries toward renewable energy development, including SAF.

“Further progress requires active policy support for the ramping-up of all renewable energy production, and for SAF within that production. Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favor of renewable energy production. The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay,” she said.

As SAF continues to emerge as a key solution for decarbonising air travel, the launch of the registry marks a major milestone, bringing structure, trust, and momentum to the global effort to make aviation more sustainable.

The registry, now live, aims to create a transparent global marketplace for SAF by securely recording environmental attributes of transactions to prevent double counting—ensuring emissions savings are claimed only once by purchasers.

SAF, a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, is critical to aviation’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The registry will allow airlines, fuel producers, regulators, and corporate clients to document and verify SAF purchases, streamlining compliance with climate obligations. IATA emphasized that the platform’s immutability—a safeguard against data manipulation—is key to building trust among stakeholders.

“This registry is a foundational step, but not a silver bullet,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist. “Governments must now prioritize policies that scale renewable energy production, including SAF, by redirecting subsidies from fossil fuels to green energy—just as they did for wind and solar.” Thomsen stressed that without urgent policy shifts, the industry’s decarbonization timeline risks delay.

The initiative arrives as global SAF production remains minimal, accounting for less than 0.2% of total jet fuel demand. While over 50 airlines have pledged to use 10% SAF by 2030, supply chain bottlenecks and high costs persist. The registry seeks to mitigate these challenges by enhancing market liquidity and transparency, though analysts caution that production incentives and infrastructure investments remain unresolved.

The SAF Registry’s launch reflects aviation’s growing reliance on collaborative frameworks to meet climate targets. Similar registries, like the European Union’s emissions trading system, have faced criticism for complexity and uneven enforcement. However, CADO’s centralized governance model could address past fragmentation, particularly in regions lacking robust carbon accounting systems.

Historically, renewable energy transitions have hinged on policy-driven subsidies. IATA’s call to replicate wind and solar incentives underscores the urgency: SAF production must grow 3,000% by 2030 to meet industry targets. Yet geopolitical tensions, feedstock limitations, and competing demands for biofuels complicate this trajectory.

For now, the registry’s success hinges on widespread adoption. If integrated into national climate frameworks, it could unlock cross-border SAF trading and attract private investment. But as Thomsen noted, “miracles” require more than data tools—they demand a global policy pivot toward renewables, starting today.",https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IATA.png,N,,2025-04-05 17:56:12.241046

Energy is a big issue, and policies that jump-start that aspect of the American economy are what many people voted for last fall. Farming states can help supplement domestic energy production with the right federal policy.

Today, America is in danger of falling behind global competitors in producing critical sources of sustainable aviation fuels. The administration’s goal is energy independence, yet the aviation industry is in danger of becoming dependent on sustainable fuels from China and Brazil. The nation needs to make progress on sustainable fuels.

With the right policies, Congress can expand sustainable aviation fuel production, consumption and distribution. The administration could take executive action on energy independence by dedicating resources to this issue.

One goal of tariffs is to leverage better trade deals with China. If we don’t act soon, China and Brazil will fill the void and send sustainable aviation fuels for use by U.S. aircraft. American airline companies want to source fuel from U.S. agriculture and distributors, yet the capacity is not present.

Domestic businesses are eager to produce. Advantage News reported in March, “Illinois stands to become (a) leader in the production of sustainable aviation fuels.” It reported that “corn and soybean farmers in Illinois look to benefit from another byproduct of their fields. Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduce emissions from air transportation. It takes about 1.5 gallons of ethanol to make one gallon of sustainable aviation fuel.”

American aircraft can use up to 50% of sustainable fuels mixed with jet fuel. Innovation has progressed so that by 2030 aircraft can fly with all sustainable fuels. This is an innovation that Congress and the administration should exploit.

The Department of Energy has set high targets, and the tax code is structured to give tax credits to produce sustainable aviation fuels. Farmers and energy producers have benefitted from innovation that allows the conversion of crops, waste, captured gasses, biomass and plants as a resource for making these fuels. More needs to be done.

One way to stimulate investment is to extend and improve tax credits. An “all of the above” approach embracing fossil fuels in addition to jet fuel from farmers will allow airlines to stop buying from China and Brazil. Regulation and red tape that slow permitting and the production of biofuels need to be reformed.

Fracking, drilling and mining are helping us get to energy independence. Yet, more can be done by targeting agriculture, timber and bioenergy to produce more, thus supplying increased sources of sustainable fuels.

Binacional’s executive financial director, André Pepitone, presented the panel “The socioeconomic and energy security role of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant”.
The vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies' Mines and Energy Committee, congressman Gabriel Mota (Republicans-RR), praised the initiative and the opportunity to discuss the sector with other entities in the sector.
“Industry cannot function without energy, families need energy, schools need energy, hospitals need energy, and Brazil continues to be a source of clean, renewable energy, currently playing a very important role,” he added.","Members of the Chamber of Deputies' Mines and Energy Committee met in Foz do Iguaçu (PR), this Thursday, the 3rd, at the Itaipu hydroelectric plant, to discuss the main challenges and opportunities of the Brazilian electrical system, such as energy transition, energy production and commercialization and the impacts of the new electrical matrix on consumer tariffs.

The meeting was coordinated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), with support from Itaipu Binacional and institutions in the electrical system. The Brazilian CEO of Itaipu, Enio Verri, who is in Brasília, recorded a welcome video and made the company available to the deputies.

According to the executive secretary of the MME, Arthur Cerqueira Valério, the objective of the meeting was to promote rapprochement between the electricity sector and the parliamentary committee.

“The idea here is to explain to parliamentarians our structure and our challenges, so that they have a better understanding of the complexity of the sector and the difficulties faced on a daily basis. In addition to presenting a little of the grandeur of Itaipu and the work that is carried out here,” he said.

Binacional’s executive financial director, André Pepitone, presented the panel “The socioeconomic and energy security role of the Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant”. The debates were attended by the general director of the National Electric System Operator (ONS), Marcio Rea; the president of the Energy Research Company (EPE), Thiago Prado; the president of the Board of Directors of the Electric Energy Trading Chamber (CCEE), Alexandre Ramos; and the director of the National Electric Energy Agency (Aneel), Agnes Maria de Aragão da Costa – among other authorities in the sector. Also present on behalf of Itaipu were Iggor Rocha (administrative) and Luiz Fernando Delazari (legal).

The vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies' Mines and Energy Committee, congressman Gabriel Mota (Republicans-RR), praised the initiative and the opportunity to discuss the sector with other entities in the sector. The new board of directors of the committee took office just two weeks ago.

“We will address important issues here and I have no doubt that it will be of great value,” he said.

“First, because [energy] is a vital sector and a key input for any society,” added Congressman Danilo Forte (União/CE), a member of the committee. “Industry cannot function without energy, families need energy, schools need energy, hospitals need energy, and Brazil continues to be a source of clean, renewable energy, currently playing a very important role,” he added.

Role of Itaipu

In his presentation, Pepitone spoke about Itaipu's legal nature, governance aspects, and detailed the control and prevention mechanisms adopted by the company. He explained that Itaipu maintains a Compliance department to ensure that the company is in compliance with current laws, regulations and internal standards; an Ombudsman's Office, which is a channel for complaints and information for internal and external audiences; and Internal Audit, which acts at any stage of the contracting process.

In addition, Itaipu hires an External Auditor through a bidding process to assess the compliance of the accounting statements with international accounting standards and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), which establishes strict corporate governance rules.

“This requirement further reinforces transparency and rigor in the monitoring of the company’s resources,” said the director.

Pepitone also presented to the deputies details of the agreement signed with Paraguay in April 2024, and the contributions to the Commercialization Account managed by ENBPar, which allowed the maintenance of Itaipu's tariff at US$ 16,71 kW.month for the Brazilian market from 2024 to 2026, the same value practiced in 2023. It is the lowest value of the plant's energy in more than 20 years, standing at R$ 204,95/MWh for the consumer.

“Itaipu currently maintains one of the lowest tariffs in Brazil, positively impacting the lives of millions of Brazilians,” emphasized the director.

According to ANEEL Order No. 3.080 of October 10, 2024, the average cost of energy acquisition by distributors for 2025 was estimated at R$307,29/MWh. Thus, according to Pepitone, Itaipu offers an advantageous price for Brazilian consumers and contributes significantly to tariff affordability, since its transfer value to distributors is substantially lower than the Pmix – the average transfer price of all distributor contracts.

Energy and sustainability

In addition to contributing to the low tariffs, the executive financial director noted that investments in regional development projects are part of Itaipu's business mission and were reinforced by reversal note 228, exchanged between the governments of Brazil and Paraguay in 2005, establishing that initiatives in the field of social and environmental responsibility “must be included as a permanent component in the energy generation activity”.

These investments – currently organized in the Itaipu Mais que Energia program – benefit 11 million Brazilians in 434 municipalities in Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul, with effective results, such as the recovery of more than 8 thousand springs, the development of 33 environmental sanitation plans, the construction of 90 Recyclable Recovery Units (UVRs), support for indigenous and fishing communities and improvements to the infrastructure of 80 philanthropic hospitals.

At the same time, the company today stands out as a protagonist in the global debate on energy transition, supporting events such as the G20 meetings and the United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP), and investing in research into new energy sources, such as solar, green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Another piece of information addressed by the director was the amount paid by Itaipu in royalties since 1984, directly benefiting six Brazilian states and 347 municipalities, in addition to the federal government. In 2024, this amount reached R$1,2 billion. For comparison purposes, this amount is more than three times the amount paid by the 59 plants that are members of the National Interconnected System (SIN) as financial compensation for the use of water resources.

“In other words, Itaipu’s actions and socio-environmental investments are not a temporary choice or a choice made by the current administration, but a commitment established by both countries. And most importantly, even while continually investing in social and environmental projects, Itaipu maintains one of the lowest energy rates in Brazil, proving that it is possible to combine sustainability, energy security and economic efficiency,” concluded Pepitone.

Technical visit

This Friday, the 4th, as part of the program of the Meeting of Deputies of the Mines and Energy Committee, the parliamentarians will participate in a technical visit to the Itaipu hydroelectric plant and will learn about the Meninos do Lago social canoeing project, maintained by Binacional and which serves young people in vulnerable situations in Foz do Iguaçu and the region.",https://folhadolitoral.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250403WB1377-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-05 12:56:28.019169

Labour corporate welfare for Rolls-Royce

In the 2023/24 year, government subsidies to corporations totaled £32 billion. The year before, they were £53 billion because gas inflation not only increased bills but also the government increased corporate handouts to profiteering fossil fuel companies. And now Starmer has announced a further £22 billion bung to the fossil fuel sector for carbon capture projects that don’t work.

Add in Rolls-Royce and its potential subsidy, and the situation is ridiculous.

Energy isn’t the only privatised sector where we’re paying twice. 2023/24 government subsidies to the railway industry totaled £23 billion. When you take a train, remember you already paid for some of the ticket. Labour is bringing the operating network for rail into public ownership, but it is leaving the trains themselves privatised. That means we will still be renting the actual trains from the private sector as it milks us dry.

The ‘rolling stock’ companies that hoard the trains have paid dividends to shareholders at £3.6 billion since 2014/2015, according to research from We Own It.

Sustainability and aircraft

One positive thing is that Rolls-Royce is committed to making its engines compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80%. SAF production needs to dramatically increase to address climate change.

The fuel could become cheaper than fossil fuels if production increases, but companies and the aviation industry are currently sleeping at the wheel. At present, one flight can emit as much Co2 as some people do in a whole year.

Another facet to Rolls-Royce is that it makes engines for military aircraft, suppling 160 customers in 103 countries. Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) reports that arms total 32% of its sales.

If Rolls-Royce wants people to publicly fund it, then it should operate as a not-for-profit. Meanwhile, it’s a no brainer than energy and rail should be fully publicly owned.

Long live the new BA loyalty scheme - The Times,"Cathy Adams, Senior Commissioning Editor",,,,,https://www.thetimes.com/travel/advice/the-ba-loyalty-scheme-is-dead-long-live-the-new-ba-loyalty-scheme-7zmsbwbp9,"This backlash prompted BA to tweak the new scheme in February.
• British Airways frequent flyer scheme changes: everything you need to know But since the relaunch of the Club last week there have been some extra grumbles from frequent flyers.
Much of it has centred on the lack of clarity around spend on BA-branded American Express credit cards, which confers bonus tier points to members and makes it easier to achieve elite status.
However, they have been reassured by the airline that these points will be credited to the previous collection year.
“It’s a novel idea for BA Club members, but it might catch on,” he says.","Flyers now earn one “tier” point per pound spent with the flag carrier, with the threshold for the silver level set at 7,500 points, up from 600. A small silver lining — pardon the pun — is that for the first time passengers can also earn tier points from booking packages with British Airways Holidays, as well as extras such as increased baggage allowances, seat selection and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)credits

When the changes were announced at the end of December there was an outcry from loyal passengers, with Rob Burgess, founder of the frequent-flyer website Head For Points, saying that the new scheme “makes it very clear to the leisure and small-business market that British Airways has no interest in their loyalty”; although Gilbert Ott, founder of God Save the Points, defended the inclusion of spending on package holidays.

This backlash prompted BA to tweak the new scheme in February. It reintroduced passengers’ ability to earn status if they fly a certain number of times with the airline — 25 for bronze and 50 for silver — regardless of the cost of the flights; plus a tier points bonus offer to provide “clarity” to its customers.

• British Airways frequent flyer scheme changes: everything you need to know

But since the relaunch of the Club last week there have been some extra grumbles from frequent flyers. Much of it has centred on the lack of clarity around spend on BA-branded American Express credit cards, which confers bonus tier points to members and makes it easier to achieve elite status. In December the airline announced that holders of the premium card could earn up to 2,500 extra tier points — or £2,500 worth — “by spending on their card”, but then said that it would reveal details “later in 2025” about exactly how much would need to be spent. This information has not yet been revealed, although it is understood that clarification is not far off. Last week frequent flyers who moaned at the airline on Twitter about the lack of detail around Amex spend were told by BA that it was “coming soon”.

Meanwhile, those who booked last-minute flights before the March 31 deadline to earn enough tier points to push them into a higher status bracket have found that their points were not credited in time and have instead been converted to the new system. However, they have been reassured by the airline that these points will be credited to the previous collection year.

BA said: “As part of the new British Airways Club we’ve provided more certainty for customers by extending the bonus tier point offer to the end of the year, introduced more ways than ever to earn tier points and we have a way to reward leisure customers that we haven’t in the past with an uncapped British Airways Holidays proposition. In 2025 British Airways American Express Premium Plus Card members will be able to earn up to 2,500 tier points by spending on their card, with more details on this offer coming soon.”

• Travellers are obsessed with status — and airlines are going into battle for their loyalty

Other airlines have been cannily looking at the fallout from BA’s scheme and tweaking their programmes, and it is possible to earn the same status and perks by joining the schemes of other airlines in the Oneworld association, of which BA is a member. By collecting Avios and points with the Oneworld members Qatar Airways and Iberia, for example, passengers can earn status more easily and enjoy the same perks as holders of BA silver and gold cards, including free seat selection, priority check-in and lounge access. Meanwhile, Royal Jordanian, also part of the Oneworld alliance, offers a “status match” that guarantees the same elite status for a small fee.

Kenton Jarvis, the chief executive of easyJet, said that Europe’s second largest airline — increasingly viewed as an alternative to BA — was considering launching a loyalty scheme in the wake of the Club changes, although he admitted that there were no imminent plans.

There are new schemes from the ultra-low-cost airlines too. At the end of March Ryanair launched Prime, a subscriber discount scheme that for £79 a year gives members reserved seats, travel insurance and access to a monthly exclusive seat sale. It says that passengers who fly more than 12 times a year will save with this offer, although frequent flyers will note that baggage is not included.

Last September Wizz Air, which mainly flies to Europe, along with some mid-haul routes to Saudi Arabia, launched a popular “all-you-can-fly” product. It costs £599 for the year and allows passengers to take an unlimited number of flights — although baggage costs and an £8 admin fee per flight are chargeable.

• British Airways’ loyalty changes are the end of middle-class flight perks

“We can also expect a new wave of matches from these airlines next spring as current BA elite members face up to status expiry on April 30,” Burgess says. “And easyJet also smells blood and will hopefully have its own loyalty scheme up and running by the end of the year, ready to match British Airways’ elites.”

If not, he advises passengers to become “free agents” — selecting flights based on price, schedule and the airline service. “It’s a novel idea for BA Club members, but it might catch on,” he says.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced the establishment of the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO), a new independent body tasked with managing the upcoming global registry for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, said CADO would oversee the SAF registry as an entity separate from IATA, operating under a global methodology designed to ensure transparency and build trust among stakeholders.

“The creation of CADO supports IATA’s soon-to-be-launched SAF Registry and reflects our commitment to rigorous oversight,” Owens Thomsen said. She called on all relevant parties across the SAF value chain, including governments, to join the organisation and support its mission.

What Makes These 50-Euro Bills So Problematic?
The 50-euro bill is the most commonly used note in Spain.
If you spot a suspicious blue or purple mark on a 50-euro note, don’t attempt to use it.
This move by the Bank of Spain is less about causing panic and more about raising awareness.","Tourists in Spain may not realize they’re at risk of carrying cash that’s suddenly become worthless.

A new warning from the Bank of Spain highlights a quiet but urgent issue just as the country gears up for its busy summer travel season: certain 50-euro bills are being withdrawn from circulation starting this April.

These aren’t counterfeit notes. They’re real banknotes that have been stained—usually with blue or violet ink—by anti-theft security systems embedded in ATMs. This technology is designed to fight physical theft by releasing a chemical dye if tampering is detected. The result? A stained bill that’s no longer usable in shops, restaurants, or even for personal exchanges.

What Makes These 50-Euro Bills So Problematic?

The 50-euro bill is the most commonly used note in Spain. Its mid-range value makes it ideal for tourists paying for meals, train tickets, or souvenirs. Unfortunately, it’s also the most targeted for both counterfeiting and anti-theft staining. When these notes get marked with ink, they’re considered invalid—even though they’re not fake. This presents a big problem for travelers who may unknowingly accept them in transactions.

It’s important to note that the ink-staining system doesn’t make a bill counterfeit, but it does render it unfit for future use. If you try to spend one, you may be denied service or questioned. And if you received the bill during a legitimate transaction, you likely won’t get reimbursed—unless you can prove you were the direct victim of a crime.

As part of this recall, the Bank of Spain is asking everyone to double-check their cash—especially bills received through informal exchanges or small businesses that handle a lot of paper currency. Since the stains may look subtle or accidental, travelers could easily miss the warning signs.

If you spot a suspicious blue or purple mark on a 50-euro note, don’t attempt to use it. Instead, bring it to a local bank branch, where staff can analyze the note and determine if a replacement is possible. The process may take time and doesn’t guarantee reimbursement, but it’s the best available option.

Why Now? Summer Season Brings More Cash—and More Risk

Spain’s tourist season sees a significant rise in cash payments, especially from international travelers who may prefer cash over cards to avoid foreign transaction fees. This influx also increases the chances of fraudulent or damaged notes entering circulation. By recalling these ink-marked bills, Spanish authorities aim to reduce confusion and prevent unnecessary losses during the peak travel months.

At the same time, Europe is experiencing a gradual shift away from physical currency. The latest report from the Bank of Spain shows that while most people still use cash regularly, digital payments through cards and mobile apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay are quickly catching up. In fact, countries like Sweden are already well on their way to becoming nearly cashless.

Governments across Europe are encouraging this shift to digital payments not just for convenience, but also to curb tax evasion and reduce untraceable transactions. For tourists, this means paying by card or app is often the safer choice—especially in unfamiliar cities or when dealing with large sums of money.

Still, many travelers prefer to carry at least some cash for emergencies, small purchases, or tipping. If that’s you, make sure to inspect every note you receive. Look carefully for any signs of discoloration or blotchy ink, particularly in shades of blue or violet. If you’re unsure, ask for another note or head to a bank before continuing your travels.

This move by the Bank of Spain is less about causing panic and more about raising awareness. It’s a proactive step to ensure travelers and locals alike aren’t left with unusable money—and to stay one step ahead of fraudsters in a rapidly changing financial landscape.

,,2025-04-05 00:11:48+00:00,Clean Air Task Force,Aviation could consume almost all available biofuel for decarbonization – maritime shipping ...,Kara Hunt,,,,,https://www.catf.us/fr/2025/04/aviation-could-consume-almost-available-biofuel-decarbonization-maritime-shipping-needs-broaden-own-strategy/,"The aviation industry and the maritime industry have both made commitments to reduce their net greenhouse emissions to near-zero by midcentury.
One such implication has to do with biofuel, an energy carrier that is central to both industries’ plans, in particular because biofuels can be blended with conventional shipping and aviation fuel.
The implication for the maritime sector is clear: the role that biofuels can play in its energy transition will be small at most.
For a variety of reasons, ammonia may be a compelling option for fuel-shifting in the maritime shipping sector.
Turning marine sector targets in achievable strategy Country representatives, industry groups, and nongovernmental organizations are gathering in London for the 83rd convening of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee.","The aviation industry and the maritime industry have both made commitments to reduce their net greenhouse emissions to near-zero by midcentury. A variety of measures of varying effectiveness and reliability can be deployed to lower the industries’ net emissions – efficiency improvements, mode-shifting, on-shoring, and out-of-sector offsets, to name a few – but the most important, most impactful step will be to deeply reduce the carbon intensity (CI) of the fuels that power airplanes and marine vessels.

A wholesale shift to low carbon intensity energy carriers poses huge quantitative and qualitative challenges for the two industries, particularly because they need to move in concert. The challenges associated with the shift and the tools that might be used to address them are connected in ways that have important implications for each sector’s decarbonization strategy. One such implication has to do with biofuel, an energy carrier that is central to both industries’ plans, in particular because biofuels can be blended with conventional shipping and aviation fuel. In recent model runs that consulting firm DNV prepared for the International Maritime Organization (IMO), maritime sector demand for biofuel reaches 2.0-7.8 Exajoules (EJ) by 2050 – or roughly 47% to 181% of the 4.3 EJ of biofuels currently produced worldwide.1

The problem, in short, is that the amount of biofuel the two industries expect to use going forward far exceeds the amount of existing biofuels, and scaling new climate-beneficial biofuels and supply chains entails significant challenges. Airlines have fewer alternatives when it comes to energy carriers so they will be highly motivated to outspend marine shipping companies (and every other industry) for all the biofuel they can get. The implication for the maritime sector is clear: the role that biofuels can play in its energy transition will be small at most.

As the International Maritime Organization finalizes a set of industry-wide, midcentury decarbonization targets this month, a measure of its commitment to those targets will be the extent to which it acknowledges the competing demands that will frustrate biofuel-based strategies and prioritizes the development of other low-carbon energy carriers and compatible propulsion systems.

Massive demand for biofuel in both industries faces limited supply and climate-beneficial supply challenges

The total amount of energy that the aviation sector and the maritime sector will need in 2050 is projected to be about 38 EJ – 24 EJ for aviation and 14 EJ for maritime. Any number of things – upturns or downturns in the global economy, major shifts in demographics, policy, or consumer behavior – could cause the actual level of energy demand from the two sectors to be substantially higher or lower than 38 EJ, but the challenge remains unavoidably stark: the aviation and maritime sectors are set to consume roughly the same amount of energy each year as India currently does, and all that energy will need to be clean.

And not just any form of clean energy will do. The process of moving a cargo-laden, 200,000-tonne vessel across ten thousand kilometers of ocean favors energy-dense fuels, especially because the amount of space dedicated to on-board energy storage affects the amount of paying cargo a ship can carry. Aircraft have even less leeway. Because liquid fuels that pack a lot of energy into a small and lightweight package help mitigate the fundamental difficulty of getting and staying aloft, energy-dense hydrocarbons power the vast majority of aviation applications and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Battery-powered aircraft are under development, but they face formidable constraints around size and range.

For years, then, the aviation industry has looked to biofuel as the energy carrier it could lean on to achieve deep emission reductions. It popularized a generic-sounding term for the fuel – “sustainable aviation fuel” or SAF – that appropriates biofuels’ promise of a carbon-neutral, closed-loop future while also keeping some distance from biofuel’s real challenges. Regardless of how it’s marketed, though, SAF made from biogenic matter is still biofuel – which means that bio-SAF production at scale poses many of the same challenges to food markets, water quality, and ecosystem health that have made the mass production of ethanol and biodiesel for on-road vehicles so problematic.

The environmental benefit of conventional biofuels on a per-unit basis typically gets smaller as overall production levels get bigger. Fuels made from wastes like crop residue and other advanced feedstocks can deliver real reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions, but the supply of suitable waste biomass is limited, and it remains to be seen if other advanced feedstock supply chains can be significantly scaled. The vast bulk of biofuels made today come from commodity oilseeds and starches like soy and corn grown with emitting inputs on prime farmland. Producing exajoules worth of biofuel is easier and cheaper when the feedstocks are cultivated, harvested, and processed on huge tracts using industrial agricultural equipment and practices. Sustainable intensification and strategic perennialization of agricultural land could increase climate-beneficial feedstock supply, but expanding biomass supply chains could cause direct or indirect conversion of grasslands and forests into agricultural land, depending on how the biomass is grown.

As detailed by CATF in Decarbonizing Aviation: Challenges and Opportunities for Emerging Fuels (2022), the International Energy Agency (IEA) published a determination that the global supply of “sustainable” biofuel could roughly triple between 2021 and 2030. Setting aside doubts that such an increase could occur without driving significant land use change-related GHG emissions, CATF compared IEA’s 2030 supply estimate to the projected energy demand from the aviation sector and found that the entire global supply of biofuels would amount to 69% of the energy that aircraft will need in 2030, 59% in 2040, and 52% in 2050. A subsequent report from CATF, Decarbonizing Aviation: Enabling Technologies for a Net-Zero Future (2024), outlines the extent to which the aviation industry will need to rapidly develop and deploy other energy carriers like synthetic SAF and hydrogen, given that all the world’s liquid biofuel can only meet about half of the sector’s mid-century energy demand. The process of commercializing synthetic hydrocarbons will be slow and expensive; the same is true for introducing hydrogen aircraft. Employing high-quality offsets from direct air capture or biomass carbon removal systems (which may produce hydrogen as a co-product) will also require a significant amount of time to scale. As such, the aviation industry will want to mitigate the related financial and logistical challenges by maximizing its use of bio-SAF, so it is unlikely to get outbid for the available supply of biofuel, especially by industries that can turn to other options.

The marine shipping industry must look beyond biofuels to decarbonize

Fortunately, marine shipping is one of those industries that has enough operational flexibility to avoid getting into a bidding war with the aviation sector. In Managing the Transition to Zero-Carbon Marine Fuels (2024), CATF shows how ship owners can gradually but significantly reduce their emissions by deploying dual-fuel engine technologies and phasing in low-carbon fuels.

For a variety of reasons, ammonia may be a compelling option for fuel-shifting in the maritime shipping sector. The production of ammonia is massively scalable because its constituent parts – nitrogen and hydrogen – are nearly inexhaustible (although isolating hydrogen is energy-intensive). However, like biofuels, optimal engineering practices and management strategies must be implemented to avoid high reactive nitrogen losses, which could negate any GHG emissions reductions. Ammonia can be used as fuel in both purpose-designed and modified internal combustion engines (ICEs), either neat or in a blend with petroleum fuel. Marine vessels are especially well-positioned to use ammonia-fueled ICEs because they can accommodate heavier engines and larger fuel tanks more easily. Many ports already site and build ammonia storage and handling equipment, which could help lessen the chicken-or-egg problem that often confounds the transition to alternative transportation fuels. Finally, more work needs to be done to test ammonia’s safety as an energy carrier, but marine vessels are already fueled and operated by professionals who can be trained to handle it safely.

Turning marine sector targets in achievable strategy

Country representatives, industry groups, and nongovernmental organizations are gathering in London for the 83rd convening of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee. The agenda is anything but dry: the delegates are set to approve measures “aimed at driving the international shipping industry’s transition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by or around, i.e. close to, 2050.” The measures to be endorsed are a global pricing mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions and “a goal-based marine fuel standard that will phase in the mandatory use of fuels with less GHG intensity.”

The carbon intensity standard will be a powerful tool for eliminating maritime sector emissions, provided the IMO designs the standard to account for global, multi-sector trends in the energy market. Because one of those trends is the growing mismatch between demand for low-carbon biofuels and the volume at which biofuels can be sustainably produced, a carbon intensity standard for the maritime sector that assumes significant access to biofuels is destined to fail.

The maritime sector’s new midcentury targets are commendable. But targets require execution, and execution requires commitment and foresight. Industry and governments can demonstrate their commitment to the mid-century targets by supporting the development of viable decarbonization pathways that don’t depend on access to biofuel (e.g., by limiting the extent to which biofuels can earn compliance credits under a clean fuel standard or by subsidizing the use of synthetic fuels), and they can demonstrate foresight by steering investment toward dual-fuel engines, on-board storage technologies, bunkering facilities, and other technologies that support the transition to ammonia and/or other massively-scalable low-carbon fuels.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02104338/GettyImages-1300225698-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 23:56:46.916995

IATA represents 340 airlines that comprise over eighty percent of global air traffic. The SAF Registry will be managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) and seeks to encourage the shift toward net zero emissions by 2050.

What is the SAF Registry?

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry is a global system, created by the International Air Travel Association (IATA) to record and organise fuel transactions. The standardisation of these accounts allows for greater transparency of fuel purchases and consumption. This, in turn, can be used to stimulate the achievement of environmental aims. The Registry has been developed in consultation with airlines, government authorities, original equipment manufacturers, fuel producers and suppliers, and corporate travel management companies. There are currently over 30 early users who are in the process of onboarding and ready to use the SAF Registry system.

The SAF Registry is managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO). The Canadian-based not-for-profit was created by IATA in March 2025 for the sole purpose of maintaining and operating the Registry. As a founding member, IATA continues to provide technical and operational support for the SAF Registry.

What are the aims of the SAF Registry?

SAF is a scarce resource and is only attainable in a few countries around the world. The Registry will help to connect airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, simultaneously reducing the issue of geographical distance and lessening the challenge of limited SAF supply. This new network encourages a call for an accelerated transition toward decarbonisation, highlighting a responsibility to support renewable energy sources by lowering costs. In addition to this, the Registry allows for increased communication and connectivity, benefiting global harmonisation.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist said:

You can earn up to 1,000 Tier Points per membership year by purchasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credits. You can do this via cash or Avios and effectively buy tier points.

What Are Sustainable Aviation Fuels?

If you’ve seen the term SAF pop up more often recently and wondered what it means, here’s what you need to know. SAF is an alternative to traditional jet fuel made from synthetic aviation fuels, aviation biofuels, or recycled carbon aviation fuels.

When burned, they produce carbon dioxide levels similar to conventional aviation fuels, but the carbon dioxide generated is already part of the carbon cycle and not extracted from the ground specifically for creating aviation fuel.

The end result is a reduction in carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. SAF is still in short supply and accounts for just 2.7% of British Airways’ total fuel use. BA was legally required to use a minimum of 2% SAF by 2025, which will increase to 10% by 2030.

The Cost and Value

Reminder: 1,000 Tier Points do not have the value they used to. You now need 1,500 for Bronze, 7,500 for Silver and 20,000 for Gold.

You can spend a maximum of £1,000 on SAF contributions each membership year (1st April to 31st March) or each £1 you spend on SAF, you will be awarded 10 Avios and 1 tier point.

You can track the number of Avios and Tier Points you would earn on the SAF calculator on the landing page:

You can also purchase this amount using 125,000 Avios.

However, you would get 10,000 Avios back paying with Avios, making it 115,000 Avios, which is still a very poor value.

Spending £1,000 or 125,000 Avios is equivalent to saving 4.31 tonnes of CO₂e. You can track the amount you spend on SAF contributions on your British Airways Club statement. You can also look at the Tier Point awarding tracker on the landing page:

When Would Purchasing SAF be Worth It?

Forget about Tier Points for a moment. If you would consider contributing to SAF without your transaction being able to earn Tier Points, that’s a personal decision.

If you’re purchasing SAF to increase your Tier Point balance, this is only really worth it if you’re short of just a few tier points needed to reach the next tier without flying. Even then, you need to think that each Tier Point is £1 and how much reaching the next Tier in The British Airways Club is worth for you. If you’re using Avios to purchase SAF for this purpose, is the transaction the best use of your Avios?

Where is Your Money Going?

The SAF transaction is processed by BA’s partner Chooose.

According to the T&Cs:

“When you contribute to SAF today, you are doing so by purchasing the attributes associated with a given amount of unblended, physical SAF which British Airways has flown or will fly on in the next 12 months. The sale of these attributes provides you, a buyer, with a claim to the carbon reduction benefit associated with the purchased amount of SAF“.

How This Differs from Other Airlines

Iberia Plus: The revamped Club Iberia loyalty programme offers plenty of ways to earn tier points from non-flight activities. At least these are live, as opposed to BA, which has launched the new British Airways Club without revealing details of how to earn tier points with AMEX! With Iberia, you can earn up to 30% of your status requirement through non-flying partners.

Air France-KLM: Instead of relying on a separate platform or asking members to manually “boost” their balance post-booking, Air France and KLM have integrated SAF donations directly into the flight booking process.

It would be good to see more BA partner activities count towards status!

Other Things to Note

There is a £10 minimum per transaction.

Your tier points and Avios should be credited to your account within 72 hours.

Final Words

There’s no doubt that contributing to Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a good thing in principle. It’s great to see BA making it part of their net zero push.

Before you rush to start spending Avios, you should know that while it’s great to have more ways to earn Tier Points, this is arguably one of the worst-value opportunities unless you’re in a very specific situation. Unless you’re just short of the next tier and have no travel planned before your membership year ends, spending £1,000 or 125,000 Avios for 1,000 Tier Points is hard to justify.

It’s up to you whether you want to contribute to SAF. If you do this, it’s best not to do it solely to earn tier points but more for the environmental benefits.

IATA SAF REGISTRY LAUNCHED

The SAF Registry is a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way.

It ensures that the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked as they move across the SAF value chain and enable the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost-recovery basis.

Significantly, this Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply —which is acutely scarce. SAF is currently available in only a few locations globally.

The Registry thus connects airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location.

In addition, it gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonization.

The SAF Registry is technology and feedstock-neutral, therefore favoring the emergence of diverse SAF production streams across the world.

It will be able to accommodate specific regulations while favoring global harmonization.

Moreover, interoperability with other registries is an important feature of the Registry, supporting competition and open markets.

The Registry was developed in consultation with airlines, government authorities, OEMs, fuel producers and suppliers, as well as corporate travel management companies.

With over 30 early users already in the process of onboarding and ready to use the system, the Registry is underpinned by the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology which provides a consistent approach to accounting for the environmental benefits of SAF purchases, regardless of location.

Tallow suppliers in Brazil for instance were already experiencing decreased interest from US producers before tariffs.
In general, market participants say international tallow suppliers would have to drop offers to keep trade flows intact.
But tariffs on major suppliers of tallow to the US, and the threat of additional charges if countries retaliate, could give refiners pause.
Biofuel producers in these zones could theoretically refine foreign tallow, claim a 45Z subsidy, and avoid feedstock tariffs as long as they ship the fuel abroad.","New US tariffs on nearly all foreign products could deter further imports of beef tallow, a fast-rising biofuel feedstock and food ingredient that had until now largely evaded President Donald Trump's efforts to reshape global trade.

Tallow was the most used feedstock for US biomass-based diesel production in January for the first month ever, with consumption by pound rising month to month despite sharp declines in actual biorefining and in use of competing feedstocks. The beef byproduct benefits from US policies, including a new federal tax credit known as ""45Z"", that offer greater subsidies to fuel derived from waste than fuel derived from first-generation crops.

Much of that tallow is sourced domestically, but the US also imported more than 880,000t of tallow last year, up 29pc from just two years earlier. The majority of those imports last year came from Brazil, which until now has faced a small 0.43¢/kg (19.5¢/lb) tariff, and from Australia, which was exempt from any tallow-specific tariffs under a free trade agreement with US. But starting on 5 April, both countries will be subject to at least the new 10pc charge on foreign imports. There are some carveouts from tariffs for certain energy products, but animal fats are not included.

Some other major suppliers — like Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand — will soon have new tariffs in place too, although tallow from Canada is for now unaffected because it is covered by the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement.

Brazil tallow shipments to the US totaled around 300,000t in 2024, marking an all-time high, but tallow shipments during the fourth quarter of 2024 fell under the 2023 levels as uncertainty about future tax policy slowed buying interest. Feedstock demand in general in the US has remained muted to start this year because of poor biofuel production margins, and that has extended to global tallow flows.

Tallow suppliers in Brazil for instance were already experiencing decreased interest from US producers before tariffs. Brazil tallow prices for export last closed at $1,080/t on 28 March, rising about 4pc year-to-date amid support from the 45Z guidance and aid from Brazil's growing biodiesel industry, which is paying a hefty premium for tallow compared to exports.

While the large majority of Brazilian tallow exports end up in the US, Australian suppliers have more flexibility and could send more volume to Singapore instead if tariffs deter US buyers. Export prices out of Australia peaked this year at $1,185/t on 4 March but have since trended lower to last close at $1,050/t on 1 April.

In general, market participants say international tallow suppliers would have to drop offers to keep trade flows intact.

Other policy shifts affect flows

Even as US farm groups clamored for more muscular foreign feedstock limits over much of the last year, tallow had until now largely dodged any significant restrictions. Recent US guidance around 45Z treats all tallow, whether produced in the US or shipped long distances to reach the US, the same. Other foreign feedstocks were treated more harshly, with the same guidance providing no pathway at all for road fuels from foreign used cooking oil and also pinning the carbon intensity of canola oil — largely from Canada — as generally too high to claim any subsidy.

But tariffs on major suppliers of tallow to the US, and the threat of additional charges if countries retaliate, could give refiners pause. Demand could rise for domestic animal fats or alternatively for domestic vegetable oils that can also be refined into fuel, especially if retaliatory tariffs cut off global markets for US farm products like soybean oil. There is also risk if Republicans in the Trump administration or Congress reshape rules around 45Z to penalize foreign feedstocks.

At the same time, a minimum 10pc charge for tallow outside North America is a more manageable price to pay compared to other feedstocks — including a collection of charges amounting to a possible 69.5pc tax on Chinese used cooking oil. And if the US sets biofuel blend mandates as high as some oil and farm groups are pushing, strong demand could leave producers with little choice but to continue importing at least some feedstock from abroad to continue making fuel.

Not all US renewable diesel producers will be equally impacted by tariffs either. Diamond Green Diesel operates Gulf Coast biorefineries in foreign-trade zones, which allow companies to avoid tariffs on foreign inputs for products that are ultimately exported. Biofuel producers in these zones could theoretically refine foreign tallow, claim a 45Z subsidy, and avoid feedstock tariffs as long as they ship the fuel abroad. Jurisdictions like the EU and UK, where sustainable aviation fuel mandates took effect this year, are attractive destinations.

And there is still strong demand from the US food sector, with edible tallow prices in Chicago up 18pc so far this year. Trump allies, including his top health official, have pushed tallow as an alternative to seed oils.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-04-05 04:56:41.166614

SAF — fuel made from renewable sources like used cooking oil or agricultural waste — has been touted as a key solution.
That’s where the SAF Registry comes in, according to IATA.
“In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders.
While IATA played a key role in creating the system, the goal is for the registry to operate independently, with membership open to international organizations and companies across the SAF supply chain.","The global aviation industry just got a major boost in its push toward sustainability. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has launched a new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, a system designed to track and verify SAF transactions worldwide. Now managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), the registry aims to create a transparent and reliable marketplace for SAF, helping airlines and corporate customers account for their emissions reductions.

Ensuring Transparency in SAF Transactions

With aviation responsible for about 2-3% of global carbon emissions, the industry is under increasing pressure to cut its environmental impact. SAF — fuel made from renewable sources like used cooking oil or agricultural waste — has been touted as a key solution. But there’s a problem: supply is extremely limited, and it’s often difficult to track who is using SAF and how much of a difference it’s actually making.

That’s where the SAF Registry comes in, according to IATA. The system is designed to ensure that every gallon of SAF is properly recorded, eliminating concerns about double counting and allowing airlines to claim their SAF investments toward emissions reductions.

“Aviation’s decarbonization is a team effort,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist. “In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders. It ensures that all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain.”

One of the biggest barriers to SAF adoption has been its availability. Right now, production is concentrated in just a few locations, making it logistically difficult—and expensive—for many airlines to incorporate SAF into their operations. The registry could help solve that problem by connecting fuel producers with airlines no matter where they are, making it easier for the industry to scale up SAF usage.

Beyond airlines, the registry is also designed to involve corporate customers. Large businesses that rely on air travel for their operations have been looking for ways to offset their emissions, and the registry gives them a way to directly invest in SAF. By purchasing SAF credits, companies can contribute to aviation’s decarbonization while also meeting their own sustainability goals.

CADO, the organization now responsible for maintaining and operating the registry, was founded in March and is based in Montreal. While IATA played a key role in creating the system, the goal is for the registry to operate independently, with membership open to international organizations and companies across the SAF supply chain.

This funding comes from the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP).

The investment includes projects approved in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration. It also supports President Trump’s 20th Executive Order to boost American energy production and help farmers, ranchers, and small businesses in rural areas.

Powering America’s Energy Landscape with Biofuels

Biofuels are liquid fuels made from plant or animal materials, commonly called feedstocks. They can also include gases like methane (from landfills or biogas) and hydrogen (from renewable sources). While most biofuels power vehicles, they can also be used for heating and electricity. Many government programs support biofuel use because they come from renewable sources.

Different industries and laws use various names for biofuels—like ethanol, biodiesel, biojet, or sustainable aviation fuel.

The press release highlighted that Secretary Rollins announced the investment at an event at Elite Octane LLC. This company is in Atlantic, Iowa, which has the highest capacity of biofuel production in America. Iowa has 42 ethanol plants that produce more than 4.7 billion gallons each year and 10 biodiesel plants that generate 416 million gallons annually.

The funding will help gas stations upgrade their storage tanks and fuel pumps. This makes higher ethanol and biodiesel blends more available. Farmers, small businesses, and local economies benefit from this as it creates more demand for corn and soybeans.

Biofuel exports are also on the rise. USDA revealed that in 2024, the U.S. exported 585,324 metric tons of ethanol, bringing in $5.11 billion. The key buyers were Canada, South Korea, and the European Union. They all want cleaner fuels more than ever.

What’s Inside the Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP)

The Higher Blends Infrastructure Incentive Program (HBIIP) was established at USDA Rural Development during President Trump’s first term. Under this program, gas stations can offer biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel more easily. It helps cover the cost of upgrading fuel pumps and storage tanks so more drivers can choose cleaner, homegrown fuel.

About 290 million cars on U.S. roads can use E15, a fuel blend with 15% ethanol. More than 22 million vehicles can run on E85, which has even more ethanol. Diesel vehicles can use B20, a blend with 20% biodiesel. Expanding access to these fuels helps drivers save money and reduces pollution.

Supporting Farmers and Rural Businesses

HBIIP creates more demand for crops like corn and soybeans, which are used to make biofuels. This investment will help American farmers and boost rural economies. It will also give easy access to cleaner and homegrown fuel to drivers.

Overall, as families gain more access to biofuels like ethanol and biodiesel, they end up paying less.

Secretary Rollins confirmed this by noting,

“President Trump is honoring our commitment to America’s farmers, ranchers and small businesses, especially here in Iowa where corn and soy growers are crucial to supporting ethanol and biodiesel production. Under the President’s leadership, we are moving away from the harmful effects of misguided climate policies like the Green New Deal. Instead, the USDA will deploy energy investments that prioritize the needs of our rural communities. Through HBIIP, we will expand access to domestic, homegrown fuels which will increase good paying jobs for hardworking Americans, restore rural prosperity and strengthen our nation’s energy security.”

Ethanol: The Emission Control Champion

Ethanol is the most common biofuel. It’s a renewable alcohol fuel made from crops like corn, sugarcane, or other plant materials. Microbes (like yeast) break down or ferment plant sugars, turning them into ethanol.

It’s often mixed with gasoline, like E10 (10% ethanol, 90% gasoline), to reduce emissions and improve engine performance. Ethanol is also used in chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing industries.

The Census Bureau of the U.S. revealed that ethanol exports for 2024 totaled 1.72 billion gallons just through November. It surpassed the previous annual record of 1.67 billion gallons set in 2018.

Poet Biorefining is the largest ethanol producer in the United States. As of 2024, the South Dakota-based company had an ethanol production capacity of 2.7 billion gallons per annum across 33 plants in the Midwest.

A USDA study showed that greenhouse gas emissions from corn-based ethanol are about 39 percent lower than gasoline.

Thus, using more biofuels is a step toward a cleaner, energy-independent future.

US Biodiesel Exports Drop Sharply in 2024

Biodiesel is a clean-burning alternative to regular diesel, made from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled cooking grease. It’s non-toxic and breaks down naturally.

The most common blend is B20, which is 20% biodiesel and 80% regular diesel.

While most biodiesel fuels trucks and heavy machinery, a small amount is now used for heating and electricity. In 2023, about 95% of U.S. biodiesel went to transportation.

The US Census Bureau reported that biodiesel exports took a steep dive in 2024, falling 30% from the previous year’s record high. The US exported 176.8 million gallons in 2024, down from 254.5 million gallons in 2023. This was the lowest volume since 2020, when 142.8 million gallons were shipped.

Export volume of biodiesel from the United States from 2001 to 2023 (in 1,000 barrels)

Canada and Peru remained the top buyers, together accounting for over 99% of total US biodiesel exports in both years. However, exports to Canada dropped 33%, while volumes to Peru saw a modest 2.4% rise.

Fastmarkets noted that some exporters pointed to stricter Canadian rules as a key reason for the drop. This means that new traceability and harvest attestation requirements under Canada’s CFR likely slowed shipments starting in September.

Others suggested that growing renewable diesel imports may have reduced Canada’s need for biodiesel. Unlike biodiesel, renewable diesel performs well in cold weather.

Renewable Diesel Reshaping U.S. Fuel Market

Regular gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel are made from hydrocarbons (hydrogen + carbon molecules). But renewable variants are made from feedstocks such as vegetable oils, animal fats, or used cooking oil. The raw materials for biodiesel and renewable diesel are the same. Renewable hydrocarbon fuels are also called Drop-in” Fuels.

There has been a significant rise in the U.S. to import more fats and oils because of the strong demand for renewable hydrocarbon fuels.

The renewable versions are nearly identical to petroleum diesel and, therefore, are compatible with existing engines and pipelines. This makes them an easy switch from fossil fuels. However, the cost of renewable diesel is higher than traditional petroleum.

From the chart, we can see that last year, the renewable diesel capacity of the U.S. was around 5.5 billion gallons per year. USDA also forecasts the capacity to hit ~ 6.5 billion gallons per year by 2025.

California Drives Real Growth

California’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) played a major role in renewable diesel’s growth. It gives carbon credits to fuel producers who cut emissions. Since the state maxed out ethanol and biodiesel blending, blenders switched to renewable diesel, as it has no blending limit.

This policy gave investors confidence. They invested in new projects, knowing the demand would last. Notably, because of LCFS, renewable diesel is now a key player in America’s clean fuel market.

Two major federal programs support the growth of renewable diesel:

Blender’s Tax Credit cuts production costs by giving tax breaks to companies that blend renewable diesel with petroleum diesel.

Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) requires biofuels—like ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel—to be part of the national fuel supply.

Oil and Biofuel Groups Debate Higher Blending Mandates

Reuters reported that oil and biofuel companies met with the EPA, pushing for higher biomass diesel blending mandates. This could signal upcoming changes to U.S. biofuel policies.

The coalition wants to raise biomass diesel mandates to 5.5–5.75 billion gallons, up from 3.35 billion, and keep the ethanol mandate at 15 billion gallons. However, smaller refiners argue these increases could hurt jobs and raise fuel prices.

Fuel retailers and truck stop operators skipped the talks, demanding the return of the blenders tax credit, which they say helped keep fuel costs down. Without it, they warn that higher mandates could lead to price hikes (diesel prices by 30¢/USG) and political backlash.

The EPA has not commented on the issue yet.

Overall, biofuels offer cleaner alternatives to traditional fuels, helping reduce pollution while keeping cars, trucks, and planes running smoothly. Amid all resistance and higher costs, it could be a key factor in America’s energy transition.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2502286989.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 15:56:28.660482

Emphasizing the urgency behind the legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister highlighted the vision and mission driving this initiative, crediting strong leadership for the rapid expansion of the aviation sector.
The minister also emphasized the significant increase in the number of aircraft, from 340 in 2014 to over 840 by 2024.
Looking ahead, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has set ambitious targets for sustainability and capacity building.","The Protection of Interest in Aircraft Objects Bill, 2025, introduced by Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu, was passed in the Lok Sabha on April 3, following its earlier approval in the Rajya Sabha. With both Houses clearing the legislation, this marks the second major aviation reform under his leadership.

The bill aims to align India’s aircraft leasing and financing ecosystem with global standards, providing a critical boost to investor confidence in the country’s rapidly growing aviation market.

It builds on the framework of the Cape Town Convention of 2001, which sought to simplify and standardize international leasing agreements. Although India formally adopted this convention in 2008, gaps in legal enforcement led to higher leasing costs—typically 8 to 10 percent higher than in other nations. This legislation aims to address those gaps, ensuring legal certainty for aircraft financiers and reducing costs for Indian carriers.

Emphasizing the urgency behind the legislation, the Civil Aviation Minister highlighted the vision and mission driving this initiative, crediting strong leadership for the rapid expansion of the aviation sector. He pointed to concrete figures demonstrating this growth: between Independence and 2014, the total number of passengers flying annually in India stood at 10.38 crore.

In just the next decade, that number more than doubled to 22.81 crore in 2024. Similarly, the number of airports in India grew from 74 in 2014 to 159 in 2024, with two more set to be launched soon.

The minister also emphasized the significant increase in the number of aircraft, from 340 in 2014 to over 840 by 2024. He stated that no other country has witnessed such rapid aviation expansion in such a short period.

The bill is expected to streamline leasing processes, make India a more attractive destination for aviation investments, and improve the country’s compliance scores under the Cape Town Convention. These changes are essential for reducing airline costs and encouraging new entrants into the sector.

Discussions on the bill also touched upon broader challenges in the civil aviation sector, such as the high cost of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which accounts for nearly 45% of an airline’s operational costs. The minister expressed concern over the variation in ATF tax across states and urged more states to follow the example of those who have reduced their rates. Lowering these taxes, he argued, would boost regional connectivity and reduce costs for passengers.

Looking ahead, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has set ambitious targets for sustainability and capacity building. Plans are in place to generate 2.5 crore liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2025 and transition over 100 airports to renewable energy, underscoring India’s commitment to greener aviation.

The sector also faces a growing demand for trained pilots, estimated at 30,000 to 34,000 over the next 10 to 15 years. The government is working on increasing the number of Flight Training Organizations (FTOs) and issuing more commercial pilot licenses annually to meet this demand.",https://ddnews.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/favicon.png,N,,2025-04-04 12:56:38.341254

“Our goal on this program was to update Chinese stakeholders on U.S. practices on biofuels, especially fuel ethanol for SAF, share the Council’s approach and achievements in promoting the use of biofuels for carbon reduction and provide reference values for Chinese government agencies to set industry standards and participate in international collaboration in the future,” Sanchez said.

The highlight of the mission was a SAF Partnership Conference held in Chengdu, organized by the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) and Sichuan Provincial Government that featured panel discussions and presentations about the current state of SAF and the pathways of stable and cost-competitive SAF.

Speaking during a panel session on feedstock diversification, Goh presented an overview on the potential role of alcohol to jet (ATJ) technology in supplementing China’s SAF production goals. While hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) fuel remains the primary pathway for SAF adoption, the Council believes there is value in discussing ethanol as an ATJ feedstock and staff sought to raise this awareness and propagate future discussions during the conference.

Later that day, the team met with SAF-focused staff from China National Aviation Fuel Southwest Company and Sichuan Airlines to better understand their goals for SAF production and use, industry standards and how the U.S. industry can support the international transportation sector’s goals of reducing carbon emissions.

The mission ended with a meeting with a local SAF producer that is building a production site in western China with a capacity of 500,000 tons of SAF per year. Goh gave a detailed presentation on the ATJ process and its commercial viability and the open discussion that followed demonstrated their willingness to explore alternative pathways to meet China’s SAF aspirations.

“We see great value in the partnership with USCBC and forming part of the vital event with guests representing the industry, policy, technology and investment in the SAF value chain. As the world’s two largest civil aviation markets, China and the United States can help countries achieve complementary advantages in the production, transportation and use of SAF and enhance global SAF supply capacity and efficiency,” Sanchez said.

“China currently consumes 40 million tons of jet fuel per year. Under the Fly Net Zero initiative adopted by the International Air Transport Association in 2021, the global aviation industry is committed to achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050, and the Council is ready to support China’s aviation industry in its decarbonization goals in the years to come.”

Microsoft’s contribution to the cost of SAF production will support the airlines within IAG with the overall reduction of lifecycle emissions.","International Airlines Group and Microsoft are strengthening their efforts to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions across the industry by extending their 2023 co-funded purchase agreement for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by five years. Under the new terms, Microsoft will co-fund an additional 39,000 metric tons of SAF that will help reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by approximately 113,000 metric tons. The extension to the agreement enables Microsoft to address Scope 3 lifecycle emissions and is the largest and longest Scope 3 SAF agreement to date, according to publicly available data.

Scope 3 encompasses lifecycle carbon emissions that are not produced by a company itself, but that it is indirectly responsible for up and down its value chain. By partnering with its corporate customers, IAG is able to purchase more SAF and reduce its Scope 1 (direct) emissions. Corporate customers also benefit by lowering Scope 3 lifecycle emissions from the industry commensurate to a proportion of their corporate flying.

Microsoft is also co-funding SAF that is used by the Group’s airlines to ship data center components globally, in partnership with Microsoft’s freight forwarders. Microsoft’s contribution to the cost of SAF production will support the airlines within IAG with the overall reduction of lifecycle emissions.

Jonathon Counsell, IAG’s group sustainability officer, said, “We’re pleased to work with like-minded organizations such as Microsoft to expand efforts to reduce flying lifecycle emissions. Long-term agreements help encourage much-needed funding in SAF production, something that IAG is championing through our investment in global SAF projects such as LanzaJet.”

Julia Fidler, environmental sustainability fuel and materials decarbonization lead at Microsoft, said, ""We are taking our collaboration with IAG further, extending our SAF purchase agreement to bring Microsoft closer to our goal of being carbon negative by 2030, while ensuring a multi-year commitment to help drive greater SAF production. We are pleased to work alongside IAG on efforts to increase demand and make SAF more widely available through our shared long-term purchase agreement.”

Using alternative fuel sources – rather than newly extracted fossil materials – means SAF releases existing carbon, instead of adding new carbon from fossil fuels to the atmosphere. By the end of 2024, 1.9% of IAG's total fuel usage for the year was SAF and total expenditure, including future commitments for SAF offtakes, exceeded $3.5 billion. IAG has been working with the aviation industry in its campaign for further government policy support to stimulate investment in new SAF production technologies.

The SAF used as part of the IAG and Microsoft agreement will be produced from used cooking oil and food waste at Phillips 66’s Humberside refinery, and from sustainably source bioethanol at Georgia-based Freedom Pines Fuels, LanzaJet’s facility in the United States. Both fuels are certified by International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC).

As the demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) markets grows, conservation practices like no-till farming and cover cropping are becoming increasingly important. Corn farmers are beginning to use conservation practices for the option to sell to companies wanting ethanol for SAF. Reducing the number of trips across the field, implementing minimal or no-till farming, and utilizing cover crops can significantly lower the Carbon Intensity (CI) score of corn used for SAF.

Justin Rahn, an Illinois corn farmer, recently went to the SAF conference, Illinois Future of Fuels: Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference, held by Illinois Manufacturers’ Association (IMA). Rahn spoke on a panel during this conference to talk about the conservation practices he partakes in and how they affect his farm. Attendees unfamiliar with farming practices were able to ask him questions about sustainable practices and learn their impacts directly from a farmer.

Reducing Carbon Intensity with Conservation Practices

""Fewer trips across the field, minimal tilling, and cover crops help reduce carbon emissions,"" Rahn explained. Some cover crops contribute by putting carbon directly into the soil, further improving sustainability by using crops as opposed to machines to implement carbon into the soil.

Precision Conservation Management Data Collection

Due to the requirements of SAF, farmers will need to track their conservation practices to have the opportunity to sell to SAF markets. ""I work with PCM [Precision Conservation Management], who collects and tracks everything I do on my farm. They meet with me twice a year to record what I planted, how much fertilizer I used, how many passes I made, and what inputs were applied to my fields. At the end of harvest, they track my yields, moisture levels, and transportation distances,"" Rahn shared.shared.

This data provides insights to farmers on the effectiveness of conservation practices and makes it easier for farmers to sell to SAF markets. These practices can be of great use to farmers, but they do come with challenges.

Challenges in Conservation

Farmers face several challenges when integrating conservation practices into their operations. ""Terminating cover crops at the right time can be difficult, especially when the weather doesn’t cooperate. Germination and growth in fall can be a struggle, particularly in dry soil conditions,"" Rahn explained.

Another issue is the high costs of using cover crops and the need for financial incentives. ""We need to be paid more for what we’re doing—cover crops cost money, and farmers need support to make it work,” Rahn expresses. He goes on to address that the companies who need the ethanol for SAF should be the ones to provide those incentives.

For conservation practices to be used by more farmers, they must have incentives. ""There is an incentive if the premium is high enough,"" Rahn stated. However, some farmers still rely on conventional methods like chisel plowing to manage soil compaction, highlighting the need for a balance between profitability and sustainability.

The company faced a hold on funding from the Department of Energy, tariffs on materials and equipment, and difficulties securing purchase agreements for recycled materials.

Mitch Hecht, the CEO and Founder of International Recycling Group, worried aloud in an October interview that public opinion could sink his fundraising efforts.

And that could have scuttled plans for one of the world's largest plastics recycling facilities that he hoped to build in Erie.

But even with a presidential election looming, Hecht said he wasn't concerned about the status of a Department of Energy conditional loan guarantee, announced in August, that would provide $182.6 million toward the project's $300 million price tag.

Such promises typically survived from one administration to the next.

Whatever the outcome of the election in November, Hecht said he expected the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office would make good on the conditional offer.

He was focused instead on the concern that public opposition could stand in the way of raising money for a project expected to create 300 jobs.

""Investors at Goldman Sachs are going to Google up what's going on,"" he said in that October interview. ""If the first thing they see is a ----show in Erie, nobody is going to want to invest. They are going to take their money and put it into something else.""

A statement from IRG on Thursday, however, suggests that the changes in administration policy made it more difficult to raise money.

""Among these challenges are a hold of unspecified duration placed on funding commitments issued by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office,"" IRG said in a statement. ""Additional challenges include recently-announced tariffs on materials and on equipment from Europe not made in the US, resulting in expectations of substantially higher project development costs than anticipated, as well as difficulties in securing long-term purchase agreements for recycled materials from plastics manufacturers and consumer product groups, many of whom are cutting back on sustainability pledges.""

Other loans are on hold as well

International Recycling Group's project hasn't been the only one affected.

According to an advisory from the international law firm of Holland & Knight, the Department of Energy has moved ahead with a $782 million advance on a loan guarantee for the development of sustainable aviation fuel.

However, that loan, according to Holland & Knight, marks the first significant disbursement to a DOE loan or grant project since President Donald Trump signed an executive order that paused the release of federal funds under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Improvement and Jobs Act, including Department of Energy Loans and Grants.

In October, Hecht defended the intentions of the loan program under President Joe Biden, which provided funds for projects deemed too risky for commercial lenders.

""it's doing exactly what the administration intended it for, which is to stand up to commercialize and deploy novel technologies that are ready for deployment,"" he said.

Pulling the plug wasn't easy for Hecht.

""I am personally devastated after 18 years of working to bring this vision to a reality that we have failed to overcome these challenges,” he said.

'To see it pulled is a significant loss'

Brandon Mendoza, CEO of the Erie Regional Chamber and Growth Partnership, expressed his own disappointment in a statement.

“The Erie Regional Chamber is frustrated by the financial pressure building due to economic uncertainty at the federal level, which IRG cited as the reason to cancel plans for its Erie plastics recycling plant project,"" he said in a statement.

""This project had significant support at the state and local level, across public and private sectors, and to see it pulled is a significant loss.""

Kim Thomas, executive director of Infinite Erie, also registered disappoint about canceling plans for the project.

""This project is part of the Infinite Erie investment playbook and has received widespread financial support across local and state government, as well as private sector investments,"" she said.

What brought the project to Erie in the first place?

There was more than one reason that Hecht chose Erie, including the presence of a thriving plastics industry and Penn State Behrend's status as one of the nation's leading schools for plastics engineering.

But it was something else that prompted Hecht to visit Erie after originally deciding on another location.

It was a news story about Erie Insurance announcing a $50 million Opportunity Zone investment fund.

He worked with the company for months to vet the concept.

By the time IRG was ready to announce its plans in October of 2020, Erie Insurance and Erie-based Plastek Group had agreed to make a combined $9 million investment in the project.

Plastek was more than an investor. It was on the road to becoming a customer.

The Erie-based company, which manufactures a large share of the deodorant containers used around the world, was under pressure from its customers to use recycled materials to make those containers.

In 2020, Dennis Prischak, the company's CEO, said ""We’re keenly aware of the increasing demand from consumers for post-use content in new packaging.""

Investors in the company react

There is little to suggest that either of those companies will be able to recover the money they invested to develop the business.

Speaking on behalf of Erie Insurance, company spokesman Matthew Cummings said, ""We are disappointed that the project is ending this way, but it is the right decision and only option given the current challenges and complexities.""

He went on to acknowledge the risk involved in an investment of this kind.

""We have always recognized that our investment carried an inherently high level of risk. It was also an investment in a promising local economic development, job creation and sustainability project.""

Cummings concluded: ""We appreciate the work and expertise that Mitch and his team at IRG, as well as countless other community partners and investors, put into this economic development effort.""

Prischak said Thursday that Plastek and his family became involved for what they believed were all the right reasons.

""We are very sad and disappointed at the recent news and the fact that plastics recycling, the plastics industry, the environment, and the jobs IRG would have created in Erie have missed out on a great opportunity,"" he said.","https://www.goerie.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/10/09/NETN/75589557007-p-1-hecht-100824.jpg?crop=5138,2891,x0,y206&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-04-04 07:56:50.279854

The new platform is designed to fast-track the global adoption of SAF and help the industry meet its target of net-zero emissions by 2050.

Step forward for sustainable aviation

Described as a “critical platform” by IATA, the SAF Registry enables airlines and industry stakeholders to track, verify, and claim their SAF usage in a secure and transparent way.

It ensures that environmental benefits from SAF purchases are recorded immutably, eliminating the risk of double counting – an essential step in building trust and accountability in the carbon reduction process.

“Aviation’s decarbonisation is a team effort,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO, we have put in place a system that benefits all stakeholders, airlines, fuel producers, regulators, and corporate customers. It is a foundational tool for building a transparent, global SAF market.”

Shift from fossil fuel

Thomsen, however, emphasised that the registry is only one piece of the puzzle. She also called on governments to urgently shift financial support from fossil fuel industries toward renewable energy development, including SAF.

“Further progress requires active policy support for the ramping-up of all renewable energy production, and for SAF within that production. Governments must reallocate their direct support given to fossil fuel producers in favor of renewable energy production. The precedent of the wind and solar energy markets is the example to follow, and this without any further delay,” she said.

As SAF continues to emerge as a key solution for decarbonising air travel, the launch of the registry marks a major milestone, bringing structure, trust, and momentum to the global effort to make aviation more sustainable.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/04/04/nazariy-kovalchuk-uGGBsPokvH8-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 04:56:09.009121

CTM supports organisations and business travellers to understand this shift by displaying SAF scores at the time of booking in the Lightning online booking tool. This feature puts information in front of travel bookers and travellers so they can make more informed travel choices that support their organisation’s sustainability goals.

Businesses, governments and non-profit organisations are all seeking ways to minimise the environmental impact of their corporate travel. CTM’s sustainability tools have been at the forefront of smarter data, decisions and measurement across the whole lifecycle of a business trip.

CTM is excited to strengthen its partnership with RDC Aviation, a leading airline data analytics company, to deliver actionable SAF scores in Lightning for our customers.

“The SAF Rating provides CTM customers with additional context to help them make informed decisions about the sustainable travel options available to them, sitting alongside RDC’s detailed and accurate emissions data in CTM’s Lightning online booking tool. We’re proud to work with CTM to deliver meaningful insights for business travellers.” Gareth Kitching, Director of Operations, RDC Aviation.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF works in the same way as traditional jet fuel, which you’ll often hear it referred to as a “drop-in fuel”, that can be blended with jet fuel and used in commercial airlines with no significant changes to an aircraft or its engine. Today, SAF can be made in three ways, as a biofuel, a waste fuel, or synthetic “e-Fuel”.

Biofuel: Where crops can be grown and fermented to turn sugar or fat into ethanol.

Waste Fuel: Used cooking oils, greases and other oils can be refined into jet fuel.

E-Fuels: Where electricity is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, with the hydrogen then combined with carbon dioxide to make drop-in hydrocarbons like diesel and jet fuel.

The International Aviation Travel Authority (IATA) estimates that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions needed by aviation to reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The largest acceleration is expected in the 2030s as policy support becomes global.

SAF scores – What are they made of?

To provide the most comprehensive assessment of airline SAF adoption, the scores displayed in Lightning, provided by RDC Aviation include several different data points, including but not limited to:

Partnership/development: Agreements between an airline and one provider to test, develop and/or produce SAF.

SAF offtake agreement: Arrangement between the airline and producer to purchase SAF.

Stake in production: Partnership in the SAF production (airline as a partner in the company).

CO2 offset: Airline and/or passenger offset carbon emissions.

Sustainability program: SAF as a criteria of the airline sustainability program.

Efficiency of their fleet: Reflection of investment in modern, efficient equipment and aircraft.

A key factor to scoring is the commitment of airlines to sustainable aviation which includes goals for future use of SAF. The specific metrics and data captured by RDC Aviation as part of this assessment and scoring include data on 250 leading world airlines that show:

Current percentage: Volume of SAF used, which could be network-wide, or, if available, on a particular route shown in Lightning.

Commitment percentage: Volume of SAF committed to purchase. This could be network-wide or on a shown route.

Commitment date: The specific date the SAF commitment will be implemented.

How can CTM customers use SAF scores?

Lightning users will be able to see SAF scores for all 250+ leading airlines when viewing flight results, alongside other critical flight information used to determine an appropriate choice such as price, in-policy status, seat availability, granular carbon emissions, and other planned data such as on-time performance.

Users can sort results by SAF score, highlighting those airlines with AAA SAF scores first. CTM will also be making the SAF scores available to travel managers upon request who wish to incorporate the data into their preferred airline review and contracting process or airline RFPs.

The addition of SAF scores further strengthens Lightning’s sustainability features including carbon emissions for air, hotel and car; the ability to filter and preference car results for EV and hybrid vehicles and the ability to sort flights, hotels and cars by lowest emissions.",https://au.travelctm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-favicon-96x96-CTM-32x32.png,N,,2025-04-04 08:56:10.288388

Developed by IATA and now live under CADO’s management, the Registry is designed to support a global market for SAF by recording transactions in a standardized and transparent way. It enables airlines and their corporate customers to claim the environmental benefits of SAF against regulatory obligations and voluntary emissions targets, helping to accelerate aviation’s transition to net zero by 2050.

“Aviation’s decarbonization is a team effort,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist. “In releasing the SAF Registry to CADO for launch, we have put in place a critical platform for the benefit of all stakeholders.”

The Registry tracks environmental attributes throughout the SAF value chain to prevent double counting and ensures purchases are immutably recorded. It connects SAF producers and suppliers with airlines globally—regardless of location—helping overcome current supply limitations and enabling in-sector emissions reductions.

The system also allows airlines’ corporate customers to support decarbonization through co-financing arrangements, leveraging their ability to contribute to the cost of sustainable fuel uptake. Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will operate on a cost recovery basis.

IATA emphasizes that the Registry is technology- and feedstock-neutral, promoting a diversity of SAF production methods and supporting harmonization across regions. It is also designed to be interoperable with other registries, encouraging open markets and competition.

“The Registry cannot produce miracles on its own, but without it, no miracles can be produced,” said Thomsen. She added that further progress depends on stronger government support for renewable energy, including redirecting subsidies away from fossil fuels.

Developed in consultation with airlines, OEMs, governments, fuel suppliers, and corporate travel stakeholders, the SAF Registry already has over 30 early users onboarding. It is underpinned by IATA’s SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, providing a consistent framework for environmental claims regardless of geography.

One of the most promising solutions emerging in this context is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). According to projections, if we are to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, more than 60% of the reductions in aviation sector emissions will need to come from SAF. This statistic clearly underscores the critical importance of accelerating both the production and adoption of this innovative fuel.

Facilitating its adoption, perhaps the key advantage of SAF is its ""drop-in"" capability, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft without requiring any modifications. This positions SAF not merely as a potential future solution but as a viable option available to the industry today. Airlines can begin integrating SAF into their operations now, making strides toward sustainability without the need for costly overhauls of their current fleets.

The transition to SAF is further bolstered by a supportive regulatory environment and favorable market dynamics. Initiatives such as the European “Refuel EU” program and the “SAF Grand Challenge” in the United States, backed by the Inflation Reduction Act, have established a robust regulatory framework to encourage investment and innovation in SAF production. Countries like the United Kingdom, Japan, and Singapore are also taking proactive steps to develop strategies that will accelerate the growth of SAF, ensuring that the aviation sector can meet its environmental goals.

Moreover, there is a growing commitment from major airlines to incorporate SAF into their operations. Companies are responding to increasing pressure from customers, investors, and NGOs to decarbonize their activities. By signing long-term purchase agreements for SAF, these airlines are not only committing to a greener future but also facilitating the financing and industrialization of the necessary infrastructure for SAF production.

But development of SAF requires a broader effort than that of just the aviation industry. It requires collaboration among a range of stakeholders: fuel producers, airlines, regulators, and financiers, to note a few.

Then we flew the first transatlantic flight by a commercial plane on 100% SAF and we landed safely at JKF.

Speaking at Toronto Pearson International Airport as the carrier re-started flying to Canada for the first time since 2014, Branson said: “People said it was impossible to fly across the Atlantic with SAF. We needed to prove them wrong and took off from London [in November 2023] with a full belly of SAF and landed in New York.

“I have tried to break a number of records. I attempted to cross the Atlantic in a boat and it sank. I then tried in a hot air balloon and it ended up in the sea and we had to be rescued by helicopters. Then we flew the first transatlantic flight by a commercial plane on 100% SAF and we landed safely at JKF.

“We’ve proven it can be done but it’s not easy because getting the quantities of SAF that we need is tough – and we’re challenging the industry to get enough SAF so that all our planes can fly on it.”

He added: “Obviously, what’s happened in America is going to make it tougher. The world was moving towards a place where it was a priority to make this happen and now for one side at least, it’s not high on the agenda.”

Asked how President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping trade tariffs might affect the Virgin group of companies, Branson said: “All I can say is that between Canada and Britain there are no tariffs that I am aware of.

“I can’t see any tariffs existing between our two countries and I hope we can become even closer than we have been over the last 50 years and we will try to make sure that happens.”

Branson was also asked what made him confident Virgin Atlantic would not withdraw again from Canada, as it had in 2001 after 9/11, ending its Toronto service, and then pulling out of Vancouver after flying there between 2012-2014.

“Nothing is guaranteed in life. But we’re much stronger than we were 20 years ago,” he said.

“We managed to survive Covid without British government help and were the only airline to do that. We paid back debts and made a profit so I’m confident that 25 years from now, Virgin will still be going strong. We’ve also got new partners which we didn’t have before, [in Delta, Air France/KLM and Westjet].”

July 2024 became the busiest month in the airport’s 99-year history, reflecting a global trend.

In fact, ICAO projects that air transport demand will continue to rise by an average of 4.3% annually over the next two decades.

When the ReFuelEU mandate states that 70% of aviation fuel must be SAF by 2050, that is not 70% of the 2024 fuel total, but of the projected demand in 2050. We have some challenges ahead.

Some of the trends we are seeing emerge, will continue in 2025 and beyond. Emerging markets are showing significant interest in producing SAF, and are aiming to export to regulated zones while gradually implementing domestic mandates.

The EU is actively promoting innovation, securing funding and creating supportive regulatory frameworks to make eSAF a reality.

In the meantime, Glessing said farmers will have to try and minimize market loss while continuing to look for new opportunities.
He said they’re working hard to focus on the relationships with their trading partners, but it’s hard for people to plan for the future with so much uncertainty.
Petersen said another way around the tariffs is add value within our own country.","GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. — Uncertainty about the future is a feeling no one wants.

“People may feel effects of tariffs tomorrow, others may not feel them for six months to a year,” said Thom Petersen, the commissioner for the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.

Petersen said the last few years have been tough on farmers, and tariffs will add to the strain.

“Basically, it’s going to add to chaos,” Petersen said.

On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on nearly all imported goods.

Petersen is worried about the impact the tariffs could have on the state’s biggest trading partners and the impact of anticipated reciprocal tariffs.

“About a third of our crop is exported and my concern is what the reciprocal tariffs will look like from some our biggest trading partners, and if some of our trading partners that we’ve worked years to develop relationships that our farmers have worked years to develop those relationships that those markets will go and look somewhere else.”

The tariff announcement comes on the heels of a difficult year for farmers.

“Farmers are struggling. We know mediation notices sent to farmers are double this year from what they were in 2024, so we know farmers are having a hard time on balance sheets, so any kind of cut or slowdown is going to be difficult,” Petersen said.

“Commodity prices have been challenging the last three years probably 2-3 and those margins are very, very tight,” said President of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Dan Glessing. “It’s been some tough sledding the last couple of years.”

Glessing is also a dairy farmer. He’s hoping for swift action by the administration on unilateral trade deals. Unilateral because he doesn’t think this administration will be interested in bilateral trade.

“It’s concerning to our members, to farmers, obviously, we are very good at producing food and fiber in this country and if that doesn’t get to where it needs to go, and if farmers can’t stay in business, that’s a challenge,” Glessing said.

He said some countries will need to continue importing American products and will continue to do so. However, they might not import as many products if there’s an additional cost to import them.

“Realistically, we don’t know how long they’re going to be on that’s probably the most unsettling part of it The duration of them is kind of the key to how much an effect it has on our bottom line,” he said.

In the meantime, Glessing said farmers will have to try and minimize market loss while continuing to look for new opportunities.

Petersen said they’ll have to explore other markets of trade farmers can tap into and add value where they can like biofuel and sustainable aviation fuel.

He said they’re working hard to focus on the relationships with their trading partners, but it’s hard for people to plan for the future with so much uncertainty.

“You know we’re really concerned for some of our farmers that they really can’t get through another bad crop year, a bad price or production year, so the tariffs you know too are being levied against some of our biggest trading partners,” Petersen said. “A lot of concern about uncertainties and we’ll just have to see how this plays out

He said he thinks tariffs are an outdated idea because we have become a global market.

Petersen said another way around the tariffs is add value within our own country.

“It takes time though to build new factories. It takes time to hire new people, you know, so I just don’t see that we’re going to see an immediate return on some of these tariffs. I think it’s going to take time to sort some of that out,” Petersen said.",https://media.kare11.com/assets/KARE/images/089a5537-cc16-4098-8daf-a67e93c42971/20250403T232851/089a5537-cc16-4098-8daf-a67e93c42971_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-04-04 00:56:07.938893

Brazil SAF industry set to take off in 2027

Sao Paulo, 2 April (Argus) — Brazil's aviation industry is keeping an eye on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) regulations as the domestic market awaits the kickoff of local production to comply with the planned blend mandate and with potential for exports. The fuels of the future law envisages raising biofuel mix standards to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in domestic flights over a 10-year period starting in 2027, as Brazil has committed to applying a 10pc SAF mandate by 2037. The country's efforts to implement a SAF mandate runs in tandem with the guidelines from UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) program, which oversees GHG reduction in international flights. The program set up two phases until reduction targets are fully implemented, so airlines and producers adapt to changes efficiently. Airlines can voluntarily adhere between 2024-2026, followed by global compulsory targets from 2027-2035, prompting SAF usage or carbon credits compensation. The mandatory phase embraces all international flights, including those from and to non-voluntary countries, except for so-called underdeveloped countries and those with a low share of global air traffic flows. Brazil's SAF is a newborn industry that holds potential for feedstock supply , mostly for its traditional production pathways using soybean oil, corn and sugarcane ethanol, as well as widespread agricultural lands engaged in biomass production without practicing land-use change. Its variability also allows new projects to reuse degraded lands and existing agricultural assets to comply with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sustainability criteria related to land-use and soil health enhancement. SAF input in Brazil faces economic hurdles as high market volatility weighs on long-term investments, says A&M Infra's management consultant Filipe Bonaldo. But he also says that the political agenda will not hinder the energy transition as has happened in the US under President Donald Trump, since Brazil's economy is heavily based on agriculture its regulatory processes spur optimism. As an agricultural powerhouse, Brazil offers low-cost production and multiple sources to provide demand, both internally and offshore. Brazil is the third largest global exporter in agriculture and livestock markets, leading soy, orange juice and beef markets globally, according to agriculture and livestock confederation CAN. Debut in Rio Brazilian fuel distributor Vibra is the first to offer SAF in Brazil, before the blend mandate comes into effect. The company imported 550,000l (16,000bl) of SAF produced with used-cooking oil (UCO) from the port of Antwerp, in the Netherlands, in January. The biofuel is available for customers at Vibra's facility at the Rio de Janeiro international airport after a 10-month logistics plan was concluded. International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) has secured all processes of the plan, from the supply chain of the product to distribution. Vibra operates in more than 90 airports in Brazil and accounts for 60pc of national aviation market share through its sector subsidiary BR Aviation, said executive vice-president of operations Marcelo Bragança. Why it took so long? The sector has long had doubts over the technical feasibility of admitting the use of biofuels in aviation , especially from a security point of view, said Anac's head of the environment and energy transition Marcela Anselmi. The agency, along with oil and biofuels regulator ANP, follow international regulations for SAF as it requires a physical and chemical resemblance to current fossil aviation fuels to ensure flight operations security. It is still not possible to use 100pc of SAF in aircraft motors, said Anselmi. There is a 50pc mix limit that inhibits worldwide adherence as there are technical restrictions yet to overcome. Recent engagement in the energy transition agenda is promoting biomass supply for aviation, as well as road and marine modalities, requiring new production pathways. For example, ATJ uses ethanol to convert it into SAF, which can be expensive to install and implies high capital expenditure. In a global context, Brazil stands in the vanguard of the SAF agenda as Europe and the US have only deployed legislation related to output and consumption over the past two years, Anselmi pointed out. Meanwhile, South America's planned SAF production capacity may reach 1.1mn l/yr in 2030, according to EPE.

US oil, farm groups push EPA for steep biofuel mandate

New York, 1 April (Argus) — The American Petroleum Institute and biofuel-supporting groups told Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials at a meeting today that the agency should sharply raise advanced biofuel blend mandates for 2026. The coalition told EPA that it supported a biomass-based diesel mandate next year of 5.25bn USG, up from 3.35bn USG this year, and a broader advanced biofuel mandate, including the cellulosic category, at 10bn Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits, up from 7.33bn RINs this year, according to three different groups that attended the meeting. Both mandates would be record highs for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Soybean oil futures and RIN credit prices have risen sharply over the past week on optimism that oil and biofuel interests were working to coordinate volume mandate requests for consideration by President Donald Trump's administration. The coalition is also pushing the agency to set a total conventional volume requirement at 25bn RINs, which would keep an implied mandate for corn ethanol flat at 15bn USG. Ethanol groups had previously eyed a mandate even higher, but limits on the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline make much more-stringent requirements a tough sell to oil refiners. The coalition provided no specific request for the cellulosic biofuel subcategory, where most credit generation comes from biogas. Credits in that category are more expensive, but price concerns have been less potent recently given an EPA proposal to lower previously set cellulosic obligations, signaling that future volume requirements can be cut, too. EPA is aiming to finalize new RFS volume mandates by the end of the year if not earlier, people familiar with the administration's thinking have said. EPA officials signaled at the meeting they were working urgently on the rulemaking. ""The agency is intent on getting the RFS program back on the statutory timeline for issuing renewable volume obligation rules,"" EPA said, declining to comment further on its plans for the rule. The RFS program requires oil refiners and importers to blend biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy credits from those who do. Under the program's unique nesting structure, credits from blending lower-carbon biofuels can be used to meet obligations for other program categories. One gallon of corn ethanol generates 1 RIN, but more energy-dense fuels earn more RIN credits per gallon. Some disagreements persist While groups at the meeting were aligned around high-level mandates, how administration officials and courts treat small refinery requests for exemptions from RFS requirements could undercut those targets. Groups present were broadly aligned on asking EPA not to grant widespread exemptions, though there is still disagreement in the industry about how best to account for exempted volumes when deciding requirements for other refiners. Groups present at the meeting today included the American Petroleum Institute and representatives of biofuel producers and crop feedstock suppliers. Some groups that previously engaged with the coalition's efforts to project unity to the Trump administration were not present. And some groups more historically skeptical of the RFS and more supportive of small refinery exemptions — including the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers — have not been closely involved. Fuel marketer groups notably did not attend the meeting after a representative sparred with others in the coalition at an American Petroleum Institute meeting last month. Some retail groups, including the National Association of Convenience Stores and the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, instead sent a letter to EPA today arguing that the groups pushing steep volumes are discounting potential headwinds to the sector from new tax credit policy. Some of the groups advocating for higher biofuel volumes have pointed to high production capacity and feedstock availability, but have preferred to ignore thornier issues like tax credits, lobbyists say. ""An overly aggressive increase in advanced biofuel blending mandates under the RFS will be punitive for American consumers"" without extending a long-running $1/USG tax credit for biomass-based diesel blenders, the retailers' letter said. That incentive expired last year and was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act's ""45Z"" credit, which offers subsidies to producers instead of blenders and throttles benefits based on carbon intensity. Generally lower credit values for biomass-based diesel — coupled with the US government's delays setting final regulations on qualifying for the credit — have spurred a sharp drop in biofuel production to start the year. Without a blenders credit, the RFS volume mandates pushed by some groups could increase retail diesel prices by 30¢/USG, the fuel marketers estimate, a potential political headache for a president that ran on curbing consumer costs. Other biofuel groups say that extending the credit would be an uphill battle this year, with some lawmakers and lobbyists instead focused on legislatively tweaking the 45Z incentive's rules to benefit crop feedstocks instead of reverting wholesale to the prior tax policy.

EU publishes CO2 car standard tweak proposal

Brussels, 1 April (Argus) — The European Commission has published the long-awaited proposal to give automobile manufacturers more flexibility in complying with the bloc's CO2 reduction targets for cars and passenger vehicles in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Those three years would be assessed jointly, rather than annually, averaging out fleet emission performance. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the additional compliance flexibility shows that the commission has ""listened"" but the EU is still maintaining its zero-emission targets [for new vehicles from 2035]. ""Predictability in the sector is crucial for long-term investments,"" said Hoekstra. The commission urged the European Parliament and EU member states to reach agreement on the targeted amendment ""without delay"". German centre-right member Jens Gieseke said there is a ""broad majority"" in parliament to fast-track approval for May. He noted that the car industry faces over €15bn ($16bn) in penalties for non-compliance with the CO2 standards. A member of parliament's largest EPP group, Gieseke also called for the commission to go further towards technological neutrality. ""We need different kinds of fuels, e-fuels, biofuels, every fuel which could help to reduce CO2 should be recognized,"" he added. This second step, withdrawing the phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICE) from 2035 onwards, Gieseke noted, should come in the last quarter of 2025. German Green MEP Michael Bloss disputed the figure of €15bn in potential fines put forward by automotive industry association ACEA. ""Even in the worst-case scenario, the total fines for all car manufacturers would not exceed €1bn,"" said Bloss. ""Car manufacturers have had enough time to adjust their production planning. Many have done so,"" Bloss said, pointing to Automaker Volvo. Under the current 2019 regulation, fines should be imposed on manufacturers for each year in 2025–2029 when they do not reach their specific fleet-wide target CO2 reductions, compared to 2021 values. But manufacturers have the option to form compliance pools with other firms. ""European car manufacturers are already talking to Tesla or Chinese manufacturers about so-called pooling, which must be stopped quickly,"" said EPP climate and environment spokesman Peter Liese. ""We want to maintain climate targets, but not make Elon Musk richer through European legislation,"" said Liese.

ISCC aware EU mulling certification recognition: Update

Adds comment from the European Commission London, 28 March (Argus) — The ISCC, an international certification system for sustainability, said today that it is aware of discussions in an EU committee about future recognition of its certification for waste-based biofuels. It said there is no legal basis for any planned measures. Industry participants said yesterday that the EU Committee on Sustainability of Biofuels, Bioliquids, and Biomass Fuels is drafting implementing regulations that would include a two-and-a-half year pause to obligatory acceptance of ISCC EU certification for waste-based biofuels. ""This action is said to be subject to further legal scrutiny and will need approval by member states,"" the ISCC said. Currently, member states accept EU-recognised voluntary scheme certification as proof that fuel or feedstocks are compliant with the bloc's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sustainability criteria. Market participants told Argus that discussions have centred around giving individual countries more choice. ""Other voluntary schemes would not be able to fill the gap. The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels and would seriously jeopardise the ability of the obligated parties to comply with blending mandates,"" the ISCC said. The ISCC has been singled out in a discriminatory way and has supported European Commission and member states' investigations into alleged fraud, it said. ""We are more than surprised by this step […and] are unable to see the rationale of the planned measure, which seems ad hoc and baseless,"" it added. Secretary-general of the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) Xavier Noyon told Argus that, if confirmed, the suspension would affect thousands of operators. ""At this time, member states are refusing to comment, and we call on the commission to urgently clarify any decisions of this nature that are on the table,"" he said. The EBB published its own proposed revision to the RED implementing legislation last month, which expanded the supervisory power of member states over voluntary schemes and certification bodies. The European Commission confirmed that the committee met on 26 March to discuss sustainable certification, promotion of biofuels, avoidance of double counting, and alleged fraud. ""We are still working on our examination of this alleged fraud in biodiesel imports from China,"" said commission energy spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen. But the commission has not taken any decision yet and cannot allude to ""possible"" scenarios, she said.

Most assessments of mitigation potential of biochar have focussed on technical or sustainable potential, and several consider economic potential.
In this review, we considered 19 peer-reviewed articles on global biochar mitigation potential published between 2010 and 2022 (Supplementary Table 1).
According to the definition in 'Definition of mitigation potential’, this aligns with sustainable potential (i.e., a sustainable subset of the technical maximum).
This demand-driven approach differs from most biochar potential studies that applied a supply-driven approach based on feedstock availability.","Strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are critically important but will not be sufficient to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. The IPCC1,2 has shown that it will also be necessary to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Biochar is one of the few technologically mature strategies available to deliver CO2 removal (CDR). Biochar systems, that involve production of biochar for use as a soil amendment, combine a biological removal process with a durable storage mechanism3. Biochar systems can provide benefits for climate change adaptation, land degradation management, food security4 and human health (e.g. Mohammadi et al.5).

Biochars are charcoal-like heterogeneous porous materials produced by heating organic matter such as forestry residues or straw in an oxygen-limited environment, generally used as soil amendments6. Biochars vary widely in their properties, dependent on feedstock and production conditions. The production process is exothermic: a small amount of external heat is required to initiate pyrolysis, whereafter combustible gas is released, which is commonly used to fuel the process. Excess pyrolysis gas (also known as syngas) can be used as a renewable energy source for heat or electricity generation, replacing fossil fuels. Thus, renewable energy is a co-product of biochar production. Biochar production systems are sometimes also termed pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS). In this review, biochar is assumed to be produced with other co-products of biomass pyrolysis, that is, bio-oil and syngas.

The primary contribution of biochar systems to climate change mitigation is CDR achieved through the persistence of biochar: biochar carbon persists in soil over centuries7,8,9 which greatly delays the oxidation of biochar compared with its biomass feedstock. Biochar can contribute additionally to climate change mitigation by building soil C through reduced mineralisation of soil organic matter10, reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions from soil11, and through fossil fuel displacement12. Besides mitigation contributions, biochar could play an integral role in system-level strategies for sustainable development and the circular bioeconomy13,14,15.

While there has been intense activity to elucidate the mechanisms of biochar impacts on soil properties and plant response16, there are relatively few studies on the climate change mitigation value of biochar systems. Life cycle assessments (LCA) of biochar systems show wide variation between feedstocks, pyrolysis conditions, and biochar applications, though most biochar systems show substantial net climate benefits. In their Special report on Climate Change and the Land17, the IPCC reported mitigation potential for biochar in the range 0.4–1.2 t CO2 equivalent t−1 dry feedstock.

There are few studies on global mitigation potential of biochar. One of the most comprehensive studies of biochar mitigation potential, by Woolf et al.12, estimated global sustainable mitigation potential to be ~3.7–6.6 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1. Synthesising available literature, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report18 estimated theoretical potential of 0.2–6.6 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1. There have been no critical reviews focussed solely on mitigation potential of biochar systems.

This paper reviews the literature on potential mitigation through biochar, examining the scope and assumptions applied, to pinpoint the basis for the wide variation between studies. We start by reviewing the various processes that provide GHG mitigation in biochar systems. We distinguish the contributions of different GHG mitigation processes to the net mitigation potential, separating CDR and GHG emissions reductions (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We examine the relationship between studies of mitigation potential and distinguish novel analyses from those based on earlier studies. Here we show that most studies since 2010 are not new analyses, but instead many are based on the study by Woolf et al.12, sometimes misquoted or selectively extracted. Differences between studies sometimes arise from confusion between CO2 vs. C due to the unusual choice of units in the study by Woolf et al.12, but, more importantly, are largely due to differences in scope of the study (CDR and emissions reduction processes included) and assumed biomass availability.

Persistent biochar carbon

The conversion of biomass to biochar, via pyrolysis, greatly delays the oxidation of biomass. Biochar has a mean residence time (MRT) in soil of hundreds to thousands of years9,19. The key factors controlling the persistence of biochar-C are feedstock type, the highest pyrolysis temperature, and duration of pyrolysis, which determine the degree of aromatisation. Long-term persistence of biochar is predicted from multi-year incubation studies using isotopic difference to quantify loss of biochar carbon. Biochar carbon is commonly assumed to comprise two pools: (1) the labile pool, the small fraction of biochar C that is susceptible to rapid mineralisation, comprising aliphatic-C, phenolic-C, and carbohydrate C, and (2) the persistent pool, the aromatised C that mineralises very slowly20,21. Estimating MRT commonly involves applying a double first-order exponential decay model. Azzi et al. 19 demonstrated the sensitivity of BC100 (fraction of biochar carbon remaining after 100 years) to the curve-fitting approach. The H/C ratio is an effective predictor of biochar persistence19; for biochars with H/C < 0.7 (considered a threshold for classification as biochar) the BC100 is 60–90%. Sanei et al.22 identified that biochars produced at temperatures > 550 °C are dominated by inertinite, with estimated half-life of 100 million years, and that random reflectance (Ro) is an effective method to characterise biochar carbon pools of differing stability. The CDR due to biomass conversion to biochar is determined by the biochar yield per unit of feedstock and the relative mineralisation rate of the biochar carbon in comparison with the unpyrolysed feedstock. Conversion rates from biomass-C to biochar-C are generally 20–50%, with lower recoveries, but greater persistence, at higher pyrolysis temperatures23,24.

Impact on soil carbon dynamics

Biochar amendment can decrease mineralisation of native soil organic matter (SOM)9 and newly added organic matter10,25,26, increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. The capacity of biochar to increase total soil organic C beyond the addition of persistent biochar-C is both a function of the properties of the biochar and those of the soil.

Change in the mineralisation rate of SOM induced by organic amendments is known as priming27. Meta-analyses of biochar-induced priming based on incubation studies in the absence of plants indicate an initial phase of positive priming (20 days28; 2 years29) followed by negative priming, with an average decrease in the mineralisation rate of SOM of 3.8% (−8.1 to 0.8% for different soils and biochars) compared with the unamended control9. Studies of soil-plant-biochar interactions have similarly reported increased mineralisation of native SOM over 66 days30 but reduction in mineralisation of 19–29% over longer periods31,32. A decadal study in an acidic Ferralsol showed that wood biochar can increase soil C through soil aggregation processes that slow the mineralisation of new C (e.g. root exudates, root detritus, microbial necromass) resulting in ongoing soil C accumulation over 10 years after one biochar application10,26. Long-term negative priming has also been recorded from wood biochar applied to a neutral pH Mollisol33. Essentially, application of biochar protects SOM from microbial breakdown. This phenomenon is likely applicable to soils with high clay content. However, in sandy soils, biochar is found to enhance priming, and aggregate formation is limited by absence of clays.

Besides its direct effect on SOC stocks, biochar-induced increase in SOM can enhance plant growth through its effect on soil water holding capacity and aggregation, and soil fertility and cycling of nutrients, further increasing SOC input to the soil.

Additional mitigation through enhanced plant growth

Biochar facilitates biotic and abiotic soil-plant-microbe reactions, particularly in the root zone, that can enhance nutrient and water supply to plants, thereby enhancing plant growth16. Meta-analyses have found that, on average, biochar increases crop yield by 10–42%16. The greatest responses are observed in acidic tropical soils and sandy soils in the drylands, while small or nil yield responses are often observed in temperate climates and high fertility soils16,34,35. Biochar-induced productivity enhancement stores additional C in vegetation, offering additional CDR, and extra biomass could be used to make more biochar.

Emissions reduction—non-CO2 GHG from soil and composting

Meta-analyses have found that biochar application can effectively mitigate N2O and CH4 emissions from soil in the short to medium term, though the effects vary widely36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43.

Meta-analyses of the impact of biochar on soil N2O emissions showed an average reduction of 12% in the field compared with the unamended control43 and reduction of 38% combining both field and laboratory conditions36. The interacting biotic and abiotic processes involved in decreasing N2O emissions include direct sorption and reaction of greenhouse gases on biochar surfaces, and changes in soil properties such as porosity, pH, availability of substrates, and microbial community composition and activity11,16. Separate meta-analyses of C sequestration44 and N2O emissions36,42 suggest a strong synergy between CDR and emissions reduction in biochar systems, in contrast with alternative organic amendments that tend to increase soil N2O emissions45. With respect to CH4, application of biochar can reduce emissions from waterlogged soils (especially acid soils), but biochar commonly decreases the CH4 sink of upland soils40,46.

Studies of soil emissions typically do not compare emissions after addition of biochar with the emissions that would arise from application of the equivalent amount of unpyrolysed biomass (commonly about three times more material). This comparison, which is applicable when considering alternative uses of a finite biomass source, would likely reveal a greater mitigation impact of biochar systems on soil emissions in many circumstances.

Recent syntheses have improved understanding of processes underlying biochar-induced decrease in GHG emissions from soil, and enhanced the capability to predict the potential impact based on biochar properties, soil types and environmental factors11,16. However, there are still uncertainties regarding the longevity of influence on soil emissions and indirect effects through impacts on leaching and volatilisation of nitrogen (N)47.

Addition of biochar to composting organic matter can reduce the emissions of N2O and CH448,49, through sorption of N on biochar surfaces, increasing N retention, and oxidation of CH4 by methanotrophs. Biochar can also indirectly lower N2O emissions through lower N leaching and volatilisation.

Emissions avoided

Avoided emissions are emissions that occur outside the biochar supply chain, that are indirectly reduced or prevented through the adoption of biochar systems, including through the use of pyrolysis gases as renewable energy, modified management of organic residues and wastes, and reduced fertiliser manufacture.

Pyrolysis gases released during the production of biochar are combusted to produce heat to drive the pyrolytic process, and excess gas can be used as a renewable energy source to displace fossil fuels used for electricity and/or heat. The amount of excess syngas produced is greater for feedstock materials with lower moisture content, which therefore require less energy to reach pyrolysis temperatures, and greater at higher pyrolysis temperatures, which produce a higher yield of gas relative to biochar. In a life cycle assessment of climate change mitigation potential of biochar production in China, the fossil fuel displacement through bio-electricity production was calculated at 0.2–6.7 t CO2-equivalent t−1 biochar applied for biochar produced from crop residues, 0.2–8.2 t CO2 equivalent t−1 for forest residues, 0.3–2.1 t CO2-equivalent t−1 for livestock manure, 0.1–1.7 t CO2 equivalent t−1 for sewage sludge, and 0.4–2.8 t CO2 equivalent t−1 for food waste50, where the lower and higher values relate to pyrolysis temperatures of <300 °C and >500 °C, respectively. Although additional fuel is required for biomass transportation, feedstock processing, and biochar production, the associated GHG emissions (0.1–1.5 t CO2 equivalent t−1) are small compared with the fossil fuel displacement50. The mitigation value of bioenergy co-produced with biochar depends on the GHG intensity of displaced energy products, and the efficiency of gas capture and electricity generation51. Greatest mitigation is achieved where syngas is used for heat rather than electricity, and where GHG-intensive electricity sources such as brown coal are displaced. While it is acknowledged that economic cost from pyrolysis energy is higher than some other renewable energy sources such as solar, pyrolysis energy could play an important role as a dispatchable energy source, firming the grid as intermittent energy sources expand.

Pyrolysing organic wastes such as poultry litter avoids N2O and CH4 emissions that arise during handling, storage and land application of the unpyrolysed waste11. Biochar is an effective and efficient way to recycle nutrients in biosolids and other organic residues that are otherwise lost and cause pollution if landfilled, combusted or discharged to waterways. Biochar and biochar-fertilizer combinations can reduce leaching and volatilisation losses of soil N, thus increasing N use efficiency52,53, reducing the amount of chemical fertiliser required, and therefore avoiding the manufacturing emissions of GHG-intensive N fertilisers.

Definition of mitigation potential

Estimates of mitigation potential of a strategy can be categorised into four types: (1) technical potential, (2) economic potential, (3) sustainable potential, and (4) feasible potential54. Technical potential is the theoretical maximum mitigation that a strategy could deliver, determined by biogeophysical limits, with known technology. Economic potential is the technical potential that can be realised economically under assumed costs, benefits, and costs of alternative options. Sustainable potential is the portion of the technical potential that allows for other societal objectives such as biodiversity conservation, maintenance of the natural resource base, and food security. Feasible potential considers geophysical, ecological, technological, economic, social and institutional barriers to adoption, to determine the likely rate of implementation at a specified time. The magnitude of estimates of potential generally decreases, while uncertainty and subjectivity increase, moving from technical through economic and sustainable to feasible potential. Most assessments of mitigation potential of biochar have focussed on technical or sustainable potential, and several consider economic potential.

Scope of analysis regarding GHG fluxes

As discussed in ‘Climate change mitigation contributions of biochar systems’, factors that contribute to mitigation through biochar systems are: CDR, reduced non-CO2 GHG emissions, and avoided emissions, particularly from fossil fuel displacement. CDR includes the carbon stabilised through pyrolysis, often expressed as carbon remaining after 100 years (BC100) (see 'Persistent biochar carbon') and can also include negative priming (see 'Impact on soil carbon dynamics') and enhanced plant growth (see 'Additional mitigation through enhanced plant growth'). All studies include carbon sequestered in biochar, but the latter two sources of CDR are omitted in most assessments of mitigation potential.

Adoption of biochar systems can reduce N2O and CH4 emitted from soil (see 'Emissions reduction—non-CO2 GHG from soil and composting'), and avoid GHG emissions from feedstock handling (collection, transport and storage), landfill, and production of electricity and heat (see 'Emissions avoided'). Some studies of global mitigation potential include many of these components (e.g. Woolf et al.12), though none that we reviewed contains all. Other mitigation components that could be considered include reduced manufacturing emissions from fertiliser production due to lower fertiliser requirements, and reduced fuel use in cultivation (due to reduced soil strength) or irrigation pumping (due to enhanced water holding capacity). However, while these are included in some LCA studies of specific biochar systems, we are not aware of any global studies of mitigation potential that include them.

Assumptions for key variables

Assumptions for several key variables influence the potential derived in each assessment: (1) available biomass (2) products of pyrolysis; and (3) persistence of biochar carbon.

Availability of biomass

To estimate the global mitigation potential of biochar systems, one must quantify the available biomass. Biomass residues and wastes that are already aggregated at processing facilities e.g. poultry litter, feedlot manure, urban greenwaste, nut shells, cotton gin trash, sawmill and paper mill residues are desirable biochar feedstocks. The current fate of the residues must be considered, to determine the amount available for biochar, and the net effect on GHG emissions. Food residues, urban greenwaste and biosolids are often landfilled or incinerated, so diversion for biochar has no risk of 'leakage', that is, inducing increased emissions elsewhere as a result of adopting biochar systems. Conversely, although crop residues make highly-effective biochar16, they are commonly retained on site to preserve soil moisture, control weeds and reduce erosion risk, and sometimes used for fuel, animal bedding or animal feed, so diversion for biochar could lead to leakage, through provision of alternative sources for these functions. Nevertheless, in high-yielding crops (e.g. irrigated cereals, sugarcane) residues are often burned to facilitate crop establishment or manage disease and pests. Pyrolysing these residues in place of in-field burning also offers benefits for the environment by avoiding GHG emissions especially CH455, and for human health by avoiding particulate emissions5. Manure is often spread in fields as organic fertiliser, so diverting for biochar could increase demand for synthetic fertiliser, however, it would reduce emissions of N2O from manure handling, and provide environmental and health benefits through reduced eutrophication and risk of transfer of pathogens.

Studies of technical potential consider the total quantities of biomass theoretically available for biochar production, while studies of economic or sustainable potential consider constraints such as competition from alternative uses, sustainability and food security implications and costs. Studies commonly use bottom-up assessments of feedstock available, for example, based on statistics for crop yields or area harvested, to estimate available crop and forest residues (e.g. Woolf et al.12; Roe et al.56). However, it should be noted that a number of uncertainties are associated with such global assessments, arising from the choice of crops, definitions of crop residues, assumptions for ratios of residues to crop yields (harvest index), consideration of technical, environmental and economic limitations, and annual variability in yields57,58. In a review of published global estimates for residue availability for bioenergy use, Hanssen et al.59 found a range of 12–76 exajoule (EJ) yr−1 in 2050 for eight bottom-up studies and attributed this variation to different methodologies, definitions and criteria for assessing availability.

Besides biomass residues, another feedstock considered in many studies is purpose-grown biomass crops, so a key assumption is the quantity of land available for dedicated biomass production. Risks to biodiversity, food security and vulnerable communities need to be considered. The use of marginal land and abandoned land for purpose-grown biomass minimises these risks, and substantial potential has been identified (e.g. Field et al.60). Furthermore, production of biomass for biochar that is then applied to the same land could restore degraded land, enhancing productivity. However, the definition and extent of marginal land are debated, and depend on the intended land use12,61, thus estimates of marginal land area are highly uncertain and purpose-specific60,61. Uncertainties regarding marginal land estimates arise from temporal and spatial variation in productivity and land use, related to seasonal conditions and transhumance patterns, for example. In a recent assessment of potential of land-based climate change mitigation strategies on abandoned cropland, Gvein et al.62 estimated 67–115 Mha of abandoned cropland available for biomass crops, excluding priority biodiversity conservation areas, in 2050. The authors noted high uncertainty of projections with respect to location of abandoned cropland, associated with inter-model differences and different socio-economic pathways, but commented that results at global scale were largely consistent and insensitive to the individual scenario.

The biomass availability assumed by Woolf et al.12 was based on the estimate derived by Field et al.60 who combined remotely sensed land use change products to identify the abandoned crop and pasture land area, which they coupled with spatial estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) from Randerson et al.63 From this, Woolf et al.12 estimated that up to 1250 Mt dry matter of purpose-grown biomass could be produced sustainably by 2100, while safeguarding biodiversity and food security. Besides high uncertainty regarding the land area, using the potential NPP to estimate lignocellulosic energy crop productivity provides a crude approximation, as realised NPP is dependent on the plant species.

Smith64 back-calculated from the CDR potential estimate of Woolf et al.12, to estimate the land requirement for biomass crops of 40–260 Mha for 2050. In contrast, Werner et al.65 used a process-based vegetation model to derive spatially explicit estimates of available biomass, and determined ‘land- and calorie-neutral’ production potential of purpose-grown biomass in 2100 for a scenario that constrained cropland to current area and maintained calorie production to ensure for food security through biochar-mediated yield increase. Assuming a yield increase of 15% from 2t biochar ha-1 biochar applied to tropical and subtropical croplands, they determined that 13.7 Mha of cropland was freed for biomass production.

Competition for biomass is likely to be a considerable constraint to biochar production. Competing uses of manures and food waste include compost, fertiliser and biogas, while bio-electricity, liquid biofuels and heat currently compete for crop and forestry residues and purpose-grown biomass. Competition for sustainable aviation fuel is likely to be strong in the future, as the growing airline industry has limited options to reduce emissions66. Several of the studies considered in this review explicitly addressed competition for residues by assuming that some fraction of the residues produced will continue to be used for feed, energy and/or soil protection (e.g. Woolf et al.12; Powell and Lenton67; Griscom et al.68). Integrated assessment models (IAMs) often assume that most available biomass is used for bioenergy: IAMs suggest strong demand for biomass for heat, bio-electricity and liquid biofuels for transport, and also for biochemicals, with proportions of each varying between socio-economic pathways, and large allocation to electricity with CCS under ambitious mitigation targets69. If the biomass assumed to be used for bioenergy in these models is instead used for biochar, energy will need to be produced from other sources, which should be factored into calculations of the net climate impact of alternative uses of biomass.

As discussed in ‘Persistent biochar carbon’, the carbon contained in biochar is highly persistent in soil, and persistence varies with feedstock and pyrolysis conditions. Pyrolysis conditions also determine the biochar yield, with lower yield—but higher persistence—at higher temperatures. Biochars comprise a mixture of organic compounds with different durabilities. Biochar carbon persistence is usually characterised in terms of MRT for the recalcitrant fraction, or BC100, the fraction remaining after 100 years19. Most studies apply the same assumptions for persistence across all feedstocks and include only the carbon assumed to be retained beyond 100 years. For example, Roe et al.56 assumed 50% conversion of biomass carbon to biochar; 97% recalcitrant fraction with half-life of 556 years, with 80% retained beyond 100 years. Similarly, Werner et al.70 assumed 55% conversion, and MRT of >750 years, with 90% of biochar carbon retained. In contrast, Woolf et al.12 used a dynamic approach, modelling biochar carbon kinetics using a 2-stage exponential decay function assuming a half-life for the recalcitrant fraction of 300 years, and demonstrated the strong sensitivity to this assumption.

In this review, we considered 19 peer-reviewed articles on global biochar mitigation potential published between 2010 and 2022 (Supplementary Table 1). We illustrate the range of estimates for each of the major contributors to mitigation, i.e., CDR, emissions reduction, and emissions avoidance (Fig. 1). Some studies focus on a limited range of mitigation contributions, such as CDR only (e.g. Smith64). Some limit scope by focussing on one technology (e.g. Pratt and Moran71) or one feedstock (e.g. Roberts et al.72) or one farming system (e.g. Lenton73).

The highest estimate was 11 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1, for technical potential including CDR, bioenergy and avoided N2O67, while the lowest estimate was 0.03 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 for economic potential74. Estimates of biochar’s global technical mitigation potential based only on CDR range from 0.3 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 68,75 to 4.9 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 67. As shown in Fig. 2, 13 out of 15 papers published since 2011 are not new analyses and of these, seven papers are based on Woolf et al.12 Since 2011, there are two essentially independent analyses of technical potential that have not relied on biomass data, biochar yields, or biochar persistence from Woolf et al.68,70.

The most comprehensive and widely cited study of biochar mitigation potential was conducted by Woolf et al. 12, who estimated ‘maximum sustainable technical potential’ of biochar systems, allowing for competition for non-waste biomass and applying safeguards to protect biodiversity and ensure food security. According to the definition in 'Definition of mitigation potential’, this aligns with sustainable potential (i.e., a sustainable subset of the technical maximum). Their estimate includes mitigation through carbon sequestered in biochar, avoided emissions of CH4 and N2O, and displaced fossil fuel emissions. Woolf et al.12 estimated global mitigation potential at 3.7–6.6 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 between 2010 and 2100, with peak rates reached after 60 to 100 years of adoption. Half of the mitigation is due to the carbon sequestered in biochar, 30 % to displacement of fossil-fuel energy and 20 % to avoided emissions of CH4 and N2O. Their higher estimate assumes biomass crops could be grown on 380 Mha of abandoned and degraded cropland and pasture that has not subsequently been converted to urban land or forest. The lower estimate includes biochar produced from available wastes and residues, together with 10% of the technical potential for agroforestry and 50% of the technical potential for biomass crops. Biochar-enhanced productivity on cropland was estimated to contribute 33–59 Pg CO2 equivalent to the cumulative avoided emissions over 100 years, assuming these additional crop residues were converted to biochar. The findings of Woolf et al.12 have been misquoted due to the confusing units used, viz. ‘Pg CO2 −C equivalent’, which has been misinterpreted as Pg CO2 equivalent, leading some papers to report Woolf’s estimate of maximum mitigation potential as 1.8 Pg CO2 equivalent (e.g., Paustian et al.76; Werner et al.70; Dumortier et al.77).

The study by Woolf et al.12 has been widely recognised and utilised in subsequent studies. Reflecting its impact, seven of the 19 global studies we reviewed derived their estimates from Woolf et al.12 Smith64 selected components of the mitigation assessed by Woolf et al.12., excluding displaced fossil fuel emissions. The mitigation potentials estimated by Dickie et al.78, through biochar application to croplands were based on assumptions and methods of Woolf et al.12, but restricted feedstocks to residues only for 2030. Lehmann et al.79 revised the estimate of Woolf et al.12, using the same model over a timeframe of 100 years but with updated equations for biochar persistence, emissions reduction and negative priming. Other studies have modified the values of Woolf et al.12 For instance, Lal et al.80 stated that their estimate is based on the gross rate of C sequestration of 1.28 Pg C y−1 from Woolf et al.12 with ‘corrections for the energy used in pyrolysis … and in restoration of degraded lands’, but the justification and derivation of these adjustments was not provided.

Other studies provide estimates of biochar mitigation potential derived from a synthesis of studies that include Woolf et al.12 and its derivates. For instance, Fuss et al.75 based their estimate on Woolf et al.12, Paustian et al.76, Lee and Day81, Roberts et al.72, Lomax et al.82, Pratt and Moran71, Griscom et al.68, Powell and Lenton67, and Smith64, deriving an ‘authors’ assessment’ of sustainable potential. Roe et al.74 reviewed largely the same range of studies, adding Fuss et al.75, and classified them as technical, sustainable or economic potentials (Fig. 2).

Besides Woolf et al.12, we have identified five independent groups of analyses to date. Three were published in 2010 and reported economic potential71,72 or technical potential73. The economic potential was derived either from bottom-up analysis of the costs and abatement potentials from large-scale and stove/kiln scale biochar projects for 2030 in developed and developing regions, respectively71, or LCA of a biochar system using only corn stover as feedstock72, producing estimates of 0.65 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 72 to 1.24 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 71. For the technical potential, Lenton73 estimated global CDR potential for 2050 through biochar produced from shifting cultivation biomass to be 0.9–1.3 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1, based on shifting cultivation fires in 2010, that is, a narrow choice of feedstock and land use system. Lenton subsequently investigated the mitigation potential of biochar from biomass residues and included avoided N2O emissions from soil and bioenergy alongside CDR67, then collated values from several studies to estimate CDR through biochar systems at 2.75-4.95 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−183.

The fourth independent group is based on Griscom et al.68 who included biochar in their seminal review of ‘natural climate solutions’. They estimated the cost-effective (marginal abatement cost <100 USD tCO2 equivalent) CDR potential of biochar systems to be 0.3 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 and a ‘maximum potential with [environmental and social] safeguards’ (equivalent to sustainable potential in this review) of 1.1 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 in 2030. The potential is calculated based on unused crop residue only, from assessments of sustainable supply of biomass for bioenergy in 2030, biochar C persisting in soil for >100 years and excluding reduced or avoided emissions. Subsequently, Bossio et al.13 presented the estimate from Griscom et al.68, unchanged, in their review of soil-based natural climate solutions, while Mayer et al.84 averaged the values from Griscom et al.68 and Woolf et al.12, for CDR only for 2100. Roe et al.56 expanded the analysis from Griscom et al.68 using bottom-up estimates of available crop residues, based on FAOSTAT data, and including avoided fossil fuel and soil N2O and CH4 emissions in their estimate of global mitigation potential.

The fifth independent group is based on Werner et al.70 who considered the total demand for CDR until 2100 and assessed how this could be provided by biochar, utilising purpose-grown feedstocks (woody and grass crops), modelled using the process-based dynamic global vegetation model (LPJmL). This demand-driven approach differs from most biochar potential studies that applied a supply-driven approach based on feedstock availability. The authors assessed a ‘basic biochar’ scenario (technical potential of biochar CDR) at the lower end of the negative emission demand up to year 2100, of 100 Pg C, which will deliver annual CDR of 4.58 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1. However, this scenario would require land comparable to the area used for wheat production. The same authors65 then took a supply-driven approach to estimate sustainable CDR through biochar, again using LPJmL to model biomass production of purpose-grown crops in the tropics and subtropics, but constraining biomass crops such that no additional cropland was required and calorie production was maintained. They estimated sustainable CDR potential through biochar of 0.44 to 2.62 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1, depending on the assumed yield response to biochar.

Our review reveals a wide range of estimates of biochar potential, from 0.03 to 11 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1, with divergence largely due to differences in scope and assumed feedstock availability. Unsurprisingly, studies that limit feedstock to biomass residues and wastes, and consider CDR only, generally reach lower estimates than those that include purpose-grown biomass crops, and consider avoided or reduced GHG emissions in addition to CDR. Of the 19 studies reviewed, five are independent analyses, and while seven relied on the original study by Woolf et al.12, sometimes misquoted, misinterpreted or selectively extracted. The three most recent independent assessments56,65,79 estimate sustainable CDR potential at around 2.7 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1 and total mitigation, including reduced and avoided emissions of up to 10.3 Pg CO2 equivalent yr−1. Thus, it is clear that biochar systems have substantial potential to contribute to climate change mitigation, including the vital challenge of CDR. Policy-makers should assess the barriers to adoption and upscaling of biochar in their jurisdictions, and introduce measures to facilitate biochar expansion, as part of their portfolio of mitigation strategies.

Most assessments reviewed have included only a subset of the mitigation contributions that can be delivered through biochar systems, with major emphasis on CDR. There is a clear need for new comprehensive assessments of global mitigation potential of biochar systems, that quantify reduced and avoided emissions as well as the CDR contribution to mitigation, incorporating the latest understanding of biochar persistence and impacts on GHG fluxes.

The potential for synergies rather than trade-offs between C sequestration and mitigation of non-CO2 GHG emissions make biochar preferable to other soil amendments and soil C sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy45. Future studies should simultaneously quantify the soil CH4 and N2O emissions and changes in soil organic C stocks due to priming, to represent the full impact of biochar systems on net GHG balance, and compare biochar with alternative organic amendments. However, there are challenges and obstacles for including these factors in global-scale assessments. As discussed in ‘Emissions reduction—non-CO2 GHG from soil and composting’, soil GHG emissions and priming are strongly influenced by soil types and environmental parameters, that widely differ around the globe. The value of applying mean values from meta-analyses is questionable. A granular approach to estimation of soil GHG emissions would require data on soil types and environmental factors to be collected or simulated in a consistent way at a global scale. Furthermore, long-term studies that simultaneously monitor changes in soil organic C stocks and effects on N2O emissions are needed, to inform estimates of mitigation potential.

To enable comprehensive holistic assessment, biochar should be included in the process-based IAMs85 that are used in scenario analyses to investigate global mitigation pathways, to inform climate policy development. Most pathways that limit global warming to less than 2 °C include large areas of biomass crops for bioenergy, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS)2, because most IAM studies currently rely on CDR through BECCS and afforestation/reforestation to meet temperature targets86. The land allocated to bioenergy crops could potentially be used instead to grow biomass for biochar. To date, very few IAM studies have included biochar, but one recent study using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) found that global CO2 removals from biochar reach 0.2–0.3 Pg CO2 yr−1 in scenarios that limit warming to below 1.5 °C in 210087. Inclusion of biochar in IAMs will enable estimates of global mitigation potential that take into consideration competing land uses, impacts on food production and energy systems from the production of biomass for pyrolysis and utilisation of biochar as a soil amendment, and influences of carbon markets. Inclusion in IAMs will also facilitate comparison between alternative mitigation strategies, particularly between the use of biomass for biochar and for bioenergy and BECCS, as demonstrated by Fuhrman et al.87 The competition for biomass, land and financial resources between alternative mitigation strategies is likely to have a large impact on mitigation realised through biochar systems.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02228-x/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2228_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-04-04 01:56:50.334655

The warning comes after some airlines raised concerns in March about the slow production of the greener sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
“Airlines are fully committed to achieving net zero by 2050, but this is a massive transition - one that airlines cannot accomplish alone,” an IATA spokesperson told Skift.
“Despite their pledges, major fuel producers have either stalled or abandoned investments in renewable fuel production, the IATA spokesperson said.
Slow Delivery of Newer and Greener Aircraft IATA pointed to another major hurdle: the slow delivery of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents most global airlines, told Skift that reaching “net zero” emissions by 2050 remains the goal, despite warnings on Wednesday that the targets may have to be delayed.

However, IATA warned that the sector is struggling to meet the target.

The warning comes after some airlines raised concerns in March about the slow production of the greener sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Without it, they say, they can’t meet their emissions targets.

“Airlines are fully committed to achieving net zero by 2050, but this is a massive transition - one that airlines cannot accomplish alone,” an IATA spokesperson told Skift. “Unfortunately, we are being let down. Governments have failed to provide the necessary policy support and financial backing to scale up SAF production, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded.”

On Wednesday, Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general and former CEO of British Airways, said the sector is falling behind.

“We’re going to have to reevaluate the commitment to net zero in 2050 because we’re just not getting the support that airlines require,” he told Reuters.

IATA also blamed fuel producers and aircraft manufacturers for the slow progress.

“Despite their pledges, major fuel producers have either stalled or abandoned investments in renewable fuel production, the IATA spokesperson said.

The International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, which represents most of the world's oil and gas companies, did not respond to Skift’s request for comment.

“Fuel companies are working hard to supply their obligations to meet the targets. We believe that the targets are realistic and can be met,” Fuel Industry UK, which represents major oilers such as BP and ExxonMobil, previously told Skift.

Slow Delivery of Newer and Greener Aircraft

IATA pointed to another major hurdle: the slow delivery of new, more fuel-efficient aircraft.

These planes are estimated to be up to 20% more fuel efficient than older models. That could reduce emissions by the same amount.

“Manufacturers have struggled with supply chain and product issues, failing to deliver the aircraft airlines have ordered,” the IATA spokesperson said.

As of February, Airbus reported a backlog of 8,652 planes, while Boeing had 6,197, according to Forecast International.

The Aerospace Industries Association, which represents Airbus, Boeing and other manufacturers, said the airline industry and other stakeholders need to recognize how complicated it is to build aircraft.

“We urge all stakeholders to recognize the complexity of meeting and exceeding the stringent safety requirements of the global aerospace industry, maximizing efficiencies, while also facing complex regulatory requirements, global economic headwinds, and ongoing supply chain challenges as airlines update their fleets,” Di Reimold, AIA’s Vice President of Civil Aviation, told Skift.

“AIA members prioritize the role of new aircraft in achieving long-term goals, with each generation of aircraft featuring state-of-the-art technologies, including engines that burn 15-20% less fuel than their predecessors. We are working towards a future that addresses demand in the most cost-efficient way possible.”

Many governments around the world say they are working to improve the production of SAF. The European Union has a policy to increase the production of SAF.

“The focus is now on their implementation, and we will offer support where needed. We will later this year present a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, which will also include aviation fuels,” an EU spokesperson told Skift.

Countries such as the United States, China, and the UK have also previously announced plans to support the production of SAF.

The meeting was held on Wednesday, April 2, at JB’s Sports Bar and Grill with many members from the community attending.

Updates on the highly anticipated DG Fuels sustainable aviation fuel plant, announced last fall, drew plenty of interest from the community. Julie Bushell, founder and CEO of Global Sustainability Developers (GSD), LLC, was the keynote speaker. GSD works with rural communities to bring in profitable projects through the Nebraska BioEconomy Initiative. Bushell has been heavily involved with PCDC and DG Fuels as the wait for the sustainable aviation fuel plant inches closer. Bushell spoke about her connection to rural communities and belief in bioeconomy’s future in strengthening the United States as a whole.

When DG Fuels announced their plans to build a plant in Phelps County, their initial investment was $5.5 billion. They have increased their total investment to $7 billion, a welcoming piece of news for the Phelps County economy. In addition to the increased investment, DG Fuels will also be giving farmers more opportunities to be a part of the plant’s operations. The plant will convert corn stover into sustainable aviation fuel, and farmers were already going to be able to sell the by-product to DG Fuels. The new financial opportunities for area farmers will come in the form of corn stover transportation and storage.

Another new development that was brought up was the implementation of an aquafer impact study. The study, led by Tri-Basin NRD, will research the potential impact the DG Fuel plant could have on the area’s groundwater.

Corn farmers are beginning to use conservation practices for the option to sell to companies wanting ethanol for SAF. Reducing the number of trips across the field, implementing minimal or no-till farming, and utilizing cover crops can significantly lower the Carbon Intensity (CI) score of corn used for SAF.

Justin Rahn, an Illinois corn farmer, recently went to the SAF conference, Illinois Future of Fuels: Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference, held by Illinois Manufacturers’ Association (IMA). Rahn spoke on a panel during this conference to talk about the conservation practices he partakes in and how they affect his farm. Attendees unfamiliar with farming practices were able to ask him questions about sustainable practices and learn their impacts directly from a farmer.

Reducing Carbon Intensity with Conservation Practices

""Fewer trips across the field, minimal tilling, and cover crops help reduce carbon emissions,"" Rahn explained. Some cover crops contribute by putting carbon directly into the soil, further improving sustainability by using crops as opposed to machines to implement carbon into the soil.

Precision Conservation Management Data Collection

Due to the requirements of SAF, farmers will need to track their conservation practices to have the opportunity to sell to SAF markets. ""I work with PCM [Precision Conservation Management], who collects and tracks everything I do on my farm. They meet with me twice a year to record what I planted, how much fertilizer I used, how many passes I made, and what inputs were applied to my fields. At the end of harvest, they track my yields, moisture levels, and transportation distances,"" Rahn shared.shared.

This data provides insights to farmers on the effectiveness of conservation practices and makes it easier for farmers to sell to SAF markets. These practices can be of great use to farmers, but they do come with challenges.

Challenges in Conservation

Farmers face several challenges when integrating conservation practices into their operations. ""Terminating cover crops at the right time can be difficult, especially when the weather doesn’t cooperate. Germination and growth in fall can be a struggle, particularly in dry soil conditions,"" Rahn explained.

Another issue is the high costs of using cover crops and the need for financial incentives. ""We need to be paid more for what we’re doing—cover crops cost money, and farmers need support to make it work,” Rahn expresses. He goes on to address that the companies who need the ethanol for SAF should be the ones to provide those incentives.

For conservation practices to be used by more farmers, they must have incentives. ""There is an incentive if the premium is high enough,"" Rahn stated. However, some farmers still rely on conventional methods like chisel plowing to manage soil compaction, highlighting the need for a balance between profitability and sustainability.

Advice for Farmers

For those considering conservation practices, Rahn suggests the best approach is to start small. ""Try it on a small scale first and work your way into it. Maybe start with half a field or one field before expanding,"" suggested Rahn. Proper care is essential to making cover crops effective, and smaller-scale experimenting can help determine what works best for individual operations.",https://www.ilcorn.org/image/3503/1000/IMA+SAS+031325-116_crop_796_354.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 20:57:00.980754

Motley Fool UK 2025","Cheap shares can power our portfolios forward. So, let’s have a look at two companies that could be fundamentally undervalued by the market and may experience supportive trends from the emerging macroeconomic environment.

Pawn shops

EZCORP (NASDAQ:EZPW) could be an intriguing investment opportunity. The company operates in the pawn industry, which typically performs well during economic uncertainty.

With Trump’s tariffs and recession risks potentially growing, demand for pawn services may rise as consumers seek alternative financing options. EZCORP’s strong fiscal 2024 performance, including record revenues and a 20% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), highlights its resilience and growth potential.

The stock appears to be priced attractively, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13.7 times for 2024, dropping to an estimated 9.2 times by 2028. This is significantly lower than the index average, suggesting undervaluation.

In line with this, consensus EPS growth rates are solid, with a projected increase of 15.62% by September 2025 and steady growth thereafter. The company’s expansion into Latin America also provides diversification and growth opportunities.

However, like any investment, risks remain. EZCORP has a high net debt position, with $569.3m in total debt against $174.51m in cash. This leverage could limit financial flexibility.

For patient investors, EZCORP may offer a compelling mix of value and growth, especially during economic turbulence. It’s actually a stock I’ve recently added to my portfolio.

A cheap European airline

I keep banging on about Jet2 (LSE:JET2) at the moment. But I’m a big fan of the stock. It’s currently trading at an enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortisation) ratio of 0.85, with some of its peers trading at a 400% premium to this. It’s got a lot of cash — £2.3bn in net cash — providing financial flexibility.

Of course, there are risks. The company faces rising costs, including higher wages, National Insurance contributions, and sustainable aviation fuel mandates, which could pressure margins. However, I’m willing to overlook some of these due to its incredibly strong relative valuation.

What’s more, I believe we may see some supportive trends in fuel prices. Aviation fuel typically represents around 25% of costs for airlines, and thankfully, fuel prices have retreated a lot from their highs. This impacts lower margin airlines and tour operators like Jet2 more than others. Brent crude prices sank after Trump’s tariffs. This may boost earnings slightly through the coming quarters — although the company does hedge this cost, like its peers.

Investors will want to keep an eye on its fleet transformation programme. Jet2 has committed to replacing older aircraft with up to 146 Airbus A321neo planes. This will offer increased operational efficiency. What’s more, the business plans to maintain annual capital expenditure at £833m. As a ratio, this sits below industry averages.

It’s a stock I’ve been topping up on. It might be low on momentum, but it’s my favourite UK stock right now.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

AVIATION

Turbulence – Global airlines have issued their strongest warning yet that the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is in jeopardy, with the head of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Willie Walsh, criticising other parts of the aviation sector and oil companies for failing to meet their commitments. Walsh said airline leaders are increasingly frustrated that the burden of decarbonisation is falling disproportionately on carriers, while others – such as airports, aircraft manufacturers, energy firms, and air traffic control – are not pulling their weight. He warned that pressure is growing to reassess the 2050 target if broader support does not materialise. Although IATA does not currently plan to revisit the target formally, Walsh acknowledged that calls to do so may arise at its upcoming annual meeting in June. He noted that the original commitment was based on the assumption that all stakeholders would contribute fairly. Airports and aerospace groups pushed back on Walsh’s remarks, with ACI Europe claiming airports are already doing more than their share, and manufacturers citing supply chain problems as a barrier. Walsh also criticised the long-delayed reform of European airspace and warned against allowing others to benefit reputationally from airlines’ efforts without matching their commitment. (Reuters)

EMEA

Leap forward – The expansion of Norway’s Northern Lights CCS project to store 5 mln tonnes of CO2 by 2028 marks a “great leap towards a scaled European market for CCS”, writes think tank Bellona. The Longship project encompassing the Northern Lights storage site followed a long-lasting Bellona campaign for a multi-source CO₂ storage infrastructure, with the organisation campaigning for Norway-Sweden cooperation on industrial decarbonisation for many years. The realisation of the bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) Stockholm project by way of Stockholm Exergi is an important step towards unlocking this potential, according to Bellona. First-mover projects like Northern Lights and Stockholm Exergi’s carbon capture operation are key for climate tech development, serving as proof of the economic, and operational viability of capturing, transporting, and sequestering CO2, and helping building confidence across emitters, investors, regulators, and the public.

State aid – The EU Commission has approved a €380 mln French scheme to support the production of renewable energy and decarbonisation equipment. The measure will back the production of batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat-pumps, electrolysers, and equipment for carbon capture usage and storage, as well as for the production of their key components and the production or recovery of related critical raw materials. The aid will take the form of direct grants and repayable advances, until no later than Dec. 31, 2025.

Tax it higher – The OECD has called for higher carbon taxes, particularly on natural gas, in Israel, as well as more stringent green building codes and the potential of taxing carbon-emitting building materials. The report published Wednesday noted that Israel’s power generation uses the highest percentage of fossil fuels in the OECD, and said emissions from this sector are “strongly underpriced by international standards”. Only a tenth of these carbon emissions in 2021 were taxed at over €60/t, the price estimated as necessary to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and a mid-range benchmark of current carbon costs in the OECD. Current carbon tax rates in Israel are too low, particularly on natural gas, where only a gradual increase to €18/t is planned by 2030, it said. Taxing natural gas at a rate consistent with other carbon sources will avoid over-investing in natural gas-based power generation, the OECD noted. (Times of Israel)

UK maritime emissions – The UK’s Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition (CMDC), backed by £30 mln in its latest round, is inviting bids from UK-based organisations to develop low-emission maritime technologies. Applications are open until Apr. 16. The programme, delivered by Innovate UK for the Department for Transport’s UK SHORE initiative, supports innovation in areas such as alternative fuels, electrification, and green shipping corridors. Recent projects include the integration of a 20-metre autonomous wing sail on the UK-flagged Pacific Grebe aimed at reducing fuel use and CO₂ emissions.

ASIA PACIFIC

Electrifying – An Australian Coalition-led senate committee has published a report calling on federal and state governments to work together to promote and coordinate the update of home electrification, Renew Economy reports. The report finds that residential electrification is a significant measure for achieving better energy outcomes in Australia, which could help boost household energy efficiency and contribute to achieving emissions reduction targets. However, the report argued that it was important consumers be given “genuine choice” about the electrification upgrades they could make, which noted the need to maintain social licence in the shift to net zero emissions.

City-to-city partnerships – Japan’s environment ministry has selected 20 projects for its low-carbon city development programme, where Japanese local governments use technology and know-how to support decarbonisation in developing countries, according to a notice released this week. The implementation of the programme is conditional on the final FY2025 budget. To date, around 30 environmental infrastructure projects have been further realised through the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), based on the results of the city-to-city collaboration projects.

Renewables to gas switch – Australia’s Northern Territory has cancelled its 50% renewable energy plan, which the Country Liberal Party – who are conservatives – initially supported when they were in opposition. The target date was 2030. The nation has an 82% renewable target by the same date, which was legislated by Canberra after Labor took office in 2022. However, the ABC reported that the government has scrapped the plan after revealing it would cost A$5 billion ($3.14) when the NT has A$11 bln in net debt and the target is only 20% met. Instead, the party plans to use gas to meet generation needs. The A$5 bln figure has been disputed.

Offshore wind buy in – Japan’s Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) has invested in a Taiwanese offshore wind service company via a new share issue. NYK said Wednesday it had bought into IOG, which provides support such as marine survey, construction support and vessel chartering, at the end of last month. The two hope to work together on Japan’s offshore wind sector. The nation has little installed capacity but great potential.

Solar gold – AngloGold Ashanti will cut 65,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions from its Safeguard Mechanism-covered Tropicana gold mine in the West Australian outback via a 61 megawatt solar-wind power station. It will cut gas and diesel use by a reported 50% and 96%, respectively. When the gas system is incorporated, the mine’s total capacity is 115 MW. It was installed by remote power specialist Pacific Energy.

‘Neutered’ NVES – Australia’s conservative Coalition plans to drop fines from the New Vehicle Efficiency Standard (NVES) if it wins the May 3 election. This means car companies that breach emissions standards won’t face fines, infuriating environmentalist groups like Greenpeace which suggested the move would “neuter” the NVES and allow car importers to send their most polluting cars to Australia, a nation that is heavily car dependent. Criticism of the NVES is that it will drive up car prices.

Rules rolled back – The US DOE rescinded a 2023 policy on Tuesday that imposed stricter conditions on LNG exporters seeking to extend their commencement deadlines for approved projects. The now-withdrawn policy required projects to be under construction and to prove delays were due to factors beyond their control before an extension would be considered. With the change, the DOE will return to a case-by-case review process for such requests.

Transportation talk – At a US Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works (EPW) hearing Wednesday, Sean Duffy, head of the Department of Transportation (DOT), fielded questions from both sides of the political aisle as lawmakers prepare to begin efforts to prepare the next Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill, which provides federal funding for transportation. During the hearing, Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK) said permitting reform for transportation projects should ensure protection against climate-related lawsuits from left-leaning and environmental groups to fulfil President Donald Trump’s day one executive order on unleashing American energy, while Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) questioned Duffy on the potential of efforts to scrub away a focus on climate to add bureaucracy to transportation projects and Senator Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) said she hopes grants for sustainability mobility are not put under the chopping block. Secretary Duffy said the department would focus on developing projects faster while still protecting the environment. Earlier this year, the DOT dropped its defence of Biden-era highway emissions rules after Duffy announced he would rescind the regulations.

Nuclear option – Colorado Governor Jared Polis (D) signed House Bill 25-1040 (HB 25-1040) on Monday, which defines nuclear as a clean energy source, a status that determines which energy projects are eligible for clean energy project financing at the county and city level. This definition also dictates which energy resources may be used by a qualifying retail utility to meet the state’s 2050 clean energy targets.

Blending battle – A coalition of US oil and biofuel industry groups met with the US EPA on Tuesday to advocate for higher federal biomass diesel blending mandates, proposing an increase to between 5.5 and 5.75 bln gallons from 3.35 bln, Reuters reported. The meeting was seen as a potential step toward the EPA releasing updated Renewable Fuel Standard quotas, expected to cover two years. The group has agreed on maintaining corn-based ethanol mandates at 15 bln gallons. However, internal divisions have emerged, with groups such as the Fueling American Jobs Coalition opposing the proposed increases. The EPA has not commented on the matter.

Biodiesel boost – Illinois increased its required biodiesel blend to B17 from B14 on Tuesday, as part of a 2022 bipartisan law aimed at promoting cleaner fuel use. The law raises the minimum blend level eligible for a tax exemption, meaning 17% of each gallon of eligible diesel fuel must come from biodiesel, largely derived from soybean oil. The Illinois Soybean Association, which represents over 43,000 farmers, supported the measure, citing benefits for energy security, rural economies, and emissions reductions. In 2026, the blend requirement will rise further to B20. The initiative is backed by lawmakers from both parties and Gov. Pritzker (D).

Ferry good news – New York City has begun transitioning its ferry fleet to renewable diesel as part of a broader effort to reduce GHG emissions from municipal vessels. The Department of Citywide Administrative Services awarded the first tender for renewable diesel (RD) fuel, following an Oct. 2024 announcement to convert the Staten Island Ferry and other city ships. The initiative includes testing the fuel on the Marchi Staten Island Ferry and aims to replace ultra-low sulfur diesel with R99 RD, which does not require engine modifications. Additional plans include retrofitting 13 large NYC Ferry vessels to meet US EPA Tier 4 emissions standards. The city is also considering the feasibility of achieving zero-emission port operations by 2040.

See you in 2026 – A lawsuit led by trade group US Chamber of Commerce against California’s state climate disclosure laws could see trial in Nov. 2026, if a summary judgement is not made before then, according to docket filings. Both parties agreed that the case is “likely amenable to resolution” by summary judgement. However, if the court sees it necessary to put a trial date on calendar, they estimate the trial will last between 5-10 court days in Nov. 2026. Discovery will close in Feb. 2026, followed by a series of expert reports and discovery through Mar. 2026.

Disclosure deficit – A new analysis published Wednesday by the Governance and Accountability Institute, along with Ceres, Carbon Accountable, and Persefoni, argues that most of California’s top state suppliers are not currently disclosing key climate-related information, raising concerns about readiness for proposed legislation. The research comes as California introduces Senate Bill 755, which would require suppliers with more than $25 mln in state contracts to report climate-related financial risks and full-scope GHG emissions, and those with $5 to $25 mln in contracts to report Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The report suggests that mandated reporting could significantly improve transparency.

Biochar win – San Francisco-based climate strategy consultancy 3Degrees has listed the first biochar project on the Climate Action Reserve (CAR) registry. The project, by Arizona-based project developer, Southwest Biochar, scaled commercially in January.

Electric evolution – Conagra Brands, a major North American packaged food company, has signed a 15-year power purchase agreement with Bloom Energy, a provider of solid oxide fuel cell technology, to install about 6 MW of fuel cells at its Troy and Archbold, Ohio production sites. The combustion-free system is expected to supply 70-75% of the electricity needs at both facilities and reduce their GHG emissions by 19%.

AI, carbon collide – GEP Software, an AI firm out of New Jersey, is expanding its partnership with carbon disclosure platform, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). The company said it would provide clients with real-time, data driven insights to track emissions with CPD’s comprehensive emissions database.

Agricultural aspirations – Brazilian grain and fibre company Amaggi and Anglo-Brazilian climate tech firm NaturAll Carbon announced Wednesday a joint renewable agriculture carbon credit project in the Brazilian state of Rondonia. The project will be developed in an area of 25,000 hectares, and is expected to be certified by Verra’s VM0042 methodology, the partners said. The project aims to develop CDR credits starting from a baseline comprised of degraded pastures and conventionally managed crops and regenerative practices such as the no-till system, crop rotation, and the use of cover crops. In March, the government of Rondonia signed an agreement with Portuguese technology organisation the Center for Engineering and Product Development (CEiiA) to map carbon stock in forest and rural prosperities in the state.

Comments welcome – Brazilian standard Tero Carbon opened public consultation on Version 2.0 of its carbon credit certification, methodology, and assets programmes, it announced Monday. The company said technical enhancements in Version 2.0 include some related to risk management, socio-environmental safeguards, risk mitigation flexibility, and software approval. VCM stakeholders can submit comments until Apr. 30. Earlier this month, Tero Carbon signed an MoU with Buenos Aires-based carbon project development platform and marketplace Forestblock to expand its foothold in Latin America, with an initial focus on Brazil and Argentina.

Come together – In Para, Brazil, State Secretary of Environment and Sustainability Raul Protazio Romao from the Semas agency met on Monday with State Attorney General Cesar Mattar Jr at the headquarters of the State Public Prosecutor’s Office (MPPA) to discuss Para’s jurisdictional REDD+ (J-REDD) programme (Agencia Para). The purpose of this visit was reportedly to “reinforce dialogue on the process”. Para’s high-profile J-REDD initiative, which is still under development, has been an ongoing point of contention between the two agencies. The J-REDD programme grabbed headlines in Sep. 2024 when Governor Helder Barbalho announced a R$1 bln ($180 mln) offtake deal with the LEAF Coalition public-private buyers’ club. This deal promptly provoked the ire of the MPPA, as well as the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office, on the grounds that there was insufficient transparency and public consultation with local stakeholders prior to signing the deal. The two penned a joint letter to Semas stating as much and demanding that SEMAS take steps to ensure that the deal align with a list of four legal requirements.

The one and only – The first auction for the Triunfo do Xingu concession in Para, Brazil concluded on Friday with only one bidder. Previously, Folha de Sao Paulo reported that some of Brazil’s largest project developers did not plan to participate, citing operational difficulties as the main factor in the companies’ withdrawal as well as a perceived lack of flexibility by the Para government. Systemica, a company with a minority stake in BTG Pactual Bank, won concession at the auction held by the B3 stock exchange (Diario do Para). Systemica’s competitor, Genuino Reflorestamento, was disqualified because it did not present all the required documentation and did not prove the legitimacy of its legal representative, according to text in the Official Gazette of Para. The Triunfo do Xingu restoration concession, valid for up to 40 years, is expected to generate R$1.2 bln ($214 mln) over the course of the contract but would also require an estimated investment of R$250 mln. Para has furthermore estimated that the winner of the bid would need to invest R$76 mln for the first seven years of the project until credit revenues are expected to become available in 2032.

Carbon accounting partners – Small business platform Xero has announced an expanded partnership with Sumday, a provider of carbon accounting software, making it easier for small businesses to track and manage their carbon footprint. Sumday will provide Xero customers with 12 months free access to its carbon accounting tools, while financial data from Xero will be linked directly into Sumday, stated the press release Wednesday. The partnership should help small business owners to prepare the necessary carbon footprint information required by larger companies up the supply chain.

Discredited – Amsterdam-headquartered non-profit Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) in its report Discredited has accused reports of two voluntary carbon market organisations – Ecosystem Marketplace and MSCI Carbon Markets – to be flawed in their analysis of the market. SOMO claims that recent reports that companies that use carbon credits to offset their emissions are likely to decarbonise their operations further and faster than those that do not have no causal link between carbon credit buyers and emission reductions.

Transparent partnership – The Clean Cooking Alliance (CCA) has partnered with AlliedOffsets in a bid to expand its data offerings on cookstove carbon markets with an aim to advance transparency within the sector, it has announced. Updated every three days, CCA’s free dashboard now features detailed insights into demand and pricing trends for cookstove credits across voluntary and compliance markets, which will complement the existing dataset from MSCI Carbon Markets, it said.

New partnership – Carbonplace, a credit management and transaction platform, has partnered with carbon registry Isometric, helping companies to navigate carbon markets. The partnership aims to strengthen market confidence by ensuring that only high-quality, scientifically rigorous credits are traded, enable businesses to know their purchases support tangible climate impact, and help scale the VCM by improving trust and transparency.

What do you think? – International Carbon Registry (ICR) has launched the public consultation of M-ICR011: Atmospheric Nitrous Oxide (N₂O) Destruction Using Photocatalysts. Developed by Crop Intellect, the methodology aims to tackle nitrous oxide—a potent GHG—by spraying a photocatalyst onto crop leaves during farming practices. The catalyst actively destroys the atmospheric N20 and the methodology quantifies N₂O destruction through flux measurements derived from air sampling and environmental data. The methodology is here and the public consultation is open from Apr. 1 – May 1, 2025. Submit feedback here.

Bids for biochar – Supercritical has launched a call for early-stage biochar projects, offering strategic exposure to leading buyers and a route to multi-year offtakes for those it selects. Deadline for applications is Apr. 18. Winning teams will receive expert support from its climate team and they’re particularly looking for new projects that aren’t yet operational and haven’t already signed major offtakes. Apply here.

Carbon ratings transition – A transition study by carbon ratings agency BeZero found that 88% out of 379 carbon projects retained the same rating over the 2024 calendar year. Of the remainder, 3% (10 projects) were upgraded and 9% (33) were downgraded. Rating movements were minor, with most changes limited to a single notch and none exceeding two, according to the analysis. The ratings demonstrated a high degree of stability and low volatility, with figures broadly in line with one-year transition rates seen in financial sector credit ratings, BeZero said.

Gold star – Peer-reviewed research published last week by academics at the University of Toronto – Mississauga has analysed 675 VCM projects to isolate key determinants of a positive ‘gender inclusion scale’ score. These indicators include Gold Standard certification, recent vintage, household devices or carbon removal project types, and African or South American geographies. According to the study’s authors, the importance of embedding gender equality in the VCM is gaining recognition, but gender impacts are still not well understood because research typically studies specific projects or standards. To improve the baseline level of gender inclusion, the researchers proposed mandatory disclosure of gender impacts and collaboration with women-focused NGOs or local governments.

INVESTMENT

Fairmat funding – French startup Fairmat has raised €51.5 mln in a Series B funding round to accelerate the industrialisation of its next-generation carbon composite recycling materials and expand internationally. The round consists of €26.5 mln in equity and €25 mln in venture debt from the European Investment Bank (EIB). The round is led by Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund and Slate VC, with additional participation from Cape Capital and long-term investors Singular, Temasek, CNP, and Pictet Group. The additional funding should help the company scale its industrial operations and strengthen its US presence where demand for sustainable materials is growing. (Tech Funding News)

AND FINALLY…

Smart business – CEOs with high academic qualifications are more likely to pursue corporate decarbonisation than those who are lower qualified or educated, according to research by Durham University Business School. The study investigated company governance data between 2000 and 2021, as well as financial data, greenhouse gas emissions and the level of CEO compensation, and found that not only is education a key factor, but also that having board members from different countries and of different ages encourages CEOs to clamp down on carbon emissions more quickly. “The more power a CEO holds the more likely they are to tackle carbon emissions,” the study added. And it isn’t just knowledge or awareness, the researchers said: “CEOs with strong power over their organisations were focused on reducing carbon emissions due to the fact that their financial remuneration is closely linked to company performance.”",https://carbon-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favicon.png,N,,2025-04-03 13:56:35.633568

This move marks a significant step toward advancing cleaner energy alternatives in the aviation sector. The company’s president, Ricardo Roa, disclosed the plans on Wednesday, emphasizing Ecopetrol’s commitment to sustainability and energy transition.

The SAF plant will be built at the Barrancabermeja refinery, one of Colombia’s key refining hubs. The project is expected to enter its development phase between late 2024 and early 2025. Roa stated that the plant is projected to begin operations by 2030, with an estimated production capacity of approximately 6,000 barrels of SAF per day. This development aligns with the global push for sustainable aviation solutions as the industry seeks to reduce its carbon footprint and dependency on conventional fossil fuels.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is considered a crucial alternative to traditional jet fuel, as it significantly lowers greenhouse gas emissions. The production of SAF involves the use of renewable resources such as agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and other bio-based feedstocks. By investing in this technology, Ecopetrol aims to support Colombia’s broader sustainability goals while also contributing to global efforts in mitigating climate change.

The company has allocated an overall investment budget of $5.9 billion to $6.8 billion for 2024. A significant portion of this funding will be directed toward projects that align with energy transition strategies, including the SAF initiative. Ecopetrol plans to finance these investments primarily through its own cash reserves, which stood at $4.4 billion at the end of 2024.

Ecopetrol’s investment in SAF production positions Colombia as a key player in the development of alternative aviation fuels in Latin America. With increasing global demand for cleaner fuel options, the new plant could open opportunities for both domestic use and potential exports in the future. Additionally, the project aligns with international aviation policies that aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) officially launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, which is now operational under the management of the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO).

The registry serves as a unified global system that allows airlines, fuel producers, corporate customers, and regulators to record and trace Sustainable Aviation Fuel transactions in a transparent and standardized manner. By connecting various players in the SAF value chain, the registry aims to support the development of a scalable and credible SAF market across the globe.

The system addresses one of the key challenges in aviation decarbonization: limited SAF availability. Currently produced in just a few locations, SAF has been difficult for many airlines to access. The registry bridges this gap by allowing environmental attributes of SAF to be recorded digitally and claimed, regardless of where the fuel is physically used. This gives all airlines equal access to SAF credits and ensures proper accounting for emissions reductions.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist, emphasized the registry’s importance: “It ensures that all airlines in the world have access to SAF and that their SAF purchases can be claimed against any climate-related obligations in this domain. The Registry will record the environmental attributes of SAF purchases in an immutable way, safeguarding against double counting.”

The SAF Registry is supported by the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, which provides a harmonized framework for tracking environmental benefits. It is both feedstock and technology neutral, encouraging innovation and diversity in SAF production. It also allows for global harmonization while adapting to region-specific regulations, ensuring compatibility with national and international frameworks.

Over 30 early users are currently onboarding, including airlines, regulatory bodies, travel management firms, and fuel suppliers. By using this centralized platform, these stakeholders can avoid fragmentation in emissions reporting and create a more reliable structure for managing SAF transactions. Corporate customers also benefit by being able to fund and track in-sector emissions reductions as part of their sustainability goals.

The registry will remain free for participants until April 2027, after which it will operate on a cost-recovery basis. This initial free access period is designed to encourage adoption and establish a wide base of users across the industry.

Responsibility for the registry now rests with CADO, a not-for-profit organization founded in March 2025. Based in Montreal and created under Canadian law, CADO was established to maintain and operate the IATA-developed platform. IATA remains involved, providing ongoing technical and operational support to ensure smooth functionality and continued evolution of the registry.

CADO’s membership is open to all stakeholders in the SAF value chain, including fuel producers, airline associations, airport operators, and government agencies. With its neutral governance model and collaborative approach, CADO is expected to play a central role in the long-term development of a transparent and competitive SAF market.

The SAF Registry marks a pivotal advancement in aviation’s sustainability journey. While it is not a silver bullet, it provides the foundation for a global market in which SAF transactions can be verified, credited, and scaled. As the industry works toward climate goals, platforms like this are essential tools that bring structure, trust, and coordination to complex international systems.

As aviation continues to expand its environmental responsibilities, the global launch of the SAF Registry may signal the beginning of a new chapter in how airlines and their partners approach sustainability in the sky.",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/airbus-a350-sustainable-aviation-fuel-saf-2025.webp,N,,2025-04-03 11:56:52.078718

Brazil SAF industry set to take off in 2027

Sao Paulo, 2 April (Argus) — Brazil's aviation industry is keeping an eye on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) regulations as the domestic market awaits the kickoff of local production to comply with the planned blend mandate and with potential for exports. The fuels of the future law envisages raising biofuel mix standards to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in domestic flights over a 10-year period starting in 2027, as Brazil has committed to applying a 10pc SAF mandate by 2037. The country's efforts to implement a SAF mandate runs in tandem with the guidelines from UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) program, which oversees GHG reduction in international flights. The program set up two phases until reduction targets are fully implemented, so airlines and producers adapt to changes efficiently. Airlines can voluntarily adhere between 2024-2026, followed by global compulsory targets from 2027-2035, prompting SAF usage or carbon credits compensation. The mandatory phase embraces all international flights, including those from and to non-voluntary countries, except for so-called underdeveloped countries and those with a low share of global air traffic flows. Brazil's SAF is a newborn industry that holds potential for feedstock supply , mostly for its traditional production pathways using soybean oil, corn and sugarcane ethanol, as well as widespread agricultural lands engaged in biomass production without practicing land-use change. Its variability also allows new projects to reuse degraded lands and existing agricultural assets to comply with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sustainability criteria related to land-use and soil health enhancement. SAF input in Brazil faces economic hurdles as high market volatility weighs on long-term investments, says A&M Infra's management consultant Filipe Bonaldo. But he also says that the political agenda will not hinder the energy transition as has happened in the US under President Donald Trump, since Brazil's economy is heavily based on agriculture its regulatory processes spur optimism. As an agricultural powerhouse, Brazil offers low-cost production and multiple sources to provide demand, both internally and offshore. Brazil is the third largest global exporter in agriculture and livestock markets, leading soy, orange juice and beef markets globally, according to agriculture and livestock confederation CAN. Debut in Rio Brazilian fuel distributor Vibra is the first to offer SAF in Brazil, before the blend mandate comes into effect. The company imported 550,000l (16,000bl) of SAF produced with used-cooking oil (UCO) from the port of Antwerp, in the Netherlands, in January. The biofuel is available for customers at Vibra's facility at the Rio de Janeiro international airport after a 10-month logistics plan was concluded. International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC) has secured all processes of the plan, from the supply chain of the product to distribution. Vibra operates in more than 90 airports in Brazil and accounts for 60pc of national aviation market share through its sector subsidiary BR Aviation, said executive vice-president of operations Marcelo Bragança. Why it took so long? The sector has long had doubts over the technical feasibility of admitting the use of biofuels in aviation , especially from a security point of view, said Anac's head of the environment and energy transition Marcela Anselmi. The agency, along with oil and biofuels regulator ANP, follow international regulations for SAF as it requires a physical and chemical resemblance to current fossil aviation fuels to ensure flight operations security. It is still not possible to use 100pc of SAF in aircraft motors, said Anselmi. There is a 50pc mix limit that inhibits worldwide adherence as there are technical restrictions yet to overcome. Recent engagement in the energy transition agenda is promoting biomass supply for aviation, as well as road and marine modalities, requiring new production pathways. For example, ATJ uses ethanol to convert it into SAF, which can be expensive to install and implies high capital expenditure. In a global context, Brazil stands in the vanguard of the SAF agenda as Europe and the US have only deployed legislation related to output and consumption over the past two years, Anselmi pointed out. Meanwhile, South America's planned SAF production capacity may reach 1.1mn l/yr in 2030, according to EPE.

US oil, farm groups push EPA for steep biofuel mandate

New York, 1 April (Argus) — The American Petroleum Institute and biofuel-supporting groups told Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officials at a meeting today that the agency should sharply raise advanced biofuel blend mandates for 2026. The coalition told EPA that it supported a biomass-based diesel mandate next year of 5.25bn USG, up from 3.35bn USG this year, and a broader advanced biofuel mandate, including the cellulosic category, at 10bn Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits, up from 7.33bn RINs this year, according to three different groups that attended the meeting. Both mandates would be record highs for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Soybean oil futures and RIN credit prices have risen sharply over the past week on optimism that oil and biofuel interests were working to coordinate volume mandate requests for consideration by President Donald Trump's administration. The coalition is also pushing the agency to set a total conventional volume requirement at 25bn RINs, which would keep an implied mandate for corn ethanol flat at 15bn USG. Ethanol groups had previously eyed a mandate even higher, but limits on the amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline make much more-stringent requirements a tough sell to oil refiners. The coalition provided no specific request for the cellulosic biofuel subcategory, where most credit generation comes from biogas. Credits in that category are more expensive, but price concerns have been less potent recently given an EPA proposal to lower previously set cellulosic obligations, signaling that future volume requirements can be cut, too. EPA is aiming to finalize new RFS volume mandates by the end of the year if not earlier, people familiar with the administration's thinking have said. EPA officials signaled at the meeting they were working urgently on the rulemaking. ""The agency is intent on getting the RFS program back on the statutory timeline for issuing renewable volume obligation rules,"" EPA said, declining to comment further on its plans for the rule. The RFS program requires oil refiners and importers to blend biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy credits from those who do. Under the program's unique nesting structure, credits from blending lower-carbon biofuels can be used to meet obligations for other program categories. One gallon of corn ethanol generates 1 RIN, but more energy-dense fuels earn more RIN credits per gallon. Some disagreements persist While groups at the meeting were aligned around high-level mandates, how administration officials and courts treat small refinery requests for exemptions from RFS requirements could undercut those targets. Groups present were broadly aligned on asking EPA not to grant widespread exemptions, though there is still disagreement in the industry about how best to account for exempted volumes when deciding requirements for other refiners. Groups present at the meeting today included the American Petroleum Institute and representatives of biofuel producers and crop feedstock suppliers. Some groups that previously engaged with the coalition's efforts to project unity to the Trump administration were not present. And some groups more historically skeptical of the RFS and more supportive of small refinery exemptions — including the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers — have not been closely involved. Fuel marketer groups notably did not attend the meeting after a representative sparred with others in the coalition at an American Petroleum Institute meeting last month. Some retail groups, including the National Association of Convenience Stores and the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, instead sent a letter to EPA today arguing that the groups pushing steep volumes are discounting potential headwinds to the sector from new tax credit policy. Some of the groups advocating for higher biofuel volumes have pointed to high production capacity and feedstock availability, but have preferred to ignore thornier issues like tax credits, lobbyists say. ""An overly aggressive increase in advanced biofuel blending mandates under the RFS will be punitive for American consumers"" without extending a long-running $1/USG tax credit for biomass-based diesel blenders, the retailers' letter said. That incentive expired last year and was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act's ""45Z"" credit, which offers subsidies to producers instead of blenders and throttles benefits based on carbon intensity. Generally lower credit values for biomass-based diesel — coupled with the US government's delays setting final regulations on qualifying for the credit — have spurred a sharp drop in biofuel production to start the year. Without a blenders credit, the RFS volume mandates pushed by some groups could increase retail diesel prices by 30¢/USG, the fuel marketers estimate, a potential political headache for a president that ran on curbing consumer costs. Other biofuel groups say that extending the credit would be an uphill battle this year, with some lawmakers and lobbyists instead focused on legislatively tweaking the 45Z incentive's rules to benefit crop feedstocks instead of reverting wholesale to the prior tax policy.

EU publishes CO2 car standard tweak proposal

Brussels, 1 April (Argus) — The European Commission has published the long-awaited proposal to give automobile manufacturers more flexibility in complying with the bloc's CO2 reduction targets for cars and passenger vehicles in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Those three years would be assessed jointly, rather than annually, averaging out fleet emission performance. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the additional compliance flexibility shows that the commission has ""listened"" but the EU is still maintaining its zero-emission targets [for new vehicles from 2035]. ""Predictability in the sector is crucial for long-term investments,"" said Hoekstra. The commission urged the European Parliament and EU member states to reach agreement on the targeted amendment ""without delay"". German centre-right member Jens Gieseke said there is a ""broad majority"" in parliament to fast-track approval for May. He noted that the car industry faces over €15bn ($16bn) in penalties for non-compliance with the CO2 standards. A member of parliament's largest EPP group, Gieseke also called for the commission to go further towards technological neutrality. ""We need different kinds of fuels, e-fuels, biofuels, every fuel which could help to reduce CO2 should be recognized,"" he added. This second step, withdrawing the phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICE) from 2035 onwards, Gieseke noted, should come in the last quarter of 2025. German Green MEP Michael Bloss disputed the figure of €15bn in potential fines put forward by automotive industry association ACEA. ""Even in the worst-case scenario, the total fines for all car manufacturers would not exceed €1bn,"" said Bloss. ""Car manufacturers have had enough time to adjust their production planning. Many have done so,"" Bloss said, pointing to Automaker Volvo. Under the current 2019 regulation, fines should be imposed on manufacturers for each year in 2025–2029 when they do not reach their specific fleet-wide target CO2 reductions, compared to 2021 values. But manufacturers have the option to form compliance pools with other firms. ""European car manufacturers are already talking to Tesla or Chinese manufacturers about so-called pooling, which must be stopped quickly,"" said EPP climate and environment spokesman Peter Liese. ""We want to maintain climate targets, but not make Elon Musk richer through European legislation,"" said Liese.

ISCC aware EU mulling certification recognition: Update

Adds comment from the European Commission London, 28 March (Argus) — The ISCC, an international certification system for sustainability, said today that it is aware of discussions in an EU committee about future recognition of its certification for waste-based biofuels. It said there is no legal basis for any planned measures. Industry participants said yesterday that the EU Committee on Sustainability of Biofuels, Bioliquids, and Biomass Fuels is drafting implementing regulations that would include a two-and-a-half year pause to obligatory acceptance of ISCC EU certification for waste-based biofuels. ""This action is said to be subject to further legal scrutiny and will need approval by member states,"" the ISCC said. Currently, member states accept EU-recognised voluntary scheme certification as proof that fuel or feedstocks are compliant with the bloc's Renewable Energy Directive (RED) sustainability criteria. Market participants told Argus that discussions have centred around giving individual countries more choice. ""Other voluntary schemes would not be able to fill the gap. The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels and would seriously jeopardise the ability of the obligated parties to comply with blending mandates,"" the ISCC said. The ISCC has been singled out in a discriminatory way and has supported European Commission and member states' investigations into alleged fraud, it said. ""We are more than surprised by this step […and] are unable to see the rationale of the planned measure, which seems ad hoc and baseless,"" it added. Secretary-general of the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) Xavier Noyon told Argus that, if confirmed, the suspension would affect thousands of operators. ""At this time, member states are refusing to comment, and we call on the commission to urgently clarify any decisions of this nature that are on the table,"" he said. The EBB published its own proposed revision to the RED implementing legislation last month, which expanded the supervisory power of member states over voluntary schemes and certification bodies. The European Commission confirmed that the committee met on 26 March to discuss sustainable certification, promotion of biofuels, avoidance of double counting, and alleged fraud. ""We are still working on our examination of this alleged fraud in biodiesel imports from China,"" said commission energy spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen. But the commission has not taken any decision yet and cannot allude to ""possible"" scenarios, she said.

This milestone will represent a complete transition from fossil fuel-powered equipment to electric alternatives for all baggage and ramp tractors, belt loaders, power stows, container loaders and aircraft tractors.

This transition will eliminate Air Canada’s use of fossil fuel equipment in these key GSE categories at this station.

This is a step forward toward achieving Air Canada’s climate-related ambition that sets out mid-term targets in support of its long-term aspirational goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Those mid-term targets are 20 percent GHG net reductions from its air operations and 30 percent GHG net reductions from its ground operations, both compared to a 2019 baseline, by 2030.

“The focus of Earth Month 2025 is renewable energy and with Québec’s renewable hydroelectric power, it is fitting that the city of Québec is our first fully electric capable station. This project demonstrates the successful collaboration between Air Canada and the YQB airport authority in developing the necessary charging infrastructure to support the transition to a zero direct emission electric GSE (eGSE) fleet powered by Québec’s renewable energy grid,” said Michael Rousseau, president and CEO at Air Canada.

“Achieving the clean energy transition for aviation will require collaboration and efforts from all stakeholders. We accept our role as Canada’s flag carrier, and acknowledge that aviation plays a critical role in global connectivity and socio-economic growth. We are committed to a coordinated approach for this long-term energy transition as we operate within an ecosystem of manufacturers, suppliers, airports, and governments, all of whom play an integral part in this important initiative,” Rousseau continued.

“The electrification of Air Canada’s ground operations at YQB represents a concrete and significant step in reducing the impact of airport ground activities on the environment. This project was made possible thanks to close collaboration between our teams, and is perfectly in line with our commitment to reduce the environmental footprint of our operations, as well as to provide the support and tools necessary for our airline partners to achieve their GHG reduction objectives. We are proud that YQB is the first Air Canada station to take this important step towards environmental sustainability,” said Stéphane Poirier, president and CEO of YQB.

“Québec City is delighted with this initiative, which makes our airport the first Air Canada station in the country to electrify its main ground support equipment. This transition testifies to the commitment of our institutions and companies to innovate while taking into account current and future energy concerns. We are proud to see YQB, a strategic hub, support the evolution of the air transport industry and actively participate in initiatives aimed at reducing our environmental footprint,” said Bruno Marchand, mayor of Québec City.

Over the last several years, Air Canada has been progressively retiring and replacing older fossil-fuel powered ground equipment across Canada with more efficient electric ground equipment.

The airline now has more than 900 pieces of eGSE equipment, representing 35 percent of the GSE fleet across all categories. Air Canada’s ground fleet includes proven electric alternatives that support operational efficiency and emissions reductions.

While some operations still require fossil-fuel powered equipment, Air Canada continues to work closely with the manufacturers to evaluate emerging technologies that come to market.

The new eGSEs are designed to reduce direct emissions compared to internal combustion engine GSEs. They are expected to lower maintenance and spare part costs, and eliminate direct fuel costs, contributing to overall cost savings for Air Canada

This is where the Open Fan comes in.
Ali pointed to two wind tunnel tests in particular that simulated the integration of the Open Fan and the wing.","Last week, Airbus hosted its third Summit in Toulouse, France, to share its latest progress for the future of flight through innovative design, advanced technologies, and novel engineering.

Key to this vision is the development of Open Fan engine architecture, which could help power a next-generation single aisle aircraft that might also incorporate foldable wings and hybrid electric batteries. During the Summit’s “Pioneering Technology for Future Aircraft” session, Mohamed Ali, senior vice president and chief technology and operations officer at GE Aerospace, joined Frank Haselbach, senior vice president of propulsion engineering at Airbus, to discuss how Open Fan technology could lead to a step change in fuel efficiency and durability in commercial aviation.

Ali pointed out that over the past 70 years, huge strides have been made in the efficiency of commercial jet engines. “If you reflect on it, our current newest engine at CFM, the CFM LEAP, is 15% better in fuel burn than its iconic predecessor, the CFM56 engine. And then the CFM56 on its own has been 15% to 20% better than its predecessor,” he said.

Yet for all of the improvements in engine design that have led to these reductions in fuel burn, the shape of the commercial jet engine has changed little. As Haselbach noted, the industry is at something of a crossroads. It can do something evolutionary by developing more ultra-high-bypass-ratio ducted engines. “Or we can actually look at something which is much more rewarding, much more challenging, much more revolutionary,” he said. “Which is Open Fan.”

What Is Open Fan?

Open Fan is a style of engine architecture that aims to provide the same level of safety, speed, noise, and power as current jet engines while delivering a significant reduction in fuel usage and carbon emissions. How will it do this? By shedding the “ducts” that traditionally encase the engine.

CFM International, a 50-50 joint company between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines, is developing Open Fan (aka unducted) engine architecture as part of the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) technology development and demonstration program. Unveiled in 2021, the RISE program is advancing technologies to support a future aircraft engine that aims to be 20% more fuel-efficient than current commercial engines while meeting customer expectations for durability and reliability.

The engineering teams working on Open Fan across CFM have high hopes for the step change this new architecture will bring for fuel efficiency while also being designed to work with alternative fuels like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hybrid electric systems, two other key initiatives currently being pursued by both companies to support the industry’s efforts to reduce flight emissions.

How Can Open Fan Change the Future of Flight?

“The next change, the next improvement in fuel burn to make it in that neighborhood of 20%, cannot happen without a fundamental change in the shape of the engine. And that’s just the laws of physics,” Ali said.

This is because of the “bypass ratio.” To improve fuel burn and efficiency, the approach has typically been to make the engine’s fan bigger. That fan scoops air and throws it to the back of the engine to generate greater thrust. But in that process, a portion of that air ends up burning with the fuel. Ideally, the amount of air that “bypasses” being burned with the fuel should be as high as possible to provide the thrust — the bypass ratio.

Seventy years ago, the bypass ratio for jet engines was about 2 to 1. Today it’s about 11 to 1. But as Ali noted, engineers can’t keep following the same formula to improve that ratio because of the ducts, which get bigger to support bigger fans, producing drag that eats at the fuel burn benefits. “There is a point that is not very far away from where we are today in which that duct is so big that it wipes out any gains that are coming from making the fan bigger,” he said.

This is where the Open Fan comes in. GE Aerospace’s current design aims to take the bypass ratio from 11 to 1 to 60 to 1. “That’s six-zero from where we are today,” Ali added. “That is the fuel burn opportunity that we are thrilled and excited about.”

Testing, Testing: Putting Open Fan Through the Paces

The RISE program has completed more than 250 critical field tests so far. Ali pointed to two wind tunnel tests in particular that simulated the integration of the Open Fan and the wing. The first 300-plus hours of tests were completed by Safran Aircraft Engines at a facility run by ONERA, the French national aerospace research center, in “the largest wind tunnel in the world,” using a one-fifth scale model of the Open Fan performing at cruising speed. This was followed by a second set of tests in collaboration with DNW in the Netherlands, performed at low speed to simulate an aircraft during takeoff, climb, and descent.

Ali called the results “extremely encouraging,” not only in terms of validating performance and noise but also the computational analysis that GE Aerospace has done with the help of Frontier, one of the world’s fastest supercomputers, maintained at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Last November, the company announced a new project it’s working on with Boeing, NASA, and Oak Ridge to use supercomputing to study the aerodynamics of an Open Fan architecture mounted on an aircraft wing in simulated flight conditions.

“Typically, when you get computational results and compare them to the wind tunnel [tests], there is a difference between the two. You spend a lot of time reconciling,” he said. But in this case, there was “no reconciliation.” He added: “These supercomputers’ capabilities are unprecedented in the ability to simulate the future.”

Next Steps for Open Fan

“We are in the middle of a lot of testing to validate durability, vibrations, endurance, and ingestion,” Ali explained. “And we’re doing all of these tests not just for the Open Fan, but there are lots of other technologies that are part of the RISE program that are behind the fan, whether it’s a more advanced core or hybrid electric.”

In fact, a lightweight compact core, which houses the engine’s compression, combustion, and high-pressure turbine modules, is being reengineered by the RISE program team to be smaller and optimize thermal efficiency, with an advanced cooling system and materials that can withstand extremely high temperatures. The core is being tested for compatibility with next-generation fuels, including unblended SAF and hydrogen, as well as with hybrid electric systems like the ones GE Aerospace is currently developing with NASA.

Flying Forward Together

The challenge of more efficient flight is not solved by one invention or company. It is about industry-wide innovation and collaboration.

“This is all leading up to the demonstration flight that we are going to be doing jointly with Airbus later in this decade,” said Ali. Acknowledging “the strong partnership” between CFM and Airbus, he added: “It’s really a reflection of what the technology wants us to do, which is a deeper, better integration between the engine and the aircraft.”",https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/default/files/aerospace-1200x650-1.jpeg,N,,2025-04-03 10:57:25.940595

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions.
According to a recent IATA estimate, SAF production in 2024 reached 1 million tonnes, or 1.3 billion liters, roughly doubling production in 2023, but still accounting for only around 0.3% of global jet fuel production.
The IATA added that the registry is technology and feedstock neutral, supporting the emergence of diverse SAF production streams.
Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist, said: “While this is of fundamental importance and a historically momentous advance, it is but one step along the way to a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced today the launch of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, a new tool aimed at facilitating a global market for sustainable aviation fuel by tracking SAF transactions and environmental benefits, and connecting buyers and sellers.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels. According to a recent IATA estimate, SAF production in 2024 reached 1 million tonnes, or 1.3 billion liters, roughly doubling production in 2023, but still accounting for only around 0.3% of global jet fuel production.

Developed in consultation with airlines, government authorities, OEMs, fuel producers and suppliers, and corporate travel management companies, the new registry is a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way, and will also record the environmental attributes of SAF as it moves across the value chain to enable claims against regulatory obligations and corporate climate goals, while also avoiding double counting.

According to the IATA, the new registry will help to solve the challenge of limited SAF supply by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location, and by giving airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions. The IATA added that the registry is technology and feedstock neutral, supporting the emergence of diverse SAF production streams.

The IATA said that 30 early users are currently in the process of onboarding the system.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist, said:

“While this is of fundamental importance and a historically momentous advance, it is but one step along the way to a mature, transparent, and liquid global SAF market.

After investing nearly $1 billion since 2010 in renewable fuel production, as well as decarbonization initiatives, Preem now produces 300,000 metric tons a year of renewable fuels. This capacity is expected to rise to 1.3 million metric tons per annum after the completion of an upgrade at the Synsat diesel plant to enable up to 40 percent co-processing of renewable feedstocks.

In Sweden Preem owns 2 refineries with 352,000 barrels a day in combined production capacity, representing 80 percent of the country’s refining capacity, VARO said.

“Primarily located in Scandinavia, Preem’s assets are highly complementary to VARO’s existing operations across northwest Europe with limited overlap”, VARO said.

Marcel van Poecke, chair of VARO and chair of energy at Carlyle, said, “This acquisition provides material value creation opportunities through disciplined investment in future growth projects, while enhancing VARO’s ability to deliver the reliable and secure energy that Europe needs”.

“The combined entity will be well-positioned to continue to play an important role in meeting Europe’s growing demand for sustainable energy for the mobility and industrial sectors”, Van Poecke added.

The resulting company “will benefit from access to Vitol’s network and global expertise”, said Vitol chief executive Russell Hardy.

The enlarged VARO will operate one of Europe’s biggest fuel supply networks with access to over 120 terminals and account for nearly 10 percent of all road and marine fuels sold on the continent, VARO said.

“The company will be the largest co-processor of renewable feedstocks in Europe”, it added. “On completion, the combined group will rank in the top five largest producers of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil and Sustainable Aviation Fuel globally. It will be Europe’s second largest renewable fuel producer and the top producer in Sweden.

“Material renewable fuel production will provide the company with a strong position in the fast-growing biofuels for transport sector. Biofuel demand in the EU transport sector is expected to increase by 50-80 percent by 2030 as Member States accelerate decarbonization efforts”.

The parties expect to complete the transaction this year.

Researchers at the University of Surrey have introduced an innovative approach that combines carbon capture and conversion into one seamless process, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods.

This new method, known as the Dual-Function Material (DFM) process, has shown the potential to be both financially viable and scalable.

A recent study demonstrates that this technique could achieve carbon capture at a cost as low as $400 per tonne, making it a competitive option compared to existing commercial systems.

What are Dual-Function Materials (DFMs)?

At the heart of this innovative process is the use of Dual-Function Materials (DFMs) – a unique class of materials designed to both capture CO₂ and facilitate its conversion into useful products, such as methane.

Unlike conventional carbon capture technology that relies on separate systems for capture and conversion, DFMs integrate both functions into a single step.

DFMs work by absorbing CO₂ from the air and then, using catalysts and renewable hydrogen, converting it into synthetic fuels.

This eliminates the need for additional energy-intensive processing steps, making the entire system more efficient and cost-effective.

By embedding this technology into industrial operations, sectors that are difficult to decarbonise – such as steel manufacturing – can significantly reduce their emissions.

The role of superstructure optimisation

To refine the efficiency of this carbon capture system, the research team employed superstructure optimisation, an advanced modelling technique that tests various process configurations.

By analysing different system designs, they identified the most cost-effective method to capture 10,000 tonnes of CO₂ per year, a scale comparable to existing commercial solutions.

This level of optimisation ensures that the technology is not only scientifically sound but also economically feasible for large-scale deployment.

The ability to integrate DFMs with existing industrial infrastructure further enhances its appeal for widespread adoption.

Potential impact on carbon reduction and clean energy

The implications of this carbon capture technology extend beyond just cost savings. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has emphasised the need for large-scale CO₂ removal to meet global climate targets.

With a growing focus on Net Zero emissions, technologies like DFMs provide a practical pathway to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels while creating cleaner energy sources.

By utilising CO₂ directly from the atmosphere and converting it into synthetic fuels, industries such as steel and chemical manufacturing can transition towards greener alternatives.

The ability to produce methane and other fuels from captured carbon presents an opportunity for energy independence and the development of sustainable value chains.

The future of carbon capture technology

As material performance continues to improve and catalyst costs decrease, the potential for DFMs to be deployed on a larger scale increases.

With ongoing research and industrial collaboration, this technology could play a crucial role in achieving climate goals while providing an economically viable solution for carbon reduction.

Integrating carbon capture technology into various industries will be essential for tackling climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

As advancements in DFMs continue, they could soon become a mainstream solution for sustainable energy and industrial decarbonisation.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2317075011.jpg,N,,2025-04-03 09:56:15.914717

We continue working to expand partnerships that bring concrete benefits to our country,” highlighted Brazil's minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation Luciana Santos.
“Like Brazil, Vietnam understands that, without human resources trained to deal with the economy of the future, there will neither be growth nor sustainable development,” she concluded.
“With the signing of the memorandum, Brazil and Vietnam renew joint efforts to strengthen the partnership in economic and trade issues.
Silveira addressed the intention to expand partnerships in the field of ​​biofuels during the session that discussed energy cooperation.","President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s official visit to Hanoi, between Thursday (27) and Saturday (29) reinforced Brazil's partnerships with Vietnam. A delegation of ministers and government representatives accompanied Lula on the trip to expand relations between the countries in different areas.

Five acts were adopted at the meetings — among them the Action Plan for Implementation of the Strategic Partnership between Brazil and Vietnam for the period 2025-2030, covering the following priority areas: politics, defense, security and global challenges; economy, trade and investment; science, technology, and innovation; climate change and the environment; education, culture, sports, tourism, and connections between peoples; consular affairs and community support.

“Brazil and Vietnam share a path of growth and development, and this commitment reaffirms our intention of building bridges, fostering opportunities and deepening strategic ties. We continue working to expand partnerships that bring concrete benefits to our country,” highlighted Brazil's minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation Luciana Santos.

SCIENCE COMMITTEE — During the Brazil-Vietnam Economic Forum on Saturday (29), the minister confirmed that the first meeting of the Brazil-Vietnam Joint Committee on Science, Technology, and Innovation will be held in Brazil in the second half of 2025. “For us, it will be an opportunity to define our cooperation priorities, plan actions, and begin their implementation,” stated Luciana Santos. The ministry is interested in establishing partnerships in areas such as semiconductors, Artificial Intelligence, quantum technologies, energy transition, biodiversity, food and nutritional security, and innovation environments.

TRAINING — The minister emphasized the agreements that had already been established with Vietnam as of 2023, regarding the training of specialized labor. “I want to reiterate the proposal we made in 2023 —and which we discussed last year between technical teams from both governments— to create a Brazil-Vietnam Center for semiconductors, to train and qualify human resources, in addition to research and development of components,” she said. Luciana Santos added that the ministry has the ambitious goal of training 50,000 specialists in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector, including engineers and hardware and software developers. “Like Brazil, Vietnam understands that, without human resources trained to deal with the economy of the future, there will neither be growth nor sustainable development,” she concluded.

MARKET OPENING — During his official visit, President Lula announced the opening of the Vietnamese market to Brazilian beef. The decision came after a series of meetings with Vietnamese government leaders. “We are working hard on the trade relationship between agricultural products and Vietnam, and President Lula’s presence was essential for this long-awaited reopening, granting the access of Brazilian beef to Vietnamese consumers,” declared Brazil’s Minister of Agriculture and Livestock, Carlos Fávaro.

Since the beginning of this administration, four new markets have been opened in Vietnam, and the trade of Brazilian leather has been facilitated. In 2025, Vietnam will already be the fourth largest destination for exports of Brazilian agricultural products, accounting for 3.2% of what was traded up to February, and only behind China, the European Union, and the United States.

TRADE AND INDUSTRY — Representing the Vice President of the Republic and Minister of Development, Industry, Trade, and Services (Ministério do Desenvolvimento, Indústria, Comércio e Serviços/MDIC) Geraldo Alckmin, Executive Secretary Márcio Elias Rosa participated in the signing of the memorandum of understanding that creates the Steering Group for Trade and Industrial Cooperation in Vietnam. The goal is to promote economic cooperation in priority areas for trade, and to create favorable conditions for the expansion of bilateral relations.

“With the signing of the memorandum, Brazil and Vietnam renew joint efforts to strengthen the partnership in economic and trade issues. We have extraordinary opportunities ahead to advance in strategic sectors, such as high technology, digital transformation, energy transition, biofuels, environmental protection, and climate change,” highlighted Alckmin from Brazil.

In addition to establishing a mechanism that enables the strengthening of trade and the improvement of the industrial capacity of Brazil and Vietnam, one of the responsibilities of the group created through the memorandum will be to identify opportunities and diversify trade between the two countries. Plans are in motion to promote studies, training programs, and information exchange are planned.

In Hanoi, the MDIC executive secretary said that the two countries already have a significant relationship with potential for expansion. “Vietnam is currently Brazil’s largest trading partner in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Brazil is Vietnam’s main partner in South America. Based on this mission, the expectation is to expand this important cooperation in high value-added sectors, such as biotechnology, semiconductors, sustainable mobility, industrial digitalization, and artificial intelligence,” stated Márcio Elias Rosa.

GOAL — Recognizing economic collaboration as an essential pillar of bilateral relations and aware of the untapped potential for greater growth, Lula and the President of Vietnam Luong Cuong agreed to pursue a bilateral trade target of USD 15 billion by 2030. They also agreed to continue working to diversify trade between Brazil and Vietnam. In this sense, they noted with satisfaction the excellent business prospects in sectors such as animal protein and aircraft.

ENERGY — Also present at the Brazil-Vietnam Economic Forum, Brazil’s Minister of Mines and Energy Alexandre Silveira highlighted the possibilities for cooperation between the two countries. Silveira addressed the intention to expand partnerships in the field of ​​biofuels during the session that discussed energy cooperation. “As in Brazil, sugarcane production is relevant to Vietnam’s economy. This makes our countries very well positioned to advance in the biofuels agenda. We already have a strong commercial partnership, particularly in the case of dried distillery grains, used in the production of ethanol. But we can do more. Brazil can be Vietnam’s largest supplier of inputs for biofuels,” he stated.

The minister highlighted Brazil’s leading role with the Fuel of the Future Law (Lei do Combustível do Futuro) — a proposal by the Federal Government that improved the legal and regulatory framework for biofuels. “We are able to expand our partnerships in other areas, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marine biofuels, and strategic minerals. We are open to sharing our experience with you, strengthening commercial partnerships and working together to decarbonize the planet's energy matrix, strengthening the new, green economy,” said Alexandre Silveira. He invited representatives from Vietnam to participate in the Global Planning Summit for the Energy Transition in June, in Rio de Janeiro, and in COP30, which will be held in November in Belém, Pará.

FURTHER ACTIONS — The governments of the two countries also signed agreements on the exercise of paid activities by employees of diplomatic missions, consular offices and permanent missions to International Organizations and on the exchange and mutual protection of classified information. During President Lula's official visit, a memorandum of cooperation was also signed between the Brazilian Football Confederation (Confederação Brasileira de Futebol/CBF) and the Vietnamese Football Federation (VFF).",https://www.gov.br/planalto/en/latest-news/2025/04/brazil-vietnam-strengthen-partnerships-during-visit-of-president-lula-ministers-to-asia/250401_planalto_acordos-firmados-brasil-e-vietna_foto-ricardostuckert-pr.jpg/@@images/885433bb-01aa-4415-9278-7a356e9e4974.jpeg,N,,2025-04-03 09:56:24.113635
