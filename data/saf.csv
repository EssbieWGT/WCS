Renewable fuels, a type of biofuel, are derived from naturally replenishing, nonedible biomass that provide a sustainable alternative to petroleum fuels and also to biofuels produced from edible crops such as corn and sugarcane.

Government policies and international regulations are driving biofuel adoption across multiple sectors, but policy support remains uneven globally. Many countries have implemented mandates for blending biofuels with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to curb emissions. Even in shipping, the International Maritime Organization is promoting biofuel use. However, policy approaches vary widely around the world. While the EU enforces strict mandates such as the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative requiring a minimum of 2% sustainable aviation fuel blending by 2025, some of the other regions lack such clear policies, leading to disparities in biofuel adoption and investment. The commitment of a nation to achieving interim net-zero objectives, availability of biomass, and affordability of petroleum fuels are critical factors influencing policy support for biofuels.

Despite their clean energy profile, biofuels face significant challenges, primarily related to production costs and competition with petroleum fuels. Processing advanced biomass sources such as agricultural and forestry waste remains expensive, limiting large-scale commercial viability. However, refiners such as Neste, Valero, and Marathon Petroleum are making strategic investments to scale biofuel production from these sources and thus lower costs. Feedstock diversification and technological innovations in refining are also critical to improving biofuel affordability and availability. Hence, although biofuels contribute towards energy security while reducing emissions, their adoption remains relatively nascent and restricted to certain markets globally. As a result, companies are cautious while pledging investments for new facilities, and even halting project development due to market uncertainties, as was seen in the case of Shell’s upcoming facility in Rotterdam.

Global renewable refinery capacity is experiencing significant growth, with 15 new facilities under construction in 2025 and two, Rayong in Thailand and Bratislava in Slovakia, already operational this year. By 2030, an additional 218 facilities are expected to come online, expanding the global capacity from 9,340 million gallons a year in 2024 to a projected 32,618 million gallons a year. The US currently accounts for a 51% share in global renewable fuel production, driven by policy support and incentives such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. However, the recent political shifts in the country – including President Trump’s efforts to repeal certain provisions of the IRA, have introduced uncertainty in the policy environment.",https://www.offshore-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/04/Biofuel-CW-feat-img-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 12:56:16.856164

Globally, around 350 million tonnes of aviation fuel were burned in 2023.
This blend can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional aviation fuels.","German energy company Mabanaft has started supplying jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to airlines at Frankfurt Airport. This move marks an expansion of Mabanaft’s aviation business into the German market. However, the volumes involved are currently quite small. Since January 2025, Mabanaft has partnered with Skytanking, an aviation fueling services company.

Together, they support operations at Frankfurt Airport. The company has already signed supply agreements with Singapore Airlines and the Lufthansa Group. This expansion adds Frankfurt to Mabanaft’s existing aviation fuel network, which includes locations in the UK and Norway. Under the European SAF Mandate, Mabanaft plans to deliver over 1,000 tonnes of SAF at Frankfurt this year.

Globally, around 350 million tonnes of aviation fuel were burned in 2023. SAF supplied by Mabanaft consists of a blend of hydroprocessed vegetable oils, fats, and greases. This blend can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional aviation fuels.

Simon Weiss, Head of Aviation at Mabanaft, stated that the expansion supports the company’s strategy to strengthen aviation supply chains. Mabanaft aims to develop its presence in hard-to-electrify sectors, including aviation. They are focused on providing conventional fuels and lower-carbon alternatives.

Under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, fuel suppliers must provide increasing volumes of SAF to airports from 2025 onward. The policy includes specific targets for synthetic fuels like e-kerosene, which is still in early commercialization stages. A report by the NGO Transport & Environment notes there are 25 industrial projects aiming to produce 1.7 million tonnes of e-kerosene by 2030.

This target exceeds the 600,000-tonne target set by EU regulation. However, no major project has yet reached a final investment decision. This illustrates the ongoing uncertainties in the emerging market for SAF.",https://worldbiomarketinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mabanaft-begins-supplying-jet-fuel-and-SAF-at-Frankfurt-Airport--e1745853500300.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 11:57:13.629048

JetZero is creating an all-new aircraft that is capable of enhancing customer experience and fuel efficiency.

Investment in JetZero Z4

The investment forges a pathway for United Airlines to order up to 100 aircraft and more. The condition for the purchase is based on JetZero achieving development milestones, including a full flight demonstration in 2027. The aircraft must also meet the United States’ safety, business and operating standards.

JetZeros’ all-wing Z4 reduces drag and produces lift across the entire wingspan of the aircraft. Due to the fabulous design of the aircraft, it could lead to a 50% reduction in fuel burn per passenger-mile when compared to other aircraft of its size. The Z4 is designed to accommodate 250 passengers and fly on conventional jet fuel. Andrew Chang, Head of United Airlines Ventures (UAV), said:

If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.

He continues:

United Airlines Ventures® was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.

The aircraft is expected to fly at a higher altitude using less fuel. The design of the Z4 will greatly improve efficiency during operation. A flight from New York/Newark to Palma de Mallorca, Spain, would use 45% less fuel compared to the twin aisle aircraft currently operating the route. Tom O’Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero, said:

United’s investment in our company signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe.

BWC executives, customers, and partners attended the ribbon-cutting event in addition to special guest Josh Harder, a California congressman.

The state-of-the-art terminal includes the first newly constructed Marine Oil Terminal Engineering and Maintenance Standards (MOTEMS)-compliant dock built in California in nearly 30 years. It will play a vital role in advancing the renewable fuels supply chain across the state, BWC reported. It is designed to safely and efficiently transfer renewable diesel and biodiesel from marine vessels, supporting California’s efforts to decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors such as heavy-duty transportation.

We are also introducing a revenue certainty mechanism to help attract investment into UK SAF production.
Under the SAF revenue certainty mechanism, SAF producers will enter into a private law contract with a government-backed counterparty.
This government has made significant progress towards delivering the revenue certainty mechanism.
We announced that we will be introducing a revenue certainty mechanism bill in the first session of this Parliament in the King’s Speech and will have the legislation in place by the end of 2026 at the very latest.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is integral to reaching net zero aviation by 2050. It reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by around 70% on average over the lifecycle of its production and use when replacing fossil kerosene. It is also an enabler of growth, and can provide good, skilled jobs across the UK.

That is why this government has taken rapid action to support SAF. Just weeks into office, we reiterated our commitment to the SAF Mandate. In November (2024), we signed it into law, and it has been in place since January (2025).

The SAF Mandate is the UK’s key policy mechanism to secure demand for SAF. It delivers GHG emission savings by encouraging the use of SAF within the aviation industry. It does this by setting a legal obligation on fuel suppliers in the UK to supply an increasing proportion of SAF over time. Suppliers receive certificates for the SAF they supply. Certificates are issued in proportion to the level of GHG emission reductions that the fuel delivers. That is, the greater the savings, the greater number of certificates they receive. The SAF Mandate started at 2% of total UK jet fuel demand in 2025 and increases linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040. It could deliver up to 6.3 million tonnes of carbon savings per year by 2040.

We are also committed to developing the UK SAF industry to secure a UK supply of SAF, attract investment and create good green jobs across the UK.

In January, we announced an additional £63 million of funding for the Advanced Fuels Fund, our grant funding programme for UK SAF production, extending the programme for another year.

We are also introducing a revenue certainty mechanism to help attract investment into UK SAF production. Under the SAF revenue certainty mechanism, SAF producers will enter into a private law contract with a government-backed counterparty. These contracts will set a strike price for SAF: if producers sell their SAF for below the strike price, the counterparty makes payments of the difference; if the SAF is sold for above the strike price, the producer makes payments of the difference to the counterparty. This addresses the most significant constraint on investment in SAF production and sends a clear signal to investors: that this is a serious UK investment opportunity.

This government has made significant progress towards delivering the revenue certainty mechanism. We announced that we will be introducing a revenue certainty mechanism bill in the first session of this Parliament in the King’s Speech and will have the legislation in place by the end of 2026 at the very latest.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/668bb8ba7541f54efe51bb2d/heidi-alexander.jpeg,N,,2025-04-28 10:56:58.315031

The judge ruled that the municipality was within its rights to implement the advertising ban.
Finally, the court determined that the advertising ban does not breach European law.","The ban on fossil fuel-related advertising in the municipality of The Hague in The Netherlands will remain in force. This follows a ruling in summary proceedings by the District Court of The Hague. The travel industry had argued that the ban violated the Dutch Constitution and European legislation, but the judge ruled otherwise, rejecting the industry’s claims.

In September 2024, the city council of The Hague voted to introduce a ban on public space advertisements promoting fossil fuels, airline holidays, flight tickets, grey energy contracts, gas contracts, cruise holidays, and cars powered by fossil fuels or hybrid engines. The aim of the ban is to protect public health, reduce the negative impacts of climate change, and improve the environment. The ban came into effect on January 1, 2025, and enforcement is scheduled to begin after May 1, 2025.

The industry association ANVR and travel companies such as TUI, D-Reizen, and Prijsvrij.nl argued that the ban infringes upon the right to freedom of expression and breaches European regulations. They sought to have the ban suspended through court proceedings.

The court emphasized that municipalities have considerable discretion in adopting policies they deem beneficial for their citizens. These decisions are made democratically after debate within the city council, and civil courts must be cautious when intervening. Judicial intervention is only warranted when it is clear that the municipality has made an evidently wrongful or unlawful decision. In this case, the court found no such evidence.

The judge ruled that the municipality was within its rights to implement the advertising ban. The city sufficiently demonstrated that the measure would contribute to safeguarding the health of residents and visitors and help mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.

Furthermore, the court concluded that the ban does not violate the constitutional right to freedom of expression. Commercial advertising is not protected under freedom of expression in the same way as other forms of speech. The advertisements from the travel companies were deemed to be commercial in nature, intended to sell travel products for profit.

Finally, the court determined that the advertising ban does not breach European law. The same rules apply to both national and international businesses operating in The Hague, meaning there is no unlawful discrimination. Additionally, the judge pointed out that the travel industry remains free to advertise non-fossil-related travel options or promote their brand name and logo in public spaces. Advertising through other channels like radio, television, and the internet also remains unaffected.

As a result, the claims by the ANVR and the travel companies were dismissed.

Choosing Milestone Moments in your Mileage Plan account is free after you’ve qualified for them.
How To Earn Alaska Airlines EQMs Qualifying for Milestone Moments requires earning elite-qualifying miles.
Here are the current choices at each Milestone Moments threshold: Which Milestone Moments Should You Choose?
Final Thoughts Alaska Airlines added Milestone Rewards to its Mileage Plan program in 2025.","In 2025, Alaska Airlines got into the game of rewarding travelers with perks along their elite status journey. Rather than waiting until you reach the next tier to gain benefits, you can receive additional perks in between.

Dubbed “Milestone Moments,” these awards are available starting at 10,000 elite-qualifying miles (EQMs). That’s a relatively achievable threshold, and travelers don’t need to qualify for any levels of elite status before they can get extra benefits.

The best part about Milestone Moments is their customization, letting you choose the perk you like — or 2 perks you like, depending on which milestone you’ve reached.

Here’s everything you need to know about this new benefit for Mileage Plan flyers and the options you can choose from this year.

What Are Milestone Moments?

Alaska Airlines announced Milestone Moments along with its other loyalty program changes for 2025. Milestone Moments are perks that you can choose, starting at 10,000 elite-qualifying miles (EQMs for short) and available at 7 different thresholds as you earn more EQMs throughout the year.

Choosing Milestone Moments in your Mileage Plan account is free after you’ve qualified for them. However, you need to make your selection within 120 days.

Hot Tip:

Different perks have different expiration periods. However, if you choose to get elite status for a day, you would have up to a year to use the perk. According to a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines, it would be valid for 14 days from activation.

How To Earn Alaska Airlines EQMs

Qualifying for Milestone Moments requires earning elite-qualifying miles. Luckily, you can earn EQMs from more than just flying. Ways to collect EQMs include spending on a credit card, travel, shopping, and more.

These are the same EQMs that count toward earning Alaska Airlines’ elite status tiers, though you don’t need to reach any level of elite status to qualify for Milestone Moments. That’s because you need just 10,000 EQMs in a year to make your first milestone choice, though you need 20,000 EQMs to reach the lowest level of elite status: MVP.

Here are some of the ways to earn EQMs with Alaska Airlines:

Since Mileage Plan awards EQMs on flights according to flight distance, fare type, and where you purchased the ticket, you can check your earnings against this chart here.

Alaska Mileage Plan Milestone Moment Choices

You have options at each milestone. Some milestones provide just 1 choice, while others provide 2. Once you make a selection, your choice is final, so ensure you’re happy with it before confirming it.

Options include bonus miles, complimentary passes for inflight Wi-Fi, gifting elite status to others, and additional perks you may like. Here are the current choices at each Milestone Moments threshold:

Which Milestone Moments Should You Choose?

The value you assign to a Milestone Moment option is subjective, but it’s worth comparing them to see what you’re getting or giving up by not choosing a different item.

For reference, we value Alaska Airlines miles at 1.6 cents each. That makes 750 bonus miles worth $12, while 15,000 miles are worth $240. The same math applies to a discount on Mileage Plan Unlocked, for which you can redeem miles toward experiences and events. Getting a discount of 10,000 or 25,000 miles on these redemptions is worth $160 or $400, respectively.

Inflight Wi-Fi costs $8 on most of Alaska’s flights, while onboard meals cost between $8 and $12.50 if you don’t get a complimentary meal. A single-day visit to an Alaska Lounge costs $65.

Then there are choices that are harder to value. What’s the value you assign to moving into first class on a flight? Is it the cost difference of the ticket against the economy-class pricing, the cost of the food and drinks you consume, or some other number in between? The dollar value attached to upgrade awards may vary from person to person and flight to flight.

That same logic will apply to gifting or sampling elite status for a single trip. For an idea of the value differences, check out our comparison of MVP Gold 75K and MVP Gold 100K.

Then there are the milestones you probably shouldn’t choose. You can get rental car upgrades rather easily by holding the right credit card and matching your status across various programs. And you should consider the lounge membership discount carefully before choosing this option. It’s just a $100 discount on a membership that covers 9 lounges for a cost of $595 — so $495 with the discount.

If you’re flying long-distance with Alaska Airlines in first class (paid or booked with miles), with Alaska Airlines’ partners, or on military travel, you can access these lounges before departing without paying. You can also access the lounge if you have elite status with a Oneworld airline and are traveling beyond the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. However, that restriction doesn’t apply to those whose elite status comes from airlines other than Alaska and American Airlines, so British Airways Club members, for example, can access the lounges for free when flying in a premium cabin with a Oneworld airline regardless of destination.

As you consider the value of your options, consider both the tangible and intangible to see what value you’ll get from a benefit. Make sure to choose a perk that you’ll use and that you’ll be happy with. Remember that all choices are final.

Hot Tip:

There are other airport lounges you can visit. Memberships like Priority Pass can give you lounge access regardless of what airline you’re flying with that day. Check out our list of the best credit cards for gaining airport lounge access.

Final Thoughts

Alaska Airlines added Milestone Rewards to its Mileage Plan program in 2025. Similar to what we’ve seen with other airline and hotel loyalty programs, guests can earn choice benefits after certain thresholds are met during the year. Some options are clearly better than others, and it’s important that you clearly understand the perk and its value before making a selection, given that all choices are final.",https://upgradedpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Alaska-Airlines-planes-at-Santa-Rosa-STS-airport.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 09:56:34.494877

The U.S. ethanol industry faces mounting uncertainty as it tries to pivot into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel, made from ethanol, holds promise but several hurdles block rapid progress.

U.S. ethanol output reached 16.2 billion gallons in 2024, almost all from corn. Yet, rising electric vehicle use and falling gasoline demand threaten traditional ethanol markets. Export opportunities are also projected to shrink in 2025, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights.

The lack of an approved Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) pathway for converting corn ethanol to jet fuel is a major obstacle. Although a petition is pending, the Environmental Protection Agency’s review process is detailed and slow.

Biofuels must cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to a 2005 baseline to qualify for D4 RINs. Otherwise, they may only earn less-valuable D6 RINs.

LanzaJet is currently the only U.S. ATJ producer, using sugarcane ethanol imported from Brazil at its Georgia facility. “Soils have been a passion of mine, and I love to share it with others,” said Brandon Hall. However, LanzaJet’s model is facility-specific and cannot yet be adopted by other ethanol producers.

The 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit further complicates matters. Ethanol intended for SAF production earns less value compared to ethanol blended into gasoline, making pricing less competitive against petroleum-based jet fuel.

SAF production in early 2025 has been slow, with less than 30 million gallons produced. The Farmers First Fuel Incentive Act, if passed, would limit 45Z benefits to US-grown feedstocks, helping U.S. corn producers but challenging companies relying on imports.

Ethanol producers are ready to supply billions of gallons for SAF, aligning with national energy goals, but faster EPA approvals and stronger policies are essential for real progress.",,N,,2025-04-28 09:56:39.199942

Business travel has a huge environmental footprint, as anyone calculating their carbon footprint knows. But travelling to meet in person and attend trade shows can be seen as a non-negotiable part of doing business today. Although online meeting alternatives accelerated their evolution during COVID, many of us are back to our pre-2020 air miles.

It can be hard to see how to reduce what’s viewed as a vital part of doing business. And a reticence to face up to the carbon cost of travel can prevent companies even starting to look at their carbon footprints.

Will innovations in aviation save business travel, or must we all stop flying now?

The sustainable future of aviation

Christopher Surgenor, a key figure in the aviation industry’s move towards sustainability, will join us at greenloop. As the Programme Director for Aviation Carbon Events and the Editor and Publisher of GreenAir News, he is at the forefront of discussions and solutions aimed at reducing the sector’s carbon footprint. His expertise spans critical areas such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), carbon markets, and the overarching goal of decarbonizing the aviation industry.

Surgenor plays a leading role in convening global experts through events like the annual Aviation Carbon conference. This conference, scheduled for November 24-26, 2025, in London Heathrow, serves as a crucial platform for stakeholders to address the industry’s climate challenges, discuss pathways to meet emissions targets, and foster a transition towards a more sustainable future.

Around 2.4% of global CO2 emissions come from aviation. Together with other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry is responsible for around 5% of global warming. But, only 4% of the world’s population have flown internationally, and only 1% of people are frequent flyers.

However, the aviation industry has set ambitious targets for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and there is significant innovation around sustainable fuels, electric aircraft and flight operations.

Sustainable aviation fuel is primarily produced using two key technologies: Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK). These innovative technologies are revolutionizing the production of cleaner, more sustainable fuel options for aviation.

FT-SPK technology has emerged as a frontrunner in the SAF production space, allowing for the conversion of natural gas and other feedstocks into jet fuel that meets the high-performance standards of the aviation industry. This process enables the production of SAF with significantly lower carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuels. Similarly, HEFA-SPK technology, which converts biomass and waste oils into SAF, is gaining momentum as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. As these technologies continue to improve, they will make SAF production more efficient and cost-effective.

Another promising area is the development of power-to-liquid (PtL) fuel, which uses renewable electricity to convert carbon dioxide into liquid fuel. This innovation holds tremendous potential for reducing the carbon footprint of aviation and contributing to the sector's long-term sustainability goals. Gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel is also emerging as a viable solution for SAF production, with several projects underway to scale this technology and meet global demand.

The outlook for producing jet fuel from U.S. corn ethanol, known as alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), is increasingly uncertain. The biofuels sector faces challenges as on-road ethanol demand drops with more electric vehicles and declining gasoline use. In 2024, U.S. ethanol production hit a record 16.2 billion gallons, mostly from corn.

Finding new markets is difficult. Analysts from S&P Global Commodity Insights expect ethanol exports to decline in 2025. A major barrier is the lack of Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) pathways for making jet fuel from corn ethanol.

Currently, most Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) generates about 1.6 biomass-based diesel (D4) RINs per gallon, adding $1.68 in value based on April 2025 prices. However, corn ethanol lacks an approved RFS pathway.

EPA approvals are pending but complex, especially since corn-based ATJ must show a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases compared to 2005 petroleum baselines.

LanzaJet remains the only U.S. commercial ATJ facility operator, making SAF from Brazilian sugarcane ethanol. The company's approval is specific to its Georgia plant. “Soils have been a passion of mine, and I love to share it with others,” said Brandon Hall.

The math behind the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is another hurdle. Corn ethanol used for SAF misses out on valuable RINs and creates pricing challenges compared to petroleum jet fuel.

Early 2025 data show slow SAF production, under 30 million gallons in the first quarter. The Farmers First Fuel Incentive Act could help, by supporting US-grown feedstocks for 45Z credits.

While U.S. ethanol producers are eager to pivot to SAF and support national energy goals, clear pathways and supportive policies are urgently needed.

Currently in manufacture are the Falcon 2000LXS, the Falcon 900LX, the Falcon 6X, the Falcon 8X, and the new Falcon 10X, expected in 2027.","Dassault Aviation is a French aerospace company that has used its expertise to manufacture military and business jets over the last century. It is a company rich in heritage and tradition, known for the Falcon family. They used their cutting-edge technology and expertise in high-performance military aircraft to produce one of the first ever business jets.

Dassault is over 100 years old, and it's over 60 years since the first Falcon flight. Since then, 2700 models and 27 variants have been made. Of these, 2100 Falcons remain in service in 90 countries, including some of the original Falcon 20's, the very first business jets, according to Dassault's own publication, Above & Beyond. Especially well known, is the pioneering Falcon 900 business jet, that is still in demand today.

Founding Vision And Early Years

The Falcon business jet was the vision of Marcel Dassault, who wanted to build an aircraft that was technologically superior but with an elegant design. The Falcon story began with the Mystère 20, a twin-engine aircraft that was intended to be a military training jet but showed potential as a business jet. Aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh was impressed by the Mystère 20 and Pan American ordered 40 of the aircraft with an option for 120 more.

The aircraft was rebranded for the United States market as the Dassault Falcon 20. It became an immediate success and was seen as a workhorse aircraft with great versatility and performance. It was a design that was sleek and it had General Electric CF700 engines. Deliveries started in 1965 and it was Dassault's first entry into business aviation.

The Dassault Falcon 10 was then introduced in 1970. It was a smaller and lighter aircraft with Garrett TFE731 turbofan engines that produced 3,230 pounds of thrust. It was fast and efficient and had an excellent climb performance of around 4,600 feet per minute. Production ran from 1973 to 1989, with a total of 226 aircraft built.

Breakthrough Projects And Growth

The Falcon 50 was introduced in 1976. The first Falcon of a trijet configuration. It had greater range than the previous aircraft and a supercritical wing that enhanced performance. The advanced airfoil reduced drag at high speed. It was promoted as an aircraft that could be used across continents and across ocean flights. The Falcon 50 was pivotal in Dassault's success as a business jet manufacturer.

There was still demand for longer-range aircraft, so Dassault introduced the Falcon 900 in 1984. This was another trijet that had a wider and longer fuselage. It was a clean sheet design and built with composite materials and used advanced digital design. The Falcon 900 was pioneering in the development process as it used CAD (computer-aided design). This allowed for greater precision, efficiency, and the best optimization of the aircraft's structure and aerodynamics.

The Falcon 900 was the flagship aircraft for Dassault and the airframe design incorporates composite materials.. Later variants included the transatlantic Falcon 900LR, the Falcon 900B, the Falcon 900EX, and the Falcon 900LX. The variants all had extended range and more advanced avionics. Still in production today, the aircraft is evidently popular with private owners, governments and businesses alike.

Continued Innovation

The Falcon 2000 flew in 1993. It was a twin-engine version of the Falcon 900 but with a shorter fuselage and a shorter range. It was the first executive aircraft to be designed entirely on a computer and focused on efficiency and comfort. Dassault's skill of combining digital design and modern engineering created an optimized and efficient airframe. Variants include the Falcon 2000EX, the Falcon 2000DX, and the currently produced Falcon 2000LXS. The Falcon 2000EX was the first aircraft to have the EASy avionics suite including synthetic vision and was the first Dassault twinjet to take steep approach trials at London City Airport.

Onwards into the 2000s, the Falcon 7X trijet was introduced in 2001 and entered service in 2007. It represented a new era in business jets, with fully digital fly-by-wire controls taken from Dassault's Rafale fighter jet program. It is a long-range aircraft with a range of 5,950 nautical miles with a spacious cabin. The aircraft is powered by Pratt and Whitney Canada PW307A engines. It has a new high-speed wing and a longer fuselage than the Falcon 900 and was the first Falcon aircraft to have winglets.

The Falcon 8X is based on the Falcon 7X but has more range and was introduced in 2016. It is an ultra-long-range aircraft with a range of 6,450 nautical miles (11,945 km) at Mach 0.80 with 8 passengers and 3 crew. However, it can reach a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.90 (approximately 690 mph or 1,111 km/h). The Falcon 8X is powered by three Pratt & Whitney Canada PW307D turbofan engines, each providing 6,722 pounds of thrust. These engines offer improved fuel efficiency compared to the Falcon 7X.

Modern Era Programs

This was continued later with the Falcon 6X, which entered service in 2023. It has the tallest and widest cabin in its class and is focused on comfort, efficiency, and performance. The aircraft is powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada PW812D engines that produce around 14,000 pounds of thrust. This gives it excellent performance and a range of 5,500 nautical miles (10,186 km). The Falcon 6X can reach a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.90 (approximately 690 mph or 956 km/h).

The Falcon 10X will be the largest and most advanced Falcon aircraft to date. It has a large and spacious cabin and has been nicknamed an 'apartment in the sky' due to its luxurious yet functional design. t boasts the largest cabin cross-section of any purpose-built business jet and has customizable configurations, allowing for a master bedroom and en suite with a shower. The aircraft has Rolls-Royce Pearl 10X engines and a range of 7,500 nautical miles, so could fly from Los Angeles to Sydney without the need to refuel. It was originally scheduled to enter service in 2025 but due to supply chain issues, it has been rescheduled for delivery in 2027. The Falcon 10X should redefine the top end of the business jet market and will no doubt be a success.

Dassault Aviation has created more than 100 prototypes in the last century and has delivered over 10,000 aircraft to 90 countries. They have over 1,000 military aircraft in service and over 2,150 Falcon jets still in service across the world. The company has approximately 14,600 employees, of which 77% are employed in France. They have a strong global presence and are supported worldwide by a network of service and support facilities.

Leadership, Culture, And Industry Influence

Dassault Aviation was founded by Marcel Bloch in 1929 as Société des Avions Marcel Bloch and adopted the name of Dassault in 1947. In 1971, Dassault acquired Breguet and the company became Avions Marcel Dassault-Breguet Aviation. In 1990, the company changed its name to Dassault Aviation and became a subsidiary of the Dassault Group. Éric Trappier has been the chairman and CEO and headed the company since 2013 and its headquarters are in Paris, France.

Dassault Aviation is the only European company to produce both military aircraft and business jets. The company places a strong emphasis on research and development and invests significantly in these areas. They have been pioneers in adopting 3D modeling and are leaders in CAD/CAM/CAE and product lifecycle management software. Dassault has always been innovative, as can be seen in their continuous development of advanced technology. They are indeed pivotal when it comes to aerospace research and development and continue to shape the future of both military and civil aviation.

Currently, Dassault Aviation has a strong focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) compatibility and reducing CO2 emissions in aviation. Their Falcon fleet is already certified to fly with SAF blends with 50% non-fossil fuel. SAF fuel, over its life cycle, emits 80-90% less CO2 than fossil kerosene. They are also developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to boost performance and safety, but at the same time, ensuring humans are at the heart of the decision-making process.

The Legacy Of Dassault Aviation: Past, Present, And Future

Dassault Aviation has always integrated the latest technology from their development of military aircraft into the Falcon family. This includes the fly-by-wire systems and the use of composite materials, as well as avionics such as the EASy (Enhanced Avionics Systems) cockpit that was built on Honeywell's Primus Epic system.

Dassault has always met the demand for larger, longer-range business jets and always listened to their customers. They have always shown a strong emphasis on fuel efficiency and are committed to creating comfortable, luxurious, and functional cabins. Dassault continues a long legacy of innovation, performance, and elegant design of business jets.

The Falcon jet family continues to grow and innovate whilst pushing boundaries. It's no wonder that Dassault and the Falcon family are one of the front-runners in business aviation.

The project is part of NTPC Green Energy’s green hydrogen hub project at Pudimadaka in Andhra Pradesh – a 1,200 acre facility that will produce green chemicals using sustainable manufacturing methods.
“This partnership … supports our goal of reaching a renewable energy capacity of 60 GW by 2032,” said NTPC in a statement.
At a startup cost of approximately $21.6bn, the hub will initially develop 20 GW of renewable energy projects and produce 1,500 tonnes per day of green hydrogen and 7,500 tonnes per day of green methanol, green urea and SAF.
India has also set a target of producing five million metric tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030, alongside decarbonisation initiatives such as achieving Net Zero emissions for Indian Railways.","Renewable energy specialist NTPC Green Energy has partnered with the gas processing technology licensor Honeywell UOP India to explore production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in India.

Under a memorandum of understanding signed on 25 April, the partners will assess how Honeywell’s eFining technology can produce SAF using green hydrogen and carbon dioxide captured from power plants operated by NTPC, which is India’s largest power utility company and the parent company of NTPC Green Energy.

The project is part of NTPC Green Energy’s green hydrogen hub project at Pudimadaka in Andhra Pradesh – a 1,200 acre facility that will produce green chemicals using sustainable manufacturing methods.

The company aims to complete the first hub by 2027 and most of the second one by 2032.

“This partnership … supports our goal of reaching a renewable energy capacity of 60 GW by 2032,” said NTPC in a statement.

At a startup cost of approximately $21.6bn, the hub will initially develop 20 GW of renewable energy projects and produce 1,500 tonnes per day of green hydrogen and 7,500 tonnes per day of green methanol, green urea and SAF.

The project will go towards India’s stated goal of 500 GW of non-fossil energy capacity by 2030, as laid out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year.

“The coming two decades are extremely crucial for India, and in the next five years we are set to achieve several major milestones,” he said.

Ein wichtiger Meilenstein war die erfolgreiche Einführung von im Inland hergestelltem SAF durch EVA Air am 23.
EVA Air hat in den letzten Jahren große Fortschritte in Sachen Nachhaltigkeit gemacht.
Mit Blick auf die Zukunft wird EVA Air den Einsatz von SAF weiter ausbauen und sich aktiv an globalen Nachhaltigkeitsinitiativen beteiligen.","„Nachhaltige Entwicklung ist heute nicht nur eine Wahl, sondern eine Verantwortung“, sagte EVA Air-Präsident Clay Sun. „Unsere bilateralen Kooperationen mit AEG FUELS, COSMO und Formosa Petrochemical Corporation spiegeln unser Engagement für Netto-Null-Emissionen wider. Durch die aktive Einführung von SAF in unserem gesamten globalen Netzwerk reduzieren wir unseren betrieblichen Kohlenstoff-Fußabdruck und fördern den Wandel und das Wachstum in der gesamten Lieferkette der Luftfahrt.“

Mit den weltweiten Bemühungen bis 2050 Netto-Null-Emissionen zu erreichen, gilt SAF als eine der vielversprechendsten Lösungen der Luftfahrtindustrie zur Kohlenstoffreduzierung. EVA Air hält sich an die SAF-Versorgungspolitik der Europäischen Union (EU) und fliegt seit dem ersten Quartal dieses Jahres auf allen Flügen ab Europa mit einer 2%igen SAF-Beimischung. Die neuen Vereinbarungen markieren die nächste Phase der Nachhaltigkeitsreise von EVA Air, die ab dem zweiten Quartal 2025 unabhängig und regelmäßig SAF an wichtigen Drehkreuzen in Nordamerika, Japan und Taiwan einführen wird. Diese Maßnahmen zielen darauf ab, die Flugemissionen erheblich zu senken und den Grundstein für eine breitere Einführung von SAF zu legen.

EVA Air arbeitet mit drei wichtigen Lieferanten zusammen. AEG FUELS ist ein weltweit anerkannter Anbieter von Flugkraftstoff mit einem umfangreichen und zuverlässigen internationalen Logistiknetz. COSMO, eines der führenden Energieunternehmen Japans, wird SAF in der Region Kansai liefern, wo die Osaka-Kansai Japan Expo bis zum 13. Oktober 2025 stattfindet. Die Formosa Petrochemical Corporation ist das erste Unternehmen in Taiwan, das SAF aus eigener Produktion liefert und damit die Widerstandsfähigkeit der lokalen Lieferkette stärkt. Durch diese Kooperationen wird die Flexibilität der Treibstoffversorgung von EVA Air gestärkt, der Einsatz von SAF im gesamten asiatisch-pazifischen Raum ausgeweitet und die nachhaltige Umstellung von Flugkraftstoff in der Region beschleunigt.

Ein wichtiger Meilenstein war die erfolgreiche Einführung von im Inland hergestelltem SAF durch EVA Air am 23. April 2025 im Rahmen des Pilotprogramms der Civil Aviation Administration zur Verwendung von SAF. Der Kraftstoff wurde auf zwei internationalen Flügen beigemischt: BR156 vom Flughafen Taipei Songshan zum internationalen Flughafen Seoul Gimpo und BR148 vom internationalen Flughafen Kaohsiung zum internationalen Flughafen Kansai in Japan. Dies markiert den offiziellen Start der SAF-Anwendung auf Taiwans lokalen Flughäfen.

EVA Air hat in den letzten Jahren große Fortschritte in Sachen Nachhaltigkeit gemacht. Im Umweltbereich hat die Fluggesellschaft zahlreiche Initiativen zur Energieeinsparung und Kohlenstoffreduzierung umgesetzt, darunter die Modernisierung der Flotte, der Einsatz treibstoffeffizienter Flugzeuge der neuen Generation, wie der Boeing 787 und des Airbus A350-1000, und die Optimierung der Flugrouten, um den Treibstoffverbrauch und die Emissionen zu reduzieren.

Mit Blick auf die Zukunft wird EVA Air den Einsatz von SAF weiter ausbauen und sich aktiv an globalen Nachhaltigkeitsinitiativen beteiligen. Die Fluggesellschaft will auch die Zusammenarbeit mit Partnern und Partnerinnen verstärken, um gemeinsam eine neue Ära der nachhaltigen Luftfahrt einzuleiten.

""Das von der ADAC Luftrettung initiierte und finanzierte Forschungsprojekt wurde in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Deutschen Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR), den Triebwerksherstellern Safran Helicopter Engines aus Frankreich und RTX’s Pratt & Whitney Canada sowie dem Hubschrauberhersteller Airbus Helicopters durchgeführt.

Die Erkenntnisse für die Projektverantwortlichen und Forschenden: Wenn SAF-Blend statt reinen Kerosins verbrannt wird, sinken bei einer Leistung, wie sie typischerweise vor dem Start am Boden erbracht wird (Idle), die Emissionen ultrafeiner Partikel um 44 Prozent, bei einer Leistung wie beim Fliegen in Einsatzgeschwindigkeit (Cruise) um 33 Prozent. Zusätzlich sinkt der CO2-Ausstoß über den Lebenszyklus des Flugkraftstoffs von der Herstellung bis zur Verbrennung, weil die wiederverwendeten Fette und Öle CO2-neutral sind und die CO2-lastigen fossilen Bestandteile ersetzen.

Während bei den ultrafeinen Partikeln signifikante Unterschiede messbar waren, wurden bei den Verbrennungsgasen Kohlendioxid (CO2), Kohlenmonoxid (CO) und Stickoxid (NOx), einem Indikator für die reibungslose Funktion der Triebwerke, keine Veränderungen nachgewiesen.

Parallel dazu untersuchten die Triebwerkshersteller regelmäßig ihre eigene Technik in den beiden Helikoptern vom Typ Airbus H145 („Christoph Rheinland“ mit Safran-Triebwerken) und Airbus H135 („Christoph Europa 1“ mit Pratt-&-Whitney-Triebwerken). Verglichen mit dem Verschleiß beim Verbrennen von herkömmlichem Kerosin konnten sie keine relevanten Unterschiede feststellen.

Une phase de concertation préalable réglementaire auprès du public va débuter lundi 28 avril pour se terminer le 20 juin. Le calendrier prévisionnel avance une mise en service pour 2030. On fait le point sur les caractéristiques et les objectifs de cette nouvelle usine.

À quoi cette usine va-t-elle servir?

Le projet H2V Thionville prévoit la création d’une unité de production d’hydrogène vert par électrolyse de l’eau, d’une capacité de 200 mW, ainsi qu’une autre dédiée à la production de carburants de synthèse, autrement appelés e-méthanol. L’objectif chiffré est d’arriver, à terme, à une production annuelle de 30.000 tonnes d’hydrogène vert, ayant pour but d’engendrer la création de 150.000 tonnes par an d’e-méthanol.

Cet hydrogène vert sera ensuite expédié vers le réseau de stations de distribution d’hydrogène présentes sur le territoire concerné par le projet. Le coût total du projet est estimé à 800 millions d’euros. Celui-ci visera à créer 140 emplois, dont 80 directs. RTE va gérer le raccordement électrique par une liaison souterraine de 225.000 volts.

De telles réalisations sont également en cours d’élaboration sur trois autres pôles industriels français: Dunkerque, Fos-sur-Mer et Le Havre. L’endroit n’a d’ailleurs pas été choisi au hasard pour la Moselle: «Le territoire est un emplacement absolument stratégique, avec la proximité du Luxembourg et de l’Allemagne, pour mener d’importants projets de décarbonation», selon Alexis Martinez, directeur général d’H2V.

Il estime que le Luxembourg aura besoin, à terme, de la présence de ces unités à proximité de son territoire pour décarboner son industrie dans les décennies à venir.

La mise en service de H2V Thionville vise également à répondre à des défis d’utilisation de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, ou ‘’carburant d’aviation durable’’) et de e-SAF (ou ‘’e-kérosène’’).

La part d’utilisation de SAF et d’e-SAF doit en effet se conformer à des objectifs de plus en plus importants au fil des années. De 2% de SAF en 2025, cette portion doit passer à 70% d’ici 2050, dont 35% d’e-SAF. L’e-méthanol produit à Thionville sera quant à lui acheminé vers les sites de Dunkerque et du Havre, qui se concentrent uniquement sur l’hydrogène vert, et pourrait également servir à alimenter Fos-sur-Mer, qui produira déjà de l’e-SAF.

Pour Rémy Dick, vice-président de la communauté d’agglomération du Val de Fensch, «ce projet va permettre la reconversion d’une friche industrielle du territoire et d’implanter un nouveau type d’industrie», dans un contexte où de nombreuses suppressions de postes sont attendues au niveau du site ArcelorMittal de Florange, la ville dont il est également maire.

Quel est le calendrier prévisionnel du projet?

Le calendrier prévisionnel de cet ensemble a été présenté à l’occasion de la conférence de presse de ce vendredi. Il se décompose en huit temps, de la concertation préalable à la mise en service:

La concertation préalable: d’avril à juin 2025

Le dépôt des dossiers par H2V, incluant les demandes d’autorisation environnementale et de permis de construire: fin 2026

En parallèle, puisque le projet doit faire l’objet d’une autorisation environnementale spécifique, une étude d’impact est en cours pour analyser les conséquences d’une telle installation sur l’environnement.

À noter que le site sera classé Seveso seuil bas. «Ce qui ne veut pas dire que tout risque d’exploser à tout instant, c’est une classification réglementaire», nuance Jean-Charles Louis, président du syndicat mixte E-LOG’IN 4 et vice-président de la communauté d’agglomération Portes de France-Thionville chargé du développement des zones d’activité.

Où en sont les trois autres projets de H2V?

Le projet H2V Thionville ne saurait exister ni se pérenniser sans les trois autres, tous en cours de développement, dans trois places fortes de l’industrie maritime française.

H2V Normandy, le site normand qui sera dédié à la production d’hydrogène vert à Saint-Jean-de-Folleville, près du Havre, est le premier à avoir obtenu les autorisations et le permis de construire. Sa mise en service est prévue pour 2026.

En ce qui concerne celui de Dunkerque, également centré sur la production d’hydrogène vert, son avenir est plus incertain. Bien que les autorisations préfectorales et les permis de construire aient été obtenus il y a déjà plusieurs années, ArcelorMittal a annoncé fin 2024 le report de sa collaboration dans le cadre de son projet d’acier décarboné. Pour le moment, le dossier ne semble pas avoir avancé, alors que la mise en service était initialement prévue pour 2027.

Enfin, la concertation préalable pour H2V Marseille-Fos s’est achevée en décembre 2023. Les permis de construire et l’autorisation environnementale devraient être délivrés cette année. La mise en service est espérée pour 2029. Ce site intégrera une production d’hydrogène vert, mais aussi d’e-méthanol et d’e-kérosène.

Comment va se dérouler la concertation préalable?

Tout comme le calendrier prévisionnel du projet, la concertation préalable sera divisée en huit temps d’échange:

Une réunion publique d’ouverture au Digital Lab d’ArcelorMittal à Uckange, mardi 29 avril à 18h,

Un «débat-mobile» au centre commercial E. Leclerc de Fameck, mercredi 30 avril au matin,

Une réunion thématique à l’IUT de Thionville-Yutz, jeudi 15 mai à 18h,

Un «débat-mobile» au marché de Thionville, mardi 20 mai au matin,

Une réunion thématique à la salle des fêtes Le Diapason à Uckange, mardi 20 mai à 18h,

Un atelier thématique à la salle du Casino à Thionville, mardi 3 juin à 18h,

Un atelier thématique à la salle Pablo-Neruda à Guénange, mercredi 11 juin à 18h,

Une réunion publique de clôture à la salle Aubépine de Florange, jeudi 19 juin à 18h.

The Fuel Store is an immersive concept store by AirCo, a Brooklyn-based startup that turns captured CO2 and hydrogen into synthetic fuels.
Previously called Air Company, AirCo has turned captured CO2 into all sorts of consumer products, including vodka, hand sanitizer, and perfume, since it was founded in 2017.
In April, AirCo fuel partnered with the Air Force for the first-ever unmanned flight powered by CO2-derived jet fuel.
The Fuel Store will be open to the public from April 30th to May 3rd at 55 Great Jones Street, New York.","In the lower Manhattan neighborhood of NoHo, the crowded area around Lafayette Street was once called Gasoline Alley because of the many auto shops and gas stations housed there. While New York is still crowded with cars, gas stations in Manhattan are now more rare (there are none today in Gasoline Alley, only one left in all of lower Manhattan.) But off of Lafayette, there’s a new kind of space-inspired gas station that reveals the future of fuel—a future in which we power vehicles across land, air, and sea with CO2 instead of fossil fuels.

The Fuel Store is an immersive concept store by AirCo, a Brooklyn-based startup that turns captured CO2 and hydrogen into synthetic fuels. Most people don’t think about their fuel all that much, or don’t know that there are options other than fossil-fuel derived gas. The Fuel Store is meant to introduce people to AirCo’s technology, and paint a possible future where CO2 powers everything from motocross bikes to jets to spaceships.

Previously called Air Company, AirCo has turned captured CO2 into all sorts of consumer products, including vodka, hand sanitizer, and perfume, since it was founded in 2017. In 2024, AirCo raised $69 million in a Series B round, and the company also has a $65 million contract with the Department of Defense; its raised over $100 million in total, according to Pitchbook. With just under 120 employees, it’s lab and R&D operations are located in Brooklyn.

Recently its been focusing on fuel, because that’s an industry where it can have substantial impact. “It’s one of the hardest industries traditionally to decarbonize,” says cofounder and CEO Gregory Constantine. Transportation is the largest contributor to the U.S.’s greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 28% of all direct emissions. Globally, aviation alone counts for 2% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions.

AirCo instead uses CO2—a greenhouse gas—as a feedstock. It combines that CO2 with hydrogen to create fuels through a process that runs on renewable energy. Though AirCo declined to share how much CO2-derived fuel it currently produces, it does have partnerships with multiple companies for the use of its sustainable aviation fuel, called Airmade. In 2022, JetBlue signed an intent to purchase 25 million gallons of Airmade over five years, and Virgin Atlantic signed an intent to purchase up to 100 million gallons over 10 years. The company has also has partnerships with Boom Supersonic, and the U.S. Department of Defense. For the government, AirCo has worked on projects for land, air, and sea transportation.

The Fuel Store showcases these different developments. When you first walk in, you see a shiny chrome gas station in the center of the room—an AirCo branded awning over sleek, futuristic pumps. A motocross bike is attached to one pump, meant to represent the freedom to “roam,” just like how AirCo’s fuels can be made either in remote locations or in cities. Along the walls are a series of products designed to tell different aspects of AirCo’s story, and the future of fuel the company envisions.

On one shelf are hard-shell suitcases decorated with modern travel stickers, one of which reads, “My plane is on an air-based diet.” The climate impact of transportation has led to some “travel shaming,” Constantine says, but he adds that travel is a part of life. Through its work making sustainable aviation, AirCo is making travel less objectionable, he says.

Next to the suitcases are vintage Air Force bomber jackets, adorned with new AirCo patches. In April, AirCo fuel partnered with the Air Force for the first-ever unmanned flight powered by CO2-derived jet fuel. AirCo’s synthetic fuels are 100% compatible with current aircrafts, unlike hydrogen, which requires new engine designs.

On the other side of the store are life vests made of recycled signal flags, a nod to the company’s successful tests with the Navy to use Airmade for marine vessels. (These tests powered boats while also emitting less visible smoke in the exhaust.) The signal flags themselves mean “urgent” and “full speed,” echoing the company’s perspective on its mission to decarbonize fuel. Above the life vests are dry bags made from upcycled sails, an ode to how sailboats, powered by air, were once the dominant form of sea travel—and how air, through AirCo’s CO2 fuel, could power future marine vessels.

Objects like the motocross bike, a mini toy AirCo fuel truck, and vintage Army T-shirts screen-printed with an image of a Polaris MRZR tactical vehicle—which AirCo successfully powered with its CO2-derived fuel through tests at West Point—showcase AirCo’s fuel use on land.

And finally, the Fuel Store also hints at AirCo going into space. One wall features a conceptual Mars helmet and workwear suit. These imagine a future where the red planet’s atmosphere—which is 95% CO2—could be harvested to power spacecrafts, rovers, and habitats. AirCo also has a long-running partnership with NASA.

“A lot of the work that we do with groups like NASA is to try to prove out that we can produce a fuel not only here on Earth made from CO2 but potentially, in the long-term future, up on Mars, so that we can bring astronauts back,” Constantine says. AirCo also created bacon, egg, and cheese space food, a nod to the classic New York City sandwich and the company’s home base.

Each of these products has tags that explain their connection to AirCo’s larger story. Though these items won’t be for sale at the Fuel Store, they will be available via auction online after the concept store’s run is over. That auction will help fund AirCo’s research and development. Visitors will be able to purchase AirCo merch like T-shirts, socks, and some of the stickers that appear on the luggage (including ones that read “honk if you love unlimited feedstocks” and “Make love, not CO2”).

The Fuel Store will be open to the public from April 30th to May 3rd at 55 Great Jones Street, New York. Constantine hopes the concept store is able to shed light on AirCo’s technology, and the hopeful future it envisions.

“Educating people about the future is a tricky challenge, but it can be an inspirational one,” he says. The origins of fuel, and these new technologies like fuel made of CO2, can be foreign to people, but the store puts them in an immersive world full of that technology’s use cases. “What we’ve tried to do here,” Constantine adds, “ is to show what the future can look like in a way that others haven’t been able to do.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/04/13-91323803-futuristic-gas-station.jpg",N,,2025-04-28 06:56:28.754867

Working in collaboration with emergency medical services operator ADAC Luftrettung, Germany’s DLR aerospace research centre sought to examine the combustion behaviour and performance of the SAF blend, with a focus on the emissions of ultrafine particles and gases, including carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

During the trial, ADAC conducted 1,800 flight hours using a pair of Airbus Helicopters H145s, powered by kerosene and biofuel made from used cooking oil in concentrations of up to 38%.

Researchers from the DLR’s Institute of Combustion Technology supported the evaluations with six ground-based measurement campaigns using its mobile measurement laboratory at Bonn-Hangelar airfield after the end of each helicopter’s shift.

This, says DLR researcher Tobias Grein, contains instruments “capable of detecting ultrafine particles as small as seven nanometres”.

Results showed the engines running on the SAF blend emitted significantly fewer ultrafine particles (UFPs) compared with pure kerosene, says the DLR.

No notable changes were found to the exhaust gases, it adds, “demonstrating that the engines run smoothly and reliably with the SAF blend”.

Hailing the success of the “first-of-its-kind” campaign, Grein adds: “These measurements were particularly exciting, and it was a unique experience for our team to conduct them ‘live’ on a helicopter just prior to take-off.”

Collecting the measurements required a “delicate touch” from the pilot, applying the throttle on the ground as if preparing for take-off − without actually leaving the ground.

ADAC says it will now expand its research and development activities with alternative fuels, increasing the percentage of SAF in the blend.

“Our long-term goal is to significantly advance the decarbonisation of aviation, including in the emergency services sector,” says Frederic Bruder, ADAC managing director.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/5/2/6/109526_adactestingcdlr_794136.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 06:56:33.763076

EVA Air has made many changes over the past few years to protect the environment.","EVA Air has signed agreements with three major suppliers to buy Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as part of its effort to reduce pollution from its flights. The suppliers are Associated Energy Group (AEG FUELS) from the United States, COSMO Oil Marketing Company from Japan, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation from Taiwan.

EVA Air President Clay Sun said that protecting the environment is a responsibility, not just a choice. He explained that working with these three companies shows the airline’s strong commitment to cutting carbon emissions. By bringing in SAF at its airports in North America, Japan, and Taiwan starting in the second quarter of 2025, EVA Air hopes to lower its impact on the environment and push the aviation industry toward greener practices.

The airline already meets European Union rules that require SAF to be used on flights from Europe. Since early 2025, all EVA Air flights leaving Europe have been using a small amount of SAF mixed with regular jet fuel. The new agreements will now allow the airline to use SAF more widely around the world.

Each supplier will play an important role. AEG FUELS is a well-known supplier that can support EVA Air in many locations. COSMO will supply SAF in the Kansai area of Japan, which is important because the Osaka-Kansai Expo will take place there until October 2025. Formosa Petrochemical Corporation is the first company in Taiwan to produce SAF locally, which will strengthen Taiwan’s ability to supply fuel without depending on other countries.

On April 23, 2025, EVA Air took an important step by using Taiwan-made SAF for the first time on two international flights: one from Taipei Songshan Airport to Seoul’s Gimpo International Airport, and another from Kaohsiung International Airport to Kansai International Airport in Japan. This was part of a government pilot programme and showed that Taiwan’s own SAF production is ready for real use.

EVA Air has made many changes over the past few years to protect the environment. It has bought newer, more fuel-efficient planes like the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-1000 and improved flight routes to use less fuel.

The airline says it will continue to increase its use of SAF and work with others to create a more environmentally friendly future for air travel.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 08:56:47.726346

The pharmaceutical sector is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, producing 55% more CO₂ per million dollars of revenue than the automotive industry. As a world-leading Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), PCI Pharma Services supports 200 clinical trial protocols annually across more than 100 countries. Our Storage, Distribution, and Returns services rely extensively on depot storage facilities and a combination of ground and air transportation, provided through one of our strategic partners, Marken, UPS Healthcare Precision Logistics, to ensure the timely and secure delivery of life-saving medications worldwide.

The Challenge

PCI Pharma Services has committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions intensity by 25% by 2030, a target pending validation from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). Achieving this ambitious goal necessitated the identification of a cost-effective emissions reduction strategy for our specialized shipping and logistics operations; one that would maintain the highest standards of quality and operational efficiency.

The Solution: Green Investment Pilot

To address this challenge, PCI partnered with Marken to participate in its three-month Green Investment Pilot. This initiative sought to generate measurable and cost-effective reductions in carbon emissions while maintaining uninterrupted service. The pilot prioritized the integration of sustainable fuels, such as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) for ground transportation and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for air transport, alongside renewable energy adoption for warehouse operations.

Framework of the Green Investment Pilot

Marken designed the pilot to streamline and incentivize corporate investment in emissions reduction through a book-and-claim system. This approach ensured immediate carbon capture recognition upon processing, aligned with the Smart Freight Centre’s (SFC) Market-Based Balance Model (MBBM) framework. The initiative also fostered supplier partnerships to improve long-term biofuel accessibility and drive demand. To ensure data integrity and procedural transparency, Marken collaborated with an SFC-accredited emissions calculation provider and an independent audit firm for validation across both air and ground transport modalities.

“Reducing supply chain emissions in pursuit of our joint climate goals requires close collaboration, and flexible, cost-effective solutions that don’t disrupt operations. At Marken, we are grateful to work with ambitious partners like PCI Pharma Services, proving that together, real and scalable impact is possible.” — Sandra Voss, Director, Global Sustainability, Marken, UPS Healthcare Precision Logistics

PCI’s Role in the Pilot

As a participant in the Green Investment Pilot, PCI:

Identified High-Impact Sites: We selected three high-volume sites in the UK and the US to maximize the potential benefits of the initiative.

Seamless Integration: As an established Marken partner, PCI leveraged existing account numbers for streamlined emissions tracking and billing.

Tailored Investment Strategy: We set investment levels on an account basis, applying them at the shipment level to align with actual fuel consumption.

The pilot aimed to assess whether a minimum standard investment rate of 0.5% of invoiced services could yield up to an 8% reduction in carbon emissions across all participating accounts. Marken’s operational teams facilitated this by utilizing a network of certified, second-generation biofuels for air and ground transportation.

Outcomes and Impact

The pilot successfully reduced over 150 metric tons of carbon emissions across all participants, with PCI alone achieving a total reduction of 13.9 metric tons. With minimal financial investment, PCI realized an absolute emissions reduction of over 18% across specialty clinical shipments, primarily driven by SAF utilization.

Beyond carbon reductions, the pilot demonstrated significant operational and strategic benefits:

Effortless Implementation: The initiative required no operational disruptions, serving as an all-in-one solution to reduce Scope 3 emissions.

Alignment with Sustainability Targets: Marken’s annual emissions reductions align with SBTi criteria, enhancing PCI’s ability to report progress on its sustainability commitments.

Regulatory Compliance Risk Mitigation: The initiative supports compliance with global and local emission reduction regulations, reducing future regulatory risks.

Industry-Wide Decarbonization Support: By participating in this initiative, PCI contributed to accelerating decarbonization efforts within the logistics sector.

Looking Ahead

Tim Hansen, ESG Director at PCI Pharma Services, remarked: “The pilot seamlessly integrated into our operations and provided a cost-effective approach to reducing emissions within our supply chain. Marken proved to be a highly reliable partner throughout the program, and the results have surpassed our expectations. We eagerly anticipate expanding our collaboration in the future.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/RYyQR6koz95R8FULpriYhg3jve3XmUtpMESxeV8LwJ8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9pU3RvY2stMTQ4ODMwMjAzOF8zNDA0LTIwMDB3aWRlLnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-04-28 05:56:16.477686

Focus: Aviation, energy, climate-compatible flying, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), bio-kerosene, measurement technology

The German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR) has partnered with the non-profit organisation ADAC Luftrettung – the German air rescue service – to conduct a pioneering research campaign examining the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in rescue helicopters. For the trial, two ADAC Luftrettung helicopters completed over 1800 flight hours using a blend of conventional kerosene and SAF. The blend contained up to 38 percent SAF produced from recycled vegetable or animal fats, such as used cooking oil. Researchers from the DLR Institute of Combustion Technology supported the long-term trial with a total of six ground-based measurement campaigns. They examined the combustion behaviour and performance of the SAF blend, with a particular focus on analysing the emissions of ultrafine particles and gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ).

DLR measurements showed that engines running on the SAF blend emitted significantly fewer ultrafine particles (UFPs) – commonly known as soot – compared to pure kerosene. During idle operation shortly before take-off, when rotor speeds are already high, researchers recorded a 44 percent reduction in UFPs. At engine power levels typical for cruising flight, particle emissions were 33 percent lower. The DLR team also found no notable changes in exhaust gases, demonstrating that the engines run smoothly and reliably with the SAF blend.

SAFs are an important step towards more climate-compatible aviation. These innovative fuels can be engineered to produce significantly fewer soot particles when burned, benefiting both the environment and the climate. In addition, the carbon dioxide released during combustion originates from renewable sources, such as plants and animals, which took in carbon dioxide during their lifetimes. This means net carbon dioxide emissions over the fuel's entire lifecycle are also substantially reduced.

Using DLR expertise to track even the tiniest particles

""For this first-of-its-kind measurement campaign, we deployed our mobile DLR measurement lab, which contains highly specialised measurement and analysis instruments capable of detecting ultrafine particles as small as seven nanometres,"" explains DLR researcher Tobias Grein, who oversaw the project. ""Before each measurement campaign we develop a tailored approach, carefully determining the setup, the position of the measuring probe and the duration of each measurement. This meticulous preparation ensures reliable and comparable data"". Tobias concludes: ""These measurements were particularly exciting, and it was a unique experience for our team to conduct them 'live' on a helicopter just prior to takeoff.""

""Following these promising first results, we aim to expand our research and development activities in this field and increase the SAF content,"" explains Frédéric Bruder, Managing Director of ADAC Luftrettung. ""Our long-term goal is to significantly advance the decarbonisation of aviation, including in the emergency services sector. Scientific partners like DLR, with their extensive expertise and many years of experience, play a vital role in ensuring the success of such projects.""

Advancing science and aviation

DLR's measurements provide detailed emission analysis categorised by particle size. Until now, helicopter emissions were largely estimated using approximation methods. ""Thanks to these measurement campaigns with ADAC Luftrettung, we now have new, significantly more accurate data collected under real-world operational conditions,"" explains Tobias Grein, highlighting the importance of this work for research and the aviation sector. ""This data can be used for extrapolations, simulations and modelling, allowing us to assess aviation's environmental and climatic impacts with much greater precision.""

The DLR Institute of Combustion Technology, based in Stuttgart, specialises in optimising combustion processes to reduce emissions. Through close collaboration with industry and other research institutions, it plays a key role in the development and testing of sustainable fuel alternatives. To this end, it offers unique expertise, particularly in measurement technologies and their practical applications.

Abstract

Low carbon fuel policies such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), Canada Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), and California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) as well as the 45Z tax credit are intended to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation. Cellulosic feedstocks, optimized biorefineries, and favorable farming locations can significantly reduce biofuel carbon intensity (CI). Despite the emergence of field-to-fuel GHG monitoring technologies that could verify such benefits, policy-specific requirements for CI accounting procedures may limit fuel producers’ ability to capitalize on these opportunities. This work examines a hypothetical biomass-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway using miscanthus and alcohol-to-jet (i) to demonstrate how GHG accounting requirements drive estimates of biofuel CIs and (ii) to explore potential CI and financial benefits of scenario-specific life cycle assessment (LCA). Results demonstrate that GHG accounting using the CFR and LCFS can reasonably account for distinct levels of net electricity production by a biorefinery, but only the CFR yields similar CI sensitivity to spatially explicit factors (feedstock CI, grid electricity CI) as scenario-specific LCA: most GHG accounting frameworks do not capture CI variation across candidate sites in the United States. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the importance of LCA methodological specifications in low carbon fuel policies and tax credits.

Version Notes

We have updated the analysis to more methodically vary feedstock split ratio - the key parameter that governs the net electricity from a biorefinery. We had originally treated this as an uncertain parameter, but varying the parameter intentionally allowed for a more transparent analysis and discussion.

Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse sind deutlich weniger ausgestoßene ultrafeine Partikel, umgangssprachlich Ruß sowie die uneingeschränkte Leistung und Einsatzbereitschaft der beiden mit SAF betankten Helikopter. Negative Auswirkungen auf Technik und Triebwerke der Maschinen waren während des gesamten rund dreijährigen Forschungsbetriebs nicht messbar. Das von der ADAC Luftrettung initiierte und finanzierte Forschungsprojekt wurde in enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Deutschen Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR), den Triebwerksherstellern Safran Helicopter Engines aus Frankreich und RTX’s Pratt & Whitney Canada sowie dem Hubschrauberhersteller Airbus Helicopters durchgeführt.

Die ADAC Rettungshubschrauber „Christoph Rheinland“ aus Köln und „Christoph Europa 1“ aus Aachen/Würselen flogen in Summe mehr als 1.800 Stunden zur Rettung von Menschenleben mit einem sogenannten SAF-Blend im Tank, womit ein Gemisch aus bis zu 38 Prozent SAF aus nachhaltigen Rohstoffen wie recycelten pflanzlichen Fetten und herkömmlichem Kerosin des Typs JET-A1 gemeint ist. Als sogenanntes Drop-In-Fuel kann SAF grundsätzlich mit herkömmlichem Kerosin gemischt werden.

Erkenntnisse für Projektverantwortliche und Forschende

Die Erkenntnisse für die Projektverantwortlichen und Forschenden: Wenn SAF-Blend statt reinen Kerosins verbrannt wird, sinken bei einer Leistung, wie sie typischerweise vor dem Start am Boden erbracht wird (Idle), die Emissionen ultrafeiner Partikel um 44 Prozent, bei einer Leistung wie beim Fliegen in Einsatzgeschwindigkeit (Cruise) um 33 Prozent. Zusätzlich sinkt der CO2-Ausstoß über den Lebenszyklus des Flugkraftstoffs von der Herstellung bis zur Verbrennung, weil die wiederverwendeten Fette und Öle CO2-neutral sind und die CO2-lastigen fossilen Bestandteile ersetzen.

Während bei den ultrafeinen Partikeln signifikante Unterschiede messbar waren, wurden bei den Verbrennungsgasen Kohlendioxid (CO2), Kohlenmonoxid (CO) und Stickoxid (NOx), einem Indikator für die reibungslose Funktion der Triebwerke, keine Veränderungen nachgewiesen. Parallel dazu untersuchten die Triebwerkshersteller regelmäßig ihre eigene Technik in den beiden Helikoptern vom Typ Airbus H145 („Christoph Rheinland“ mit Safran-Triebwerken) und Airbus H135 („Christoph Europa 1“ mit Pratt-&-Whitney-Triebwerken). Verglichen mit dem Verschleiß beim Verbrennen von herkömmlichem Kerosin konnten sie keine relevanten Unterschiede feststellen.

Frédéric Bruder, der Geschäftsführer der ADAC Luftrettung, betonte zum Abschluss des internationalen Langzeitprojektes die Vorreiterrolle der fliegenden Gelben Engel bei der Verwendung von Biokerosin und mit Blick auf den Klimawandel auch deren gesellschaftliche Verantwortung, bei der Dekarbonisierung der Luftfahrt treibende Kraft zu sein. Er kündigte nach den vielversprechenden ersten Ergebnissen an: „Wir möchten Forschung und Weiterentwicklung auf diesem Gebiet noch vertiefen und den SAF-Anteil weiter erhöhen“. Langfristiges Ziel der ADAC Luftrettung sei es, die Beimischung auf bis zu 100 Prozent zu erhöhen und in der Folge auch den Einsatz von synthetischem E-Fuel, auch Power-to-Liquid-Kerosin (PtL) genannt, zu ermöglichen. PtL bezeichnet die Erzeugung flüssiger (Liquid) Brenn- oder Kraftstoffe mithilfe von elektrischer Energie (Power) aus erneuerbaren Quellen.

Historie des Pilotprojekts und Ausblick

Den Start des in dieser Form einmaligen Forschungsprojekts markierte der erste Flug eines Rettungshubschraubers, einer H145 der ADAC Luftrettung, mit 40-prozentiger SAF-Beimischung im Sommer 2021 in München. Im Dezember desselben Jahres startete die ADAC Luftrettung gemeinsam mit dem DLR, Safran Helicopter Engines und Airbus Helicopters ihre Untersuchungen zu den langfristigen Effekten von SAF des Flugkraftstoff-anbieters Air bp auf die Technik von Maschine und Triebwerken mit „Christoph Rheinland“. Für eine breitere wissenschaftliche Basis wurde in Kooperation mit RTX’s Pratt & Whitney von Dezember 2021 an zusätzlich „Christoph Europa 1“ mit SAF-Blend des Multi-Energie-Konzerns TotalEnergies betankt. Im Sommer 2025 soll auch er 1.000 Einsatzstunden absolviert haben. Die Projektbeteiligten erwarten sich vergleichbare Ergebnisse.

Statements der Projektpartner

Deutsches Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR):

„Für die in dieser Form erste und bisher einmalige Messkampagne hatten wir unser mobiles DLR-Messlabor im Einsatz. Darin befinden sich spezielle Mess- und Analysegeräte. Diese sind geeignet, um ultrafeine Partikel bis zu einer Größe von sieben Nanometern zu untersuchen. Vor jeder Messkampagne erarbeiten wir ein individuelles Konzept und legen Aufbau, Position der Messsonde sowie die Dauer der Messungen fest. Nur so erhalten wir zuverlässige und vergleichbare Daten, beschreibt Forscher Tobias Grein vom Institut für Verbrennungstechnik des DLR, der das Projekt DLR-seitig betreut hat. Sein Fazit: „Diese Messungen waren sehr spannend und auch für unser Team etwas Besonderes, das alles ‚live‘ an einem Helikopter kurz vor dem Abheben zu machen.“

Safran Helicopter Engines:

Jean-François Sauer, EVP Programme bei Safran Helicopter Engines, kommentiert: „Diese Langzeituntersuchung des SAF-Einsatzes in einem H145-Hubschrauber mit unserem Arriel-Triebwerk ist ein wichtiger Meilenstein. Sie zeigt die Kompatibilität unserer Triebwerke mit SAF im Langzeitbetrieb und ermöglicht die Bewertung des ökologischen Nutzens, sowohl bezüglich der Reduktion von CO2 als auch von lokalen Schadstoffemissionen. Wir freuen uns, dass wir an diesem Experiment gemeinsam mit der ADAC Luftrettung, dem DLR und Airbus teilnehmen konnten. Safran Helicopter Engines setzt sich bereits seit mehreren Jahren für den großflächigen Einsatz von SAF in der Hubschrauberindustrie ein. Alle Safran-Hubschraubertriebwerke sind bereits für den Einsatz von bis zu 50 Prozent SAF qualifiziert. Der nächste kurzfristige Schritt ist die Qualifizierung von 100 Prozent Drop-In-SAF, also einem Treibstoff, mit dem aktuelle Triebwerke mit wenig oder ohne Modifikation betrieben werden können. Wir planen, dies bis 2025 zu erreichen.“

RTX’s Pratt & Whitney Canada:

„Die Initiative der ADAC Luftrettung zeigt effektiv die Bereitschaft und Anpassungsfähigkeit der aktuellen Flugzeuge und Triebwerke, mit SAF zu betrieben werden, und liefert greifbare Vorteile, ohne unsere hohen Standards in Bezug auf Leistung und Sicherheit zu beeinträchtigen“, sagte Nico Chabée, Vice President Marketing & Sales, Helicopters von Pratt & Whitney Canada. „Die PW206B-Turboshaft-Triebwerke, die die H135-Hubschrauber der ADAC Luftrettung antreiben, sind für SAF-Mischungen von bis zu 50 Prozent mit herkömmlichem Jet A/A1 Kerosin gemäß den ASTM International-Spezifikationen zertifiziert. Unser Engagement für die Förderung alternativer Kraftstoffe umfasst die Unterstützung von Kundeninitiativen und die Entwicklung zukünftiger Kraftstoffspezifikationen, um die Nutzung von bis zu 100 Prozent SAF zu ermöglichen.“",,N,,2025-04-28 05:57:05.440578

A digitally literate and sustainability-conscious workforce will be key to adapting to industry changes and future-proofing Egypt’s aviation sector against potential disruptions.
Egypt’s aviation sector is at a pivotal juncture.","Aviation stands as a pillar of Egypt’s economy, contributing significantly to employment, trade, and tourism development. A recent study released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has measured the vital economic and employment benefits that the aviation sector, including aviation-related tourism, generates for Egypt. Based on 2023 data, aviation’s impact is not only substantial but poised for further growth as the government leverages the sector strategically for national development.

Economic and Employment Impact

According to the IATA study, the aviation industry, encompassing airlines, airports, supply chains, and tourism, generates USD 21.1 billion in economic activity—equivalent to 5.3% of Egypt’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This robust contribution reflects both the direct benefits of aviation operations and the wider impact through related industries.

In terms of employment, aviation supports nearly 1.4 million jobs across Egypt. This includes not only airline staff but also workers across the broader aviation value chain and the thriving tourism sector, which heavily relies on air connectivity. Of these, 32,800 people are directly employed by airlines, underscoring the industry's critical role in job creation.

Moreover, Egypt's aviation industry handled a staggering 338,600 tonnes of air cargo in 2023, showcasing its significance in facilitating trade and commerce, and enhancing the country's integration into global supply chains.

Aviation’s Strategic Role in National Development

The importance of aviation to Egypt extends beyond pure economic figures. Following a recent meeting with Dr. Sameh Elhefny, Egypt’s Minister of Civil Aviation, Kamil Alawadhi, IATA’s Regional Vice-President for Africa and the Middle East, emphasized aviation’s role as a strategic enabler for Egypt’s broader economic and social ambitions.

“Aviation is a key contributor to Egypt’s economy. Directly and through its well-developed tourism industry, aviation supports nearly 1.4 million jobs. And over 5% of Egypt’s GDP has close links to aviation,” said Alawadhi. He further noted the government’s commitment to aligning the aviation sector with global standards and best practices, particularly in critical areas like safety, sustainability, cost-efficiency, and skills development.

The Egyptian government’s aviation strategy is also closely linked to its Vision 2030, aiming to diversify the economy, stimulate private investment, and foster sustainable development.

To continue maximizing aviation’s benefits, IATA outlines three major priorities for Egypt:

1. Cost-Efficiency in Infrastructure Development

Egypt is making substantial investments to modernize and expand airport infrastructure, notably at Cairo International Airport, Borg El Arab Airport, and Sphinx International Airport. IATA stresses the importance of collaborative consultation with airline operators during these developments to ensure cost-efficiency.

By adhering to international best practices, Egypt can avoid imposing unnecessary financial burdens on airlines and passengers, preserving the affordability and competitiveness of its aviation sector. Transparent pricing, regulatory stability, and efficiency in operations are essential to attract more airlines and increase passenger traffic, especially as Egypt looks to strengthen its position as a regional hub.

2. Sustainability and Decarbonization Initiatives

Egypt has made promising moves in aviation sustainability. In collaboration with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the country is developing the capability to produce 120,000 tonnes of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) annually.

This initiative supports Egypt’s Vision 2030 sustainability objectives and contributes to the global aviation industry's goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Access to affordable, locally-produced SAF will not only reduce Egypt’s carbon footprint but also position it as a leader in green aviation practices in Africa and the Middle East.

Furthermore, Egypt’s hosting of COP27 in 2022 elevated its profile as a committed player in climate action, and investments in sustainable aviation are a logical extension of that leadership.

3. Building Capacity for a Skilled Aviation Workforce

A strong and future-ready workforce is fundamental to the long-term resilience and safety of Egypt’s aviation industry. IATA highlights the need for intensified efforts in skills development—ranging from technical operations to digital transformation and sustainable aviation practices.

Egypt is encouraged to invest in training programs, aviation academies, and public-private partnerships that can produce a skilled workforce adept in safety protocols, technology adoption, and customer service excellence. A digitally literate and sustainability-conscious workforce will be key to adapting to industry changes and future-proofing Egypt’s aviation sector against potential disruptions.

Egypt’s aviation sector is at a pivotal juncture. With strategic investments, collaborative policymaking, and a steadfast commitment to sustainability and skills development, Egypt can ensure that aviation continues to be a powerful engine for economic growth, trade expansion, and tourism prosperity.

By addressing cost-efficiency, environmental sustainability, and human capital development, Egypt is well-positioned to leverage aviation’s full potential—both today and for generations to come.

The partnership between the Egyptian government and IATA reflects a promising trajectory, where global best practices align with national aspirations, setting Egypt firmly on a course toward a resilient and dynamic aviation future.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/25_03_2025_12_45_04_5696141.webp?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-04-28 02:56:42.288083

Typical jet fuel costs per flight The cost of jet fuel per flight depends greatly on a number of factors, including the length of the flight, the number of passengers onboard, and the aircraft used to operate the flight.
The increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is also a factor to consider when looking at jet fuel usage and costs.
Relative stability in jet fuel prices - for now Since reaching their peak in the summer of 2022, fuel prices have stabilized somewhat.
The cost of jet fuel for US airlines per flight varies greatly, depending on the length of the flight and the aircraft used.","Jet fuel is one of the key ingredients that make up air travel. In fact, it may well be the most important - after all, without it, aircraft would not be able to fly. The price of jet fuel is highly volatile and can be greatly affected by external events such as political or economic instability. This, in turn, has a significant impact on the aviation industry as a whole.

The varying cost of jet fuel can greatly impact major carriers such as American Airlines' operational and financial performance. In this article, we examine the typical jet fuel costs of some of the major airlines in the US. We will also consider what future jet fuel prices might look like and the impact that any changes could have on the industry.

One of the largest individual costs

Jet fuel represents one of the biggest single outlays for an airline, often totaling billions of dollars per year. This is, of course, together with the cost of purchasing or leasing the aircraft themselves and the costs involved in recruiting and retaining highly skilled and engaged employees.

According to the latest statistics from Statista, carriers worldwide spent a total of $291 billion on jet fuel in 2024. This increased from $271 billion in 2023 and $215 billion in 2022.

Naturally, 2020 and 2021 were anomalies as they were greatly affected by the global downturn in air travel during and just after the pandemic. Airlines worldwide spent a total of $80 billion and $106 billion in these two years, respectively. In 2019, this figure was $190 billion, showing how carriers today are spending more than $100 billion more per year on jet fuel than they were five years ago.

Fuel hedging - it can make or break an airline

Fuel hedging is when airlines lock in a fixed price for their jet fuel purchases over a given timeframe. This helps them overcome any fluctuations in the market price of jet fuel. For example, an airline may agree to purchase its jet fuel from a given supplier at $500 per ton for three years.

However, it is a very complex technique to get right, and airlines can potentially lose a lot of money if things do not go to plan. But when it does work, they can achieve a significant financial advantage over their competitors.

Using the above example of a pruchase price of $500 per ton:

If a carrier agrees to purchase jet fuel for $500 and prices rise to $700 per ton during that time, it will benefit greatly from its hedging deal.

If prices fall to $300 per ton during that time, the carrier will be at a significant disadvantage and may even fail to survive financially.

Fuel consumption by US airlines has increased

According to the Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the total quantity of fuel consumed by US airlines in December 2019, the final 'normal' year before the COVID-19 pandemic, was 1.55 billion gallons per month.

However, following several uncertain years throughout the pandemic, fuel usage by US airlines had risen to 1.59 billion gallons per month in December 2024. This represents an increase of 0.04 billion gallons (or 2.7%) over five years.

When comparing December 2024 with the same period in 2023, there was a slight increase from 1.58 billion gallons of jet fuel used by US airlines per month.

Changes in jet fuel prices over time

Given that crude oil is used to produce jet fuel, the price of jet fuel is greatly dependent on that of crude oil, and can vary greatly, as shown in the graph below from the International Air Transport Association (IATA):

At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when air travel was brought to a standstill across the world, demand for jet fuel plummeted, and so did prices. In May 2020, jet fuel was available for just $200 per metric ton.

However, the sudden surge in demand for air travel following the removal of COVID-related travel restrictions caused prices to rise drastically, peaking in June 2022 at more than $180 per barrel. In addition to fluctuations in demand, geography can also affect jet fuel prices, with differences of up to $12 per barrel between different regions of the world. Unsurprisingly, the Middle East is home to some of the world's cheapest jet fuel.

Typical jet fuel costs per flight

The cost of jet fuel per flight depends greatly on a number of factors, including the length of the flight, the number of passengers onboard, and the aircraft used to operate the flight. Although it is no longer operated by any US airlines, the iconic Boeing 747 provides a clear example of jet fuel prices. When operating a typical flight from New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to London Heathrow Airport (LHR), the 747 burns approximately 73,000 kg of fuel. If using the price of $0.67 per kg, this equates to a total cost to the airline of $48,800. With 450 passengers onboard, this works out at $108 in fuel costs per passenger.

When it comes to the Airbus A380, the so-called Superjumbo typically burns 11,000 - 12,000 kg of fuel per hour. On a standard seven-hour flight across the Atlantic, the aircraft burns in the region of $51,000 worth of fuel. However, both aircraft are put to shame by more modern, fuel-efficient twinjets such as the Airbus A321neo. On a similar journey across the Atlantic, the A321neo is estimated to burn just $10,000 worth of fuel, highlighting why the aircraft is becoming ever more popular among both US carriers and others around the world.

A clear comparison between the three aircraft is shown in the table below:

Improved fuel efficiencies

Modern aircraft, built of light, composite materials and equipped with highly fuel-efficient engines, typically burn much less fuel per flight than their older counterparts. The comparison of the Boeing 747 vs the Airbus A321neo mentioned above is a clear example of this.

As technologies advance and aircraft manufacturers design ever-more fuel-efficient aircraft, it is highly likely that the fuel cost per flight for airlines will continue to decrease. Wingtips and sharklets are one way in which this can be achieved, with the upcoming Boeing 777X's innovative folding wingtips potentially sparking serious change in how these are used going forward.

The increased use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is also a factor to consider when looking at jet fuel usage and costs. SAF is a key component in helping airlines across the world work towards their sustainability targets. Currently, it is quite expensive to produce, but as it becomes more commonplace and its price drops, it will help airlines to save significant amounts of money on their fuel bills, as well as reduce their environmental impacts.

Relative stability in jet fuel prices - for now

Since reaching their peak in the summer of 2022, fuel prices have stabilized somewhat. As demand for air travel continues to rise, it is likely that airlines across the US will continue to spend more on jet fuel as they operate more flights.

The cost of jet fuel for US airlines per flight varies greatly, depending on the length of the flight and the aircraft used. For example, a transatlantic flight on a relatively inefficient Boeing 757 is going to cost a lot more in jet fuel than a short hop between the US and Canada on a modern, fuel-efficient Airbus A321neo.

However, in the face of ever-greater political and economic uncertainty, the price of crude oil, and with it jet fuel, is likely to change at short notice. It remains to be seen how airlines across the US and beyond will respond to such changes.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/how-much-do-us-airlines-pay-for-jet-fuel-per-flight-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-04-28 02:56:57.580831

Investments in Arlanda’s Marketplace, a key commercial hub, boosted net revenue. At the same time, international passenger numbers grew, though at a slower pace due to external challenges.

However, Swedish domestic travel has continued to face difficulties, reflecting the general broader market trends.

Swedavia Q1 Financial Performance

Swedavia’s financial results for January to March 2025 were impressive. Net revenue reached SEK 1,510 million, up SEK 67 million from SEK 1,443 million in the same period last year.

This growth came despite a slight dip in passenger numbers. Operating expenses also fell, partly due to a milder winter.

This contributed to an operating loss of SEK -136 million, a significant improvement from last year’s SEK -217 million. Cash flow from operating activities was positive at SEK 191 million, a SEK 134 million increase from 2024.

“Even with fewer passengers, we’ve increased revenue and reduced operating costs,” said Jonas Abrahamsson, Swedavia’s President and CEO. “Our operating profit improved by SEK 81 million compared to last year, showing resilience in a challenging environment.”

Passenger Trends and Market Challenges

In Q1 2025, 6.6 million passengers traveled through Swedavia’s ten airports, a 1.3% decrease from the same period in 2024. This marks the first quarterly decline in passenger numbers since the pandemic.

International travel continued to recover, but growth slowed due to economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Domestic travel, meanwhile, remained weak.

“The world is changing rapidly,” Abrahamsson noted. “Economic and geopolitical shifts, including the ongoing trade war, make it hard to predict the aviation industry’s recovery. We expect the economic upturn to be delayed, which will likely impact air travel demand.”

Stockholm Arlanda’s Growth

Swedavia continued to increase its offerings at Stockholm Arlanda Airport. In January, Japan’s largest airline, ANA, launched a new route to Tokyo Haneda.

Norwegian expanded its Arlanda network with four new destinations, while Ryanair added ten new routes from Arlanda and Göteborg Landvetter.

Ryanair also introduced two new aircraft to its Swedish fleet, moving their start date from July to June to improve summer connectivity across Europe. Norwegian further strengthened Arlanda’s role by reopening its pilot base in the spring.

Infrastructure and Sustainability Investments

Arlanda’s infrastructure upgrades progressed smoothly. In February, the final section of the new Marketplace opened, enhancing the airport’s commercial appeal.

Modernization work on air bridges, stands, and infrastructure near Sky City remains on track. Swedavia also welcomed the Arlanda Coordinator’s interim report in March, which emphasized improving road transport to and from the airport.

The company supports strengthening both road and rail connections to boost Arlanda’s competitiveness and Sweden’s global standing.

Sustainability remains a priority. In January, Swedavia issued a SEK 2 billion green bond to fund eco-friendly projects.

The company also invested SEK 40 million in sustainable aviation fuel for the third consecutive year, bringing its total investment since 2020 to SEK 135 million. These efforts underline Swedavia’s commitment to greener aviation.

Looking Ahead

Despite challenges, Swedavia is optimistic about 2025. The summer season, the busiest travel period, will see airlines expanding routes and capacity.

With ongoing investments in infrastructure and sustainability, Swedavia is well placed to navigate market uncertainties while strengthening Sweden’s aviation hub.

About Darling Ingredients

Develops, produces, and sells natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients in North America, Europe, China, South America, and internationally.

What are the underlying business or industry changes driving this perspective?

The positive outlook for renewable fuels public policy, along with the normalization of margins, provides a favorable environment for future cash generation, potentially supporting revenue growth.

The reduction in financial leverage, as evidenced by the $146.2 million debt payment and lowering the financial leverage ratio to 3.33 times, is expected to enhance net margins through reduced interest expense.

Interest in and premiums for sustainable aviation fuel align with a positive future outlook, which may improve both revenues and earnings in the long term.

The anticipated increase in fat prices, due to supply restrictions from tariffs, presents opportunities to improve EBITDA in the Feed segment, signaling potential growth in net margins.

The recovery in the Food segment, bolstered by strong demand for collagen peptides and innovations such as Nextida, projects continued revenue and EBITDA growth through competitive product positioning in 2025.

Darling Ingredients Future Earnings and Revenue Growth

Assumptions

How have these above catalysts been quantified?

This narrative explores a more pessimistic perspective on Darling Ingredients compared to the consensus, based on a Fair Value that aligns with the bearish cohort of analysts.

The bearish analysts are assuming Darling Ingredients's revenue will grow by 2.4% annually over the next 3 years.

The bearish analysts assume that profit margins will increase from 3.0% today to 8.3% in 3 years time.

The bearish analysts expect earnings to reach $508.1 million (and earnings per share of $3.2) by about April 2028, up from $171.6 million today. The analysts are largely in agreement about this estimate.

In order for the above numbers to justify the price target of the more bearish analyst cohort, the company would need to trade at a PE ratio of 16.0x on those 2028 earnings, down from 29.4x today. This future PE is lower than the current PE for the US Food industry at 18.4x.

Analysts expect the number of shares outstanding to grow by 2.33% per year for the next 3 years.

To value all of this in today's terms, we will use a discount rate of 6.21%, as per the Simply Wall St company report.

Darling Ingredients Future Earnings Per Share Growth

Risks

What could happen that would invalidate this narrative?

The transition from the blender's tax credit to the producer's tax credit and the complexity surrounding it could temporarily impact Darling Ingredients' sales and feedstock eligibility for fuel types, potentially impacting short-term revenue and net income.

With DGD's first-quarter EBITDA significantly lower compared to last year due to macro events in the biofuel market, there is a risk that ongoing volatility in biofuel prices could continue to negatively impact earnings and balance sheet health.

Uncertainty and complexity regarding tariffs and supply chain adjustments for imported feedstocks pose ongoing risks that could lead to additional costs, affecting overall company margins and net profit.

The renewable fuels market has faced substantial noise and uncertainty, impacting forward sales volumes and margins. This ongoing uncertainty, including potential changes in policy, could unpredictably affect revenue and EBITDA.

Despite improvements in feed and fat prices, competition in the market, along with potential weather-related disruptions and changes in the geopolitical landscape, could negatively impact raw material costs, thereby affecting revenue and gross margins.

Valuation

How have all the factors above been brought together to estimate a fair value?

The assumed bearish price target for Darling Ingredients is $40.2, which represents one standard deviation below the consensus price target of $47.8. This valuation is based on what can be assumed as the expectations of Darling Ingredients's future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors from analysts on the more bearish end of the spectrum.

However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $60.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $34.0.

In order for you to agree with the bearish analysts, you'd need to believe that by 2028, revenues will be $6.1 billion, earnings will come to $508.1 million, and it would be trading on a PE ratio of 16.0x, assuming you use a discount rate of 6.2%.

Given the current share price of $31.88, the bearish analyst price target of $40.2 is 20.7% higher.

We always encourage you to reach your own conclusions though. So sense check these analyst numbers against your own assumptions and expectations based on your understanding of the business and what you believe is probable.

“We have to work in good faith and negotiate and stay proactive in delivering our message.” –Minnesota Soybean Growers Association","MANKATO, Minn. — When President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs in April 2025 on many of U.S. Soy’s trading partners, media outlets sought the nonpartisan Minnesota Soybean Growers Association for reaction to the turmoil.

Sure, MSGA President Darin Johnson would prefer if news groups called to instead discuss positive industry news – value-added uses for soy, the potential of sustainable aviation fuel or the conservation practices farmers employ on their operations, for example. But he’s seeing the media attention as a sign that MSGA is recognized as a leading voice for soybean producers. Over 60-plus years of advocacy, MSGA has built a reputation as a reliable source that journalists, and legislators, can seek out for timely information on the soybean industry.

“We’re trying to protect our members, our industry, our livelihoods,” said Johnson, a fourth-generation farmer. “And being out in the media is a way to educate and inform the public on how agriculture affects all of us, not just the 1-2% of us who are active in production agriculture.”

Johnson certainly did his part in the lead up to planting his 2025 crop. To begin April, he visited with multiple Twin Cities TV stations, welcomed France’s largest TV network, hosted a Star Tribune reporter and invited Sen. Amy Klobuchar to his operation. His message was consistent: Soybeans are Minnesota’s No. 1 ag export, valued at over $2 billion each year. Damaging trade relationships, most notably China, jeopardizes the farm economy, creating a ripple effect across greater Minnesota. Johnson also emphasized how trade wars increase input costs while touching on how domestic demand can be boosted.

“We understand that there can be improvements made to our current trade agreements, but farmers always seem to be collateral damage in trade wars,” Johnson told Sen. Klobuchar. “We also see an opportunity with the administration by promoting biofuels.”

Sen. Klobuchar, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Ag Committee, said she heard concerns from farmers across Minnesota during Congress’ April recess.

“How many more things can you handle?” she said as Johnson gave a tour of his farm shop. “Input costs, weather, poultry, animal diseases, no Farm Bill, tariffs – farmers are dealing with a lot right now.”

Telling our story

Jeffrey Sorenson, one of six Minnesotans on the American Soybean Association, had never before hosted a news organization on his farm. A second U.S. trade war with China led Japan’s TV Asahi, one of the country’s largest TV networks, to request a visit to a Minnesota farm. Sorenson fit the bill: A knowledgeable family farmer who lives under two hours from the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Within 20 hours of speaking with an Asahi producer, Sorenson, prepping for spring planting, was hosting a film crew on a Saturday afternoon.

Despite some language barriers, Sorenson said the Japanese interview offered a unique opportunity to underscore the importance of preserving trade relationships amid a turbulent farm economy.

“It was a really good experience,” Sorenson said. “I’m glad we’re getting a chance to tell our side of the story.”

MSGA Vice President Ryan Mackenthun and Director Bob Worth were also active in sharing policy priorities during interviews with ABC News and the BBC.

MSGA and the American Soybean Association were relieved when the president announced a 90-day tariff pause to allow for trade negotiations with dozens of countries. However, at press time, the president kept a universal 10% tariff in place, and both the U.S. and China raised their tariffs to 125% and $145.

Johnson is optimistic that a “Phase Two” deal can be reached sooner rather than later. The longer the uncertainty prevails during the growing season, the more China is likely to turn to South America to meet its demand for soy. Meanwhile, MSGA continues to sing from the same hymnal.

“We are encouraging a de-escalation and want to keep our trade relationships intact,” Johnson said. “We have to work in good faith and negotiate and stay proactive in delivering our message.”

Jak wynika z jej informacji, jako pierwszy w kraju paliwem SAF został zatankowany samolot typu Airbus A320 czarterowego przewoźnika, który w środę na zlecenie linii SkyUp wykonał z Katowic do Marsa Alam w Egipcie i z powrotem.

Dzięki temu Katowice zostały pierwszym lotniskiem w Polsce, na którym wykonano fizyczną dostawę zrównoważonego paliwa lotniczego. Jak przypomniał szef zarządzającego portem Górnośląskiego Towarzystwa Lotniczego, trwa tam budowa multimodalnego węzła przeładunku towarów i paliw w oparciu o bocznicę kolejową.

Budowa ta, dofinansowana przez Unię Europejską, zakończy się w połowie 2026 r. - Po oddaniu do użytkowania, będzie to najnowocześniejsza w Polsce lotniskowa infrastruktura do magazynowania i dystrybucji paliwa lotniczego, także typu SAF - podkreślił Tomasik.

Prezes Unimotu Adam Sikorski dodał, że spółka Unimot Aviation, dysponująca silnym zapleczem logistycznym, chce być dostawcą i kompleksowym partnerem dla linii lotniczych i lotnisk w Polsce - wspierając je m.in. w dostosowaniu się do nowych regulacji.

“W kontekście globalnych działań na rzecz redukcji emisji, paliwa alternatywne, takie jak SAF, będą tylko zyskiwać na znaczeniu“ - zwrócił uwagę Sikorski.

Unimot przypomina, że zgodnie z Rozporządzeniem Parlamentu Europejskiego i Rady (UE) 2023/2405 z 18 października 2023 r., od 1 stycznia br. wszystkie unijne porty lotnicze obsługujące ponad 800 tys. pasażerów rocznie (lub 100 tys. ton cargo) zobowiązane są do stosowania paliwa SAF w ilości nie mniejszej niż 2 proc. całkowitej masy paliwa lotniczego. Z uwagi na te kryteria, obowiązek obejmuje osiem lotnisk w Polsce.

SAF to alternatywa dla tradycyjnych paliw kopalnych, produkowana m.in. z olejów roślinnych, tłuszczów zwierzęcych i odpadów z produkcji rolnej. Produkt może przyczynić się do około 65 proc. redukcji emisji potrzebnej, aby sektor lotniczy osiągnął zerowy poziom emisji netto do 2050 r.

Grupa Unimot jest multienergetyczną grupą kapitałową oraz niezależnym importerem paliw ciekłych i gazowych w Polsce. Od grudnia 2016 r. spółka należy do stowarzyszenia AVIA International, dzięki czemu jako pierwsza uzyskała prawo do budowania i rozwoju sieci stacji paliw AVIA w Polsce i w Ukrainie.

Unimot pełni funkcję Niezależnego Operatora Logistycznego, będąc trzecim graczem na rynku magazynowania paliw; zajmuje też drugie miejsce na rynku produkcji asfaltów w Polsce.

Technological advances and intensive research into switchgrass are paving the way for a new era of more environmentally-friendly air travel.

Discover how this green revolution could redefine aviation industry standards and contribute to a greener future.

The potential of switchgrass for sustainable aviation fuel

Switchgrass, a promising bioenergy crop, stands out for its ability to contribute to the U.S. goal of producing 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2050. Recent research from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlights its advantages: high biomass yields, reduced nitrogen requirements and diverse ecological benefits.

Grown on marginal lands, switchgrass limits nitrate leaching, prevents erosion and improves soil health while sequestering carbon. These characteristics make it a viable candidate to replace corn in the quest for more sustainable energy solutions for aviation.

Ecological advantages and comparison with maize

Switchgrass offers impressive biomass yields while requiring less than half the nitrogen required by corn, significantly reducing nitrous oxide emissions. In addition to its low fertilizer requirements, this plant improves soil health and reduces nitrate leaching, thus contributing to a healthier ecosystem.

Studies conducted in the Midwest have shown that energetic switchgrass varieties, such as Independence and Liberty, are not only more profitable but also more sustainable on less productive land. These results underline the importance of site-specific strategies to maximize the economic and environmental benefits of switchgrass over corn.

Profitability and regional adaptation of switchgrass cultivars

Economic analyses show that energetic switchgrass varieties, notably Independence and Liberty, consistently outperform forage types in terms of profitability. However, the effectiveness of nitrogen rates varies from region to region: while 56 kg/ha generally promotes higher yields, a reduced input of 28 kg/ha sometimes proves more profitable.

The market has witnessed a remarkable surge in recent years, driven by the growing demand for environmentally friendly air travel. As airlines and passengers prioritize reducing carbon footprints, adopting SAF has become a crucial strategy to address the aviation industry's environmental impact.

As the global community strives to find ways to reduce CO2 emissions and fight climate change, the air transport sector has its challenges and prospects. To this end, Asia Pacific has scaled up its efforts towards SAF as the region benefits from supportive energy policies and associations supporting environmentally sustainable aviation. The shift of Asia-Pacific markets to sustainable aviation fuel has been boosted in five countries with new developments in Australia, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand. The Australian government, in the recent 2024/25 budget, has outlined plans to ramp up support of the low-carbon liquid fuel industry, especially for SAFs, while Singapore Airlines and Scoot have made their first purchase of the fuel at Changi International Airport from the recently commissioned Neste Singapore plant which is currently the world’s largest single SAF production facility. Two major collaborations have also been made between Japan and Malaysian partners where SAF to be produced in Malaysia will be imported to Japan to assist that country in achieving its 2030 target of 10% of SAF utilization. Another regional partnership will entail the collection of used cooking oil from another Japanese firm to aid in producing SAF for a new refinery in Thailand to commence by the first half of 2023.

The Asia Pacific SAF market has also seen a surge in private sector involvement, with several companies investing in developing and producing sustainable aviation fuel. For instance, in 2024, Airbus expressed its willingness to invest in India to expedite the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). India has the potential to develop a new industry for biofuel production, particularly SAF, not only for domestic consumption but also for export to regions like Europe and Oceania. Moreover, companies, along with the government authorities in the region, are heavily invested in sustainable aviation fuel. Biofuel firms are pouring more than USD 1 billion into building China’s first plants to turn waste cooking oil into aviation fuel for export and meet domestic demand once Beijing mandates the fuel’s use on airplanes to cut emissions. Junheng Industry Group Biotechnology Co Ltd started producing the first SAF last December at a 400,000 tpy plant in the central city of Puyang for 1.3 billion yuan (USD 180 million), becoming the second SAF maker to win airworthiness certification from domestic civil aviation authorities after Sinopec’s Zhenhai.

With rising consciousness of decarbonization within the aviation industry, supporting authorities and private organizations, and funding from authorities, the governments of the Asia Pacific countries to reduce the emission of GHG in the coming years, the consumption of SAF is expected to increase in the future. Therefore, the region will multiply due to the activities of governments, private investments, and the growth of awareness of the need to use them in aviation. As the aviation industry in this region expands, SAF is expected to play an essential role in reducing the sector’s negative environmental impact.",https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/email/artdeco/logos/96/linkedin-bug-color.png,N,,2025-04-27 18:56:08.892222

As the world strives to meet the ambitious targets set by the Paris Agreement, it becomes increasingly clear that transformative changes are essential within this challenging sector. One of the most promising developments in this arena is the establishment of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (ESAF) in Egypt. This initiative underscores the country’s commitment to supporting global climate change mitigation efforts through the production of SAF, a biofuel that mirrors the properties of traditional jet fuel while significantly reducing carbon emissions.

Decarbonizing the Aviation Sector

The aviation sector significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, requiring substantial changes to meet Paris Agreement goals. Key strategies for reducing these emissions include improving efficiency, transitioning to alternative fuels, adopting new technologies, and implementing carbon removal methods.

The Insurance Federation of Egypt (IFE) revealed in July 2024 that the aviation sector’s CO2 emissions from fuel make up 12% of the whole transportation sector’s CO2 emissions. Although the aviation sector represents a relatively small share of global emissions, it is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonize, because it requires low-carbon technologies that are expensive. Nevertheless, the sector has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, according to the IFE.

The Role and Benefits of SAF and Establishment of ESAF in Egypt

The Egyptian petrochemicals sector is working to support Egypt’s decarbonization targets through several projects, including the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional fossil jet fuel, but with a smaller carbon footprint. It is also defined as renewable or waste-derived fuel that meets environmental sustainability criteria by significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle compared to conventional fossil fuel. SAF can be produced from a number of sources, including vegetable oils, animal fats, as well as organic or plastic waste.

In November 2024, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Karim Badawi inaugurated the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (ESAF). The company supports global climate change mitigation efforts by developing environmentally friendly and renewable energy sources for aviation. ESAF also advances Egypt’s green economy transition, fostering sustainable energy investment, technology localization, and economic growth.

ESAF’s ownership is structured with 85% held by Egyptian public petroleum sector companies and 15% by private sector partners.

The project, with an estimated $530 million investment, will utilize advanced global technology to convert locally sourced waste into 120,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel annually. This is projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 400,000 tons per year. The ESAF company is established in a strategic location in Alexandria, as it is expected to integrate with existing petroleum infrastructure, enhancing efficiency and promoting sustainable energy development.

The Establishment of ESAF in Egypt marks a pivotal step toward addressing the significant greenhouse gas emissions generated by the aviation sector. As this industry grapples with the challenges of decarbonization, the innovative production of SAF emerges as a crucial strategy for reducing its carbon footprint.",https://egyptoil-gas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/06Websit_Issue_April25.jpg,N,,2025-04-27 11:56:47.741563

Beyond the technological aspects, Airbus emphasizes the need to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks for hydrogen aviation.
The technology is intended to complement – not replace – sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions and is expected to be especially efficient on short- and medium-range routes.","Airbus unveils a hydrogen-powered aircraft with electric engines that could replace jet engines: Aviation giant Airbus presented this week its innovative hydrogen-powered aircraft concept at the company’s annual aviation conference held in Toulouse. This is a prototype in advanced development stages, representing one of the company’s leading directions toward emission-free aviation. The new aircraft, named ZEROe, uses four independent electric engines, each powered by hydrogen fuel cells producing two megawatts of power.

The most intriguing innovation – at least visually – is the appearance of the engines, which are mounted as external pods on the wings, similar to propeller engines commonly used in the pre-jet era. However, this is not a mechanical propeller, but a completely different technology that operates quietly, without combustion, and with particularly high energy efficiency.

A propeller is a mechanical thrust device – rapidly rotating blades connected to a piston engine or turbine, whose role is to push air backward and generate forward thrust. For many years, passenger and military aircraft used this technology – mainly until the 1960s, when jet engines began replacing them. Propellers were exposed, noisy, and limited in speed.

Although the new Airbus aircraft includes four external engines with blades – which may look like propellers – in practice, they are full electric propulsion systems powered by fuel cells that carry out a hydrogen-oxygen oxidation reaction to generate electricity. There is no combustion, no fossil fuels, and no polluting emissions.

The concept presented is based on two central liquid hydrogen tanks feeding four separate fuel cells. Each fuel cell generates electricity for an independent engine, and together they power the aircraft quietly, cleanly, and efficiently. The entire system is expected to reach a total output of 8 megawatts – enough power to operate a short- to medium-range passenger aircraft.

Airbus reports that this technology is currently undergoing intensive testing. In 2023, the company successfully operated a propulsion system with a 1.2-megawatt output, and in 2024 completed integrated tests involving fuel cell systems, converters, gearboxes, heat exchangers, and electric engines.

In parallel, a ground test system for liquid hydrogen use, named LH2BB, was developed in collaboration with Air Liquide. This system allows safety testing and power distribution evaluations before actual flight.

Beyond the technological aspects, Airbus emphasizes the need to develop appropriate regulatory frameworks for hydrogen aviation. The company is also advancing this topic with international aviation and standards bodies, in order to prepare the infrastructure and frameworks that will allow such aircraft to enter commercial service.

According to Airbus’ forecast, the new aircraft may enter commercial service in the late 2030s, as part of the expected replacement for current single-aisle models like the A320. The technology is intended to complement – not replace – sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions and is expected to be especially efficient on short- and medium-range routes.","https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/659786",N,,2025-04-27 04:56:26.788261

But at the 2025 IATA World Cargo Symposium (WCS) in Dubai, it became clear that sustainability isn't just about what's in the fuel tank — it's also about what ends up in the trash.

In a panel on circular economy in air cargo, industry leaders peeled back the layers on one of the sector’s most under-discussed opportunities: reimagining waste not as a by-product, but as a resource. Moderated by Saleem Saeed, Sustainability Manager at IAG Cargo, the conversation featured Michelle Fok, Head of Sustainable Development at Cathay Cargo Terminal; Celine Hourcade, Vice President, Global Head of ESG / Sustainability at SATS; and Daniel Leng, Chief Operating Officer at LATAM Cargo; each offering deeply grounded insights into how their organisations are attempting to close the loop on materials, processes, and procurement.

“Sustainability isn’t always a cost centre. In many of our projects, it helped us save money, simplify operations, and reduce waste.”

Daniel Leng, LATAM Cargo

Their collective message? The path to circularity in air cargo is complex, but the potential payoff — for the planet and the bottom line — is immense.

Beyond carbon: Why circularity is the next sustainability frontier

Net-zero by 2050 is now a baseline expectation in aviation. But the panellists of the sustainability track at IATA WCS Dubai argued that meeting this goal requires more than cleaner fuels. It calls for an industry-wide pivot away from the traditional “take-make-dispose” approach and toward systems where materials are reused, repurposed and retained in the value chain for as long as possible.

As SATS’s Hourcade pointed out, it’s a shift that starts not with fuel but with a fundamental mindset change: “Transformation requires that mindset shift,” she said. “You have to start with your local teams, test what works in your own context, and once you understand the impact, you can expand and apply those learnings to operations across the network.”

Circularity isn’t a parallel track to sustainability — it’s the infrastructure that underpins it.

From siloed operations to shared intelligence

One of the most powerful takeaways from the discussion was the recognition that most air cargo terminals operate in isolation. Cathay Cargo Terminal’s Fok acknowledged that, despite belonging to a major airline group, her team at Cathay Cargo Terminal had limited visibility into the innovations or challenges faced by others.

“We don’t really have a very big network of talking to each other,” she admitted. “If we’re limiting ourselves to just our own operations and local knowledge, it means we’re also limiting our ability to learn from some of the good practices happening elsewhere — whether that’s in the UK, the US, or even in Chile,” mentioned Fok.

This lack of communication is more than an operational inconvenience — it’s a lost opportunity. In a sector defined by global connectivity, the internal fragmentation is stark. If the industry can move containers across oceans in 24 hours, surely it can move knowledge across departments.

Procurement as strategy, not paperwork

The panel also pulled back the curtain on one of the most overlooked levers of sustainability: procurement. In many organisations, procurement is treated as a compliance function — focused on cost, volume, and delivery. But in a circular model, procurement becomes a strategic driver of change.

LATAM Cargo’s Leng didn’t mince words: “If you say, ‘Okay, I’m just going to decide based on price,’ then you’re not being true to what you’re claiming as a sustainability-led company.”

What does this mean in practice? It means choosing materials not only for their performance or cost but also based on recyclability, reusability, and environmental origin. It means embedding sustainability into contracts, so vendors are held to the same values as the buyer. And it means pushing beyond superficial certifications to demand operational transparency.

“If we’re limiting ourselves to just our own operations and local knowledge, it means we’re also limiting our ability to learn from some of the good practices happening elsewhere.”

Michelle Fok, Cathay Cargo Terminal

“We’re not quite there yet,” Leng admitted, “but if you don’t involve your suppliers from the beginning — if you’re not clear about your sustainability expectations — it’s going to be very difficult to make any progress.”

The innovation culture gap

Perhaps the most compelling part of the conversation revolved around the cultural barriers to circularity. Shifting mindsets inside large organisations is no small feat. Sustainability, in many firms, is still siloed — treated as a marketing function or relegated to an annual report, mentioned Leng in an exclusive interview on the side lines of IATA WCS.

But as Fok explained, her team used the IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) certification process as a Trojan horse to re-examine their entire operational model through the lens of sustainability. “It challenged me to look into the whole process again together with our stakeholders,” she said. “I alone cannot do anything; it has to be collaborative.”

Leng echoed that sentiment with a powerful reminder of where real innovation comes from: “All of our sustainability initiatives — every single one of them — came from our frontline teams. That’s where innovation lives. All they needed was support and room to explore.”

He continued, “Sustainability isn’t always a cost centre. In many of our projects, it helped us save money, simplify operations, and reduce waste. You just have to give your people the space to innovate.”

Regulatory disarray: The enemy of progress

Circularity may be a global ideal, but regulations are deeply local. For multinationals like SATS and LATAM, this fragmentation poses a significant challenge.

“We operate in 27 countries,” Hourcade noted. “We have to face different jurisdictions, different regulations, and they are not consistent with one another.”

Leng shared a similar frustration: “Some companies can do it in one country but not in another, simply because local regulation doesn’t allow you to take that step. That lack of consistency makes it harder to implement good practices at scale.”

“But if we can align incentives, if we can be transparent, and if we can share learnings, then we have a fighting chance (towards achieving sustainability)”

Saleem Saeed, IAG Cargo

This inconsistency isn’t just frustrating — it’s a strategic risk. It creates inefficiencies, undermines ROI, and disincentivises innovation. That’s why all three panellists agreed: industry bodies like IATA must take the lead in establishing common guidelines and global standards.

The missing piece: Standardisation across the chain

Circularity isn't just about reusing materials — it’s about designing systems that make reuse possible. That requires standardisation. But as Hourcade pointed out, this is easier said than done when each airline specifies different materials and packaging preferences.

“If each airline has its own type of plastics, or a different type of cover they want us to use, then we lose control over our own sustainability strategy,” she said. “It creates fragmentation that ultimately works against the circularity ambition we all share.”

The problem isn’t just material choice. It’s also about volume. Without scale, circular solutions — like reusable cargo wraps or cardboard pallets — struggle to achieve economic viability. In other words: innovation needs alignment to survive.

Labs, loops, and learning from failure

So where does that alignment begin? According to Leng, it starts with creating experimental hubs. LATAM uses its operations in Santiago and Miami as “labs” to test circular solutions like reusable pallets, biodegradable straps and new loading procedures.

“In Miami, for example, we’ve replaced single-use plastic wraps for flower imports with reusable blankets. It keeps the flowers dry during rain, performs better than plastic, and is reused endlessly. It’s simple, effective, and cleaner.”

He also pointed to LATAM’s Second Flight initiative: “We collect old uniforms from our crew and give them to local artisans to create purses, wallets, and other goods. Instead of ending up in landfills, they get a second life — and empower local communities.”

Even cargo pallets haven’t been spared the circular rethink. “We now inspect the wooden pallets brought in by customers. If they’re operational, we reuse them. If damaged, we repair them. If beyond repair, we recycle them. This helped us cut pallet purchases for exports by 100% and for imports by 50%.”

And in Santiago, LATAM's use of bright red plastic pallets — made from recycled soda crates — has not only helped reduce waste but also loss: “Since we’re the only ones using red, we no longer lose them. It’s a small but smart win for operations and the planet.”

But testing also means failing — and that’s something the industry needs to get comfortable with. “You need to develop that safe environment for creativity,” said Saeed. “It’s that continuous improvement bit. You try something. If it doesn’t work, you try again.”

Fok agreed: “We need to keep failing, we need to keep innovating, keep learning from the journey, and keep improving.”

Airlines as enablers, not observers

Another recurring theme was the pivotal role airlines play — not just as clients, but as co-innovators. “Airline is actually a very important stakeholder inside the circularity journey,” Fok said.

When airlines back a circular initiative — whether it’s a new type of pallet or a reusable cargo wrap — they give it scale, credibility and operational runway. In many cases, projects that would otherwise stall in pilot mode can go global with the right airline support.

“If each airline has its own type of plastics, or a different type of cover they want us to use, then we lose control over our own sustainability strategy.”

Celine Hourcade, SATS

Leng reinforced this with a broader strategic vision: “As a group, we’ve committed to a sustainability strategy centred on climate change, shared value, and circular economy. We’re not just flying sustainably — we’re redesigning our culture around it.”

Final descent: Rethinking waste as strategy

The transition to a circular economy in air cargo isn’t a quick fix or a corporate buzzword. It’s a paradigm shift. It requires letting go of linear thinking and reimagining waste as a strategic asset — not an unavoidable cost.

The panelists at WCS 2025 offered a refreshingly grounded take on what it will take to get there. Collaboration. Cultural transformation. Standardisation. Transparency in procurement. And above all, a willingness to fail, learn, and adapt.

“There’s no silver bullet,” Saeed concluded. “But if we can align incentives, if we can be transparent, and if we can share learnings, then we have a fighting chance.”

The message from Dubai was clear: sustainability in air cargo is no longer just about flying cleaner. It’s about thinking in circles — because that’s the only way forward.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/04/25/81370-iata-sustainability-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-27 02:56:17.001076

Leaked Scottish Government documents say Petroineos had “no intention” of supporting any of the proposals that could salvage hundreds of jobs.

The company is also said to have demanded major changes to Nats’ and UK Government energy policies for it to agree to anything.

A briefing from officials to SNP Acting Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero, Gillian Martin, states: “Petroineos have stated previously that the technologies of most interest to the joint venture (sustainable aviation fuel/bio fuels production and green hydrogen) are sub economic.

“Therefore there is no intention on the business’ part to proceed with these options without significant policy changes at UK Government and Scottish Government level.”

The blow emerged before a £1.5million UK and SNP government plan outlining nine potential futures for Scotland’s only oil refinery was published last month.

Project Willow warned that £3.5billion in private cash would be needed to transform the plant near Falkirk — set to shut in this year with 400 jobs axed — into a renewables hub fit for the future.

The stance by Petroineos, a joint venture between China and Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has emerged amid anger at how British Steel’s Chinese owners ran down its Scunthorpe plant.

Scots Lib Dem economy spokesman Willie Rennie urged the Nats ministers to explore “every viable route” to secure Grangemouth’s future.

He added: “Unfortunately they seem to have wasted five years when they could have been getting ahead of the problem. Petroineos are not covering themselves in glory but workers will have little sympathy for John Swinney and Keir Starmer too.”

Labour has come under fire for not moving to save the refinery in the same way they did to take control of British Steel.

First Minister Mr Swinney said this month Grangemouth should be nationalised by the UK Government.

Petroineos said Nats were warned about Grangemouth’s woes in 2020.

The firm was contacted for comment. The Scottish Government said: “Refining at Grangemouth should continue, the closure is premature and is detrimental to Scotland’s transition to net zero.

“We have continued to press the UK Government to leave no stone unturned in securing the site’s future as interventions of this magnitude would require them to take action.”",https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/775-million-losses-last-refinery-935863600_1cfaf7.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-04-26 18:56:29.595306

Operationally Strong

Refining production in 2024 was the strongest since 2019 with capacity utilization rates exceeding 93%, which was well above the 85-90% guidance. Total refined production of 26.7 million tons and 30.4 million tons sold, was the highest in almost a decade. This was helped by:

MANILA, Philippines — The rise in vegetable oil prices in the world market is opening new doors to one of the country’s prized agricultural products: coconut.

Global vegetable oil prices –from palm, sunflower to coconut – have been on a rally as world supplies tighten amid growing demand for both household and industrial uses.

The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) vegetable oil price index in March rose by nearly 24 percent year-on-year to 161.8 points from 130.6 points in the same month last year.

The FAO attributed the increase to the continued spike in the global prices of palm, soy, rapeseed and sunflower oils due to dwindling supplies coupled by rising demand by consumers.

The effects of the hike in world vegetable oil prices were immediately felt in the country through higher copra prices and more expensive cooking oil.

The uptick in copra prices is indeed a welcome news to over three million Filipino coconut farmers, who are considered among the poorest in the country.

But on the other hand, consumers are reeling from higher prices of cooking oil. Industries, such as food and fuel, are also impacted.

But between these two sectors, an opportunity arises for both the sector and the government: to further promote coconut value-adding to advance the development of the sector and improve the welfare of farmers.

It is high time for the coconut industry to accelerate its efforts of utilizing all parts of the mature nut amid the tightening of supplies.

This is one of the recommendations made to Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) administrator and CEO Dexter Buted to address the current coconut supply situation by the agency’s Trade Information and Relations Division (TIRD).

The recommendation noted that coconut water from ordinary copra production must be collected and processed into nata de coco to serve as raw materials for the manufacturing of coco patch and other cellulosic materials.

Likewise, small and medium virgin coconut oil producers must be trained to use their coconut water into beverages and other users, according to the memorandum from the PCA’s TIRD.

Coconut water is one of the rising export products of the country with value of shipments estimated at $67.45 million in 2023, according to industry players.

There is also an opportunity to take advantage of the coconut husks, which often go into waste, to be sold to decorticating machines or coir processing plants to produce value-added products.

Meanwhile, the coconut shell can be turned into charcoal briquettes and even into handicrafts that should be promoted under the government’s Coconut Farmers Industry Development Plant, which is bankrolled by the coconut levy trust fund.

“The increasing global demand trend for vegetable oils is inevitable. This is a big opportunity for the Philippines to further strengthen its flagship industry,” the memorandum read.

The rise in global vegetable oil prices continues to be evident in the country’s export earnings as coconut oil shipments in the first two months continue to outpace last year’s figures at even faster rates.

Coconut oil exports rose by almost seven percent year-on-year to 139,413 metric tons (MT) but its value surged by 80 percent on an annual basis to nearly $250 million, based on Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data.

In February, the value of coconut oil exports more than doubled to $251.12 million from $118.59 million in the same month last year, PSA data also showed.

The country’s total earnings from coconut oil exports last year reached a record-high of almost $2.2 billion, about 85 percent higher than the $1.18 billion recorded in 2023.

The country’s exports of other coconut products like shell charcoal rose by nearly 60 percent year-on-year to $76.3 million from $47.8 million. Likewise, export volume of the coconut product expanded by nearly 65 percent to 140,280 MT from 85,103 MT.

The country can also take advantage of growing demand from transport and aviation industries by boosting production of vegetable oil-based products such as coconut methyl ester (for biodiesel) and sustainable aviation fuel.

This measure complements the policy that is being mulled over by the government wherein a portion of the country’s coconut oil will be retained for domestic use to ensure supply and prevent further price spikes while shipping out excess stocks to sustain the prized export market.

Penetrating the higher value markets such as biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels would be able to replace the lost export revenues caused by the retention policy.

The PCA is in talks with industry stakeholders and relevant government agencies regarding the proposal.

The PCA has the legal mandate and basis to regulate the export of coconut oil, as provided under multiple presidential decrees including PD 1468 that created the agency’s charter and mandate.

The power was further strengthened under PD 1644 as it granted the PCA the “full power and authority” to regulate the marketing and export of copra, coconut oil and their by-products.

Neighboring countries such as Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia have already implemented various export restriction policies to address supply shortages and rising cooking oil prices in their respective markets.

Despite an increase in production, the country’s coconut oil exports are projected to remain flat in market year 2025-2026 (October-September) at 1.13 million MT due to higher demand for biodiesel blending, according to a US report.",https://media.philstar.com/photos/2025/04/26/4_2025-04-26_19-25-37.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 21:57:04.996318

Baseball, America’s favourite pastime, is known for its exciting moments, but it’s also a sport with a significant environmental impact. As awareness of climate change grows, sustainability in sports is becoming more important, and baseball is making strides to reduce its carbon footprint and become more eco-friendly.

One major change is the way baseball stadiums are being designed and renovated. Many MLB teams now use eco-friendly building materials, energy-efficient systems, and waste reduction strategies.

For example, Citi Field, home of the New York Mets, has installed low-flow toilets and energy-saving lights. In fact, 15 MLB teams have committed to achieving zero waste in their stadiums, and teams like the San Francisco Giants are leading the way. These efforts have helped MLB reduce energy consumption by 40% in the last decade. A significant step for sustainability in sports.

Sustainable Equipment

Baseball equipment is also becoming more sustainable. Traditionally, bats were made from wood, and gloves were made from leather, both of which are natural resources. Now, manufacturers are looking for eco-friendly alternatives, like synthetic, plant-based materials for gloves and bats made from sustainable wood or recycled materials. This reduces the need for new timber and leather.

Another big focus for baseball is reducing the sport’s carbon footprint. Travel is a key contributor to emissions, as teams often fly across the country. Some teams are now investing in carbon offset programs to balance out their emissions, and MLB has set a goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.

Sustainable Food and Concessions

Food and concessions at games also play a role in sustainability. The food industry in stadiums produces a lot of waste, from plastic to food scraps. Many teams are working to cut down on this waste by eliminating single-use plastics, offering plant-based options, and composting more food waste. The Seattle Mariners, for example, have eliminated plastic straws, and other stadiums are following by switching to more recyclable and biodegradable materials.

Fan Participation in Sustainability

Fans are also part of the solution. As people become more environmentally conscious, fans are encouraged to recycle, carpool, and bring reusable bottles to games. These small actions may seem minor, but they add up when you consider the millions of people attending games each season.

A Growing Movement

While baseball’s journey to sustainability is still just beginning, the changes are noticeable and will likely keep growing. The sport is setting a great example for other industries, proving that even something as traditional as baseball can evolve to protect the planet. From energy-efficient stadiums to sustainable food options, baseball is showing that it’s not just a game for fans but a game for the Earth too.

Conclusion

In conclusion, baseball is hitting home runs in sustainability. By reducing waste, using eco-friendly materials, and promoting environmental responsibility, the sport is helping create a greener world one game at a time.",https://brignews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pexels-pixabay-264279-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 18:56:42.309636

Without action by Congress and the Trump Administration, America risks falling behind our global competitors, led by China, in producing a critically important source of our energy independence: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

SAF was invented in the U.S. by American innovators in our private sector. They have developed novel ways to convert crops, plants, biomass, captured gases, waste and even used cooking oil into jet fuel. SAF is blended with jet fuel without the need to modify existing aircraft. SAF also creates good-paying jobs and new economic opportunities for farmers and communities in rural America. With farmers worried about tariffs impacting their sales abroad, the Trump Administration can act today to encourage more U.S. crops are converted into SAF that are produced here in America.

Right now, countries like China and Brazil are incentivizing their farmers, boosting SAF production and imported SAF into the U.S. at the expense of our domestic energy producers. As a result, American aviation relies heavily on SAF that’s produced outside of the US.

American farmers are going to feel some pain of the Trump trade measures, because foreign nations are already working to block exported farm products from the United States. Politico reported on April 3, 2025, “Trump administration officials are assuring farm-state Republicans they will funnel billions of taxpayer dollars to farmers who are hit by President Donald Trump’s intensifying trade war.” Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins met with Sens. John Boozman (R-AR) and John Hoeven (R-ND) to discuss how to add some funding of farm bill programs to the upcoming budget reconciliation measure to help hurting farmers.

SAF creates new markets for American agriculture, bioenergy, and technology developers. Incentivizing more SAF production in the U.S. will create new opportunities for American agriculture and will help mitigate the impact of trade actions by our global competitors.

The alternative fuels produced by farmers for aviation is widely used by commercial aircraft today and could be wholly sourced in the United States with the right policy. Sustainable fuels, SAFs, as described by the U.S. Department of Energy are “an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks” that can “be blended at different levels with limits between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced.” They cite the International Civil Aviation Organization for the fact that over 360,000 commercial flights have used SAF in the U.S. and Europe.

Although SAFs have some positive environmental impact, it is important to note the economic aspect of insourcing production. Insourcing while helping farmers who will be hurt by their products being cut off from export to China because of the tariff battle going on between the U.S. and China is good policy. The market domestically is vast for these fuels because an American aircraft can use up to 50% SAF that ends up blending with traditional fossil fuels with that percentage increasing every year.

It makes no economic sense to have the Department of Energy set high targets for SAF, while we import from China and Brazil. The technology exists to convert American crops and plants to fuel. There also is the capability to use biomass and other resources to produce more domestically. Federal policy should be to encourage domestic production through subsidies and tax credits, while discouraging companies from importing from other nations farmers.

China and Brazil have been especially focused on dominating the SAF market. Valor International reported on April 23, 2025, “Chinese renewable energy company Envision is considering investments in Brazil to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).” The platform Sustainable Aviation Fuels Futures cited that “Brazil's diverse agricultural landscape offers a variety of feedstocks suitable for SAF production” including sugarcane bagasse and straw, cattle manure, and municipal solid waste.” Brazil and China are large exporters of SAF to the United States.

America is already drilling, mining and fracking our way energy independence. We can do the same by unleashing American agriculture, bioenergy, timber and other industries and encouraging them to grow/create more feedstock to generate more SAF here at home.

This strategic move not only benefits the environment but also secures the U.S.'s position in the global energy race. By driving innovation and ensuring robust supply chains, the U.S. stands poised to effectively counter China's efforts in the SAF domain, securing America as the leader in this competitive future for all. As the skies beckon with the promise of sustainable flights, the role of the U.S. government in fostering SAF development is crucial. It ensures a greener tomorrow, setting the pace for sustainable aviation on a global scale.

Now is the time for our government to support the domestic production of this fuel so American companies don’t have to rely on foreign sourced sustainable fuel.

The Challenges Facing The Boom Overtures In the 20th century, a supersonic jet was a technical achievement.
The Rundown Of The Boom Overture Boom has a major challenge ahead of itself.","The Boom Overture is an upcoming supersonic transport. It will carry 60 to 80 passengers traveling at Mach 1.7, with a range of 4,250 NM (7,870 KM). Some speculate about whether the plane will ever fly, and there are certainly reasons to be worried. But if it does and if it becomes successful, then it will undoubtedly be one of the most impressive aircraft projects to ever come out of the commercial aircraft industry, and it's using something that has existed for over a century: brilliant aerospace engineering.

Unfortunately, not everyone is excited about breaking the sound barrier again. Beyond skeptics who criticize the aircraft from a business perspective, environmentalists are pushing back. They believe that a Boom supersonic transport (SST) is a dangerous idea, something that moves in the opposite direction of where we as a society should be headed. The same thing happened back in the 1960s, when Concorde , the Boeing 2707 , and the Tupolev TU-144 were being developed. Ultimately, only 14 Concordes ever flew, but now that supersonic flights may be returning, so are the environmentalists.

Damage To The Environment

In 2018, the European Federation for Transport and Environment published a three-page report regarding the effects of supersonic flight on the climate. The findings were concerning. First, the T&E describes that high-altitude flying would worsen non-CO2 effects. Most airliners cruise at altitudes between 30,000 feet and 43,000 feet, while a future SST like the Boom Overture would fly at 55,000 feet or higher. These can exceed CO2 emissions, and hundreds of SSTs in the skies could contribute significantly more to these harmful emissions than their fleet sizes would suggest.

Not only will the planes emit more, but they will also carry fewer passengers. Boom claims that up to 80 passengers can fit into the Overture, which, at 201 ft (61m), is similar in size to a Boeing 787 Dreamliner or an Airbus A330. These planes can carry 300 or more passengers. A Boeing 757-300, a large single-aisle jet, is 22 ft (6.7 m) shorter and carries 234 passengers in Delta's configuration. So not only will the Overture be more wasteful, but each passenger will contribute significantly more in terms of CO2 emissions and other toxic effects.

Furthermore, with 60-80 seats being sold for business class prices, as Boom claims, the Overture is primarily meant to fly between airports like London Heathrow, New York-JFK, and Tokyo-Haneda. These are huge centers for business travel, but they have slot restrictions. To use the Overture on these city pairs, airlines will need to remove existing equipment from these routes, replacing it with a jet that is more polluting while carrying fewer passengers. Not a leap forward for a world that is hoping to go greener.

Noise Concerns And The Effects

The Concorde, Tupolev Tu-144, F-22 Lightning, and the F-15 Eagle all have something in common. These supersonic planes all produce a sonic boom, an aural effect that occurs when an aircraft breaks the sound barrier. This sound can be heard by everyone under the flight path of a supersonic jet, as it occurs continuously when an aircraft is flying past the speed of sound. A sonic boom typically measures at 110 dB, which is equivalent to holding a chainsaw in your hands, and can even cause damage to buildings.

This has led nearly every country in the world to ban commercial supersonic flights over land, which severely impacted the viability of the Concorde. The return of supersonic flying would either require changes in legislation, new engineering solutions to minimize the effect of the sonic boom, or be relegated to overwater flights. Furthermore, Concorde was also incredibly loud during takeoffs and landings, so any new SST would need to address this as well.

The idea of letting hundreds of supersonic airliners fly above Mach 1 while rattling windows would be incredibly unpopular with voters, so it's unlikely that legislation would change regarding this. Although the T&E does go in-depth about the noise impacts of SST fleets, this is a less realistic concern. Any SST will only be able to fly above Mach 1 over water, unless governments experience a serious change of heart.

Boom's Response To These Concerns

Boom claims that Overture will be 100% compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This is a type of jet fuel that doesn't use fossil fuels in its production, but is rather a biofuel. Using SAF doesn't change the emissions directly generated from aircraft engines, but the carbon emitted from these planes can be absorbed back into the sources that are used for SAF, effectively making it carbon-neutral.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has pledged to make aviation fully carbon-neutral by 2050, and SAF is a key component to that. It's compatible with existing engines, and SAF can even be mixed in with traditional jet fuel. However, production is not widespread yet, and it's significantly more expensive than regular fuel, which means that we still have a long way to go until widespread acceptance. SAF also doesn't address the problem of other emissions damaging the atmosphere at high altitudes.

As for the noise, Boom claims that the Overture will be comparable to today's subsonic airliners when they are close to the ground. During cruise, Boom has another solution. The company recently announced what it dubbed ""Boomless Cruise."" Essentially, below Mach 1.3, the sonic boom will refract upwards, away from the ground. This is made possible by software-controlled speeds and the design of Boom's in-house Symphony engine. However, the plane will generate an audible sonic boom above Mach 1.3, meaning that it can only fly at top speed over water.

How The Flaws Of The Past Are Shaping The Overture

In the 1960s, there were three major SST projects on the drawing board: Europe's Concorde, the Soviet Tupolev TU-144, and the comparatively huge Boeing 2707. The Americans got tied up in engineering challenges, bureaucracy, and cost overruns, so the 2707 didn't make it off the drawing board. The TU-144 had some problems and was pulled out of service seven months after debuting. 14 Concordes flew until 2003, but this doesn't mean that the plane was economical.

Environmentalists had raised concerns about damage to the ozone layer, which died down when it became clear that supersonic flights wouldn't become widespread. Today, the Overture's SAF capabilities should help address environmental concerns. Meanwhile, the ""Boomless Cruise"" will allow the Overture to fly supersonically overland without the sonic boom.

Furthermore, the Concorde burned so much fuel that its 100 seats had to be sold for First Class prices. British Airways made a profit by branding it as an exclusive, unique experience for the ultra-rich, made possible from its London hub and the type's rarity. Meanwhile, Boom claims that the Overture's seats can be sold for business class prices, a much easier price point to sell tickets.

The Challenges Facing The Boom Overtures

In the 20th century, a supersonic jet was a technical achievement. The Americans couldn't even get it done, and the TU-144 was plagued with technical problems. But today, it's been done. The challenge now will be to make it work economically, which is no easy feat. The engines will be the biggest factor in whether the Overture succeeds or not, and this hasn't been a smooth process for Boom.

Boom was unable to find a viable off-the-shelf design or convince a manufacturer to develop a new motor, so instead it's developing the Symphony engine in-house, with help from Kratos, StandardAero, and General Electric subsidiaries. However, designing engines is hard, and there's a reason why neither Airbus nor Boeing designs jet engines themselves. The Symphony is particularly ambitious, and Boom is promising fuel efficiency as well as the Boomless Cruise feature.

Boom will need to create a plane that works as a supersonic transport and as a proper airliner. The environmental concerns are also valid, and Boom will need to ensure that its answers work. If the plane is too polluting, then it's quite possible that it simply won't be certified, given the current state of the environment. Buying an extremely dirty plane will also be bad publicity for airlines.

The Rundown Of The Boom Overture

Boom has a major challenge ahead of itself. It needs to create a plane that is appealing for airlines to operate, while also being a thirsty supersonic jet, and it needs to address the environmental concerns. Otherwise, airlines won't buy it. The environmental concerns are real, and if not addressed, this could be a step backward in the goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions.

The biggest challenge to success will be the Symphony engine. This is an incredibly ambitious goal, and the company has taken on the challenge of developing the motor itself. If it succeeds, this will certainly be an incredible achievement. But it must address economic concerns and environmental concerns to make sense for airlines.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/why-some-environmentalists-aren-t-too-happy-with-the-comeback-of-supersonic-flights-16x9.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 13:56:36.987705

The Fawley Green Hydrogen scheme will be built on land near the Fawley oil refinery, which will use the technology to reduce its carbon emissions.

The project is a partnership between refinery owner ExxonMobil and French-based firm Hynamics, a subsidiary of EDF Group.

Hynamics will install a 120MW electrolyser, which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. All of the hydrogen produced by the plant will be supplied to the refinery ”replacing existing fossil fuels used for heating”, a Hynamics spokesperson said.

The project was shortlisted by the government’s Hydrogen Allocation Round 2 (HAR2), which allocates cash from the £240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund supporting commercial hydrogen production projects across the UK.

An ExxonMobil spokesperson said: “Among a range of lower emissions solutions, ExxonMobil has been exploring the introduction of green hydrogen at its Fawley facility.

“As a customer for the HAR2-shortlisted Fawley Green Hydrogen project, green hydrogen, made directly from renewable energy, could not only lower process emissions but also support the production of a range of lower carbon fuels including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).’’

Pierre de Raphelis-Soissan, CEO at Hynamics UK, said: “Today’s announcement reiterates the UK’s commitment to put green hydrogen at the heart of the energy transition.

“We are proud to collaborate with ExxonMobil on this project, as they are committed to reduce their carbon footprint across their major operated assets.

“The Fawley project will provide a reliable source of green hydrogen for at least 15 years, enabling the acceleration in the provision of low carbon energy at ExxonMobil petrochemicals complex, which represents a potential 100,000 tons of CO2 avoided each year.”

Hynamics’ project is among 27 shortlisted for HAR2. The company work with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero during the due diligence phase to clarify and provide further details on the “opportunity and value for money” the Fawley Green Hydrogen project is said to offer.

Der neue Forschungsansatz von Boeing ähnelt dem von Airbus.

Was Technologien für neue Flugzeugmodelle angeht, beschäftigen sich Airbus und Boeing in den vergangenen Jahren durchaus mit ähnlichen Ideen und Konzepten. Sie setzten aber unterschiedliche Schwerpunkte.

In Sachen Antrieb setzte der europäische Flugzeugbauer im großen Stil auf Wasserstoff, während der amerikanische Konkurrent sich etwas zurückhaltender gab und auf nachhaltige Kraftstoffe fokussierte. Im März trat Airbus aber in Sachen Wasserstoff auf die Bremse und kündigte an, sich vorerst ebenfalls mehr auf Sustainable Aviation Fuel oder kurz SAF zu konzentrieren.

Was die Konstruktion der Tragflächen angeht, tritt nun umgekehrt Boeing auf die Bremse und nähert sich dadurch Airbus an. So berichtete zuerst das Portal The Air Current unter Berufung auf interne Boeing-Dokumente, der Hersteller lege die Entwicklung des Zukunftsfliegers X-66 zunächst auf Eis, um seine Fachkräfte für bestehende Modelle wie 737 Max und 777X zu nutzen.

Nun hat sich auch Boeings Projektpartner Nasa geäußert. Die Raum- und Luftfahrtbehörde teilt mit, die Arbeiten am X-66-Demonstrator würden vorerst pausiert. Sie verweist auf das «komplexere» Flügelkonzept der X-66, genannt Transonic Truss-Braced Wing. Es bezeichnet einen Schulterdecker, dessen lange, dünne Tragflächen über Streben mit dem unteren Teil des Rumpfes verbunden sind.

Doch auf diese Streben wollen Boeing und Nasa nun vorerst verzichten und sich ausschließlich auf die langen, dünnen Tragflächen konzentrieren. Dazu möchten die Partner weiterhin die angeschaffte McDonnell Douglas MD-90 nutzen, um einen Demonstrator zu bauen. Das anvisierte Tragflächenkonzept soll später an verschiedenen Flugzeugen zum Einsatz kommen können.

Eine Annäherung an Airbus ist dies, weil der europäische Konzern ebenfalls an einem langen, dünnen Flügel forscht, der nicht auf ein Flugzeugmodell festgelegt ist. Airbus-Technikchefin Sabine Klauke hatte schon 2023 im Gespräch mit aeroTELEGRAPH gesagt: «Boeing hat ja angekündigt, einen Demonstrator zu fliegen. Viele der Elemente ähneln Elementen, die wir auch nutzen. Nämlich lange Flügel, die aerodynamischer sind, um die Effizienz zu steigern.»

Zum Truss-Braced-Wing sagte sie jedoch bereits damals: «Wir haben uns auch damit beschäftigt. Unsere Einschätzung ist: Einerseits gewinnt man sehr viel durch die lange und dünne Auslegung des Flügels. Andererseits hat man diesen Holm, den man für die Stabilität braucht, über den man aber auch wieder Effizienzen verliert. Und dann sind die Anbau- und Integrationskonzepte für die Triebwerke und andere Systeme ganz anders als heute.»

Mike Sinnett, Chef von Boeings Produktentwicklung, verteidigte die Streben ein Jahr später: «Sie sind kein totes Gewicht, sie sind selbst Flügel. Es sind Flügel, die Flügel hochhalten.» Das habe sich auch im Windkanal erwiesen. «Diesen Teil kennen wir, inklusive aller Wechselwirkungen oder Ineffizienzen, die mit der Strebe einhergehen», argumentierte er.

Auch seien die Streben kein Hindernis bei der Platzierung der Triebwerke. Und die hohen Tragflächen würden Vorteile bringen. «Wenn Sie sich die heutigen Flugzeuge ansehen, sei es der Neo oder die Max oder jedes andere Schmalrumpfflugzeug, sind sie durch das mögliche Nebenstromverhältnis und den Durchmesser der Triebwerke eingeschränkt», sagte Sinnett. «Wenn Sie jemals einen Open Rotor oder einen Open Fan nutzen wollen, ist das bei einem Flugzeug mit niedrigen Tragflächen wirklich schwierig, aber bei einem Flugzeug mit hohen Tragflächen wäre das sehr leicht möglich.»

All diesen Argumenten zum Trotz setzen Boeing und die Nasa ihre Arbeiten nun aber doch zunächst ohne die Streben fort. Die Hintertür: Ist das reine Tragflächenkonzept ein Erfolg wollen sich die Partner womöglich auch wieder mit den Flügelstreben beschäftigen.",https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/uaBk9kuTURBXy8wZWU4ZjhmYy0wMDQxLTQ4ODgtYjBlNi04NzU5YzZhMWQyYTMuanBlZ5KVA28AzQbxzQPolQLNBLDNAnbDw94AAaEwAg,N,,2025-04-26 13:56:45.781438

Darling Ingredients’ recent earnings call painted a mixed picture, with positive developments in cash flow and debt reduction, alongside improved performance in the feed and food segments. However, challenges in the DGD segment led to a net loss for the quarter, and market uncertainties continue to cast a shadow over the renewable fuels market. Despite these hurdles, the core business outlook remains optimistic.

Strong Cash Flow and Debt Reduction

Darling Ingredients reported a robust cash flow, enabling the company to pay down $146.2 million in debt, significantly reducing its financial leverage ratio to 3.33 times. This strategic move underscores the company’s commitment to strengthening its financial position and enhancing shareholder value.

Improved Performance in Feed and Food Segments

The earnings call highlighted notable improvements in the feed and food segments. The feed segment’s total sales increased to $896.3 million, with EBITDA rising to $110.6 million. Similarly, the food segment experienced improved margins and volumes, with EBITDA climbing to $70.9 million, reflecting the company’s operational efficiency and market demand.

Positive Outlook for Core Business

Despite some challenges, Darling Ingredients maintains a positive outlook for its core business, expecting to earn between $950 million and $1 billion of EBITDA for the year. The strong performance in March is a promising indicator of sustained momentum.

Przełomowe tankowanie samolotu typu Airbus A320 miało miejsce 23 kwietnia 2025 roku na lotnisku w Katowicach-Pyrzowicach, skąd maszyna udała się w rejs do egipskiego Marsa Alam.

Dostawę zrealizowała spółka UNIMOT Aviation, należąca do Grupy UNIMOT, stając się tym samym pierwszym operatorem na polskim rynku, który sprostał wyzwaniom nowego, unijnego otoczenia regulacyjnego.

Zgodnie z rozporządzeniem Parlamentu Europejskiego i Rady (UE) 2023/2405, już od 1 stycznia 2025 roku wszystkie unijne porty lotnicze obsługujące ponad 800 tys. pasażerów rocznie (lub 100 tys. ton cargo) będą zobowiązane do stosowania paliwa SAF w ilości nie mniejszej niż 2% całkowitej masy paliwa lotniczego. Oznacza to, że wymóg ten obejmie osiem największych lotnisk w Polsce – Katowice znalazły się w tym gronie.

SAF – przyszłość lotnictwa

SAF to paliwo powstające z odnawialnych surowców, takich jak oleje roślinne, tłuszcze zwierzęce i odpady rolnicze. Jego stosowanie pozwala na znaczne ograniczenie emisji CO₂ – nawet o 65% – co czyni je jednym z kluczowych rozwiązań w dążeniu do osiągnięcia neutralności klimatycznej sektora lotniczego do 2050 roku.

— „W Unimot Aviation dysponujemy silnym zapleczem logistycznym, które pozwala nam działać szybko i efektywnie. Chcemy być nie tylko dostawcą, ale partnerem wspierającym linie lotnicze i porty w dostosowaniu się do nowych przepisów oraz w budowie zrównoważonej przyszłości lotnictwa” – podkreślił Adam Sikorski, prezes zarządu UNIMOT S.A.

Katowice liderem infrastruktury paliwowej

Wydarzenie nieprzypadkowo miało miejsce w Katowicach. Lotnisko w Pyrzowicach już teraz inwestuje w rozwój nowoczesnej infrastruktury, w tym budowę multimodalnego węzła przeładunkowego opartego na bocznicy kolejowej. Projekt współfinansowany ze środków unijnych ma być ukończony w połowie 2026 roku.

— „To ważny sygnał dla rynku. Dzięki tej dostawie Katowice Airport stało się pierwszym lotniskiem w Polsce z fizycznym dostępem do SAF.

At first glance it looks like a shipping container, but peer closer and you may see an early glimpse of the future of more sustainable aviation.

The OX1 machine located at the UK’s Oxford Airport is the culmination of years of research into the process of converting carbon dioxide and hydrogen into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Opened in September 2024, the demonstrator can produce 1kg of liquid fuel per day. It will be followed next year by a larger demo plant at Oxford Airport and later by a commercial facility.

OXCCU, the Oxford University spinoff that developed the technology, believes it can contribute to global aviation emissions reduction as the industry eyes net emissions from operations by 2050. Aramco Ventures, the corporate venturing arm of Aramco, became an investor in OXCCU in 2023, alongside other aviation and energy industry players including United Airlines, Eni and Trafigura.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

OXCCU is scaling up a novel catalyst process to convert captured CO2 and hydrogen directly into SAF in a single step. A major challenge facing the sector has been the high cost of synthesising sustainable aviation fuels, explains OXCCU CEO and co-founder Andrew Symes, who studied chemistry at Oxford before working in commodity trading and venture capital.

He says,

What we have is a simplification of existing routes to make sustainable aviation fuel, which enables a lower cost plant and a lower operating cost process,

The OXCCU method is based on the century-old Fischer-Tropsch chemical process – but utilizing a catalyst pioneered by fellow OXCCU co-founder Dr Tiancun Xiao.

“Tiancun published a paper in 2020 that generated worldwide media coverage and which essentially showed for the first time [in the laboratory] that you could go from CO2 and hydrogen directly to the jet fuel range hydrocarbons with one catalyst in a single step – avoiding the need to make intermediates such as carbon monoxide or methanol. That is really where the cost reduction lies and sits behind our core technology,”

While other pathways have higher capital costs due to multiple steps, as well as higher operating costs linked to lower hydrogen efficiency, OXCCU says its approach requires less hydrogen input per amount of jet fuel, which could reduce capital and operating costs, leading to a lower Power-to-Liquid (PtL) SAF.

Net zero challenge

These are important considerations as global air traffic continues to rise and the aviation industry assesses different carbon reduction technologies. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that in order to achieve its 2050 net-zero emissions target, some 65% of the total emissions reductions will in all probability need to be achieved using SAF.

Demand for the fuel may be dictated by a number of factors including the pace of legislative requirements to adopt more sustainable fuels mandated by governments worldwide as well as the voluntary uptake of the fuels by private jet operators.

Symes, says:

We will probably see the emergence of markets where SAF is mandated and we may also see voluntary demand that could also be facilitated by the airlines and fuel suppliers, driven by corporates choosing to buy SAF to offset their Scope 3 emissions,

With much of the current feedstock for sustainable aviation fuels coming from sources such as used cooking oil and agricultural waste, the focus is turning to emerging technologies that may help in satisfying what is expected to be sharply rising demand.

Symes believes the OXCCU demonstrator is an important milestone in that journey and can be scaled up and combined with industrial facilities to utilize point source carbon dioxide emissions.

He says,

The ultimate goal is to have a plant in operation with our technology by the end of the decade,

Aramco is an investor in a number of startups supporting innovation in the energy and mobility sectors.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

EMEA

One step forward, two steps back? – The UK government proposal to allow offshore wind developers who haven’t yet secured planning consent to bid into the auction process going forward risks increasing the risk that winning bidders may not end up being able to actually build the project, said Henrik Andersen, CEO of Vestas. Even if they do build one, it may be on a more delayed timeline than in the past, he told Bloomberg. Previous auctions that fix power prices for 15 years have only included fully permitted projects, so this proposed change would deviate from that. The UK has the largest offshore wind capacity in Europe largely thanks to the success of its auction system, though it hasn’t been without hurdles, and Andersen said there needs to be consistency going forward.

More than expected – Holcim reported better than forecast first quarter profit on Friday, with CEO Milijan Gutovic telling reporters the company was well prepared to navigate tariff disruption due to the localised nature of its business. In its last results before spinning off its North American business Amrize, the Swiss maker of building materials posted recurring operating profit of 515 mln Swiss francs ($619 mln) for 1Q 2025, beating forecasts for 494 mln francs in a company-compiled consensus.

Top Forest – Finnish forestry group Stora Enso’s first-quarter operating profit beat market expectations on Friday, though it said that US President Donald Trump’s tariffs would lead to subdued market demand. CEO Hans Sohlstrom said the direct impact of the current tariff rates was limited, as the company’s sales to the US account for just below 3% of group sales in 2024. The CEO said the key is to reposition and renegotiate prices in the US to compensate for tariffs. Its shares were up 1% on Friday morning. Stora also said its expected ramp-up of its new packaging board line in Oulu, Finland, will have a negative impact of around €100 mln on its annual adjusted operating profit. (Reuters)

No to dirty ads – A Dutch city successfully defended the world’s first law to ban fossil fuel advertising, setting a precedent for other cities across Europe. The Hague introduced a high-carbon ad ban, outlawing any publicly and privately funded advertising for petrol and diesel, aviation, and cruise ships. The Dutch trade association for travel agencies and the travel company TUI filed lawsuits against the ban. (NL Times)

Cut the fossils – ClientEarth lawyers are urging the EU Commission to revise its proposed Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework (CISAF), warning it enables fossil gas subsidies and lacks essential environmental safeguards. The CISAF aims to simplify approval for state aid in renewable energy and clean tech, but ClientEarth says it falls short of supporting a truly green transition. “Europe claims to be enabling a cleaner industry, yet current State aid rules go as far as to explicitly endorse fossil gas as a decarbonisation solution,” said ClientEarth lawyer Stephanie Nieuwbourg.. “Taxpayers money should be directed to genuinely sustainable projects.” The framework, like the current Climate, Energy and Environmental Aid Guidelines (CEEAG), still allows support for fossil gas infrastructure labeled ‘hydrogen-ready’ – a loophole that could lock in fossil fuel use, according to ClientEarth. “It’s a missed opportunity to take real action to prevent aid from supporting environmentally harmful activities, including fossil gas use,” Nieuwbourg added. ClientEarth calls on the Commission to strengthen the framework before today’s consultation deadline, 25 April.

ASIA PACIFIC

For sale – Malaysia’s Bursa Carbon Exchange (BCX) has announced the inaugural auction of the nation’s first technology-based carbon credits from a methane avoidance project, scheduled for June 18. Developed by Cenergi SEA Berhad and Monsoon Carbon and registered under Verra, the project aims to reduce GHG emissions from industrial facilities by capturing biogas generated in open wastewater treatment systems, and preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere, the exchange said in an email. The first project activity is located in Langkap, Perak state.

SAF procurement – Taiwan-headquartered EVA Air has signed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) procurement agreements with three suppliers: Associated Energy Group (AEG FUELS), COSMO Oil Marketing, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation, according to a company statement. The airline’s flights departing from Europe have been operating with a 2% SAF blend since Q1 2025, and the new agreements will further broaden the use of SAF within its global operations. EVA Air said it will begin SAF integration at key hubs in North America, Japan, and Taiwan from Q2 this year.

Reservation – Japan GX Group, which operates a carbon credit marketplace, has obtained a patent it claims can allow its corporate clients to have “reservation rights” to J-Credits that are not yet issued, according to a statement released this week. Securing carbon credits in advance will make it easier to formulate and execute mid- to long-term plans as well as hedge the risk of price increases, the company said, adding it aims to launch a product based on the patent by FY2027.

Nuclear push – India is considering allowing foreign companies to own up to 49% of its nuclear power plants, Reuters reported, in a bid to rapidly expand atomic capacity and cut carbon emissions. The move would require amendments to the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act and the Atomic Energy Act, which the government aims to push through Parliament’s monsoon session. Domestic firms including Reliance, Tata Power, Adani, and Vedanta have also discussed investing about $26 bln into the sector, currently a state monopoly with just over 8 GW capacity.

AMERICAS

New E15 push – A group of US House members is reigniting a push to allow the year-round sale of E15 fuels – or gasoline blended with 15% ethanol. A group of 25 lawmakers announced this week that they are asking the White House to permit the sale of E15 fuels from June 1 to Sep. 15 across the nation. In February, the administration affirmed it would allow the year-round sales across eight Midwest states beginning Apr. 28. It’s not the first time the House has pushed for an expanded measure. Last year, a bipartisan group of representatives introduced legislation that would have allowed the year-round sale of E15 fuels, although the bill died in committee.

“Just” credits – International carbon registry Verra is planning a May launch of a new methodology for the accelerated retirement of coal-fired power plants using a just transition, it said. It will be the first “people-centered transition credit methodology” in the world, it added. Transition credits, a new type of credit, championed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is meant to drive early shutdowns of coal-fired power plants and must be priced at a minimum of $30 per tonne of CO2e, for them to be viable, according to experts.

China biochar credits – China’s first biochar carbon credit project, which registered on Puro on Thursday, has issued its initial batch of 330 CORCs. Developed by MioTech with Nanjing Nian’da Environmental Technology and Nanjing Forestry University, the project converts agricultural waste into biochar for carbon storage and soil improvement. The facility plans to expand production to 4,500 CORCs annually by 2027. MioTech is also targeting 50,000 tons of CDR credits by 2027 across several carbon removal methods. Separately, Puro on Thursday announced a partnership with French platform CrystalChain to strengthen digital MRV and streamline CORC issuance.

Woodland Code update – The UK’s Woodland Carbon Code is having a refresh with a new version under development. A consultation on version 3 of the code will open next week with proposed changes including: updating rules to encourage more projects on crofted land, updating data in the additionality cashflow spreadsheet, providing clearer information on requirements and guidance, and changing the minimum duration for projects in line with international standards. The draft version will be shared next week. Announcement here.

Philanthropic gestures – Non-profit Planete Urgence has launched ‘Climate Philanthropy’, a new climate action financing tool for companies to contribute towards climate action projects such as mangrove restoration without using carbon markets. The tool is built on a “100% virtuous contribution logic”, whereby companies finance projects outside their value chain and receive an impact certificate that documents the carbon measurement of the project over 10 years and other indicators related to biodiversity and human development. The certificate can then be integrated into usual reporting and evaluation frameworks. More details here.

Drop-in fuels are developed to be chemically identical to conventional fuels, making them compatible with existing engine and power unit technologies.
“When we speak about sustainable fuels, we need to make sure that the full life cycle of the production remains sustainable,” Michot continues.
Both Championships will continue to use Aramco’s 100% Advanced Sustainable Fuels for now, but both will eventually adopt fully synthetic fuel.
“Using sustainable fuel has not increased the cost of seasons in Formula 2 or Formula 3.","Innovation in Formula 1 goes beyond the looks of the cars and, with looming regulation changes on the horizon, fuels are becoming an ever-increasing focus for teams and power unit manufacturers in the chase for performance.

As they balance championship aspirations in 2025 with the creation of the all-new cars for the 2026 regulation change, the fuels set to be used in F1 in 2026 are already powering the FIA Formula 2 and Formula 3 Championships.

In a collaboration with Aramco, the Advanced Sustainable Fuel active in both Championships has reached a new impressive standard, with all 52 cars running on 100% sustainable fuel.

It is a massive step forward in the development of the type of fuel that will be used in Formula 1 next season, and has exceeded expectations, as F2 and F3 CEO Bruno Michel explains.

“It’s been going very, very well. We started this partnership with Aramco a few years ago, started with a 55% sustainable fuel, and it was part of the plan to make sure we were arriving at 100% normally in 2026.

“But because of the fantastic job Aramco has been doing, we’ve been able to anticipate it and do it this season, which has been a great thing.”

Both of the junior categories have been used as a testbed for F1 in the past, such as with the increased size of the 18-inch Pirelli tyres, first used in F2 in 2020 before F1 adopted the same tyre size from 2022.

Just as Pirelli were able to develop the larger F1 tyre compound based on the findings generated in F2, the use of Aramco’s 100% Advanced Sustainable Fuels in F2 and F3 has been developed to be ‘drop-in’.

Drop-in fuels are developed to be chemically identical to conventional fuels, making them compatible with existing engine and power unit technologies. They remove the need for any major modifications to the cars to use them, and reduce CO2 emissions in the process.

FIA Director of Single Seaters Nikolas Tombazis says the work done in F2 is directly relevant to what will come in F1, allowing the governing body to gather data ahead of the introduction of such fuels in Formula 1 next season.

“Making sure the performance is fairly similar in Formula 2 is an important first step. The fact that the fuel is drop-in fuel is important. In addition, there are some relatively minor aspects related to reliability, fuel tanks and stuff like that, maybe there's some small chemical differences.

READ MORE: F2 and F3 CEO Bruno Michel on F1’s ‘exceptional’ rookie intake and why Bearman’s super-sub showing was so vital

“It's important to check to make sure we don't have any issues on the cars. These lessons Formula 2 are learning, I think, are taken note of for Formula 1. So that's important.”

Crucially however, the fuels used in F2 and F3 have not come at the cost of any performance, in accordance with the targets set by the Championships.

F2 and F3 Technical Director Pierre-Alain Michot says the collaboration with technical partners has been a big success, with the product used on track this season ahead of schedule and performing as expected.

“The clear target was to have no impact on performance and for Mecachrome, our engine partner, to make sure that the engine was as reliable as before,” Michot explains.

“We worked quite hard with Mecachrome and Aramco to make sure that we could define a good formula for this fuel. We tested several different fuels, did a lot of mileage on the dyno and in the development car before releasing it on the track and on 52 cars.

F2: Verschoor makes last-lap pass for Jeddah Feature Race win

“It proved to be quite successful, the performance is there, the reliability is there, so we just need to continue on this path.”

While Formula 1 and the FIA has been watching closely, the use of drop-in and fully sustainable fuels have the potential to have an even wider importance in the automotive industry.

Development of such fuel could pave the way for adaptation for mass market use that would eventually filter through to road car use.

Part of that adoption process is already underway, as Aramco continues to work on their development of the fuel whilst, at the same time, ensuring the process of creating the fuel is just as sustainable as the product itself.

“When we speak about sustainable fuels, we need to make sure that the full life cycle of the production remains sustainable,” Michot continues. “Aramco is working that out as well, to make sure that the energy needed to produce this sustainable and synthetic fuel comes from sustainable energy as well.

F2: Lindblad becomes youngest winner in Formula 2 history as he inherits maiden victory in Jeddah Sprint

“That’s part of the journey, and they are making sure that the full cycle [of producing the fuel] is sustainable and not just the final product. That’s one of the main targets and the biggest challenge to achieve that.”

“Aramco are working really hard to build more plants to make sure they can produce sustainable fuel at a wider range. For now, it’s quite a niche market but the aim is to make it for mass market.

“We do that by going step-by-step and they are working out how to make it happen in the near future.”

While Formula 1 teams gear up to adopt their own sustainable fuels for 2026, Formula 2 and 3 will continue to press on with Aramco, with the next target already in sight.

Both Championships will continue to use Aramco’s 100% Advanced Sustainable Fuels for now, but both will eventually adopt fully synthetic fuel.

That development is already well underway and holds exciting potential not just for the future of the FIA single seater pyramid and Formula 1, but the wider automotive industry.

“The next step is synthetic fuel,” Michel confirms. “That’s the next step in our development programme with Aramco and we are still working with them on that flat out at the moment.

“Using sustainable fuel has not increased the cost of seasons in Formula 2 or Formula 3. Aramco is supplying this fuel free of charge to the teams. So instead of increasing costs, it’s diminished the cost of the season.”

Tombazis adds that it has been a hugely useful learning experience for the FIA to have Aramco’s fuel used in Formula 2 and Formula 3 ahead of F1 adopting such fuels from ’26.

While each team will be developing their own fuels in collaboration with their own technical partners, the performance levels, positive environmental factors, and high level of competitiveness of both Championships bodes well for Formula 1 in 2026.

EXPLAINED: What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel and why is F1 investing in it?

“It’s quite an interesting and complicated process. Of course, in Formula 1, we are delighted in the FIA there’s an opening grant from Formula 2 with Aramco and we’re very respectful of this process.

“That's the additional challenge in Formula 1, and I think it's very useful that these initial steps taken in the lower categories. I think we'll complete the picture next year when Formula 1 makes this big step.”",https://media.formula1.com/image/upload/t_16by9South/f_auto/q_auto/v1745588591/fom-website/2025/Formula%202/GettyImages-2211119217.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 08:56:08.831283

The airplane also is expected to integrate readily into today's airport infrastructure, requiring no new accommodations for jet bridges, runways or taxiways.

In 2023, the U.S. Air Force announced a $235 million contract to JetZero to fast-track the development of JetZero's full scale demonstrator.

The JetZero Z4 airplane is designed to accommodate 250 passengers and fly on conventional jet fuel, with propulsion systems able to utilize sustainable aviation fuel blends.

United's corporate venture capital fund, United Airlines Ventures (UAV) enables the airline to invest in emerging companies that have the potential to influence the future of travel.

UAV has made a number of alternative aircraft investments including:

Hybrid-electric

Hydrogen-powered

Electric Air Taxis (eVTOLs)

Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures (UAV), said:

""If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,""

""United Airlines Ventures® was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.""

Tom O'Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero, said:

""United's investment in our company signals the industry's belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,""

""JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.""

The design contributes to a more efficient operation due to its shape and the higher altitude at which it will fly.

The aircraft design has the potential to also offer improvements to the passenger experience like flexible seating options, larger seats across all classes and dedicated overhead bin space for each seat.

Additionally, the design streamlines the boarding process with a main boarding door that is wider than that of a comparably sized aircraft, leading to multiple aisles and passenger cabin bays for more efficient passenger distribution.

It may further enhance accessibility by featuring wider aisles and handicap-accessible lavatories, creating a comfortable travel environment for all passengers and in-flight crew.

Delta Air Lines is also partnering with JetZero, expecting a more sustainable aircraft as a part of the plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://fl360aero.com/upload/blogs/2085_GpYrZooaIAAMC5W.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 08:56:13.570135

During the last month of Q1 2025, the manufacturer delivered 71 aircraft to 37 customers, with orders of up to 211 aircraft. By the end of March 2025, the A330neo had received over 1,800 firm orders from more than 130 customers across the globe.

Throughout the year, Airbus has delivered four A330-900s to CIT Leasing (Malaysia Airlines), Delta Air Lines, Cebu Pacific, and another one to CIT Leasing. As with Airbus’ other new-generation aircraft, the A330 family can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and targets 100% compatibility by 2030.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/a330neo-first-flight-take-off-4.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 10:56:09.451075

Up next? A plane that's essentially one giant wing.

The airline on Thursday unveiled a plan to buy up to 200 of the 'blended-wing body' aircraft from California-based aerospace startup JetZero. The startup wants to compete with Airbus and Boeing by creating a plane that burns half the fuel of a similarly sized, traditional tube-and-wing plane.

The 250-passenger ""Z4"" aircraft is not yet certified, but the company is aiming for a 2030 commercial launch and successfully flew a subscale prototype in 2024.

Andrew Chang, the managing director of United Airlines Ventures, the division that funds these innovation-focused investments, told Business Insider the Z4's oversized wing could create a ""living room in the sky.""

""Everything around the customer travel experience — how they sit in the plane, board, and deplane, and how [crewmembers] serve them — can be reinvented around the new space within this new aircraft design,"" he said.

Chang added that the conditional purchase agreement relies on JetZero's ability to prove its revolutionary design with a full-sized demonstrator by 2027 and meet United's operational and business requirements on things like cost, fuel burn, and safety.

But he was confident JetZero, which the US Air Force has also backed, could deliver: ""If you look at the management team, there's a lot of institutional experience and knowledge there from companies like Airbus and Boeing.""

More wing means more cabin real estate

JetZero's futuristic plane combines the wings and fuselage into a single lifting surface. This unique airframe dramatically widens the cabin, allowing United to accommodate over a dozen seats per row.

Widebody passenger aircraft today max out at 10-abreast rows. The densest configuration ever proposed was 11 seats across on the world's largest commercial airliner, the Airbus A380 — though no carriers signed on.

The Z4 will be shorter than traditional dual-aisle planes. Chang said that instead of 20 or 30 rows of seats, there may be only 10 or 15.

There would also be more aisles for navigating the cabin, and up to four entry doors, improving boarding and deplaning efficiency.

Chang added that there would be economy and premium seats with Starlink WiFi and media to create a living-room-like vibe and likely some reimagined spaces: ""Every square foot of real estate, you want to have revenue passengers on it,"" he said.

It's unclear what new spaces United could develop, but JetZero competitor Natilus has some ideas for its in-development 200-person blended-wing aircraft design called Horizon.

Speaking to BI in October, Natilus CEO Aleksey Matyushev said Horizon could accommodate lounge or playroom areas. He added that this could offset the possible complaint of the longer rows reducing the number of window seats.

Delta Air Lines is also working with JetZero as a partner developer. It said the cabin could accommodate accessible seats and lavatories, and dedicated overhead bin space for every passenger.

Alaska Airlines' investment, which also has the option for plane orders, said the airframe would provide a quieter flying experience.

JetZero could replace some of United's old Boeing planes

JetZero said its Z4 plane's better lift and lower drag could cut fuel burn by up to 50% per passenger mile while still flying up to about 5,750 miles nonstop. It would use conventional jet engines and run on traditional or sustainable aviation fuel.

Chang said this efficiency and subsequent cost cuts could make the new jet a replacement for midsize airplanes like the Boeing 757 and the Boeing 767. United plans to retire these older aircraft by 2026 and 2030, respectively.

For example, United said in a press release that a flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Palma de Mallorca, Spain, would use up to 45% less fuel than the twin-aisle aircraft flying the route today.

United's Boeing 767 operates that summer seasonal transatlantic trek. JetZero's new aircraft could take over, and it would fit into the existing airport infrastructure on both sides of the pond.

JetZero's expected commercialization is years away. United plans to take on next-generation aircraft like the Airbus A321XLR and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner as more immediate and reliable replacements for the 757 and 767.

If certified, JetZero's aircraft would provide United with another high-range, high-capacity, and cost-effective fleet option that could comfortably sit in between.

It would have more range and capacity than the A321XLR but less than United's 787-9 and 787-10. The Z4 could hold a handful more people than the airline's smallest Dreamliner variant, the 787-8.

That’s why getting to that next step, the next phase of growth, will come with the XLR.” Air Canada sees the small single-aisle A220, assembled in Mirabel, Que., as the backbone of its modern fleet.","The immense Airbus manufacturing site in Hamburg, Germany, is a city unto itself. Several of the 18,000 employees who work here refer to it as a “town within a town,” with low-slung office buildings set on modern cobbled roads, near spotless aircraft hangars, cacophonous assembly lines, restaurants, cafeterias, and—naturally—an adjoining airport.

“Only the hairdresser is missing,” an Airbus staffer joked on a tour in early April, where Skies was the only Canadian aviation publication with exclusive, behind-the-scenes access.

Hamburg is the second-largest Airbus factory in Europe, after the facility in Toulouse, France, that also holds the company’s Commercial Aircraft headquarters. Its nearly 100 buildings are snugly packed onto about 3.7 square kilometres of land, the size of about 1,000 soccer fields.

“It’s like a little island, all built on water,” another tour member said, referencing the site’s northern border on Elbe River, and smaller waterways along its south and eastern fringes.

Hamburg is the nerve centre of the Airbus A320 family of narrowbody airliners, where structural assembly and final assembly of the A319, A320, A321, A321LR and A321XLR (extra long-range) is carried out in efficient, carefully regimented shifts.

The site is also crucial to the widebody A330 and A350 programmes; the forward and rear fuselages of both types are manufactured and equipped in Hamburg before delivery to Toulouse in massive Airbus A330 airlifters (better-known as the BelugaXL).

Also in Hamburg: the A320 and A330 cabin definition centre and design studio, where airline clients from around the world meet with Airbus staff to firm up the interior layout of new aircraft orders—everything from seating configuration to lavatory fixtures and carpet fabric.

“It’s really the place for cabin definition,” said Alexander Jürs, manager, Customer Service and Communication at Airbus. “There’s one place in the world for Airbus where do we do it, and that’s here in Hamburg.”

Today, it’s the XLR that grabs most of the attention, thanks in part to a small delegation from Air Canada that includes Alexandre Lefevre, vice-president, Network Planning and Fleet Strategy.

“The XLR will give us the ability to open up new destinations, open up new markets,” said Lefevre. “There is a perfect match between that product and what we need.”

YEAR-ROUND ROUTES

Air Canada is betting on the XLR as a game-changer, integral to an ambitious growth strategy to open up year-round transatlantic service and add new overseas routes. The airline currently offers seasonal routes to Europe in widebody aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A330, but those are typically only profitable in summer, when demand is high.

Overseas traffic dips considerably in winter and the shoulder seasons, but Air Canada believes it could still sustain routes on a narrowbody like the XLR, which boasts a range of 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 kilometres), seating capacity between 180 and 244 passengers, and 30 percent less fuel burn and operating costs than previous-generation aircraft.

“It gives airlines the possibility to use it for secondary airports, to use it together with their widebodies,” said Suchithra Raman, single-aisle marketing manager, Commercial and International, at Airbus.

“Going that far on a single-aisle aircraft with single-aisle economics, is something completely new. It’s a game-changer for the world.”

Air Canada is also openly working to become one of the world’s top 10 airlines, as measured by available seat miles, and sees the XLR as key to achieving that goal. At the time of writing, the airline was ranked No. 13 in the world by ASM, slightly behind British Airways but ahead of Lufthansa and Air France.

“Size matters in the industry,” said Lefevre in a sit-down interview. “When you get to be a bigger airline, you’ve got bigger purchasing power, you’ve got a bigger footprint, more connections. The more connections we offer, the more passengers we can attract, our loyalty program gets bigger— everything gets enhanced by the size of the airline.”

“It’s not a race to be the biggest,” he added. “In our case, we feel like the volume and the spread of the airline will help all the commercial parts of the company to be more successful.”

Air Canada’s first XLR is on the assembly line in Hamburg, and is expected for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2025, on a lease from Air Lease Corporation. The airline has ordered 30 XLRs in total, a mixture of owned and leased aircraft.

It’s expected the XLR will enter service within three months of delivery, potentially grabbing market share from U.S. and European competitors by attracting transatlantic customers who normally connect through U.S. airports.

“When you look at Toronto and Montreal, our two main transatlantic hubs, they’re really on the shortest path on the transatlantic,” said Lefevre.

“Almost all the flights from the U.S. overfly Toronto and Montreal … [with the XLR] you get the range to serve so many of those destinations.”

EXTRA-LONG RANGE

The XLR is based on the A321neo (a lower-case acronym for new engine option), and entered service in 2024 with Spanish carrier Iberia and Ireland’s Aer Lingus.

It shares the A321neo’s option for twin Pratt & Whitney GTF or CFM International LEAP-1A turbofan engines, can operate with the same crew, and has 86 percent commonality for spare parts, Airbus said. It claims all the features of a modern long-range aircraft, with lie-flat business class seats, wider economy seats, and larger overhead bins.

The main difference-maker is its 12,960-litre rear centre tank (RCT), which enables 15 percent more range than the A321LR (long-range) version and 30 percent more range than the base-level A321neo, in the same came cargo space as two additional centre tanks (ACTs).

“On the A321LR, you had the option of putting up to three ACTs,” said Raman. “But that meant you’re putting a box within a box in your cargo compartment. In terms of efficiency, the XLR beats that, because this is integrated into the fuselage.”

Due to the extra fuel capacity, the XLR’s maximum takeoff weight increases to 101 tonnes (101,000 kilograms). Pilots can adjust the aircraft’s multi-function control and display unit (MCDU) for more efficient take-off performance, and the aircraft has some physical differences from the rest of the A320 family including an inboard single-slotted flap, and reinforced landing gear to accommodate heavier loads.

The aircraft’s 11-hour maximum flight can connect any European market to Toronto and Montreal, with 30 percent fewer carbon dioxide emissions per seat, 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel compatibility, and a 50 percent quieter noise footprint, according to Airbus.

It also enables direct flights to Paris and London from Calgary and Vancouver, though Air Canada is more closely eyeing transpacific routes from its B.C. hub.

“On a per-seat basis, it’s way cheaper to fly widebodies,” said Lefevre, noting trip cost and cost-per-seat are key metrics. “But if you cannot fill the widebody, the equation doesn’t work … if the demand is not that strong, I need to right size my trip cost.”

“The XLR is a nice fit for us.”

EUROPEAN EXPANSION

Canada’s vast geography and small population have long bedevilled domestic carriers, but the country’s winter climate is also a major concern for international travel. A flight to Montreal from Toulouse can seem idyllic in July or August; less so in grey, bone-chilling November.

“We’re flying widebodies at 250 to 300 seats for each flight, and that’s too much [in the winter],” said Lefevre. “When you get a platform like the XLR, you get to offer the number of seats [to match] demand, and you can also offer more frequency.”

Air Canada projects offering five weekly flights from Montreal to Toulouse year-round with the XLR, and plans to significantly grow its Montreal hub by adding service to key markets in South America and northern Africa.

Target destinations include Lima, Peru; Dakar, Senegal; Marrakech, Morocco; Madeira, Portugal; and Malaga, Spain; along with secondary markets in northwestern Europe like Edinburgh, Scotland, and Nantes and Marseilles, France.

“You’re going to see the XLR also flying in North America,” noted Lefevre.

“Having that lie-flat premium and efficient experience on transcontinental flights from Toronto and Montreal to cities like Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, San [Francisco], LAX — you’re going to see that product going through. We’re also looking at opportunities on the leisure side.”

As part of a bid to boost its customer experience, Air Canada is rolling out a new “glowing hearted” cabin design across much of its fleet, aimed at conveying Canadian values like friendliness, hospitality, and emotional warmth.

“The glowing-hearted concept (is) about being consistent across the whole journey,” said Lefevre.

“But it’s also about showing our values. I think all airlines are trying to differentiate themselves, and showing who we truly are. We’re Canadian, we’re welcoming, and that’s really something we want to showcase — warm, Canadian feeling and the welcoming experience that Canadians can deliver.”

XLR ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE

In a far-flung section of a hushed assembly line in Hamburg, Lefevre stepped into the XLR fuselage for the first time. He was visibly pleased to see the aircraft, still very much a work in progress, which Air Canada initially ordered in 2022.

Deliveries were slated to begin in the first quarter of 2024, with the final aircraft arriving in 2027. Those dates have been pushed back, and the airline has been vocal about its eagerness to integrate the XLR into its fleet as soon as possible.

Air Canada is in the midst of a major fleet expansion, with 91 new aircraft scheduled to arrive over the next four years. This includes 31 Canadian-made Airbus A220s, 11 Boeing 787-10 Dreamliners, 11 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, and one 787-9 Dreamliner.

“Some of them will replace older aircraft, but the vast majority will come for growth,” said Lefevre. “We will be growing the airline more than five percent every year.”

The XLR makes up roughly a third of the aircraft in this planned expansion, with 15 to be leased through Air Lease Corporation, five leased through AerCap, and six being acquired in a purchase agreement that includes the rights to acquire 14 more of the type.

“It’s going to help us on the next phase,” said Lefevre. “We’re at a phase now where we feel we’re covering all the big markets — all the big dots. The next opportunity may be less obvious, because the demand is smaller. That’s why getting to that next step, the next phase of growth, will come with the XLR.”

Air Canada sees the small single-aisle A220, assembled in Mirabel, Que., as the backbone of its modern fleet. But the XLR is seen as an ideal complement to the A220’s continental connectivity.

“The XLR is kind of the extension of the A220 story we’ve got in North America,” said Lefevre. “If you are a passenger connecting from the U.S.— you live in Dallas, and you want to go to any point in Europe, you board an A220, connect in Montreal, and you get to the final destination on an XLR.”

“That’s a combination that will give us a lot of new origin-destination pairs.”",https://assets.skiesmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/A321neo_ACA1.jpg,N,,2025-04-26 08:56:26.325902

Naig was a guest Friday on the Iowa PBS show “Iowa Press,” where he also discussed the challenges facing Iowa’s agricultural economy, bird flu and eminent domain.

Naig, a Republican and native Iowan, has been ag secretary since 2018 and was reelected in 2022.

No official bid for governor

Naig said the announcement from Gov. Kim Reynolds that she would not be seeking reelection came as “a bit of a surprise” that has caused him to pause and consider the possibility of running for the position.

“I still, at this stage of my life, I want to be of service to the state of Iowa, and I want to think about the best ways that I can do that,” Naig said.

Naig said at this time the discussion is on his “side of the table” with family, friends and supporters to decide if a run for governor is the best path forward.

When pressed for more details, like staff and campaign strategies in the event of gubernatorial bid, Naig said he’s not to that point.

“This is around my kitchen table, this is about me getting into a planter tractor here in the next couple weeks and giving a lot of thought to it,” Naig said. “That’s not to say we’re not talking to a lot of folks.”

Naig said Republicans in Iowa have a deep bench of potential candidates. Attorney General Brenna Bird, Sen. Mike Bousselot, House Speaker Pat Grassley, and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann have said they are considering the gig.

Changes impacting ag in Iowa

Naig said the agricultural economy in Iowa is “tough” and while there were positive trade outcomes from the first Trump administration’s foreign policy, Iowa farmers are in a worse position now to weather potential trade wars.

“We don’t have the kind of buffer in our ag economy — profitability and margins are not where they were even then, today,” Naig said. “There’s not a lot of room to absorb that shock.”

Naig said this was a message sent to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins during her recent visit to Iowa, and that the ag department should be ready to support farmers.

Naig said he is “encouraged” by the countries that are coming to the table to negotiate better trade deals, and hopes to see greater domestic consumption of ag commodities by expanding the ethanol industry and branching into sustainable aviation fuel.

“What you hope and certainly what we’re advocating for is unleashing that domestic consumption, but needing to make sure that we’ve got an expanded trade portfolio as well,” Naig said.

Naig said India could be a potential “game changer” if the country were able to make a trade agreement with the country.

Bird flu

The nation is in its fourth year of an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which has impacted more than 168 million birds nationally.

Naig said he is considering options, like a vaccine for birds, now that he was not willing to consider three years ago. He also said there needs to be more people in the animal industries sector of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to respond to outbreaks like HPAI.

The Iowa secretary said he did not believe a “herd immunity” approach, which has been suggested by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was “a workable solution” to the bird flu.

Other issues

Naig has been pushing for the Legislature to expand the Choose Iowa program, which helps to market and support Iowa grown products and producers.

One of its programs is similar to the recently cut federal Local Food for School and Local Food Purchase Assistance programs, which were COVID-era funds to help schools and local institutions purchase from local farmers.

Naig said he hopes the Choose Iowa versions, which this year were just pilot programs, could be a permanent program, funded through regular appropriations rather than short-term funding pools.

“We want something that can actually stand the test of time, be around, be something that you can plan for,” Naig said.

Naig also addressed the issue of eminent domain, which has been a growing topic of debate across the state, particularly in relation to a carbon sequestration pipeline that has planned more than 1,000 miles of pipeline in the state.

“It should be rare,” Naig said. “It should be the least desirable option to get something done, and there should be overwhelming voluntary agreements in place before something like a project — any project with eminent domain — would go forward.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-83/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/naig-on-iowa-press-1024x6611745618586.png?h=21017897&itok=R-eoxw0B,N,,2025-04-26 08:56:39.194551

Abstract

:

The development of new technologies for the production of renewable energy is fundamental to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, the search for new energy generation methods that are environmentally responsible, socially rational, and economically viable is gaining momentum in order to mitigate carbon footprint. The aviation sector is responsible for a significant fraction of greenhouse gas emissions; for this reason, the decarbonisation of this sector must be investigated using biorefinery models. This study presents a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for optimising the design and configuration of the supply chain in different states of Brazil for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green diesel and gasoline, using microalgae cultivated in sugarcane vinasse as the raw material. The technology of hydrothermal liquefaction was assessed in terms of its capacity to convert microalgae without need for the energy-intensive drying step. The MILP model was developed in the LINGO v.20 software using a library of physical and economic process models. We consider the selection of processes based on the object of total minimum cost, with optimal production plant scaling and regional supply chain design, including an assessment of resources and final product distribution. A case study was implemented in Brazil, considering different regions of the country and its local demands for fuels. São Paulo is the most profitable state, with a cash flow of 1071.09 and an IRR of 36.19%, far outperforming the rest. Transport emissions alone represent between 0.6 and 8.6% of emissions generated by the model. The costs of raw materials, mainly hydrogen (57%) and electricity (27%) represent the main costs evaluated in the model. The production cost (MUS$/TJ biofuel) is in the range of 0.009–0.011. Finally, changes in the cost of electricity have the greatest impact on the model.

1. Introduction

The depletion of fossil fuels, waste generation, increasing energy demands, and cli-mate change mitigation have raised concerns about sustainable and renewable energy pro-duction [1,2], and the energy transition will help in proper waste management and the development of a green economy [3]. Biomass (referring to those organic materials that can be converted into useful energy) is a green and sustainable renewable resource [4]. About 89% of biomass is used as heat in combustion, 7% is used as transportation fuel, and 4% is used to produce electricity [5]. Renewable energies such as biomass fuel (biofuels) have high potential to replace fossil fuels, [6] and have the advantage of being renewable sources of carbon [7]. Biofuels include liquid (biodiesel, bioethanol, bio-oil), solid (biochar, pellets), and gaseous (biogas, syngas) fuels and can be used to generate power and heat, or as a transportation fuel [3,6]. Biofuels are obtained through the conversion of biomass, which includes algae biomass, animal residues, wastes, and lignocellulosic biomass. Depending on their feedstock, nature, and properties, the biofuels produced from them can be divided into four categories: first-, second-, third-, and fourth-generation fuels [8,9,10].

Sugarcane is one of the main crops worldwide and Brazil is its largest producer, fol-lowed by India, China, and Thailand [11]. Sugarcane is mainly used for the production of sugar and alcohol. However, an important by-product of the sugarcane industry is bagasse, a fibrous material that is used as a raw material for renewable energy production [12]. In addition to bagasse, vinasse is another by-product of the sugarcane industry that can be used for energy generation [13]. It is estimated that for every litre of ethanol, be-tween 10 and 14 L of vinasse are produced [14,15]. This by-product has a high organic content; therefore, it is not advisable to dispose of it in water bodies. Among its main uses, vinasse has potential for biogas production through anaerobic digestion [1,16] and can also be used as a culture medium for the production of microalgae biomass [17].

Microalgae are microorganisms that use sunlight and carbon dioxide to generate chemical energy while producing oxygen, i.e., they store the sun’s energy in the form of organic compounds such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These compounds can then be used as a source of energy or feedstock for biofuels [18,19,20]. They are considered as fundamental sources of biomass for biofuel production because of their enormous benefits: (1) they can be cultivated in fresh and salt water; (2) they display high growth and production rates compared to other plants; (3) they require less water consumption for growth than terrestrial crops; and (4) cultivation is possible in the absence of terrestrial soil [21]. These types of microorganisms are used in various fields such as agriculture, food, medicine, and cosmetics [22]. In this sense, due to the energy, environmental, and economic crisis, microalgae biomass biorefineries represent a potential viable solution to this crisis. Therefore, one way to valorise the different sugarcane by-products is through the development of biorefineries to produce biochemicals and/or profitable biofuels [23]. Brazil is one of the pioneer countries in the biofuels market and its biorefinery infrastructure is a base for the implementation of various methodologies linked to large-scale biofuel production [24,25]. The term biorefinery encompasses networks of facilities that integrate different processes and equipment to transform biomass into biofuels, biomaterials, and biochemicals [26]. Biorefineries play an important role in industries because they can efficiently use resources, offer a solution to climate change, can reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and can meet energy needs [27]. The main obstacle when evaluating biorefineries projects is technical and economic feasibility; therefore, it is essential to address the integration of mass and energy flows through mathematical models for resource optimisation [23]. The optimisation of superstructures based on mathematical models provides a versatile array of configurations for a defined objective function [28]; thus, different conversion routes, multiple feedstocks, multiple periods, and the production of various biofuels can be included [29]. Another important aspect when evaluating the economic part of a biorefinery is to consider the environmental dimension and to analyse the supply chain. A supply chain is a network used to coordinate feedstock availability and product demand [30], and its proper design can provide a highly reliable and cost-effective system [31].

Several studies have evaluated the optimisation of superstructures using linear or mixed-integer nonlinear integer linear programming (MILP or MINLP) to integrate feed-stock streams, exploit waste, and produce a variety of biofuels and high-value products through the biorefinery concept. Varshney et al. [32] formulated an optimisation model for the production of bioethanol, pellets, and electricity from bagasse processing with the objectives of maximising net present value (NPV) and minimising greenhouse gas emissions and water footprint. Macowski et al. [33] developed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to optimise the supply chain for the production of bioethanol from sugarcane to evaluate the environmental impact and economic value.

Gutierrez-Franco et al. [34] proposed the use of a multi-objective (economic, environmental and social) model (MILP) to design a sustainable supply chain for biofuels in Colombia from forest residues. Moretti et al. [35] formulated a model (MILP) to minimise the fuel production costs of a supply chain in Italy from 3 different feedstocks (wood chips, grape pomace, and olive pomace), 2 means of transportation (train and truck), and possible feedstock pre-processing. Gilani and Sahebi [36] proposed a model (MILP) of the supply chain for biofuel production from sugarcane with the objective of maximising profits from sales, minimising environmental impacts, and maximising supply chain employment. Basile et al. [37] applied an economic and environmental optimisation model for the design of a supply chain in Sweden for the production of biomethanol from forest residues. Vitale et al. [38] proposed a model for the supply chain in Argentina, using wood waste and forest residues as raw material for the production of wood pellets, with the objective of minimising the operating cost. Infante et al. [39] developed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to minimise the carbon dioxide balance in the evaluation of a microalgae biorefinery, considering the production of various biofuels in Colombia. The results showed that producing diesel and green gasoline via hydrothermal liquefaction was the most favourable conversion pathway for minimising carbon dioxide emissions. Bagasse is also used as fuel for power and heat systems and as a pellet product. Loon et al. [40] studied a MILP model for the conversion of oil palm biomass into bio-based products and electricity. The results indicated that 0.2271 GWh/year of electricity and 0.0050636 Mtonnes of biofertilizers could be generated. Jabbarzadeh and Shamsi [41] proposed an optimisation model for the design and planning of a supply chain dedicated to bioethanol production from second- and third-generation biomass. Eslamipoor [42] discussed the importance of reducing carbon emissions in a sustainable supply chain (SSC) through carbon pricing. The results showed that a decentralised supply chain tends to be inefficient in terms of coordination, because the benefits are mainly concentrated to the retailer, while the producer barely covers its costs, without making a profit.

This study proposes the application of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the optimisation of biorefineries by studying the operating conditions of a supply chain that uses sugarcane vinasse as a microalgae culture medium for the production of sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel and gasoline in different states of Brazil. We analyse the model from both economic and environmental perspectives.

2. Materials and Methods

The optimisation of the superstructure consists of devising a mathematical formulation based on the biorefinery’s objectives. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model based on superstructure optimisation is developed for the production of SAF and green diesel and gasoline from an integrated microalgae biorefinery, using vinasse as the culture medium. The methodology used is based on three main steps. (1) We develop a superstructure of production processes steps, taking into account secondary data. (2) We formulate mathematical physical and economical models for mass and energy balance as well as the capital and operating costs associated with each model. (3) We solve the mathematical model to evaluate the objective function proposed.

The developed superstructure consists of different main processing steps/stages: (1) vinasse biodigestion, (2) microalgae cultivation in open ponds, (3) harvesting and dewatering, and (4) the conversion of microalgae biomass into final biofuels by hydrothermal liquefaction and upgrade. All of the above steps/stages are required for each constituent unit of the system being evaluated. Figure 1 shows a representation of all the steps/stages that make up the biorefinery.

Vinasse biodigestion: In order to calculate the available vinasse, we evaluated the ethanol production capacities of the states addressed in the study. For each litre of ethanol produced, 13.82 litres of vinasse are produced [43]. The produced vinasse is fed into an anaerobic biodigester to produce biogas, a compound mainly composed of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Using the volume of vinasse produced in each state and the typical Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of the vinasse, the total COD load can be defined. Based on the removal efficiency of the UASB reactor (treatment method chosen for this study), the amount of COD removed can be calculated and the biogas flow rate of the system can be calculated. In this unit, biodigested vinasse not only produces biogas but also serves as a culture medium for microalgae. Key parameters include vinasse COD value = 33.25 kg/m3 [44]; UASB reactor efficiency = 62.5% [44,45]; CH4 percentage in biogas = 60%; and biogas production per COD removal = 0.234 m3/kg (in terms of CH4) [45].

Microalgae cultivation (open pond): Open-pond cultivation was chosen for the production of microalgae biomass in this study. We used biodigested diluted vinasse as the culture medium, with a reference vinasse concentration of 5% by volume. The amount of water lost through evaporation depends on factors like climate, temperature, and humidity. According to Guieysse et al. [46], water loss is approximately 0.476 m3/m2/year. The culture system presented a depth of 0.3 m and the system was assumed to be a high-rate algae pond (HRAP) with a constant concentration of 0.56 g/L during harvest periods and a hydraulic retention time of 8 days, corresponding to a biomass productivity of 70 mg/L-day (dry algae base without ash) [47]. The electricity consumption of the paddle wheel and pumps for the cultivation system is 2.7 kW/ha and 0.5 kW/ha, respectively [48].

Harvesting and dewatering: In this study, the harvesting and dewatering of the biomass were carried out in 3 processes: decantation, flocculation, and centrifugation. In the first process, excess water was removed to increase the algae concentration from 0.56 g/L to 20 g/L [49]. The efficiency of this unit was 95%. Subsequently, the microalgae biomass went through a chemical flocculation process to increase the algae concentration to 7.5% by weight. In a flocculation tank, 0.15 g/L of aluminium sulphate was added [50]. The biomass recovery in this process was 98% and the energy consumption was 0.15 kWh/m3 feed [51]. The biomass suspension after flocculation was concentrated by centrifugation at 200 g/L. The cell recovery efficiency was 99% [51].

Hydrothermal liquefaction: After the centrifugation process, the microalgae biomass with 20% solids is used in a hydrothermal liquefaction process for the production of SAF and green diesel and gasoline. During this unit, the main parameters are hydrogen consumption = 0.021 t H2/t dry microalgae; heat consumption = 0.59 MWh/t dry microalgae; electricity consumption = 0.035 MWh/t dry microalgae; gasoline production = 0.06 t gasoline/t dry microalgae; diesel production = 0.1287 t diesel/t dry microalgae; and SAF production = 0.0924 t SAF/t dry microalgae [52,53].

The biogas produced from the biodigestion of vinasse goes to a purification unit. The purification unit consists of a treatment process that upgrades and enriches the methane in the biogas to produce biomethane. In this study, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technology is employed to produce biomethane with 99% purity. The energy consumption of this unit is 0.31 kWh/Nm3 of biogas fed, with a CO2 removal efficiency of 99% and methane losses estimated at 3.5% [54].

For this study, the electricity supply is provided by the available electricity grid.

3. Structure, Formulation and Data of the Model

The optimisation model is a mixed linear programming problem (MILP) based on the superstructure shown in Figure 1. All processes considered in the superstructure are physical models based on the mass balance and energy of each technology, taking into account literature data and estimated data as previously mentioned. The superstructure was modelled as an MILP model and implemented in the LINGO v.20 software. Figure 2 shows a representation of the workflow of the optimisation superstructure. The mathematical model utilized during the case study uses [55,56] for reference.

3.1. Definition of Set

The formulation of the model considers different sets, to include and exclude different processes and parameters. Different main sets are worked on: resource (R), modal (M), location (L), and unit (U). The resource (R) elements are anything that can be transported as consumed resources, intermediates, and final products; the unit (U) elements are any technology that can transform one resource into another. For example, sugarcane vinasse can produce biogas through the biodigestion process. In this case, each element is inserted into the superstructure together with input flows (IARu,r) and output flows (OARu,r). The elements of the location (L) set represent the places with availability of raw material and/or demand, while the elements of the modal set represent the different modes of transport considered in the model.

3.2. Investment Cost Updating and Linearization

The investment cost is defined as the initial capital expenditure needed to build the biorefinery’s process units, with costs expressed on a per-process-unit basis. When calculating the required investment for plant and unit construction, data from the literature, where unit capacities are known, were used for reference. Since unit costs fluctuate over time, the cost values were adjusted using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI).

In the current study, exponent values of 0.6 were assumed for all units. Since each unit inserted into the superstructure has a reference scale, each capital investment cost at the reference scale must be adjusted. Therefore, a piecewise linearization of the capital cost function was performed for each process. To perform this linearization, the cost curve was obtained as a function of the scale variable (wu) when using Equation (1), where se is a scale exponent, Cu,p is the adjusted investment cost for the unit, and the investment cost at the reference scale is represented by C0u. The curve is then divided into different levels limited by a minimum and maximum value, CapMinu,l and CapMaxu,l, respectively. The coefficients of the linearized cost curve for each process are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Table S1).

C u = C 0 u w u se

(1)

3.3. Unit Selection and Scaling Adjustment

Selection and scaling for each unit element are performed using Equation (2), where CapMinu and CapMaxu are minimum and maximum parameters, representing the scaling that a unit can have, yu,p is a binary variable, representing the existence of that unit, and wu,p is a continuous variable responsible for unit scaling. When selected, a unit has a yu,p equal to one, and its wu,p is limited by CapMinu and CapMaxu. If not selected, the value zero is assumed, resulting in a wu,p equal to zero.

CapMin u y u , p ≤ w u , p ≤ CapMax u y u , p

(2)

When a unit is selected and scaled, one of the levels must also be selected. Only one level is chosen per unit at each location when using Equation (3). If a level is not selected, its binary variables (ylu,l) will have a value of zero, so the local scale factor variable wlu,l will also have a value of zero. As such, Equation (4) ensures that wu will be equal to the value of wlu,l of the selected level.

∑ l yl u , l ≤ 1

(3)

∑ l wl u , l = w u

(4)

3.4. Objective Function

The objective function of the superstructure is to minimise total costs, taking into account annualised investment, resource and transportation costs, and the sale of services, as shown in Equation (5).

M i n I N V C + O P E C + R M A C + T R N C − P R S C

(5)

Equation (6) was used to calculate the annualised investment cost (INVC), where au,l and bu,l represent the angular and linear coefficients of each linearized interval, respectively. The annualisation factor (AF) was set as 0.072.

INVC = ∑ l ( a u , l wl u , l + b u , l y u , l ) * AF

(6)

Equations (7)–(9) are used to calculate the operating cost (OPEC), raw material acquisition cost (RMAC), and product selling revenue (PRSC), respectively. The maintenance cost (MC) and other costs (OCs), which include operating supplies, administrative costs, overhead costs, taxes, and insurance costs, were set as 6% and 8.6% of the investment cost, respectively, based on [57]. The labour cost was set as 10% of the manufacturing cost, as in [58].

The parameters RCr and SPr represent the cost of resource r if bought and consumed as a raw material and the selling price of resource r if sold as a product, respectively.

RMAC = bought r RC r

(7)

PRSC = sold r SP r

(8)

OPEC = ∑ l ( a u , l wl u , l + b u , l y u , l ) * AF * ( MC + OC + LC )

(9)

The transportation cost (TRNC) is calculated using Equation (10), which considers the mass of the resource transported from location p’ to p, transfOutModalp’,p,r,mo, the distance transported, distp’p, and the modal cost to transport that resource, modCostr,mo.

T R N C = ∑ p ′ ∑ p ∑ r ∑ m o t r a n s f O u t M o d a l p ’ , p , r , mo * d i s t p ’ , p * m o d C o s t r , mo

(10)

3.5. Mass Balance

The methodology uses the concept of scaling, that is, each unit is a specific process where the input flow (IARu,r) and output flow (OARu,r) for each resource are relative to the specific scale; therefore, the scale of a unit can be expanded or reduced. In this case, a continuous variable (Wu,p) was used for each of these parameters, multiplying each of the input/output flows. In this way, the consumption (consu,r,p) and production (produ,r,p) of resources of that unit can be calculated. The calculation of the consumption (consu,r,p) and the production (produ,r,p) of resources of that unit at a given location is performed using Equations (11) and (12).

OAR u , r w u , p - prod u , r , p = 0

(11)

IAR u , r w u , p - cons u , r , p = 0

(12)

The mass balance, defined in Equation (13), applies to each resource (r) and location (p). Each resource produced or purchased at a location must either be consumed or sold, either locally or at another location. The balance is formed by six flows: consumption (consu,r,p), production (produ,r,p), purchase (boughtr,p), sale (soldr,p), input via transportation of resources from one location (p’) to another (p) (transfInr,p’,p), and output of resources via transportation from one location to another (transfOutr,p,p’). All factors depend on the number of hours for which the processes are operational, which is denoted by fop (8760 h).

bought r , p + ∑ u prod u , r , p fop + ∑ p ′ t r a n s f I n r , p ′ , p = ∑ u cons u , r , p fop + sold r , p + ∑ p ′ t r a n s f O u t r , p , p ′

(13)

3.6. Availability and Demand Constraints

Equations (14) and (15) are the availability and demand constraints, respectively, where availability and demand represent the available and demanded quantity of resource r, ensuring that each resource purchased is available and each resource sold is in demand.

bought r , p ≤ avail r , p

(14)

sold r , p ≤ demand r , p

(15)

3.7. Transport Restrictions

Equations (16)–(18) govern the transportation of resources between the locations included in the model. Equation (16) asserts that the mass of each resource entering the system and being transported to location p is the sum of the masses of that resource transported by the different modes considered. Equation (17) indicates that the mass of each resource leaving and being transported from location p to location p’ is the sum of that resource transported by the different modes considered. Equation (18) establishes that the mass of resource r leaving location p’ towards p via mode mo is equal to the mass that entered location p via mode mo, ensuring no losses due to transport.

t r a n s f I n r , p ’ , p = ∑ m o t r a n s f I n M o d a l r , p ’ , p , mo

(16)

t r a n s f O u t p , p ’ , r = ∑ m o t r a n s f O u t M o d a l p , p ’ , r , mo

(17)

t r a n s f O u t M o d a l p ’ , p , r , mo = t r a n s f I n M o d a l p ’ , p , r , mo

(18)

3.8. Transport Modal Unitary Cost

To calculate the transportation modal unitary costs of raw materials, intermediates, and final products, a simulation was performed based on data from the Brazilian National Land Transport Agency, taking into account different variables (vehicle configuration, type of load and distance) [59]. The main economic assumptions adopted for economic evaluation are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Table S2).

3.9. Economic Analysis

The economic calculations performed were discounted cash flow (Equation (19)), net present value (Equation (20)) and internal rate of return (Equation (21)).

D i s c o u n t e d c a s h f l o w i n y e a r t i m e = c a s h f l o w 1 + D i s c o u n t r a t e t i m e

(19)

N P V = ∑ D i s c o u n t e d c a s h f l o w i n y e a r t i m e − t o t a l i n v e s t m e n t

(20)

0 = ∑ c a s h f l o w t i m e 1 + I R R t i m e − t o t a l i n v e s t m e n t

(21)

where discount rate = 0.185 [60]; NPV = net present value; IRR = internal rate of return; and time = 20 years.

3.10. Emissions

Equation (22) demonstrates how the actual emission reduction can be quantified.

A c t u a l e m i s s i o n r e d u c t i o n = A E − R M A E − T E A E

(22)

where AE = avoided emissions; RMAE = raw material acquisition emissions; and TE = emitted by transport.

GHG Emission in Transportation

For the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport of resources, transport in diesel trucks was considered, which consumes 0.33 L/km. The emissions from the transportation of resources are presented in the Supplementary Materials (Table S3). Table S4 in the Supplementary Materials presents reference values for CO2 emissions and emissions avoidance.

4. Case Study

Currently, Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of sugarcane in the world. In addition, Brazil is the world’s leading producer of ethanol, using sugarcane as feedstock. This means that the estimated production of vinasse in Brazil is 336 to 504 GL/year [13]. To evaluate the proposed optimisation model, a case study in Brazil was selected, taking into account the ethanol production capacity. The nine Brazilian states with the highest ethanol production capacity were studied and subsequently the vinasse production was calculated. The calculation of vinasse production was made based on the study by [43], where, for each litre of ethanol, 13.82 litres of vinasse are produced. For the production of sugarcane in Alagoas, Paraíba, and Pernambuco, a production of 180 d/year was assumed, while in the other states the production was 210 d/year. Table 1 shows the potential of each selected state.

Jet fuel demand replaced aviation fuel consumption at each state’s main airport. The demand for aviation fuel for each state was calculated from the consumption of jet fuel in each state in the year 2023. Aviation fuel demand at each airport is found in Table 2.

5. Results and Analysis

In this study, with the solution of the objective function for each state, it was possible to calculate the quantity of biofuels produced, as shown in Table 3.

The objective function for all the analysed states yields negative solutions, i.e., profits are produced at the evaluated processing scale.

Figure 3 shows the costs for the different states analysed. The states of Paraíba and Pernambuco have the highest costs associated with investment as a percentage of total costs, while Mato Grosso is the state with the lowest investment costs as a percentage, but it has the highest proportion of transportation costs (and this is because the distances between regions with availability of vinasse and the demand for biofuels are greater than in the other states in the case study).

This suggests that logistics costs are a significant challenge, perhaps due to the geographic location or transportation infrastructure in this region. Regarding resource costs, hydrogen purchase costs account for approximately 57% of raw material costs, followed by electricity purchase costs at 27%.

Table 4 shows the economic results for the entire supply chain. As can be seen in Table 4, São Paulo is the most profitable state, with a cash flow of 1071.09 and an IRR of 36.19%, far outperforming the rest. Its NPV of 2641.78 stands out as the highest, indicating a significant net return on the initial investment of 2953.66. Its discounted payback of 4.22 years is the fastest, reflecting an accelerated rate of the recovery of capital. This is because the state of São Paulo is by far the largest generator of vinasse of the states analysed in this study, with 509.7 Mtonnes, representing approximately 46% of the total. Its production far exceeds that of the state with the second largest volume, Goiás, which generates 170.8 million, i.e., São Paulo produces almost three times more vinasse than Goiás. Compared to other relevant states such as Mato Grosso (110.2 million), Mato Grosso do Sul (107.1 million), and Minas Gerais (107.5 million), São Paulo generates almost five times more vinasse. If contrasted with northeast states such as Paraíba (12.5 million) or Pernambuco (14.1 million), the difference is even more marked: São Paulo produces more than 40 times the amount of vinasse of these states. The states of Paraíba and Pernambuco do not meet the profitability criteria; this is because the IRR is lower than the opportunity cost. Both have IRRs lower than the expected threshold for investments (18.5%); in addition, they show a negative NPV, that is, the return does not compensate the initial costs. Even discounting future income, they have the lowest cash flows, which significantly reduces their ability to generate value. The states of Goiás and Minas Gerais have payback periods of 5.10 and 5.45 years, respectively, while states such as Paraná and Mato Grosso have slower discounted payback periods, but are still viable. The production cost ranges between 0.009 and 0.011 (MUS$/TJ biofuel) for different states. Hayward et al. [63] evaluated the feasibility and cost of producing jet fuels using lignocellulosic biomass; the results showed that the estimated cost of biomass-based jet fuels ranges from $0.70 to $1.90 per litter. In another study, Wang [64] assessed the economics of various feedstocks for jet fuel production in Taiwan, with results indicating a minimum selling price for jet fuel ranging from $0.91 to $2.73 per litter.

The values for avoided CO2 emissions, Raw Material Acquisition (RMA) emissions, and transport emissions for the studied configurations are provided in Table 5. Transport emissions from the services range from 0.6% (Alagoas) to 8.6% (Mato Grosso) of total emissions. The actual reduction in emissions for the different states is approximately 98.4%.

In 2024, the estimated carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq) emissions for domestic and international flights in Brazil amounted to 14,236,728.9 tonnes [65]. In parallel, emissions avoided by aviation fuel amounted to 2,535,575 tonnes of CO2 eq. When analysing the relationship between avoided and generated emissions, an approximate value of 0.178 is obtained. This means that our actions contributed to reducing the total emissions generated by the air sector in Brazil by 17.8%. This positive impact reflects a significant advance towards the decarbonisation of a highly emitting sector such as aviation, highlighting the importance of implementing effective climate change mitigation strategies. The emissions avoided by the biofuels produced were 15,398,086.51 tonnes of CO2 eq, representing a net positive impact of 1,161,357.61 tonnes of CO2 eq avoided beyond the emissions from the air sector. This means that, for each estimated tonnes of CO2 emissions from domestic and international flights in Brazil in 2024, the actions implemented avoided an additional 1.08 tonnes of CO2 eq.

Brazil’s new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) aims to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 59% to 67% by 2035 compared to 2005, reaching a range of 850 million to 1050 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent [66]. To achieve this, Brazil must avoid between 1223 million and 2132 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2035. As mentioned above, the emissions avoided by the biofuels produced were 15,398,086.51 tonnes of CO2 eq, representing between 0.72% and 1.26% of Brazil’s total net emissions reduction target for 2035.

Sensitivity analysis was employed to examine and evaluate the impact of variations in model parameters on the discounted payback. All states were simulated again for different electricity prices—50, 60, and 30 USD/MWh; different hydrogen prices—3000, 4000 and 6000 USD/ton; and different discount rates—10, 15 and 20%. The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6.

With the variation in the price of electricity, the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco continue to present negative NPVs. With a value of 80 USD/MWh, the model does not activate any distillery in Paraíba, and so this parameter has a great influence on the model for these two states (Specific incentives and differentiated energy rates are needed to improve profitability in less competitive states, such as Paraíba and Pernambuco, which have negative NPVs under less favourable scenarios). As the price of electricity decreases, the payback decreases for all states, except for Mato Grosso, with a value of 60 USD/MWh. This is because the transport cost decreases by 29% and biofuel production (gasoline, diesel, biomethane and aviation fuel) is reduced by 13%. When the electricity price is 50 USD/MWh, the discounted payback decreases by between 6 and 19% with respect to the base case, while when the electricity price is 80 USD/MWh, the discounted payback increases by between 2 and 10% with respect to the base case (Figure 4).

Figure 5 shows the discounted payback trend with the variation in the hydrogen price. For a price of 3000 USD/ton, the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco show a discounted payback of 11.66 and 14.46 years, respectively; for the values of 4000 and 6000 USD/ton, the two states indicate a negative NPV, and so the investment is not viable. As the price of hydrogen decreases, the discounted payback decreases for all states. When the hydrogen price is USD 3000/ton, the discounted payback decreases by 19–30% with respect to the base case, while when the hydrogen price is USD 6000/ton, the discounted payback increases by 3–35% with respect to the base case.

The decline in hydrogen and electricity prices has led to a strategy of reducing the payback period, suggesting that policies supporting domestic green hydrogen production and renewable energy generation could have immediate positive effects on the sector’s profitability.

Figure 6 shows the trend of the discounted payback with the variation in the discount rate. When the discount rate is 10%, the discounted payback decreases between 19 and 41% with respect to the base case, while when the discount rate is 20%, the discounted payback increases between 5 and 21% with respect to the base case. For a discount rate of 10%, the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco show a discounted payback of 11.59 and 9.13 years, respectively; for the values of 15 and 20%, the state of Paraíba indicates a negative NPV, so the investment is not viable. For a 15% the discount rate, the discounted payback in the state of Pernambuco is 14.68 which represents an increase of 61% with respect to a discount rate of 10%. The sensitivity to the discount rate suggests that the financial context and access to credit or subsidies will also be decisive in encouraging new investments in the biofuel sector.

6. Conclusions

In this study, we propose an MILP model for a biorefinery that uses sugarcane vinasse as a medium for microalgae cultivation to achieve the production of green gasoline, green diesel, aviation fuel, and biomethane. The case study model focuses on different states in Brazil. The model’s objective function aimed to minimise the system’s total cost. The states of Goiás and Mato Grosso satisfy the aviation fuel demand in full, while Alagoas, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraíba, Pernambuco Paraná, and São Paulo satisfy the aviation fuel demand by 36.46%, 66.35%, 99.66%, 18.29, 5.10%, 63,02%, and 13%, respectively. The states of Paraíba and Pernambuco have negative NPVs, meaning that, for these two states, the project may not be financially viable after 20 years, while the state of São Paulo has the lowest discounted payback. Transportation-related emissions of energy produced in biorefineries represent 0.6–8.6% of the modelled total emissions, underscoring the critical role of biorefinery location and logistics infrastructure. The proposed model demonstrates clear alignment with the climate goals established in Brazil’s NDC, with an average emissions reduction of 98.4% across the assessed states and the ability to avoid 15.4 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This impact represents between 0.72% and 1.26% of Brazil’s total net emissions reduction target for 2035, as established in its new NDC, reinforcing the model’s relevance as a viable tool that can contribute to meeting the country’s international commitments regarding climate change. Regarding resource costs, hydrogen purchase costs account for approximately 57% of raw material costs, followed by electricity purchase costs at 27%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the price of electricity has a high influence on the model. Overall, the model stands out for its real applicability, providing a strategic tool to guide investment decisions and public policies in the sustainable energy transition.

Hi, everyone. Look at this truck right behind me. It's carrying sustainable aviation fuel or SAF as we like to call it, and it's being used right now to fuel our aircraft. So here's the thing, SAFE isn't something for the future. It's really available today. In fact, in 2024, we've already used 18% SEF across our operations and that includes in our flight tests and our Beluga operations. So it's real. And it's happening and it shows that we can really make a difference today. But here's the challenge. We need to go further. We need more surf at affordable prices to have more and more adoption. And so we need to push forward for the industry to reach our goals together. So here we have it. We've got the aircraft technology, we have the fuel technology, and we have a common goal. So let's make SAF the new normal because the time to. Connect is really narrow. Let's do this.

Canada H2 sees opening as political chaos engulfs US

Canada H2 sees opening as political chaos engulfs US

Houston, 25 April (Argus) — Canada's hydrogen sector sees an opportunity to attract global customers as the US' bellicose stance toward its northern neighbor unites Canadians behind strengthening its energy capacity and as US political turmoil sends countries looking for other trading partners. ""The mayhem south of the border has created a real national interest in exports,"" Trigon Pacific Terminals chief executive Robert Booker said this week at the Canadian Hydrogen Convention in Edmonton, Alberta. Trigon is building a berth at the port in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, to handle low-carbon hydrogen converted to ammonia. ""The choice, quite frankly, is become the 51st state or export,"" Booker said. ""We should export, and there's broad understanding that that's good for Canada."" Canadian energy exports from Alberta have largely gone south to the US. Ambitions to tap global markets have been stymied in years past by community and federal opposition to building rail and pipeline infrastructure that would connect the landlocked province to the Pacific coast. Multiple large-scale hydrogen proposals in western Canada were quietly shelved in the past year because of a lack of infrastructure, among other challenges, and Canadian companies were shut out of recent Asian auctions to buy hydrogen because of similar restraints. But Trump's return to the White House has changed Canadians' views on export infrastructure. Both candidates in the upcoming 28 April general election, including Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney who served as UN Special Envoy for Climate Action, have vowed to build out pipelines , rail corridors and other infrastructure — including electricity grids — to diversify energy exports away from the US. ""We've never been this united in the country,"" said Julie Lemieux, chief executive officer of Triple Point Resources, which is developing a salt dome in Newfoundland for hydrogen storage. ""That's the positive of the chaos. We've been notoriously slow to approve these projects and invest in infrastructure. Whoever wins next week, they've all committed to investing in infrastructure."" Panelists speaking in Edmonton expressed relief that Canada didn't follow the US example of putting tariffs on China, whose technology and components will be instrumental to containing costs while building Canadian infrastructure. ""For better or worse, whatever your opinion, the build out of new infrastructure today is really dependent on China, especially when it comes to green infrastructure, where there's already an embedded green premium,"" said Matthew Borys, vice president of corporate development at EverWind Fuels. ""Keeping the cost down is super important to getting these things built out."" The Trump administration's preference for fossil fuel extraction over clean energy and its expansionist designs on the Panama Canal are also seen as opportunities for Canadian developers to attract Asian customers who could avoid the canal by exporting from British Columbia terminals, said James Vultaggio, vice president of Atco EnPower. ""The administration to the south is focused more on fossil fuel production and reducing environmental regulations,"" Vultaggio said. ""If they want to cede their seat as a clean energy leader, then Canada has an opportunity to fill that seat, and we should take it."" Trump has been outspoken in his preference for fossil fuel extraction and has paused all federal clean energy disbursements related to the Inflation Reduction Act, which has raised doubts about whether US hydrogen hubs can survive as they were initially conceived during the administration of former president Joe Biden. Clean energy incentives such as the 45V hydrogen production tax credit have also come under scrutiny as the Trump administration seeks to shrink government spending. The uncertainty around clean energy incentives in the US may well send American investment north, said Denis Caron, chief executive of the Belledune Port Authority in eastern Canada's New Brunswick province, which is positioning itself as a green energy hub targeting European markets. Caron said an American company working with the port of Belledune remains bullish on its prospects there and could serve as a model to attract even more American investment if the US continues to claw back support for clean energy. ""We see an opportunity to attract American investment to Canada and make those types of investments,"" Caron said. ""Canada has a golden opportunity to fulfill the requirement of supplying clean and green energy products globally.""

The BMW Group is driving the future of emission-free heavy-duty transport – with pilot operations of the first hydrogen trucks now underway at Plant Leipzig as part of the H2Haul project. Demonstrating its openness to different technologies once again – including in logistics – the BMW Group’s involvement is one component of its more comprehensive hydrogen strategy connecting transport, production and products.

A MILESTONE IN EMISSION-FREE HEAVY-DUTY TRANSPORT.

The BMW Group is taking the next step towards sustainable transport logistics: two local emission-free fuel-cell trucks are now entering pilot operations. Part of the European H2Haul project supporting hydrogen-powered freight transport, the trucks will travel between Leipzig, Landsberg and Nuremberg to see how their drive technology performs in everyday operations. In addition, state-of-the-art hydrogen filling stations are currently under construction at Leipzig and Hormersdorf (northeast of Nuremberg) to offer the fast refuelling necessary for truck operations to succeed. The project is being realised by the BMW Group in conjunction with Iveco, DHL and TEAL mobility.

Michael Nikolaides, head of Production Network and Logistics at the BMW Group, says:

The right choice of transport is important in global logistics, as elsewhere, to keep us future-focused and efficient in our work.

“So, transport logistics is another area reflecting the BMW Group’s open-minded approach to technologies. For the first time, hydrogen-powered trucks will support series production in German car manufacturing. We have been working on the project for a number of years now and are rolling out this pilot fleet in collaboration with our partners. It’s an important milestone as it will give us experience of how these trucks work in series operations and help us continue enhancing this crucial technology,”

H2Haul: TWO OF THE 16 SUBSIDISED TRUCKS ARE ON THE ROAD FOR BMW GROUP LOGISTICS.

The H2Haul project looks at how hydrogen fuel cell-powered trucks perform in real-world driving and what they can contribute to fossil fuel-free heavy-duty transport. All in all, 16 vehicles are involved, subsidised by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership and operating across Europe. Of those, two are IVECO S-eWay Fuel Cell trucks on the road for the BMW Group. Findings from the pilot project are expected to help enhance the technology and get it market-ready. A valuable addition to the battery-electric trucks already on the road, the hydrogen vehicles are quick to refuel and offer significant range. They are also flexible to use as they are independent of the charging infrastructure or grid development.

A CLEAR STRATEGY FOR EMISSION-FREE LOGISTICS AT THE BMW GROUP.

The BMW Group’s participation in the H2Haul project is a key cornerstone in its Reduced Logistics Emissions Strategy. This aims to achieve emission-free transport logistics, with a dedicated cross-departmental team developing measures to reduce CO₂ from the BMW Group’s road, rail and shipping transport worldwide. Drive technologies receiving a positive rating are advanced into pilot projects and new plant concepts, whose emissions data is then systematically recoded to enable accurate CO₂ reporting.

FueL CELL AND COMBUSTION ENGINE COMPARED.

Fuel cell technology is not all the BMW Group is testing: it is also involved in the HyCET (Hydrogen Combustion Engine Trucks) project. In the future, this will see two 40-tonne and one 18-tonne truck powered by hydrogen combustion engines join its logistics fleet. Funded by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV), the HyCET project is being implemented by the BMW Group in conjunction with DHL, Volvo Trucks, Deutz, KEYOU and TotalEnergies.

By testing H₂ fuel cells and combustion engines simultaneously, the BMW Group is remaining true to its open-minded approach to technologies – including in logistics. While fuel cells work more efficiently, combustion engines are cheaper to produce as they essentially work on the same tried-and-tested principle as a diesel. The EU ordinance classes both hydrogen technologies as zero-emissions, and out on the road they are both being trialled on the same routes and refuelling at the same filling stations. The aim is to determine the best use case for each technology in BMW Group logistics.

HYDROGEN AS A DRIVER OF PLANT LOGISTICS.

Heavy-duty transport is not the only area where the BMW Group uses hydrogen: it also uses it within its own plants. Plant Leipzig is considered a pioneer in this regard, being home to the first indoor hydrogen filling station in Germany since way back in 2013. Today it operates five such facilities as well as one of the largest fleets of fuel cell-powered forklifts and tug trains in Europe. The latest filling station even offers fully automated refuelling – another first!

FLEXIBLE HYDROGEN BURNERS FOR CLEANER PAINTING.

Innovative solutions are a defining feature in production too, where the BMW Group is the first carmaker in the world to roll out a brand-new type of burner, now on stream in Plant Leipzig. The new bivalent system can be powered by gas as well as hydrogen, and there are currently five such burners operating in contrast roof painting for the MINI Countryman. Further burners are currently being converted for hydrogen, with the longer-term aim of doing away with gas power completely and reducing CO2 emissions further.

Petra Peterhänsel, Plant Director at BMW Group Plant Leipzig, taking a longer view of the plant’s overall direction for the future, explains:

Our vision at Plant Leipzig is to largely decarbonise production. We can achieve that, in part, by replacing fossil fuels with hydrogen,

FIRST HYDROGEN-POWERED PRODUCTION BMW DUE IN 2028.

Beyond logistics and production, hydrogen also plays an important role in vehicle development. After successful testing in a pilot fleet, the BMW iX5 Hydrogen is about to embark on the next step in its development, with an existing model due for launch as a fuel cell vehicle (FCEV) in 2028. Complementing the portfolio of battery-electric (BEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV) and combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, the hydrogen model will offer a further solution for electromobility and yet another local emission-free drive option for BMW Group customers to choose from.

Also present at the announcement was Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad.
Earlier in his speech, Nik Nazmi called the project a “game-changer” for Malaysia’s energy and aviation sectors, noting its alignment with the country’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement.
This refinery will help decarbonise the aviation sector while enhancing our energy security and supporting Malaysia’s net-zero aspirations,” he said.","Partnership with UAE poised to transform aviation sector, operational by 2029

KUALA LUMPUR: Airlines will have greater access to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with the setting up of a state-of-the-art refinery in Port Klang, a US$500mil (RM2.19bil) collaboration between UAE-based Bin Zayed International Group (BZI) and Malaysia’s FatHopes Energy (FHE).

The two firms announced that the facility – among the first of its kind in South-East Asia – will be one of the world’s most forward-looking SAF refineries.

It is expected to transform the regional clean aviation landscape by producing SAF via the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids pathway, which currently accounts for over 80% of global SAF production.

According to BZI (Malaysia) Berhad managing director Datuk Seri Dr Shamir Kumar Nandy, the project is slated to break ground in 2026 and begin commercial operations by 2029.

“We are underwriting the entire sum for now by ourselves. Based on FatHopes’ findings and updates, they’re in the process of getting the necessary approvals and sanctions before they can break ground.

“So I believe that will be a year down the road – about 12 months from today,” he said at a press conference here yesterday.

Also present at the announcement was Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad.

Shamir said the partnership combines BZI’s global investment expertise and FHE’s leadership in sustainable biofuel feedstock aggregation, laying the groundwork for a highly diversified and scalable SAF platform in the region.

He added that the Port Klang refinery is a key element in Malaysia’s ambition to produce one million tonnes of SAF annually, solidifying the nation’s role in the global SAF economy.

“This initiative has the potential to reimagine the future of flight,” said Shamir.

“It’s about profit, people and the planet – but most importantly, it’s for the planet,” he added.

FHE chief executive officer Vinesh Sinha said the project, currently in the feasibility stage, will have a production capacity of 300,000 tonnes per annum, requiring roughly 330,000 tonnes of feedstock.

He noted the technology in use can process various feedstocks, guided by prevailing policies and certifications.

While BZI has fully committed to the financing, Vinesh highlighted that the primary challenges in the refinery’s development are technical in nature.

“There’s a lot of input materials we need – hydrogen and nitrogen, which are major components of the manufacturing process.

“We are in the midst of identifying sources for those. Then there’s the port infrastructure, which is also a key factor.

“On our end, we are really focused on technical readiness and securing environmental impact assessment clearance for this particular plant,” Vinesh added.

Earlier in his speech, Nik Nazmi called the project a “game-changer” for Malaysia’s energy and aviation sectors, noting its alignment with the country’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement.

“Air travel is essential, but it must become sustainable. This refinery will help decarbonise the aviation sector while enhancing our energy security and supporting Malaysia’s net-zero aspirations,” he said.

Nik Nazmi also highlighted the project’s socio-economic value, saying it will create jobs and benefit communities involved in the biofuel supply chain.

“This project shows that sustainability and economic opportunity can go hand in hand.”",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/04/26/3284823.JPG,N,,2025-04-25 19:56:17.725045

DENVER, April 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Boom Supersonic, the company building the world's fastest airliner, Overture, today announced that it has selected a site at the Colorado Air and Space Port in Watkins, CO to conduct engine tests for its Symphony propulsion system. The site was previously used for hypersonic engine development. Symphony, the bespoke engine for Overture, is a medium bypass turbofan optimized for supersonic flight. Boom is investing $3-5 million into the site this year to prepare it for supersonic engine testing, slated to start later this year.

""Symphony is rapidly advancing from concept to reality. By leveraging an existing site, Boom will have the first independently-owned supersonic engine test facility for less than it would have cost to rent a government facility,"" said Blake Scholl, Founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic. ""By vertically integrating propulsion, we are able to accelerate development, reduce costs, and custom-tailor an engine for Overture—unlocking capabilities like Boomless Cruise.""

The Symphony engine test facility, located in Adams County only 35 miles from Boom's headquarters, will support this year's test of Symphony's prototype core. Measuring 12 feet long and 4 feet in diameter, the core is the high pressure spool of the engine, consisting of the compressor, combustor, and turbine—the most critical components of the first independently-developed supersonic jet engine.

""This is an exciting moment not just for Adams County, but for the future of aerospace innovation in Colorado,"" said Lynn Baca, Chair of the Adams County Board of Commissioners. ""Boom's investment in our community puts us at the forefront of the aerospace industry and reflects our shared commitment to advancing next-generation transportation technologies.""

The facility at the Colorado Air and Space Port includes a control room and advanced instrumentation. Data collected from Symphony core tests will allow Boom to refine engineering and manufacturing design for Symphony. Boom expects to expand the site in 2026 to facilitate full-scale testing of the entire Symphony turbofan prototype.

""We are very excited to welcome Boom Supersonic to the Colorado Air and Space Port and to support the development of its revolutionary Symphony engine,"" said Jeff Kloska, Director of the Colorado Air and Space Port (CASP). ""We look forward to a great partnership with Boom and to advancing our aviation and aerospace ecosystem at CASP.""

The Symphony engine continues to progress rapidly. In March, Symphony passed a key technical review—enabling the manufacturing launch. Multiple parts have already entered the manufacturing phase and engine assembly will start later this year. When the Symphony program moves into production, Boom will leverage the skilled team and facility at StandardAero in San Antonio, TX to build Symphony engines at rate.

Purpose-building and vertically integrating Symphony enables Boom to unlock additional capabilities for Overture, including flying at supersonic speeds without an audible sonic boom on the ground with Boomless Cruise. Symphony features enhanced transonic performance compared to commercially-derived engines, allowing Overture to efficiently accelerate to supersonic speeds at altitudes above 30,000 feet—where Boomless Cruise is possible.

In February, Boom's XB-1 demonstrator broke the sound barrier six times without creating a sonic boom that was heard on the ground, opening the door to supersonic flight over land onboard Overture with Boomless Cruise. Overture has 130 orders and pre-orders from United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines, representing the first five years of production at its Overture Superfactory in Greensboro, North Carolina.

If these projections are met, the Z Four could redefine sustainable transatlantic travel by 2030—with environmental, commercial, and passenger benefits like never before.

In a move that signals the dawn of a radical new era in commercial aviation, United Airlines has announced a groundbreaking investment in JetZero, a California-based startup developing the Z4 aircraft, a next-generation blended wing body (BWB) jet that could dramatically reshape the future of long-haul travel. If successful, the Z4 aircraft could reduce fuel consumption by up to 50%, significantly cut emissions, and redefine passenger experience on transatlantic routes.

The news follows United’s previous investment in Boom Supersonic’s Overture, reaffirming the airline’s strategy to position itself at the cutting edge of aviation innovation. The Chicago-based carrier’s latest bet—on a futuristic airframe design that blends the fuselage and wings into one continuous lifting surface—is among the boldest yet.

The Investment: A 200-Aircraft Vision

United Airlines Ventures, the airline’s corporate venture fund, has committed to an initial order of 100 JetZero Z4 aircraft, with an option for 100 more. While the financial terms remain undisclosed, the partnership is conditional on JetZero achieving critical developmental milestones, most notably a full-scale demonstrator flight by 2027 and full compliance with United’s safety and operational standards.

If the Z4 proves successful, it could be a game-changer—not only for United but for the entire aviation sector. It aligns directly with the carrier’s net-zero emissions goals by 2050 and enhances its leadership role in advancing cleaner, smarter flying.

What Is the Blended Wing Body?

Unlike traditional tube-and-wing jets, the blended wing body design merges the fuselage with the wings into a wide, flat, lifting structure. This configuration drastically reduces aerodynamic drag and improves lift-to-drag ratio, making it a more fuel-efficient option for long-haul routes.

The JetZero Z4 is expected to carry up to 250 passengers and operate using conventional jet fuel, but it will be fully compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends—key to future-proofing aircraft as the industry transitions toward greener alternatives.

NASA has long championed the BWB concept for its aerodynamic efficiency and is actively supporting JetZero alongside the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to meet certification and integration requirements ahead of the 2030 launch window.

Geo-Targeted Potential: United’s Transatlantic Footprint

United’s existing hubs in Chicago, Newark, Washington D.C., Houston, and San Francisco could serve as key bases for early Z4 operations, especially on transatlantic routes to London, Frankfurt, Paris, and Amsterdam—markets where long-haul efficiency matters most.

With the Z4 capable of reducing fuel use on such routes by up to 45%, United stands to gain operational flexibility, reduce carbon emissions, and offer a more environmentally conscious product to leisure and corporate travelers alike.

The aircraft is also touted to be compatible with existing airport infrastructure, alleviating concerns over the size and shape of the fuselage disrupting terminal logistics or gate compatibility.

Passenger Comfort Meets Efficiency

Beyond efficiency, the Z4’s interior promises a roomier, more comfortable cabin. With the blended wing layout, designers have greater flexibility in seating configurations, cabin layout, and even natural lighting solutions. The result? An upgraded customer experience that competes not only on sustainability, but also on comfort.

Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures, noted: “JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency.”

This shift aligns with passenger demand for more spacious and quieter cabins, especially as business and leisure travelers expect airlines to deliver not just speed and savings, but enhanced in-flight well-being.

Why United Is Betting Big on Aviation Reinvention

JetZero must now navigate a series of high-stakes development stages, including aerodynamic testing, full-scale prototyping, and FAA certification. The company has strong momentum, having already secured technical support from NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center.

If all goes to plan, the first Z4 could enter commercial service by 2030—just in time for airlines to meet the ICAO’s CORSIA emission standards and consumer expectations for more sustainable travel.

By making this early commitment, United not only secures a place at the front of the line but also signals to regulators and investors that BWB is no longer science fiction—it’s an emerging reality.

The Supersonic Jet Revival: A New Era in Passenger Travel

The dream of supersonic travel once soared high in the skies, quite literally, through the revolutionary Concorde—a marvel of aviation engineering that promised unmatched speed and status. From 1976 to 2003, the Concorde captivated the imagination of the world, shrinking the New York to London flight time to just over three hours. But despite its prestige, the Concorde’s retirement marked the end of an era, burdened by immense fuel consumption, deafening sonic booms, and unsustainable operating costs. Now, two decades later, the idea of supersonic passenger travel is not only being revived—it’s being redefined.

Today’s supersonic renaissance is fueled by a unique blend of innovation, urgency, and opportunity. Climate change has forced the aviation industry to reimagine what flight efficiency means, while technology has matured to the point where noise, emissions, and even cost challenges are beginning to seem surmountable. At the center of this modern movement is Boom Supersonic, a U.S.-based company that has captured attention with its Overture aircraft—an ambitious jet designed to travel at Mach 1.7 and carry up to 80 passengers.

Boom’s progress has been significant, and the aviation industry has taken notice. Major carriers like United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines have placed pre-orders for the Overture, signaling their confidence in the commercial potential of supersonic travel. These aren’t just experimental partnerships; they represent a shift in how legacy airlines view their future. The goal is no longer just faster travel but smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable air mobility.

Unlike the Concorde, which operated with a niche clientele, Boom aims to democratize supersonic travel—at least to the level of current business class offerings. The company has stated it intends to keep ticket prices competitive, potentially around $5,000 round-trip for transatlantic journeys. If successful, this could open the door for a new class of premium flyers—those who value both time and environmental responsibility.

But challenges remain. One of the most pressing is the issue of sonic booms. The harsh crack of an aircraft breaking the sound barrier was a major reason Concorde was restricted from overland routes, limiting its commercial flexibility. To tackle this, new supersonic jet developers are focusing on low-boom or boomless designs. NASA and other aerospace leaders are contributing research into how to reduce noise signatures without compromising speed.

Fuel is another critical factor. The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, and supersonic jets, by nature of their high speeds, require more energy. Boom Supersonic has committed to running its aircraft entirely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80%. While this helps with emissions, questions about SAF supply, scalability, and cost remain in the spotlight.

In addition to Boom, other companies such as Spike Aerospace and Exosonic are developing their own versions of quiet, efficient supersonic aircraft. Their goals align with industry-wide trends: faster point-to-point travel, low noise impact, and strong environmental credentials. Even NASA’s X-59 QueSST project—short for Quiet Supersonic Technology—is focused on delivering data that could one day help overturn the FAA’s longstanding ban on civilian supersonic flight over land.

The renewed interest in supersonic flight also coincides with a broader transformation in the aviation sector. Air mobility is being pushed to evolve—not just in speed but in sustainability, digital connectivity, and passenger experience. Airlines are looking to differentiate themselves in a post-pandemic travel economy that prizes convenience, safety, and innovation. Supersonic travel fits neatly into this narrative. It not only satisfies the demand for shorter travel times but also serves as a symbol of progress—a futuristic solution that could inspire confidence and loyalty in increasingly climate-conscious consumers.

Of course, regulatory hurdles still need to be addressed. Air traffic management systems will need to adapt to faster flight corridors. Infrastructure such as airports and fueling stations must also evolve to accommodate new aircraft types and SAF requirements. But these are not insurmountable obstacles. They are challenges typical of any transformative leap in aviation history—and ones that many stakeholders, from manufacturers to regulators, are actively working to overcome.

Supersonic jets may not be carrying average economy passengers anytime soon, but their revival marks a powerful step forward for commercial flight. It’s not just about breaking the sound barrier again—it’s about breaking the industry’s stagnation in speed and innovation. If aircraft like Boom’s Overture deliver on their promises by the early 2030s, the golden age of high-speed travel may finally return—not as a luxury for the few, but as a viable option for the many who demand speed, sustainability, and sophistication.

The supersonic future is not just coming—it’s accelerating. And this time, it might just be built to last.

The deal gives UA the option to purchase up to 200 Z4 aircraft (100 firm orders plus 100 options), subject to JetZero meeting key development milestones, notably a full-scale demonstrator flight in 2027, and meeting UA’s safety, business, and operational requirements.

The terms are conditional—UA has not disclosed the investment amount—but the commitment signals confidence in JetZero’s novel all-wing design. Andrew Chang, head of UA Ventures, said, “If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.”​

Z4 Airframe: Efficiency and Specs

According to JetZero, the Z4 is designed as a twin-turbofan jetliner that carries around 250 passengers over transcontinental ranges. The startup says the Z4 will have a range of around 5,000 nautical miles and burn up to 50% less fuel per passenger mile than today’s conventional airliners of a similar size.

Key performance features include:

Blended-wing-body design: The aircraft’s wide “all-wing” planform generates lift across the cabin, dramatically reducing drag.

The two high-mounted turbofan engines, based on Pratt & Whitney’s PW2040, burn either conventional jet fuel or SAF blends.​

Fuel and sustainability: By reducing aerodynamic drag and flying at high altitude, the Z4 could use roughly 45% less fuel on specific routes (JetZero cites a Newark–Mallorca flight as an example)​.

It is optimized for conventional kerosene plus sustainable aviation fuels.

Airport compatibility: Despite its novel shape, the Z4 is sized to fit existing airport infrastructure. It requires no new runway, taxiway, or jet bridge modifications – it can use today’s gates and ground equipment without change.

Certification and timeline: JetZero recently passed a preliminary design review and expects a full-scale prototype, also known as a demonstrator, to fly by 2027.

The company targets entering service around 2030 as a fuel-efficient replacement for mid-sized twin-aisle jets.

Passenger Experience Innovations

JetZero’s BWB layout also promises a very different cabin experience. Without a narrow fuselage, the Z4 offers a wide, open-plan cabin that can be arranged flexibly​.

Key passenger benefits include:

Spacious seating: All classes get larger seats and more dedicated overhead bin space​.

The flat, wide cabin means aisles can be wider too.

Faster boarding: A single wide main boarding door feeds into multiple aisles and cabin bays, speeding up passenger flow.

With two or more aisles (depending on layout), boarding and deplaning could be much faster than on today’s twin-aisles.

Accessibility: Wider aisles and enlarged lavatories, including handicap-accessible facilities, are built in, aiming to improve accessibility for passengers with mobility challenges.

United believes these features can redefine long-haul comfort. As Chang noted, the Z4 could give “a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers” while also improving fuel efficiency​.

Tom O’Leary, JetZero’s CEO, said UA’s support “signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed to achieve the efficiency and cost savings” demanded by growing air travel demand​.

He added that JetZero’s focus on the airframe is “the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.”

Strategic Context: UA’s Innovation Portfolio

United’s move on JetZero fits a broader strategy. UA Ventures (UAV), the carrier’s corporate venture arm, has been actively funding next-generation air transport technologies. Its portfolio spans electric, hydrogen, and advanced air mobility. For example, according to a report by Flight Global that further details JetZero's figures on orders, technical specs, and investment context, UAV has backed hybrid-electric regional airliner developers, hydrogen-fueled aircraft initiatives, and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) projects.

UAV has made a number of alternative aircraft investments including:

Hybrid-electric

Hydrogen-powered

Electric Air Taxis (eVTOLs)

These investments support UA’s goals for a lower-carbon, more efficient future fleet. In recent years, UA also helped launch a US$100 million Sustainable Flight Fund to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). By partnering with JetZero, UA adds a radical new airframe to its horizon of possibilities. If the Z4 proves out, it could become a “core mainline” aircraft for UA’s future long-haul fleet​.

As Chang put it, UAV is focused on companies “that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint,” and JetZero “reflects that philosophy.” Sources: UA and JetZero press releases and aviation industry reports​.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/680b86669ea9aca6c72a6184_JZ%20image%203840x2011.jpg,N,,2025-04-25 18:56:59.971989
