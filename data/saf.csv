She now enjoys collecting the waste from her used cooking oil (UCO), knowing it can generate extra income instead of polluting the environment.

Many villagers in Tegalreja have adopted the same practice, selling their UCO to Beo Asri Waste Bank, which partners with Indonesia's state-owned oil company PT Pertamina to reprocess the waste into biofuel for aircraft.

Indonesia has for the first time successfully converted UCO into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a milestone in the country's waste management and alternative energy journey. Domestic carrier Pelita Air has already begun using the UCO-based biofuel on its Jakarta-Bali flights.

""Usually before, we would just throw it in the garbage or the nearby river, which polluted the environment. But now we can collect it and earn money from it,"" Sudarti told Xinhua in a recent phone interview. She said she can earn about 7,000 rupiahs (0.43 U.S. dollars) per kilogram of UCO, packed in bottles.

The collected UCO is absorbed by Pertamina Kilang Internasional (KPI) and processed at the RU IV Cilacap refinery. KPI Operations Director Didik Bahagia said on Friday that, for now, SAF production is limited to the Cilacap facility, but plants in Dumai, Riau province, and Balongan, West Java province, are targeted to join next year.

""We expect to process up to 38,566 kilolitres of UCO per year, with a production potential of 1,236,146 kilolitres. With that, we can meet domestic demand for SAF and even explore export opportunities,"" Bahagia said, adding that Indonesia is the first country in Southeast Asia to produce such fuel.

PT Pertamina's Vice President of Corporate Communication, Fadjar Djoko Santoso, said Tuesday that the company had established UCO collection points at 35 fuel stations in major cities, including Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya.

""People who want to sell their UCO can come to the nearest collection point. The price is on average 5,000 to 5,500 rupiahs (0.30 to 0.33 dollars) per litre. So, please feel free to sell your UCO,"" Santoso said.

Turning everyday kitchen waste into biofuel not only cuts carbon emissions in aviation, one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, but also stimulates a domestic circular economy. It is part of Indonesia's broader strategy to green transport fuels and reach its net-zero emissions target.

Chairman of the Indonesian UCO Collectors Association for Renewable Energy, Matias Tumanggor, noted that Indonesia has significant UCO potential, while a study by Traction Energy Asia estimates that Indonesia could produce 2 million kilolitres of UCO annually, sourced from households, street vendors, restaurants, and the food industry.

Dadan Kusdiana, secretary general of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, said SAF made from UCO could reduce carbon emissions by up to 84 percent compared with fossil-based jet fuel.

He stressed that SAF is a breakthrough opportunity for aviation to reduce its carbon footprint without compromising safety or performance.

""Today's momentum confirms that Indonesia's clean energy transition is not just talk, but a series of practical steps, starting with harnessing bioenergy potential, integrating refinery technology, and public participation in supply. However, there remains work to be done, particularly in bioethanol development and strengthening inter-agency collaboration,"" Kusdiana said. ■",,N,,2025-09-01 00:56:31.150076

Oil company Eneos Corp. had also reached agreements with 26 municipalities as of June to collect waste cooking oil from households.
The number of municipalities collecting waste cooking oil started to increase after the Conference of Parties (COP3) in 1997 in Kyoto.

Koshikawa added: “Waste cooking oil is discarded along with food scraps, but it can be used effectively when it is separated.","In a significant step toward aviation decarbonization, major Japanese carriers are now being refueled with domestically produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) using waste cooking oil.

A ceremony was held July 7 at Tokyo’s Haneda Airport to mark the official launch of the technology to achieve net zero emissions in aviation.

Shinichi Inoue, president of All Nippon Airways Co., told the gathering that SAF holds the key to achieving carbon neutrality, which means balancing emissions from human activities with those absorbed by forests and other sources.

Japan’s first SAF mass-production plant was completed at the site of Cosmo Oil Co.’s Sakai Refinery in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture, last December.

The plant started production in April to supply SAF to Kansai, Chubu and Haneda airports.

While the central government has set 2050 as its target year to achieve carbon neutrality, the aviation industry envisages having SAF account for 10 percent of the fuel it uses in 2030. The industry came up with the goal in 2022 under its basic policy to promote decarbonization based on the Aviation Law.

Because cooking oils derive from plants that had absorbed carbon dioxide as they grew, SAF is said to reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 80 percent when compared with conventional jet fuel.

The key issue is producing enough of the stuff to achieve clean energy in the aviation sector.

The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy said 1.72 million kiloliters of SAF will be needed annually to achieve the 10 percent figure.

But only 500,000 tons, or around 550,000 kiloliters, of used cooking oil is generated in Japan each year, according to the Japan Federation of UC Oil Business Cooperative Associations (UCO Japan), which organizes the collection of waste cooking oil for recycling as biofuel.

The bulk, around 400,000 tons, is reclaimed from food industry sources, including food plants and restaurants, and is subsequently used for livestock feed or exported. Ninety-five percent of it is used that way.

Attention is now focused on how to collect 90 percent of the remaining 100,000 tons produced in homes that literally goes to waste.

Itami city authorities in Hyogo Prefecture formalized a SAF partnership during a ceremony held at the city hall in June.

Since fiscal 1999, the municipality has collected residential waste oil, converting it into biodiesel for its sanitation vehicles and other purposes.

But now, all the material is repurposed into sustainable aviation fuel.

The Higashi-Murayama city government in western Tokyo struck a similar agreement in February to collect used cooking oil from homes.

These agreements were spearheaded by construction giant JGC Holdings Corp. under its “Fry to Fly Project” to achieve the goal of emissions-free aviation.

About 250 entities, including more than 30 municipal governments, are supporting the initiative.

“The key is to secure waste cooking oil,” said project head Yuki Nishimura.

Oil company Eneos Corp. had also reached agreements with 26 municipalities as of June to collect waste cooking oil from households.

The company is working on a project with trading house Mitsubishi Corp. to produce SAF at its Wakayama refinery in or after the business year that begins in April 2028.

“It takes time for people to learn about SAF. We are forging ahead with the project as part of an awareness campaign before the plant starts operations,” a representative said.

The number of municipalities collecting waste cooking oil started to increase after the Conference of Parties (COP3) in 1997 in Kyoto.

The Kyoto city government began recovering used cooking oil that year to convert it into biodiesel fuel.

Currently, it collects about 120,000 liters at 1,645 locations across the city every year to power 185 garbage trucks and 115 city buses.

Kyoto-based Revo International Inc., which has been working with the city government on the project, also produces SAF.

Japan’s first SAF production plant in Sakai is run by a limited liability company whose shareholders include JGC Holdings, Cosmo Oil and Revo International.

Tetsuya Koshikawa, CEO of Revo International, has been at the forefront of collecting waste cooking oil and producing biodiesel fuels for the past 30 years.

“Many people said it would be difficult for biofuel to stay relevant, which makes it so heartening to see it being used as a recyclable resource to provide aviation fuel,” he said.

Koshikawa added: “Waste cooking oil is discarded along with food scraps, but it can be used effectively when it is separated. It is a necessary resource for Japan.”",https://p.potaufeu.asahi.com/b2b4-p/picture/29957764/635a7c0d6a15767649ad0d30d96c3f11.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 23:56:21.729544

Countries worldwide have recognised the immense potential of biofuels in enhancing energy security, mitigating climate change, and stimulating economic growth.

Pakistan's economy is strongly anchored in agriculture, which accounts for nearly a quarter of its gross domestic product (GDP) and employs almost half of the country's workforce.

However, the sector also generates significant waste, raising environmental and sustainability concerns. The innovative strategy of harnessing this agricultural waste for biofuel production not only mitigates waste management concerns but also transforms two major challenges — environmental sustainability and costly energy dependence — into a single, impactful solution.

Biofuel is any fuel derived from organic sources, such as plant biomass, agricultural residues, or animal by-products. The production of biofuels generally relies on three distinct technological approaches: chemical, biological, and physical processes.

Biogas and bioethanol stand out as two of the most widely recognised biofuels, both produced through biological fermentation methods. However, a range of innovative biofuels is also emerging, including dimethyl ether (DME), sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), diesel, and butanol, which hold significant potential for advancing renewable energy solutions.

The evolution of biofuel technology is also notable, as it transitions from first generation, which primarily relied on food crops as feedstock, to second generation that utilises lignocellulosic feedstock, such as crop residues and other agricultural waste.

Even more advanced are third-generation biofuels, which leverage algae as a high-yield feedstock, marking a significant step forward in sustainable energy production.

Countries worldwide have recognised the immense potential of biofuels in enhancing energy security, mitigating climate change, and stimulating economic growth. Leading the way in integrating biofuels into their energy portfolios are Brazil and the United States.

For Pakistan, biofuel production offers a similar opportunity, serving as both a strategic step towards achieving energy independence and a crucial measure to address the environmental challenges associated with crop residue burning.

Pakistan has decades of experience in producing bioethanol and biogas, making them ideal starting points for expanding the country's biofuel capabilities. Initial efforts could focus on enhancing ethanol production by transitioning from first generation to second generation, and eventually to third generation.

Simultaneously, we could explore the development of valuable biofuels such as SAF, diesel, and gasoline through innovative pathways like the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and alcohol-to-gasoline (ATG) technologies.

DME is emerging as a highly promising and versatile fuel known for its clean-burning properties. It is widely utilised as a substitute for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in domestic, industrial, and transportation applications.

DME can either be blended with LPG or used as a complete replacement, making it a flexible and adaptable option. China has been a global leader in adopting DME, while Indonesia has also made significant strides by gradually replacing LPG with DME, benefiting from its compatibility with the existing LPG infrastructure.

In Europe and North America, several initiatives are underway to produce and promote DME as a cleaner, more sustainable alternative for transportation fuels.

Recent advancements in technology have enabled the production of second-generation DME through a fermentative process in Australia. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale production of this biofuel, positioning it as a sustainable option with potential on a par with second-generation bioethanol.

To fully harness the potential benefits of biofuels, Pakistan must focus on developing a comprehensive, multistep framework tailored to the country's unique challenges and opportunities. This approach begins with creating the initial roadmap, which lays the foundation for formulating a detailed policy plan.

The policy plan would then lead to the development of an actionable implementation strategy. The subsequent phase would involve establishing robust standards and regulations to ensure consistency, quality, and adherence to international practices.

Finally, the process culminates in the effective execution of these measures. This systematic and well-structured framework would position Pakistan to maximise the economic, environmental, and energy security benefits of biofuels.

The development of this framework would be guided by world-renowned experts and scientists specialising in both current and emerging biofuel technologies. By incorporating their insights, the strategy can emphasise a multipronged approach that addresses three essential priorities: support to attract foreign investment, fostering local industrial capacity, and a strong commitment to indigenous research and development (R&D).

To maximise the effectiveness of these three components, the government-led supporting initiatives need to be integrated into the framework right from the initial roadmap stage.

On the commercial front, these initiatives might include tax incentives, subsidies for biofuel production facilities, public-private partnerships, and the introduction of blending mandates across all fuel types. For instance, the government could enforce mandates requiring 10-20% biofuel blends in diesel, petrol, aviation fuel, and LPG, with a long-term vision of scaling these blends up to 50% and eventually transitioning to 100% renewable fuels.

Building robust indigenous R&D capabilities is essential for innovating cost-effective production methods tailored to the local feedstock. To achieve this, Pakistan could leverage its overseas diaspora of accomplished scientists by establishing connections with domestic universities and institutions to facilitate knowledge exchange and expertise development.

A key starting point would be the creation of one or more centres of excellence in biofuels. These centres could focus on identifying under-researched areas, where global competition remains limited, to accelerate the development of local expertise and intellectual property, positioning Pakistan ahead of international competitors.

The strategic integration of policy reform and advanced research initiatives is crucial for guiding Pakistan towards a sustainable and prosperous energy future. With a pragmatic, multipronged approach, the country has the potential not only to meet its domestic energy demand but also to emerge as a leading regional supplier of renewable fuels, thereby redefining its energy narrative for the decades to come.

By leveraging strategic partnerships, AI-driven innovation, and disciplined underwriting, IAG is not only navigating the challenges of a consolidating sector but also positioning itself to create enduring value. For investors, the question is whether these moves translate into a sustainable competitive advantage—or if they are merely tactical adjustments in a crowded market.

Strategic Partnerships: Anchoring Growth in Regional Markets

IAG’s alliances with the Royal Automobile Clubs of Queensland (RACQ) and Western Australia (RAC) exemplify its focus on regional expansion. These partnerships are projected to add $3 billion in gross written premiums (GWP) and boost insurance profit by at least $300 million, directly addressing the need for scale in fragmented markets [1]. By integrating RACQ and RAC’s customer bases, IAG is expanding its distribution network while reducing customer acquisition costs—a critical edge in a sector where margins are often razor-thin.

The strategic logic here is clear: regional players often possess localized expertise and customer trust, which national insurers struggle to replicate. By acquiring these regional assets, IAG is blending local knowledge with its own operational efficiency, a formula that mirrors broader industry trends. For instance, Marsh McLennan’s 2025 acquisition of Olympic Insurance Agency similarly aimed to leverage regional specialization in high-growth sectors like real estate and manufacturing [4]. IAG’s approach, however, is distinct in its emphasis on technology and data-driven underwriting, which we’ll explore next.

Technological Innovation: The AI-Driven Edge

IAG’s investment in artificial intelligence (AI) is a cornerstone of its strategy. AI-powered tools now resolve 70% of simple claims in real time, reducing costs by 30–50% and enhancing customer satisfaction [1]. This is not just about efficiency—it’s about redefining the customer experience in an industry historically plagued by slow claims processing and opaque pricing.

The company’s partnership with Canadian AI firm DAITY to develop risk analytics further underscores its commitment to innovation. By integrating AI into underwriting, IAG is able to refine pricing models, identify emerging risks (such as climate-related perils), and allocate capital more effectively [1]. This technological edge is particularly valuable in a consolidating sector where larger firms can outspend smaller competitors on data infrastructure.

Reinsurance and Risk Management: Stabilizing Earnings in a Volatile Environment

Natural perils—wildfires, floods, and cyclones—remain a wildcard for insurers. IAG has mitigated this risk through a $2.8 billion reinsurance deal with Berkshire Hathaway and an additional $650 million adverse cover from Enstar, capping annual natural peril costs at $1.283 billion [1]. This financial armor not only stabilizes earnings but also allows IAG to maintain aggressive underwriting margins, which rose to 17.5% in FY25 from 15.6% in FY24 [2].

The reinsurance strategy is a masterstroke in risk management. By transferring a portion of its exposure to reinsurers, IAG can focus on growth without sacrificing resilience. This is especially critical in a sector where climate change is driving up the frequency and severity of catastrophic events.

Consolidation and Competitive Positioning: A Sector in Flux

The insurance industry is undergoing a wave of consolidation, with large firms acquiring regional players to capture market share and expertise. For example, Arthur J. Gallagher’s $13.5 billion purchase of AssuredPartners and Marsh’s $7.75 billion acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services highlight the trend [4]. IAG’s own acquisitions of RACQ and RAC align with this pattern, but its emphasis on technology and ESG (e.g., investments in sustainable aviation fuel) differentiates it from peers [1].

This consolidation creates both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, it allows IAG to scale rapidly; on the other, it intensifies competition for talent, technology, and capital. However, IAG’s disciplined underwriting—prioritizing profitability over market share—and its ability to absorb costs through AI and reinsurance give it a structural advantage.

The Long-Term Outlook: A High-Conviction Play?

For IAG to succeed in the long term, it must continue to balance growth with prudence. Its FY25 results—$9.98 billion in net earned premiums and a projected $1.45–$1.65 billion in insurance profit for FY26 [3]—suggest it is on track. Yet, the company’s future will depend on its ability to adapt to macroeconomic shifts, such as rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions, which could strain underwriting models.

Investors should also monitor IAG’s ESG initiatives. As climate risks become more acute, insurers that integrate sustainability into their operations—whether through green investments or AI-driven risk modeling—will likely outperform peers. IAG’s dual focus on technology and ESG positions it well in this regard.

Conclusion

IAG’s strategic expansion in regional insurance markets is a compelling case study in long-term value creation. By combining partnerships, AI, and reinsurance, the company is building a moat that protects against both industry volatility and competitive pressures. In a consolidating sector, where the winners will be those who can scale efficiently while maintaining profitability, IAG’s playbook offers a blueprint for success.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-31 21:56:35.725730

Jaminan ini diberikan setelah dilakukan pemantauan langsung ke sejumlah titik distribusi energi vital, mulai dari terminal BBM, stasiun pengisian nelayan, hingga fasilitas aviasi.

Anggota Komite BPH Migas, Basuki Trikora Putra atau akrab disapa Tiko, menyampaikan bahwa kelancaran pasokan energi di Bali sangat penting, bukan hanya untuk mobilitas masyarakat, tetapi juga sebagai penopang pertumbuhan ekonomi daerah yang bergantung pada sektor pariwisata.

“Bali ini menjadi destinasi wisata internasional dan sudah mendunia. Karena itu, dukungan kebutuhan energi, baik BBM maupun aviasi, harus betul-betul tersedia dengan baik,” ujar Tiko usai meninjau Integrated Terminal (IT) Manggis, Karangasem, Kamis (28/8/2025).

Selain memastikan ketersediaan pasokan, BPH Migas juga menaruh perhatian besar pada sarana distribusi. Tiko menekankan pentingnya memastikan kondisi armada mobil tangki dan awaknya dalam keadaan prima.

“Kami mengecek operasional mobil tangki sebagai alat distribusi BBM kepada lembaga penyalur. Kondisi mobil dan awak mobil tangki harus dipastikan benar-benar baik agar distribusi tidak terganggu,” jelasnya.

Ia menambahkan, bagian penting dari rantai pasok adalah memastikan produk BBM sesuai dengan spesifikasi pemerintah. Hal ini menjadi tugas dan tanggung jawab BPH Migas untuk menjamin konsumen menerima BBM yang layak pakai.

Pemantauan juga dilakukan di SPBU Nelayan (SPBUN) Badung pada Jumat (29/8/2025). Fokusnya adalah penyaluran BBM subsidi dan kompensasi yang diberikan melalui mekanisme surat rekomendasi.

“Pihak penyalur harus lebih berhati-hati. Jangan sampai kuota BBM subsidi jatuh ke tangan konsumen yang tidak sesuai ketentuan. Bila ditemukan ketidaksesuaian surat rekomendasi, penyalur wajib melaporkannya ke dinas terkait,” tegas Tiko.

Selain sektor darat dan laut, BPH Migas turut memastikan pasokan BBM untuk sektor udara. Tinjauan dilakukan di Aviation Fuel Terminal (AFT) Ngurah Rai, Badung, yang memasok avtur bagi maskapai penerbangan di Bali.

“Kondisi pasokan dan penyaluran avtur di AFT Ngurah Rai sudah berjalan cukup baik. Yang penting, operasional di sini harus tetap kondusif agar penerbangan bagi masyarakat dan wisatawan tidak terganggu,” ungkap Tiko.

Dalam kunjungan itu, BPH Migas juga memonitor hasil uji coba Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), campuran avtur dengan 2,5 persen minyak jelantah (used cooking oil/UCO). Uji coba ini dilakukan oleh maskapai Pelita Air untuk penerbangan rute Jakarta–Bali.

“Kami mengapresiasi uji coba SAF ini. Ini pencapaian luar biasa yang dapat mendukung penggunaan energi berkelanjutan di bandara-bandara Indonesia,” tambahnya.

Pemantauan BPH Migas ini turut melibatkan sejumlah pihak, antara lain AFT Manager Ngurah Rai I Komang Susilo Gosa, Sales Area Manager Fuel Retail Bali Pertamina Patra Niaga Endo Eko Satryo, Sales Branch Manager Fuel I Bali Azam Akbar Hawariy, serta Sales Branch Manager Fuel III Bali Made Bilan.

The sky may still be the limit—but only if aviation fuel keeps pace with the world below.","IATA warns jet fuel supply at risk without urgent SAF scale-up

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has issued a stark warning in its May 2025 report, “Conventional Aviation Fuel and the Energy Transition: Refineries in Focus.” As the global energy sector moves decisively away from fossil fuels, traditional oil refineries are closing at a rapid pace—putting conventional aviation fuel (CAF) supply under mounting pressure.

While the energy transition is vital to climate goals, the IATA cautions that without coordinated action, the aviation sector may face a growing shortfall in jet fuel availability. The report argues that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is not only essential for decarbonisation, but also critical to mitigating fuel supply volatility caused by refinery closures and import dependencies.

A shifting demand landscape

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects oil demand for ground transport will peak by 2030, driven by electric vehicles (EVs) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Refineries, traditionally optimised for gasoline and diesel fuel, are economically unsustainable in a world of declining fossil fuel demand.

Unlike road transport, aviation lacks immediate alternatives. Jet fuel remains essential, as electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft are still decades from widespread use. Yet jet fuel makes up only 6–7% of refinery output. As demand for gasoline and diesel fuel weakens, refineries are rationalising or repurposing facilities, threatening jet fuel supply security.

Refinery rationalization and regional impacts

Japan illustrates the risks: government-imposed regulations and demographic shifts led to refinery closures, which later triggered aviation fuel shortages during the post-Covid-19 air travel recovery. The U.S. West Coast faces similar vulnerabilities, relying on imports from Asia due to limited pipeline infrastructure and Jones Act restrictions, which require goods shipped between U.S. ports to be transported on U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, and U.S.-crewed vessels. Europe is also at risk, with closures planned for key refineries like Grangemouth, UK, and Wesseling, Germany, in 2025.

Supply chain stress and price volatility

Longer, more complex supply chains heighten exposure to geopolitical disruptions. The Red Sea crisis and Panama Canal droughts have already caused delays and shipping cost spikes. In the U.S., regional jet fuel prices have become increasingly volatile. Without structural incentives, refineries are unlikely to boost jet fuel production, since it remains a marginal product compared to gasoline or diesel fuel.

SAF: A strategic buffer, not just a climate tool

SAF is typically viewed as a decarbonisation solution. Produced from waste oils, biomass, or synthetics, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. But the IATA report argues that SAF also enhances supply resilience. With global SAF output under 0.2% of total jet fuel use in 2024, scaling production is urgent.

SAF pathways include bio-based (e.g., HEFA from used cooking oil) and power-to-liquid (PtL) synthetic fuels. Each faces barriers—feedstock limits, cost, and technology maturity. Yet SAF could be produced in retrofitted refineries or co-processed in existing facilities. IATA advocates policy support for these conversions and long-term investment in SAF infrastructure.

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates minimum SAF blending, while the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act offers production credits. But globally, SAF supply still lags far behind projected demand. To meet net-zero goals, production must scale to more than 400 billion litres by 2050.

Safeguarding aviation’s energy future

The report urges governments and industry stakeholders to treat SAF as essential to aviation’s energy security. Without SAF, the sector risks fuel shortages, supply bottlenecks, and cost spikes. Airports must upgrade infrastructure to support multiple fuel types, and airlines should diversify their sourcing strategies.

Increased SAF adoption can also cushion airlines from crude oil market swings. Long-term offtake agreements and regional SAF hubs could stabilise pricing, secure supply, and reduce carbon liabilities.

The IATA’s May 2025 report makes clear that the energy transition—if unmanaged—could destabilise global aviation fuel supply. SAF offers a path forward, addressing both emissions and resilience. Governments must incentivise SAF production, refineries must adapt, and airlines must invest in future-proofing their fuel strategy.

,,2025-08-31 21:27:50+00:00,The Business Times,Temasek's GenZero challenges idea that only carbon removal solutions matter,Janice Lim,,,,,https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/esg/temaseks-genzero-challenges-idea-only-carbon-removal-solutions-matter,"[SINGAPORE] Temasek’s investment platform GenZero has pushed back against some segments of the sustainability community for their position that only carbon credits generated from carbon removal technologies are credible.
There have been calls by some that carbon removal projects – which involve actively taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it – is more permanent, and therefore, more credible.
Carbon removals projects include direct air capture, which is currently limited in supply and very costly.
One example is its partnership with Chinese tech company Tencent to offtake at least one million carbon credits from GenZero’s investment portfolio over 15 years.
This includes companies that support the scaling of the carbon markets, such as carbon exchange Climate Impact X.","[SINGAPORE] Temasek’s investment platform GenZero has pushed back against some segments of the sustainability community for their position that only carbon credits generated from carbon removal technologies are credible.

The state investor’s decarbonisation-focused investment vehicle said that such “debates over whether one particular type of carbon credits counts and others do not are not productive”, in its latest sustainability report released on Monday (Sep 1).

While GenZero subscribes to the principle that carbon credits should be a means to tackle residual emissions and serves as a complement to the bigger priority of governments and corporates reducing their own emissions as much as possible, it does not mean that credits generated from non-removal projects or solutions are not a valid avenue.

According to GenZero, there is evidence that there are high-quality credits being generated from a range of projects, from nature-based ones to technological solutions, as well as projects that focus on emission reductions and removals.

“So we cannot discount and we cannot go upfront to say that only removals, or 10-day removals or durable removals matter,” said Anshari Rahman, director of policy and analytics at GenZero’s strategy and development group.

Speaking during a media briefing, he added: “You need to tackle the issue on a principles basis. If the issue is reversals or permanence, we should look at how standards and methodologies can... use the best available science and technology to improve monitoring, and address some of these pain points.”

There has been continued debate over the credibility of carbon credits generated from the reductions of emissions. Such projects include nature-based ones such as avoided deforestation, or technology-based ones like the use of sustainable aviation fuel in aircraft.

While such criticisms have been around since the formation of carbon markets, the debate resurfaced recently as various scandals challenging the integrity of various carbon reductions projects emerged. Criticisms that credits that have been generated and used do not represent actual emissions reductions have sent the prices of carbon credits and the trading volume plummeting over the last few years.

There have been calls by some that carbon removal projects – which involve actively taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it – is more permanent, and therefore, more credible.

Carbon removals projects include direct air capture, which is currently limited in supply and very costly.

While work still needs to be done in improving regulatory framework – by national governments and international bodies – around this nascent industry, GenZero noted that there has been progress over the last few years in response to credit buyers pulling back on concerns over their integrity.

“We must not let the pursuit of perfection slow down climate action. Although carbon markets are still evolving, uncertainty should not justify paralysis,” said the report.

In light of the ongoing evolution of carbon markets, GenZero said that it has bolstered its risk management framework with enhanced due diligence measures including third-party audits and verifications conducted both pre and post- investment.

On the issue of integrity, GenZero chief executive officer Frederick Teo has confirmed that the investor no longer has a stake in the former C-Quest Capital – which has been rebranded to Bridge Carbon – after its former chief executive officer Kenneth Newcombe became embroiled in fraud charges over one of the cookstove programme it is running.

GenZero’s investment thesis

The carbon market downturn has led GenZero to adjust its investment process.

While it initially would invest in carbon projects in the belief that demand for credits will come once the supply is generated, the investor is now more proactive in securing buyers from the get-go, said Kimberly Tan, head of GenZero’s investment group. One example is its partnership with Chinese tech company Tencent to offtake at least one million carbon credits from GenZero’s investment portfolio over 15 years.

“The idea of some of those initiatives is... to understand what buyers want, to align upfront, and then to... invest in projects where we can be reasonably certain that there will be demand – in the form of a multi-year off-take that will give our project that base load of financial returns, or at least capital protection,” said Tan.

As for how the investor will continually make these adjustments in the current environment where climate action is potentially reduced due to policy actions by US President Donald Trump, Tan said that it will continue to look for investments that are “regulation-proof”.

“A lot of the climate tech innovation does happen in the US, and I think that will remain and probably will not change, regardless of the political environment. I think what we do have to take into account is then given the current existing exposure, how do we then very selectively add on,” she added.

GenZero said in its report that government and corporate pullbacks have contributed to a slowdown in climate investing.

It sees a real risk that governments managing tight fiscal budgets with multiple competing needs will choose to cut back on investments in climate.

With tariffs leading to cost increases and supply chain disruptions, companies will also be less willing to adopt fundamental decarbonisation technologies given the weaker appetite for capital expenditures.

They will also be less likely to embark on ambitious net-zero plans involving the use of carbon credits to address residual emissions, given the fear of greenwashing accusations.

Of the S$5 billion of startup capital that Temasek provided to GenZero since its inception in 2022, less than half has been deployed, although Teo declined to give an exact figure when asked by reporters.

Its capital is channelled into three main decarbonisation pillars: nature-based projects, technology-based ones, as well as carbon ecosystem enablers. This includes companies that support the scaling of the carbon markets, such as carbon exchange Climate Impact X.

While its funds are split relatively equally across all three pillars, Teo said, GenZero’s portfolio construction is a dynamic process.

The ability to scale and generate commercial returns, the potential for climate impact to be realised in the near term are some of the factors that the investor looks at when making its investment decisions. It does not have a set target on how much capital should go to each of the three pillars.

Climate impact

GenZero revealed in its inaugural sustainability report that it has set a target to achieve reductions or removals of at least seven million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) cumulatively by end-March 2028.

It has achieved direct climate impact of three million tCO2e as at Dec 31, 2024 cumulatively since 2024. This just takes into account its stake in its investee companies across its portfolio.

This number goes up to 12.9 million tCO2e when including indirect realised climate impact.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/5b4fc899a6a2753928f6a6bbf7fce53437571cc5aa783fd69d074ddde5f6327c?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-08-31 18:56:21.994357

Unlike conventional jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel comes from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops.
But it is not widely used because supplies are limited, and its cost is three to five times that of regular aviation fuel.
Sustainable aviation fuel costs more, partly because of the logistical challenge of sourcing raw materials, said Malinen.
India, Thailand and Malaysia have announced 1 per cent targets by 2027, but further goals have not been confirmed.","[SINGAPORE] Governments must be more ambitious in mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuel to spur its producers to ramp up output, said Heikki Malinen, president and chief executive officer of green-fuel producer, Neste.

He said that Singapore’s targets, extending through 2030, set a good example – but global governments can go further, and shoot for higher, longer-term goals.

In 2026, Singapore will impose a levy on outbound flights, calculated based on a national target for sustainable aviation fuel to make up 1 per cent of all the fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026.

By 2030, this will rise to between 3 and 5 per cent.

In an interview with The Business Times, Malinen said: “We need a transitory solution between conventional jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuel, and that’s why we believe the mandate should be raised to about 10 per cent over the next five to seven years.”

Neste is listed on Nasdaq Helsinki, and is the world’s biggest producer of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

But without concrete signals about future demand, producers of this greener jet fuel cannot afford to gamble by ramping up capacity, Malinen said, as setting up production facilities takes years and requires major capital expenditure.

Singapore’s unique approach – with centralised procurement and a national target for sustainable aviation fuel based on volume – could thus be a “guiding light” for the region, he said.

Still on the ground

Sustainable fuel is viewed as the most viable way to decarbonise aviation at the moment; other options such as hydrogen and electric power are expected to be adopted only in the 2040s.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel comes from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops. It can cut carbon and greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 90 per cent.

But it is not widely used because supplies are limited, and its cost is three to five times that of regular aviation fuel.

Growth in the supply of this greener fuel remains “disappointingly slow”, said the International Air Transport Association. A million tonnes of it was produced in 2024, just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production.

The high price is a barrier, and fuel accounts for as much as 30 per cent of an airline’s costs. Airlines already have thin profit margins – around 3 per cent in 2024 – and competition is fierce, with travellers being sensitive to ticket price increases.

Sustainable aviation fuel costs more, partly because of the logistical challenge of sourcing raw materials, said Malinen. Neste has around 600 vendors in 60 countries, and has set up networks to collect, for example, used cooking oil. It has long focused on using waste and residues, which others cannot easily use, to make this green fuel.

While supply is also affected by factors such as technology, mandates should increase production, he said. And as economies of scale grow, the price gap between conventional fuel and this greener fuel should narrow.

Mandates on the use of sustainable jet fuel are, however, gaining momentum: The European Union and the United Kingdom have led the way with binding targets of 6 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively, by 2030; at least another 17 nations have announced or are considering mandates or targets.

But most existing policies lack specifics and have a limited time-frame, said Malinen.

Australia has a non-binding goal of 10 per cent usage by 2030. India, Thailand and Malaysia have announced 1 per cent targets by 2027, but further goals have not been confirmed.

China, the world’s second-largest market for passenger aviation, announced the use of only 50,000 tonnes of this fuel by this year.

Malinen said: “What industrial companies like Neste would find very helpful is more visibility on the longer-term plans. If decisions are made on an annual basis, without a long-term perspective, how can a company take a massive bet for investing (in the production of this fuel)?”

He added: “If you want to have enough capacity for the early 2030s, you need to start making decisions now.”

This is because building the plants that produce this fuel is no small task. For instance, Neste began planning for its 2.5 billion euro (S$3.7 billion) Rotterdam facility in 2020. It will be completed only in 2027.

File a flight path

The lack of clarity is clouding investment decisions, said Malinen. “We’ve seen a number of companies now retract their investment plans, simply because no one really knows what happens next in the regulatory fight.”

The uncertainty also makes it harder to secure funding – a key reason for the failure of recent projects in sustainable aviation fuel.

In 2024, five such projects with a planned output of almost a million tonnes were cancelled. These included Oceania Biofuels’ project to build Australia’s first plant for this fuel; the project between Fulcrum Bioenergy and Solena in the US; and those by oil majors Shell and BP.

At least three projects in China have reportedly been postponed, and the lack of clear signals on the future of this greener fuel was cited as a reason.

But there are some bright spots, especially in the Asia-Pacific, said Malinen, citing Singapore, Thailand and Japan as the “frontrunners”.

Japan has the “most ambitious” long-term target in Asia – of 10 per cent sustainable aviation fuel by 2030; Thailand’s target is 1 per cent in 2026, gradually going up to 8 per cent by 2036.

Singapore’s target – 3 to 5 per cent by 2030 – is not as high, but Malinen noted that the country is seen as a “shining star”, adding: “My understanding is that what it does, others will follow eventually.

“So the decision Singapore takes on these mandates is extremely critical for the whole region,” he said, and expressed hope that the Republic would set higher targets.

Regardless, Singapore’s centralised approach is an efficient and transparent one that others should emulate, he said.

“If Singapore Airlines and Singapore take on the decision to use sustainable aviation fuel, then others will eventually have to follow, because they don’t want to be left behind.”

To date, the Singapore Airlines group has purchased 3,000 tonnes of this fuel from Neste’s Singapore refinery, in preparation for using it for 5 per cent of its total requirements by 2030.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/ccfc27461402233f42e10ce24fdba4db1f0e2dd45e7d2a43e91bf062b13f9015?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-08-31 17:56:22.696635

Cumulatively, the direct and indirect climate impact by GenZero amounts to 12.9 million tonnes as at Dec 31, 2024.
They may also face greater regulation that requires them to factor the price of their carbon emissions into their bottom lines.","SINGAPORE – Three million tonnes of planet-warming emissions have been directly reduced or removed from the atmosphere due to investments made by Singapore-based climate investment firm GenZero as at Dec 31, 2024.

In its inaugural sustainability report published on Sept 1, GenZero said it aims to contribute to at least seven million tonnes of direct emission reductions or removals through its investments by March 31, 2028 .

This is equivalent to about 10.9 per cent of Singapore’s emissions

projected for 2028

.

GenZero was set up by Singapore’s investment company Temasek in 2022 with an initial injection of about $5 billion.

Its focu s is on enabling a global trade in carbon credits by investing in nature and technology, as well as services to boost the credibility of carbon markets.

GenZero chief executive Frederick Teo declined to reveal the investment quantum utilised so far, saying only that “the majority of the firm’s initial funding has not been deployed”.

Setting a climate impact performance target puts GenZero among the first global investment entities to do so.

Other ways of measuring climate impact used by other firms include the size of investments in sustainability initiatives, size of nature areas restored, and species saved.

The report’s coordinator Sofia Galanek told the media at a briefing ahead of the report’s release that by setting the target, the firm hopes to hold itself to “a higher level of accountability” in a market where few set goals for the amount of emissions reduced or removed by their actual level of investment.

“We see a lot of net-zero targets, emission reduction targets, but not so much on the achievement of climate impact,” said Ms Galanek, GenZero’s senior associate of strategy and development.

“While the ecosystem is still on its journey to standardise climate impact measurement, we hope that by setting the target, we can contribute to the dialogue in this industry and demonstrate our achievements over time.”

GenZero’s climate impact target is also calculated based on its own stake in its investments.

Mr Teo said the firm chose 2028 as a near-term milestone, as the deadline provides “enough time to generate some climate impact from our early investments and instils early accountability for our impact performance”.

“The capital we have deployed will continue to generate climate benefits well beyond 2028,” he added. “Together with new investments in the coming years, we are laying the foundation for more ambitious long-term climate impact.”

The firm maintains a global portfolio of investments that are split across solutions that use nature to reduce emissions, decarbonisation technologies and levers that enable carbon markets to grow.

For instance, it has invested in Aurora Sustainable Lands, a firm that employs various ways of managing forests in the United States to maximise carbon dioxide absorption.

GenZero has backed CleanJoule, a firm that is commercialising technology to produce sustainable aviation fuel that can reduce aircraft emissions.

The investment firm has invested in related services that can boost the credibility of carbon projects, such as BeZero Carbon, a global carbon ratings agency that validates projects.

Mr Teo said GenZero’s climate impact target includes only emission reductions or removals that directly do so, such as nature restoration projects.

Investments that indirectly lead to climate impact, such as sustainable aviation fuel production, or those that contribute to a more favourable market for these technologies, are not factored into the target.

Mr Teo said such investments make nature and technology solutions investable, translating into direct impact in the long run.

“So without the enablers being in place, without investing into the development of a proper ecosystem, you cannot unlock the potential in nature and many other things.”

Responding to queries from the media, Mr Teo said it did not count carbon emissions from its carbon credit investment involving

US firm C-Quest Capital

, which had been embroiled in fraud charges.

Cumulatively, the direct and indirect climate impact by GenZero amounts to 12.9 million tonnes as at Dec 31, 2024.

GenZero also addressed questions on the outlook for carbon markets, given the ongoing trade tensions, economic uncertainty and faltering political support for climate action.

This follows a 2023 Guardian report that rubbished forest carbon offsets and claimed that about 90 per cent of rainforest credits were ineffective.

According to GenZero, climate technology financing dropped by 29 per cent, from US$79 billion (S$101.4 billion) between the f ourt h quarter of 2022 and the t hird qu arter of 2023, to US$56 billion in the following four quarters.

But there are tailwinds that could help lift the dampened outlook, according to GenZero’s director of policy and analytics Anshari Rahman.

He highlighted improved standards, as well as greater transparency and assurance in the quality of these credits, as being a silver lining for the market.

Moreover, many companies have set corporate net-zero targets. They may also face greater regulation that requires them to factor the price of their carbon emissions into their bottom lines.

One carbon credit represents one tonne of planet-warming emissions that is either prevented from being released or avoided. Emitters can buy these credits to offset their carbon footprint.

The carbon market can benefit countries that host carbon projects as it is a source of revenue for underfunded climate initiatives, such as forest conservation projects, that would not otherwise have been implemented.

South-east Asia has a lot of untapped potential for becoming a source of carbon credits, Mr Anshari added.

He said: “Carbon markets can be leveraged as an accelerator for decarbonisation in South-east Asia and the broader Asian region.”

Going forward, GenZero hopes to invest in more projects that have benefits that go beyond carbon, with biogas and agroforestry on its radar.

For example, biogas can contribute to energy security, while agroforestry has the potential to contribute economic opportunities that benefit local communities.

The firm’s managing director and head of investments Kimberly Tan said: “For instance, it may be sustainable cocoa production or sustainable coconut production where local communities benefit from carbon and increased productivities from what we’re doing.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/e5bb8693669fe160021c5d4cf76707e0687486013944554ebb787e567f900d85,N,,2025-08-31 17:56:28.700852

The summit brought together over 500 experts from across the public and private sectors, ranging from energy executives to environmental advocates, to explore innovations in energy, climate resilience, and sustainable growth.

This year’s theme was the energy transition, highlighting the interconnectedness of supply chains, environmental policy, and the urgent need for decarbonization. These themes align directly with NYLCV’s advocacy efforts, especially our push for investments in clean energy and transportation electrification across New York State.

Much of the conversation focused on the potential for business to utilize innovation and investment opportunities to drive progress as well as profits, a mindset that NYLCV highly encourages. As a nonpartisan organization committed to clean air, clean water, renewable energy, and open space, we know that the energy transition isn’t just necessary, it is an opportunity to reshape our economy for the better.

Global Discourse, Local Action

The summit offered a unique opportunity for NYLCV to engage with leaders from both the public and private sectors. The event explored topics ranging from offshore wind and compressed air energy storage to clean transportation and carbon markets, many areas where New York has already taken bold action.

Panels on emerging tech, such as long-duration storage and sustainable aviation fuel, underscored the importance of innovation in scaling emission reduction efforts. A particularly notable presentation by Canadian green energy company Hydrostor detailed how compressed air can be used to store off-peak energy and reduce reliance on peaker plants during times of high demand. Another presentation from an energy storage company highlighted how large-scale battery facilities can alleviate blackouts, a timely concern as heatwaves become more frequent in NYC. These technology applications reflect the same principles NYLCV supports in advocating for grid modernization and resilience at the state level.

Also highlighted was the growing momentum around environmental justice and community-based adaptation. Organizations like CORE, in conjunction with speakers such as Chelsea Clinton, emphasized the need for proactive rather than reactive resilience planning. This is particularly vital in in vulnerable areas facing exceptionally high climate risks. NYLCV’s efforts to increase local investment in parks and green infrastructure echoes this focus on equitable climate solutions that benefit historically marginalized communities.

National Voices Encourage State Leadership

Though the scale of the summit was global, many of the issues hit close to home. From electrifying bus fleets to building smarter, more equitable cities, NYCV’s priorities were reflected in nearly every conversation, a reminder that state and local governments can lead when federal efforts lag.

Former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, now with Bloomberg Philanthropies, delivered a keynote speech stressing the role individual states have in achieving climate targets. She emphasized that even in the absence of \ federal leadership, climate champions like New York must continue to lead on clean energy, emissions reductions, and environmental protections.

NYLCV’s mission to evaluate, endorse, and elect environmentally focused candidates remains essential in advancing this vision. Our work bridges the gap between grassroots advocacy and policy implementation, ensuring that ambitious climate goals are backed by political will and public support.

A Broader Perspective on the Energy Transition

Topics ranged broadly, from smart grid technologies to circular manufacturing. Whether discussing regenerative agriculture or advanced recycling systems, the summit reinforced that climate solutions must be integrated, interdisciplinary, and scalable.

Some other key insights from the conference included:

Expanding possibilities for public-private partnerships in funding the transition, including models supported by green banks and philanthropic capital, even in the face of unfavorable economic forecasts.

The need to better align climate finance and long-term infrastructure planning, particularly in high-cost, high-risk sectors like storage, carbon capture, and electrification.

Looking Ahead

NYLCV’s participation in Sustainability Week reaffirmed our role as a connector between local advocacy and national momentum.

These initiatives are reshaping the company’s financial trajectory and positioning it for long-term viability in the premium private aviation market.

Cost-Cutting and Fleet Modernization: The Foundation of Financial Recovery

Wheels Up’s 2024-2025 strategic overhaul has yielded measurable results. For Q2 2025, the company reduced its net loss by 15% year-over-year to $82.3 million and narrowed its Adjusted EBITDA loss by 22% to $29.0 million [1]. These improvements stem from a $50 million annual cost-saving plan, driven by fleet simplification, overhead reductions, and operational streamlining [2]. The shift to premium aircraft like the Embraer Phenom 300 and Bombardier Challenger 300 has already transformed 17% of the fleet, with plans to add three more Challenger 300s in Q3 2025 [3]. This modernization not only enhances customer experience but also improves unit economics, as premium jets offer higher utilization rates and lower maintenance costs compared to older models [4].

The financial impact is evident: despite a 3% revenue decline in Q2 2025, Wheels Up’s Adjusted Contribution Margin rose by 4 percentage points to 12.2% year-over-year [5]. This margin expansion underscores the effectiveness of cost discipline in offsetting revenue headwinds, a critical step toward breakeven.

Delta Air Lines: A Catalyst for Growth and Stability

Delta Air Lines’ partnership has been instrumental in Wheels Up’s turnaround. Beyond financial backing—a $100 million undrawn revolving credit facility and $150 million term loan [6]—Delta has integrated its corporate sales force into Wheels Up’s operations. This collaboration has unlocked a 25% year-over-year surge in corporate membership fund sales, with corporate customers now accounting for 45% of Wheels Up’s membership fund mix in Q2 2025 [7]. Delta CEO Ed Bastian has emphasized that this synergy is central to Delta’s premium travel strategy, leveraging its 20 million SkyMiles members to create a direct pipeline for Wheels Up’s services [8].

Delta’s influence extends beyond sales. By incorporating Wheels Up into its loyalty program, Delta offers SkyMiles members one million miles for using the private jet service, effectively converting its high-net-worth customer base into a growth engine for Wheels Up [9]. Additionally, Delta’s access to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and fleet optimization expertise has helped Wheels Up align with ESG trends, a growing differentiator in the premium travel sector [10].

Integrated Corporate Sales: A New Revenue Engine

The integration of Delta’s corporate sales team has been a game-changer. Wheels Up CEO George Mattson noted that corporate sales are “outpacing expectations,” with the channel now representing the fastest-growing segment of membership fund sales [11]. This success is attributed to Delta’s ability to cross-sell Wheels Up to its corporate clients, who value the flexibility and prestige of private aviation. The hybrid model—allowing Delta One passengers to extend their itineraries with Wheels Up private jet legs—has further broadened the customer base, appealing to high-income professionals and HNWIs [12].

Risks and the Road to Profitability

While progress is clear, challenges remain. The private aviation market is highly competitive, and converting corporate sales into long-term profitability will require sustained execution. However, Wheels Up’s 2026 timeline for full cost-cutting results and fleet modernization completion offers a clear path to breakeven [13]. With the $500 million credit facility from Delta and other investors providing financial stability, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the $40 billion private aviation market, which is growing at 12% annually [14].

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Premium Travel’s Future

Wheels Up’s strategic turnaround—anchored by cost discipline, fleet modernization, and Delta’s ecosystem—has laid a robust foundation for long-term growth. The combination of improved margins, diversified revenue streams, and a scalable partnership model suggests that UP could emerge as a key player in the premium travel sector. For investors, the question is no longer whether Wheels Up can survive, but how effectively it can leverage its current momentum to dominate a market in flux.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-31 15:56:31.284934

In an exclusive conversation with BioSpectrum Asia, Christopher Ong, Managing Director of DHL Express Singapore, shares how DHL’s latest investments — including a new €10 million pharmaceutical hub — are strengthening Singapore’s position as a strategic life sciences and healthcare logistics hub for the Asia Pacific region

How is DHL contributing to Singapore’s role as a strategic hub for the life sciences and healthcare industry in the Asia Pacific region?

At DHL, we align closely with Singapore's strategic vision to position itself as a leading global hub for life sciences and healthcare (LSHC). Singapore’s robust infrastructure, strong regulatory framework, and prime geographic location has become an attractive spot for multi-nationals and upcoming researchers to establish their presence in Singapore, especially in dedicated estates such as Tuas Biomedical Park and Biopolis. As Singapore’s biomedical sector continues to thrive, manufacturing products valued at nearly S$38 billion (estimated €25.4 billion) for global markets (JTC, 2025), DHL is committed to supporting this growth by providing tailored logistics solutions that meet the evolving needs of the life sciences and healthcare sector.

To do this, we recently launched our €10 million pharmaceutical hub in Singapore to enhance our capabilities and drive innovation in this space. At 8,200 square meters, the new pharma hub brings our total warehouse space in Singapore for dedicated LSHC operations to over 36,000 square meters. This is a major step for us in offering a full, comprehensive suite of solutions for the LSHC industry in cold-chain warehousing, pharmaceutical finished goods, and clinical trials.

The DHL Express global network also connects more than 220 countries and territories globally, with 3 global hubs, 19 regional hubs, and close to 300 aircrafts. In 2024, we upgraded our South Asia Hub (SAH) located by Singapore Changi Airport, further enhancing our global connectivity and boosting our operational capacity on the ground. SAH was established in 2016 to serve as a key logistics hub connecting Singapore to the rest of the world. Today, the hub is also home to five DHL-owned Boeing 777 freighters that optimise transit times between the Americas and Asia. We are equally well-equipped to serve Europe. Our Europe to Asia connection, operated by cargo airline AeroLogic since 2009, remains strong. A joint venture between DHL Express and Lufthansa Cargo, our AeroLogic network mainly serves routes between Europe and Asian destinations from Monday to Fridays, strengthening our service offerings to customers.

Our strong global aviation and ground network and ongoing investments are critical in building our life sciences and healthcare infrastructure and logistics capabilities to support Singapore’s role as a leading global life sciences and healthcare hub.

What does DHL's recent investment in a new pharmaceutical hub in Singapore entail?

Our new pharmaceutical hub in Singapore marks a significant enhancement of DHL’s healthcare logistics capabilities. The hub features specialized temperature-controlled zones, including ambient (15°C to 25°C) and cold room (2°C to 8°C) that ensures precise storage conditions for sensitive healthcare products. It is also Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant and features advanced cold chain infrastructure like airtight loading docks and dedicated anterooms. This is critical in ensuring uninterrupted temperature stability throughout the logistics process.

Located near the Tuas Bio-Medical Park, DHL’s new pharma hub also offers seamless connectivity to Changi Airport and Tuas Mega Port, enabling efficient regional and global distribution for our pharmaceutical partners.

Our vision does not stop here. We are already looking at introducing pharma-related value-added services such redressing activities within this facility. Regional partners can expect more development in the Asia Pacific, especially with DHL’s commitment to invest €500 million into healthcare logistics in Asia Pacific by 2030 to meet the increasing demands and complexities of the market.

How DHL addressing the needs of medical device companies operating in Singapore?

We are focused on deploying specialized logistics solutions tailored for the medical device sector. The export landscape for medical devices is complex and navigating it requires a comprehensive understanding of local regulations to ensure compliance and market access. Our shipping solution, DHL Worldwide Medical Express, or WMX caters specifically to this sector. This solution is designed to help companies navigate the complexities of shipping life-saving medical components internationally and is particularly beneficial for urgent deliveries of time and temperature-sensitive shipments.

Other offerings in the pipeline include dedicated warehousing options for seamless transits, customised transportation options for timely deliveries, advanced tracking systems that provide real-time visibility throughout the logistics process and meet UN 3373 and IATA Dangerous Goods standards.

In addition, we have DHL Certified Life Science Healthcare Specialists that are always ready to help our customers maintain adherence to the regulatory framework governing medical devices by providing guidance to navigate product classifications and compliance requirements across countries. Customers can also opt for shipment insurance that protect their shipments in transit too.

The number of clinical trials in Singapore has been relatively steady the past decade. How can DHL provide value to this segment?

We understand the multi-faceted logistical challenges surrounding clinical trials and take great care in offering comprehensive logistics services tailored for these trials to facilitate a smoother clinical trial workflow and value-add to the drug development process. In Singapore, this is done through temperature-controlled transportation and customized supply chain solutions that guarantee the timely delivery of clinical trial materials, be it investigational drugs, investigational medicinal products, or biological samples. Our services include real-time tracking and monitoring to ensure that all shipments are handled with the utmost care and precision.

WMX shipments receive top priority within our DHL network, with pickups by our couriers as late as possible in the day and deliveries at the earliest available service. Within Asia Pacific, our WMX solution prioritises temperature-controlled, time-critical shipments from over 20,000 clinical sites. Customers can also leverage DHL’s robust and extensive network across the Asia Pacific region to deliver their shipments from main metropolitan cities into Singapore within the next working day. A Saturday delivery option is also available upon request.

Can you elaborate on DHL’s cold chain facilities in Singapore and their importance for temperature-sensitive shipments?

Our cold chain facilities, including the newly opened pharmaceutical hub, are vital for maintaining the integrity of temperature-sensitive medical shipments. Equipped with cutting-edge monitoring technologies, these facilities ensure optimal temperature control throughout the handling process during shipping. By using our WMX service, customers can choose from ambient (room temperature), controlled-ambient (15°C to 25°C), refrigerated (2°C to 8°C), frozen with dry ice (-80°C), frozen (-15°C to -25°C), and ultra-deep frozen (below -180°C) options when shipping their active pharmaceutical ingredients. Contingency activation services like dry ice replenishment and access to refrigerated facilities are also available.

Just this year, our expertise in cold chain management was further strengthened by DHL’s acquisition of Cryoport’s CRYOPDP. CRYOPDP specializes in providing white-glove courier services. This strategic partnership with Cryoport integrates DHL's global health logistics capabilities with Cryoport's industry-leading expertise, giving us an edge in the provision of specialised solutions in a fast-growing life sciences and healthcare market segment.

Besides ensuring optimal temperature control, time is of essence when transporting temperature-sensitive shipments. Coupled with priority pickup and delivery services, our in-house customs team is experienced in clearing priority shipments to maximise efficacy for our customers.

How does DHL balance high-compliance healthcare logistics with its decarbonisation targets in Singapore?

As the healthcare sector in Singapore increasingly prioritises sustainability (Healthcare Asia, 2024), we recognize our role in supporting these efforts. Our investments are aimed at creating a more sustainable supply chain that not only meets international compliance standards but also addresses the environmental impact of healthcare logistics.

At DHL, we started our sustainability journey in 2009 to drive carbon efficiency, and in 2017, we were the first company in the transport and logistics sector to set a 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target. Last year, we strengthened our commitment by introducing a 4th bottom line to our new DHL Group Strategy 2030 - Green Logistics of Choice (on top of Employer of Choice, Provider of Choice, Investment of Choice).

We have been using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a lever in our emission reduction targets for air transportation since 2021. Most recently in July 2025, we signed a deal with Neste to supply 9.5 million litres of SAF from Singapore Changi Airport, one of the largest deals by volume in the air cargo sector in Asia. DHL customers can also opt in for GoGreen Plus and choose a desired proportion of SAF to be used in their international shipments through a “book and claim” system that targets their Scope 3 emissions through carbon insetting.

We have also been converting our ground fleet to electric vehicles (EVs) for last mile pickup and deliveries since 2022. Today, at the Express team, we are the proud operator of over 100 EVs, the largest fleet of commercial EV vans in Singapore.

As the managing director of DHL Express Singapore, what do you think sets DHL apart from other service providers?

I strongly believe that our people bring about growth and quality. Each DHL Express employee goes through a Certified Internal Specialists (CIS) programme that imparts values, and technical and soft skills. It is not by chance that we have been certified by global people analytics and consulting firm Great Place to Work® Institute as the Number 1 Great Place to Work in Singapore for 5 consecutive years, since 2020.

The culture of building a great workplace for all motivates employee to bring about great service quality for customers which eventually lead to customer loyalty, ultimately driving profitability that allows us to reinvest into our business to strengthen our infrastructure and capabilities.

With regards to our life sciences and healthcare segment, we build a culture around what is inside the box – a crucial shipment that can help save lives. This culture permeates throughout our entire logistical chain, where everyone works towards the same vision – to ensure that your time and temperature-sensitive shipments gets delivered to its destination on time.

Finally, how does DHL ensure pandemic resilience in its logistics operations?

The agility to respond to a global pandemic is not built overnight. Over time, DHL has established a robust framework to bolster resilience within our network and operations. In 2020, our capabilities were put to the test during the COVID-19 pandemic when we had to ensure the effective distribution of vaccines efficiently.

Hawaiian Airlines recently unveiled the forthcoming application of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on designated routes between Osaka, Japan, and Honolulu, Hawai. This undertaking, conducted in partnership with Alaska Airlines and Cosmo Oil Marketing Co., is designed to achieve meaningful reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and to advance the promotion of sustainable tourism within the Asia-Pacific corridor. By pioneering the deployment of SAF on international Asia–Pacific services, the carrier seeks to combine a rigorous response to the rising global demand for travel with a measurable commitment to minimising the environmental impacts of its operations.

This step not only aligns with the airline’s sustainability goals but also strengthens tourism between Japan and Hawaii, a region known for its pristine beaches and vibrant culture. Passengers on flights between Kansai International Airport in Osaka and Honolulu will be among the first to experience the benefits of SAF, which can cut life-cycle carbon emissions by up to eighty percent compared to traditional jet fuel.

A Game-Changer for Eco-Tourism

Hawaii’s tourism industry is one of its key economic pillars, with over ten million visitors arriving annually. The introduction of SAF on flights between Japan and Hawaii is poised to enhance the appeal of both destinations, offering an eco-friendly travel option for sustainability-conscious travellers. Tourists can now travel with peace of mind, knowing their flight contributes to reducing global carbon emissions.

The collaboration marks a significant leap towards greener aviation and could become a model for other airlines operating in the Asia-Pacific region. Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint considerably, helping to make tourism more sustainable for future generations.

Cosmo Energy Group’s Role in SAF Production

Cosmo Energy Holdings, a key partner in this initiative, is leading the charge in Japan’s sustainable fuel production. Through a subsidy from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO), Cosmo has developed a supply chain for SAF production, using domestically sourced used cooking oil. The partnership with Hawaiian Airlines allows for the first commercialisation of locally produced SAF in Japan, marking a historic milestone in the country’s push for more sustainable fuel options.

This collaboration not only addresses the aviation sector’s carbon emissions but also promotes local sourcing of materials, further enhancing the environmental benefits of this initiative. As Japan strives to meet its 2050 net-zero carbon emission target, this move demonstrates the country’s commitment to developing sustainable energy solutions and reducing environmental impact.

Promoting Sustainable Travel Between Osaka and Honolulu

As the travel industry increasingly focuses on environmental responsibility, the introduction of SAF will be a key factor in drawing eco-conscious tourists to Hawaii. The initiative enhances the appeal of Honolulu and Osaka as eco-tourism destinations. Hawaii is known for its unique ecosystems, while Japan’s cultural heritage and scenic landscapes continue to attract millions of visitors each year. This partnership highlights both regions’ dedication to balancing tourism with environmental sustainability.

In addition, the use of SAF supports the broader sustainability goals of both Hawaiian Airlines and its parent company, Alaska Airlines. The airlines have ambitious plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, and this move is a significant step toward reaching that target. Through investments in cleaner technology and sustainable fuel sources, the airlines aim to reduce their overall environmental impact.

A Shared Vision for a Greener Future

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, both long-established in the aviation industry, are now at the forefront of sustainability efforts. The airlines’ commitment to SAF, alongside other innovations in technology and fleet modernisation, aligns with their goal of making air travel more environmentally friendly.

The expansion of the SAF programme is part of a wider trend in the aviation industry to address climate change and promote sustainable tourism. This initiative provides a valuable opportunity for visitors to enjoy the beauty of Hawaii and Japan while supporting eco-friendly practices.

The Future of Travel: How SAF Benefits the Tourism Industry

The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on the Osaka–Honolulu route marks a significant advancement in the advancement of responsible tourism. As conscious travel becomes a central concern for increasing numbers of international visitors, this initiative serves as a prototype for expanding low-environmental-impact flight possibilities. When regarded alongside the rising consumer preference for eco-oriented journeys, the carbon-offset advantages derived from the use of SAF may in due course recalibrate the strategy for managing long-haul aviation.

Passengers flying the Osaka–Honolulu leg can take in Hawaii’s world-renowned shoreline, rich cultural heritage, and varied outdoor pursuits while knowing that their travel-related greenhouse-gas discharge has been markedly diminished. The gesture goes beyond compliance and underscores the obligation of the hospitality industry to sustainable governance, thereby preserving for subsequent generations the allure of both the Japanese archipelago and the Hawaiian Islands.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Airlines-1-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 17:56:39.094354

Der Überführungsflug war eine Premiere: Das Flugzeug wurde mit einer Mischung aus 50 Prozent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ausgeliefert, die direkt von Airbus zertifiziert wurde. Dieser Fortschritt zeugt vom Engagement von Air France-KLM, die Dekarbonisierung des Luftverkehrs voranzutreiben.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) spielt eine zentrale Rolle bei der Reduzierung des CO₂-Fußabdrucks des Luftverkehrs. Es ermöglicht eine Verringerung der CO₂-Emissionen über ihren gesamten Lebenszyklus hinweg um mindestens 65 Prozent im Vergleich zu herkömmlichem Kerosin.

Air France-KLM gehört zu den drei weltweit führenden Anwendern von SAF und verfolgt eine strenge Beschaffungspolitik: Es werden nur nachhaltige Kraftstoffe ausgewählt, die nicht in Konkurrenz zur menschlichen Nahrungsmittelversorgungstehen, nicht zur Abholzung von Wäldern beitragen und nicht aus Palmöl hergestellt werden.

Eine weitere gemeinsame Initiative der Gruppe und des Herstellers: Air France-KLM und Airbus haben eine Vereinbarung geschlossen, die es den Mitarbeitenden von Airbus ermöglicht, den CO₂-Fußabdruck ihrer Geschäftsreisen zu reduzieren, indem sie die SAF-Produktion unterstützen. Diese freiwillige Verpflichtung ist Teil des „SAF Corporate“-Programms von Air France-KLM, das die Finanzierung und den Kauf von SAF ermöglicht. Seit seinem Beitritt zum SAF-Programm im November 2023 hat Airbus durch den Kauf von mehr als 670 Tonnen SAF die CO2-Emissionen um mehr als 2.000 Tonnen reduziert.

Die Erneuerung der Flotte ist ein zentraler Bestandteil der Transformationsstrategie der Air France-KLM-Gruppe. Mit einem um 20 Prozent geringeren Treibstoffverbrauch und CO₂-Ausstoß pro Passagierkilometer im Vergleich zu Flugzeugen der vorherigen Generation verkörpert der Airbus A220 dieses Ziel.

Air France-KLM hat fast 200 Flugzeuge der neuen Generation (Airbus A220, A320neo, A321neo, A350 und Boeing 787) fest bestellt, und allein im vergangenen Jahr 41 Flugzeuge der neuen Generation für alle ihre Fluggesellschaften in Empfang genommen.

Diese strukturellen Investitionen – in Höhe von mehr als zwei Milliarden Euro pro Jahr – tragen dazu bei, dass bis 2030 bis zu 80 Prozent der Flotte der Air France-KLM-Gruppe aus Flugzeugen der neuen Generation bestehen werden.

Green hydrogen is a clean fuel, and producing it directly from seawater lowers costs and energy use.
A similar idea was explored at Northwestern University to draw nearly limitless energy from the soil using microbial fuel cells.
While the power output is relatively small, it shows how unexpected bio-resources can help real communities meet basic energy needs.
Many of these technologies struggle with high implementation costs, limited infrastructure, and skepticism from policymakers that favor established fuel sources.","In a world dominated by talk of solar panels, wind turbines, and nuclear reactors, some of the most fascinating breakthroughs in energy are happening in unexpected places. Scientists are experimenting with everything from using moisture to break down plastic into usable recycled material, to turning seawater into hydrogen, and even converting banana peels into biogas.

The future of energy isn't just about creativity, it's also about accessibility. A clean technology only matters if it's affordable enough to be adopted widely. That's why researchers are increasingly looking at low-cost, everyday materials that most of us see as waste. Imagine if the dredges of your morning coffee or the leftovers from a winery could one day fuel cars, buses, or even planes.

What once seemed useless might just be the key to fueling the world. So, let's take a look at 10 unexpected energy sources you probably never imagined could be turned into fuel.

Your daily caffeine fix might do more than help you live longer — it could literally power the bus you take to work. It sounds unbelievable, but researchers have discovered that used coffee grounds contain oils suitable for biodiesel production. A London-based startup called Bio-Bean, has already partnered with transport authorities to turn discarded coffee grounds into biofuel for buses.

The process is simple but brilliant. The grounds are collected from coffee shops, processed to extract oil, and converted into biodiesel. Remarkably, this new fuel works seamlessly in existing diesel engines, so there's no need for costly modifications. This approach is not only efficient, it's also eco-friendly because it reduces waste, lowers emissions and reduces the need for fossil fuels.

Billions of cups of coffee are consumed globally each year, producing massive amounts of waste. If even a fraction of that waste were redirected into fuel, the environmental impact would be enormous.

Seawater, which covers more than 70% of our planet, could become a major source of clean energy. At the University of Adelaide, scientists have developed a method to turn seawater into green hydrogen fuel, without the costly removal of the salt content. Traditional electrolysis (splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen) usually requires purified water because salt corrodes the electrodes. By using a specialized non-precious catalyst, the team bypassed this problem.

The benefits are huge. Green hydrogen is a clean fuel, and producing it directly from seawater lowers costs and energy use. Beyond the lab, companies like Equatic are scaling this idea further, with a process that not only extracts hydrogen fuel but also forces seawater to absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, locking it away as stable minerals. This means the ocean doubles as both a carbon sink and a fuel factory.

While large-scale adoption is still in progress, this discovery could completely transform energy production, offering a pathway to clean fuel and climate action at the same time.

It sounds like a science fair prank, but urine can actually generate electricity. Researchers at the University of Bath have developed miniature fuel cells that harness bacteria to break down compounds in urine. As the microbes digest the waste, they release electrons, which flow through a circuit to produce an electric current. A similar idea was explored at Northwestern University to draw nearly limitless energy from the soil using microbial fuel cells.

This method has been trialed in schools in Kenya and Uganda, where it powers LED lights in bathrooms and even charges small electronics. Beyond the novelty factor, this technology excels in places where grid power is expensive or unreliable, converting waste into a low-cost source of electricity.

While the power output is relatively small, it shows how unexpected bio-resources can help real communities meet basic energy needs. Who knew the restroom could be a mini power plant?

Tofu might be a protein-packed meal on your plate, but its production leaves behind loads of soybean pulp and wastewater. Instead of letting these byproducts go to waste, scientists have found a way to convert them into biogas using anaerobic digestion. In this oxygen-free process, microorganisms break down organic matter, releasing methane-rich gas that can be used for cooking, heating, or generating electricity.

Factories in Indonesia are already tapping into this system. What's clever is that tofu waste can produce the very energy that keeps tofu-producing factories running. It's cost-effective, sustainable, and reduces dependence on fossil fuels. Unlike high-tech innovations, this solution is relatively straightforward and simply repurposes existing waste materials and technology.

By turning food waste into fuel, tofu factories demonstrate how circular economies can reshape industries. Not only are they feeding people, they're also powering themselves and contributing to a greener energy grid.

Air travel is a notorious contributor to carbon emissions, but a slimy green solution could change that. Algae, rich in oils and fast-growing in saltwater, is emerging as a powerful candidate for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike crops like corn or soy, algae doesn't compete with food supplies and produces far more oil per acre of land.

What makes algae oil especially exciting is its high calorific value, meaning it releases significant energy when burned. Airlines are under pressure to adopt SAF under the European Union's RefuelEU Aviation regulations, which require 2% SAF use by 2025, rising sharply in future decades. Algae biofuel could help to meet this demand without straining agricultural land or freshwater resources.

This unusual fuel source seems like science fiction, but it's real and faces significant challenges. Large-scale cultivation, affordability, and building supply chains are just some of the hurdles preventing widespread adoption. Still, the vision of planes powered by photosynthetic organisms harvested from the sea is compelling.

Cows aren't just milk and beef machines — they're also renewable energy generators. Their manure, which has always been useful for crops, is now helping to light up houses and run machines. When processed in biogas plants, cow manure breaks down into methane-rich gas that can heat homes, generate electricity, and even fuel vehicles. The leftover material is a nutrient-rich biofertilizer, creating a zero-waste system.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 28 times stronger than carbon dioxide. When released into the atmosphere unchecked, it contributes heavily to global warming. By capturing it for energy, farms prevent harmful emissions while creating usable fuel. For example, in Japan, a biogas facility handles about 250 tons of manure daily, producing 1.2 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 2,200 homes per year.

This approach turns farms into power plants. Instead of contributing to climate problems, livestock operations can become part of the solution. It's dirty work, but the result is a cleaner environment and a steady source of renewable power.

Every bottle of wine we enjoy leaves behind a surprisingly large amount of skins, seeds, and stems that are collectively called grape pomace. Traditionally, wineries either discard this material or use small amounts for livestock feed, but researchers are now turning it into bioethanol. By fermenting the natural sugars found in pomace with yeast, ethanol is produced, which can then be blended into fuel for cars or used as a renewable energy source.

The process has major environmental advantages. Instead of letting grape waste rot in landfills where it would release methane (a powerful greenhouse gas), it's transformed into a clean-burning fuel, helping to reduce reliance on petroleum.

Countries with thriving wine industries such as France, Italy, and Spain are especially well-positioned to scale this technology. With millions of tons of pomace generated annually, the energy potential is vast. What was once winery trash could end up fueling cars, blending sustainability with one of the world's oldest industries.

Slipping on a banana peel is a comedy trope, but in real life those peels can generate energy. When processed in anaerobic digesters, banana waste breaks down to release methane-rich gas, which can be used for cooking and electricity. According to researchers from the Agro-Energy Group at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM), banana waste can provide up to 55% of the electrical needs of the Ecuadorian province of El Oro.

The potential is massive. A single kilogram of dried banana peels can produce up to 0.3 cubic meters of biogas — enough to run a small generator. With more than 125 million metric tons of bananas produced worldwide each year, the fuel capacity is staggering.

Urban markets and food processors throw away tons of banana waste daily. Instead of leaving it to rot in landfills (where it releases methane anyway), centralized digesters can capture that energy for communities. In some regions, researchers are even producing bioethanol from banana waste for vehicles. That means your fruit snack could one day help fuel cars.

What happens to the truckloads of tomatoes that spoil before reaching supermarket shelves? Instead of being discarded, scientists have discovered that these rotting tomatoes can actually generate electricity using microbial electrochemical cells. In this system, microbes feed on tomato waste and release electrons during digestion. Electrodes capture those electrons, creating an electric current.

Tomatoes are especially useful in this process because they contain lycopene, a natural pigment that improves the transfer of electrons. Even small amounts of waste (just 10 milligrams) can produce about 0.3 watts of power, so imagine the potential in farming regions where tons of produce are often lost due to oversupply or transport issues.

If farms and processing plants harnessed this method, they could generate energy to power their own facilities instead of paying for costly waste disposal. Microbial fuel cells are still in the early stages of development, but they're a great example of turning food loss into useful energy.

Plastic pollution is one of the world's biggest environmental headaches, but what if trash bags and bottles could be transformed back into fuel? Through a process called pyrolysis, non-recyclable plastics are heated in the absence of oxygen. This breaks their long polymer chains into smaller hydrocarbons, producing pyrolysis oil, which is a viable alternative to gasoline.

Unlike traditional recycling processes, pyrolysis can handle dirty or mixed plastics. Startups such as Petgas in Mexico are already proving the concept, converting 1.5 tons of plastic waste into 356 gallons of fuel in a week. The market for this fuel is currently valued at more than $1.4 billion in the U.S. alone, and it's projected to significantly grow in the next decade.

Challenges remain but pyrolysis offers a promising way to turn a waste crisis into an energy opportunity. Instead of piling up in landfills or choking oceans, plastics could literally keep engines running.

The promise of waste-to-energy is exciting, but adoption isn't simple. Many of these technologies struggle with high implementation costs, limited infrastructure, and skepticism from policymakers that favor established fuel sources. However, without supportive policies and public buy-in, many of these ideas may remain trapped in laboratories instead of reaching communities.

The potential payoff of adoption is clear. Diverting food waste into anaerobic digesters would reduce landfill emissions, lower energy costs, and provide decentralized power for small businesses. Plastic-to-fuel plants could reduce both pollution and dependence on imported oil. For rural areas, manure or banana peels could mean reliable electricity without waiting for the grid.

The shift might take time, but it's worth it. Waste doesn't have to be a liability; it can be a lifeline. By tackling adoption challenges head-on, governments, industries, and communities can turn overlooked byproducts into the building blocks of tomorrow's energy system.",https://www.bgr.com/img/gallery/10-unexpected-energy-sources-you-didnt-know-could-be-used-as-fuel/l-intro-1756392754.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 13:56:48.094810

These modules deliver higher energy yield, improved temperature performance and lower degradation compared with conventional panels. The facility will expand to 10 GWp of capacity in the near term and eventually 20 GWp, making it the largest integrated solar manufacturing site in the world.

In parallel, the company is building giga factories for batteries and electrolysers. The battery unit will begin operations in 2026 with a capacity of 40 GWh, scalable to 100 GWh. The electrolyser unit is scheduled to start by end-2026 with 3 GW of annual capacity, supporting cost-competitive green hydrogen production.

Ambani said the integration of solar, storage and hydrogen under one ecosystem will bring cost and technology advantages while strengthening supply chain resilience, positioning Reliance as a leader in the global energy transition.

Alaska stands at a crossroads in its economic development. Vast untapped resources could propel our state into a new era of prosperity, but without the infrastructure to move them to market, they remain stranded. Central to unlocking this potential are the Point MacKenzie Rail Spur and Port MacKenzie.

The rail spur, a 32-mile extension connecting Port MacKenzie to the Alaska Railroad mainline near Houston, creates the shortest rail route from the Interior to tidewater. Port MacKenzie itself is a deep-draft facility across Knik Arm from Anchorage, with 9,000 acres of industrial land ready for exports and logistics. It is as ice-free as the Port of Anchorage, has never needed dredging, and can handle Panamax-size ships. The dock already has the safety features in place, making it an excellent solution for bulk exports.

This is not a pie-in-the-sky idea. Most of the infrastructure is already built, with nearly $184 million invested. What remains is leadership to finish the job. We cannot call ourselves a resource state while refusing to complete the transportation projects that move our resources to market. The return on investment is undeniable, and the benefits far outweigh any lingering concerns.

Completing the spur would mean thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions in new revenue. Up to 3,000 jobs in mining, timber, energy, and construction could be created, and the project could generate $300 million annually in royalties, fees, and taxes. A 2007 study projected $4.4 billion in long-term benefits. These are not speculative numbers; they reflect the enormous value of turning stranded assets into revenue-producing exports in a state that develops resources better, safer, and with more environmental concern than anywhere else in the world.

The resources are already there. Copper and zinc from the Ambler Mining District, where companies plan to export 1.7 million tons annually, could move through Port MacKenzie. The same is true for graphite, antimony, rare earths, and other minerals critical to modern technology. Timber and coal exports would gain new life with this route, reducing shipping costs by up to 70 percent compared to trucking or air. The biomass and LNG needed for globally required Sustainable Aviation Fuel are available through Port Mack and could be produced right there. In a global market where efficiency determines competitiveness, that margin is decisive.

This infrastructure would make Alaska’s resources competitive in global markets, especially with our Indo-Pacific Allies. It would directly support projects such as the $43 billion Alaska LNG development, which depends on efficient material transport. For a state struggling with declining oil revenues and population stagnation, diversification through Port Mack is not optional; it is imperative.

The advantages are not just economic but strategic. Alaska’s Interior holds critical minerals the nation needs for technology, renewable energy, and defense. Today those assets are trapped, forcing dependence on foreign suppliers, including China, for materials like rare earths and antimony. Completing the rail spur aligns with President Trump’s 2025 Executive Order expanding rail infrastructure for oil, gas, timber, coal, and minerals. It advances energy independence, strengthens national security, and supports Arctic defense by creating an efficient logistics route between Interior bases and tidewater.

Critics point to Port MacKenzie’s limited past use, but without rail access the port cannot attract the volume needed for viability. This is a chicken-and-egg problem. Completing the spur breaks the cycle, opening the door to high-volume and bulk exports and finally putting this asset to work for Alaskans.

The construction progress underscores how close we are. Seventy-five percent of the spur is complete, including 25 miles of embankment, bridges, 110 culverts, and a one-mile loop. What remains is track and signaling. This is not a shovel-ready project; it is beyond shovel-ready and overdue.

Concerns about navigation in Cook Inlet and winter operations are real but not insurmountable. They are the same issues faced by the Port of Anchorage. More powerful tugboats and skilled pilots have already solved these challenges, and operators themselves confirm the risks are well within their capabilities. What is not acceptable is continuing to let our mineral wealth sit idle while past investments gather dust.

Diversification for Alaska is not optional; it’s imperative. We need infrastructure that creates jobs, broadens our revenue base, and strengthens our position in global supply chains. The Point MacKenzie Rail Spur and Port MacKenzie do exactly that. They offer Alaska the chance to move from potential to production, from stagnation to growth.

The next governor must make this project a priority. That means securing federal grants, state bonds, and private investment to finish the job. It means streamlining regulations to move construction forward. And it means standing up to critics who are content to watch opportunity slip away for political reasons. Alaska cannot afford another decade of delay.

In the end, this is not about politics or one port or rail line. It is about whether Alaska will live up to its identity as a resource state. The jobs, the revenue, the strategic advantages, and the diversification are all within reach. What we need now is the leadership to bring them across the finish line.

The Point MacKenzie Rail Spur and Port MacKenzie are the linchpins of Alaska’s future. They will define whether our resources remain stranded in the Interior or flow to world markets. They will determine whether our state prospers or continues to tread water. The choice before the next governor is simple: finish what Alaska has already started, or let our resources, and our children’s future, remain stranded. The right choice is clear.

Cette prouesse a été accomplie par un Boeing 787 de Virgin Atlantic, reliant Londres Heathrow à New York JFK. L’utilisation du SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) ne représente pas seulement un exploit technique, mais marque aussi une avancée décisive dans la réduction de l’empreinte carbone de l’aviation. Ce vol constitue une étape cruciale vers une aviation plus respectueuse de l’environnement, tout en soulignant l’importance de l’innovation pour lutter contre la pollution.

Le SAF : un carburant révolutionnaire

Le SAF, ou carburant d’aviation durable, révolutionne le secteur par son origine principalement issue de déchets organiques. Il utilise des huiles de cuisson usagées et des graisses animales, transformées par un procédé appelé HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids). Ce mélange contient également un pourcentage de kérosène aromatique synthétique dérivé de sucres végétaux. Cette composition permet au SAF d’être entièrement compatible avec les infrastructures actuelles de l’aviation. Virgin Atlantic mise sur ce carburant pour atteindre l’objectif ambitieux de zéro émission nette de carbone d’ici 2050, soulignant son rôle essentiel dans la décarbonation du secteur.

« C’est un miracle mécanique » : un Boeing 787 réussit le premier vol transatlantique 100 % carburant durable et ridiculise les sceptiques

Les traînées de condensation : un défi majeur

Outre l’efficacité du SAF, le vol de Virgin Atlantic a permis de mettre en lumière un autre enjeu environnemental : les traînées de condensation. Ces traces blanches, laissées par les avions, jouent un rôle significatif dans le réchauffement climatique. Une étude récente révèle que 57 % de l’impact climatique de l’aviation entre 2000 et 2018 est attribuable à ces traînées, surpassant même les émissions de CO2. Le Rocky Mountain Institute, en collaboration avec d’autres partenaires, explore des solutions pour minimiser cet effet en partageant les données collectées lors du vol avec l’industrie aéronautique.

Un soutien gouvernemental indispensable

Ce vol historique n’aurait pas été possible sans le soutien du gouvernement britannique, qui a assuré son financement. Cela a non seulement permis la réalisation du vol, mais a aussi encouragé les recherches sur les traînées de condensation. Le gouvernement s’engage à partager les découvertes avec l’industrie pour élaborer des procédures de vol visant à réduire l’impact climatique. Ces initiatives sont essentielles pour atteindre les objectifs environnementaux fixés et stimuler l’innovation dans l’aéronautique. L’implication des autorités est cruciale pour accélérer la transition vers une aviation durable.

L’avenir de l’aviation durable

Le succès de ce vol transatlantique représente un pas important vers une aviation plus propre. Grâce à des innovations telles que le SAF et les recherches sur les traînées de condensation, l’aviation pourrait réduire considérablement son empreinte carbone. Cependant, des défis subsistent. Il est fondamental de poursuivre les investissements en recherche et développement et de renforcer la collaboration internationale pour que ces technologies deviennent la norme. Comment ces révolutions technologiques transformeront-elles l’aviation mondiale dans les années à venir ?

Kolaborasi tersebut, kata dia, dapat diwujudkan dengan mendorong intesifikasi produktivitas sawit petani yang saat ini masih memiliki ruang besar untuk optimalisasi.

Hal itu disampaikan Jatmiko di hadapan ratusan peserta seminar internasional, The 2nd International Conference on Agirculture, Food and Enviromental Science (ICAFES) tahun 2025 yang terdiri dari 60 dekan Fakultas Pertanian seluruh Indonesia, dosen, peneliti, dan mahasiswa pertanian saat menjadi keynote speakers di Universitas Riau, Pekanbaru, Sabtu hari ini (30/08/2025).

Kegiatan itu turut para ahli pangan dan lingkungan dari berbagai belahan dunia seperti Johan Kieft ahli lingkungan Badan Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa, Dr Idesert Jelsma peneliti Belanda, Prof Ir Usman Pato yang merupakan peneliti bidang ketahanan pangan lulusan Gifu University Jepang, serta sejumlah peneliti akademisi lainnya dari Malaysia dan Filipina.

Dalam pemaparannya, Jamtiko mengatakan bahwa ruang terbesar untuk penguatan ketahanan pangan dan energi dari komoditas sawit, yang selama ini menjadi penyumbang ekonomi Indonesia, bahkan pada saat beberapa krisis yang terjadi, adalah penguatan produtkivitas sawit petani.

“Ruang terbesar untuk improvement adalah dari sisi petani. Kita semua dapat berkolaborasi bersama, untuk meningkatkan produktivitas petani sawit Indonesia melalui intesifikasi,” kata Jatmiko.

Ia menjelaskan, penguatan produktivitas petani merupakan satu dari dua kunci utama yang diusung PTPN IV PalmCo untuk mendukung program nasional mewujudkan ketahanan pangan dan energi nasional.

Saat ini, rerata produktivitas petani sawit Indonesia masih di kisaran 2–3 ton crude palm oil (CPO) per hektare per tahun, jauh dari korporasi perkebunan yang dikelola secara profesional yang mampu mencapai 6 ton.

Untuk meminimalis disparitas itu, ia mengatakan PTPN IV PalmCo telah menempuh beragam inisiatif penting untuk mendongkrak produktivitas petani, mulai dari Program BUMN Untuk Sawit Rakyat, penyediaan bibit unggul bersertifikat yang kini tercatat lebih dari dua juta batang bibit sawit unggul telah diserap petani, penerapan skema off-taker yang menjangkau lebih dari 10.200 hektare, serta penguatan sistem kelembagaan organisasi koperasi.

Hingga 2024, PalmCo telah mendukung pencairan dana BPDPKS untuk areal peremajaan sawit mitra KUD seluas 15.321 hektare. Keberhasilan model kemitraan ini terlihat dari produktivitas tanaman menghasilkan (TM) plasma yang mencapai rata-rata 12,57 ton/Ha, bahkan ada yang mencapai 18,05 ton/Ha, melampaui standar nasional 12 ton/Ha.

“Peremajaan sawit rakyat (PSR) adalah kunci. Tanpa itu, kita akan kehilangan daya saing sekaligus melemahkan kontribusi sawit bagi ketahanan pangan dan energi. Dan melalui forum ini, kami berharap ke depan kita akan saling berkolaborasi dan bersinergi untuk bersama-sama memperkuat inisatif ini,” jelas Jatmiko yang disampaikannya menggunakan bahasa Inggris.

Jika kolaborasi untuk intesifikasi tersebut dapat terlaksana dengan baik, maka bukan hanya ketahanan pangan dari sektor sawit yang dapat di wujudkan, melainkan target pemerintah dalam implementasi B50 pada 2027 bisa terpenuhi. Untuk diketahui, target alokasi biodiesel B50 itu diperkirakan membutuhkan pasokan sekitar 20,11 juta kiloliter.

Lebih jauh, dalam paparannya, Jatmiko turut menyinggung bahwa perubahan iklim bukan lagi ancaman di masa depan, melainkan kenyataan yang berpotensi berdampak terhadap produktivitas pertanian global, termasuk komoditas kelapa sawit Indonesia. Tantangan ini jika tidak disikapi dengan bijak, maka sejarah Indonesia yang pernah menjadi eksportir gula di tahun 1930-an silam, dan kini malah menjadi salah satu importir gula terbesar dunia, juga dikhawatirkan akan terjadi dengan komoditas CPO.

Berdasarkan data yang ia paparkan, selama dekade 2015-2024 yang tercatat sebagai periode terpanas dalam sejarah, dengan konsentrasi CO₂ mencapai level tertinggi. Dampaknya, setiap kenaikan suhu 1°C menurunkan hasil panen antara 3,1 hingga 7,4 persen sehingga memicu yang disebut sebagai ‘climateflation’-kenaikan harga pangan akibat anomali iklim.

“Sehingga ini memerlukan solusi berkelanjutan yang hanya dapat diwujudkan melalui kolaborasi seluruh stakeholders, termasuk bapak ibu akademisi,” tuturnya lagi.

Sebagai produsen minyak sawit mentah (CPO) terbesar dunia yang menyumbang sekitar 60% pasokan global, ia menyebut Indonesia memiliki peran krusial. Namun, industri ini menghadapi tantangan multidimensi. Selain ruang perbedaan produktivitas antara petani dan korporasi yang tinggi, tekanan regulasi sustainability, khususnya dari Uni Eropa, juga semakin kompleks.

“Jadi selain kunci meningkatkan produktivitas petani, dan penguatan prinsip ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) juga harus berjalan berkesinambungan,” tegas Jatmiko.

Komitmen ESG PalmCo diwujudkan dengan pengembangan energi baru terbarukan (EBT). PalmCo telah mengoperasikan 7 unit Pembangkit Listrik Tenaga Biogas (PLTBg) dan 4 unit co-firing biogas dengan total kapasitas 9,3 MW. Bahkan, perusahaan sedang dalam proses seleksi mitra untuk pengembangan 20 unit Compressed Biomethane Gas (CBG) dan 1 fasilitas Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Sehingga, di akhir penjelasannya, ia kembali menegaskan bahwa investasi strategis, kebijakan yang efektif, inovasi, dan kolaborasi yang erat antara petani dan industri, merupakan fondasi essential untuk membangun ketahanan dan mengamankan sistem pangan dan energi yang berkelanjutan bagi Indonesia.

“Sekali lagi kami sampaikan, kolaborasi adalah kunci menuju solusi berkelanjutan. Kesempatan ini kami harap menjadi awal yang baik untuk bersama mewujudkannya,” demikian dia.(Rizal).",https://koranpelita.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG-20250831-WA0023.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 13:58:00.243554

Global tours are known for their relatively heavy carbon footprints. However, Chris Martin and the band pledged to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by half compared to their last world tour.

Four years later, with the ongoing 2025 leg at London's Wembley Stadium, Coldplay is reportedly standing by that commitment. The band claims that

""72% of all tour waste has been diverted from landfill and sent for reuse, recycling, and composting.""

That is an improvement from 66% in 2023. Moreover, eighteen shows in 2023 were powered entirely by a tourable battery system built from recycled BMW batteries. Coldplay has also funded two solar-powered ocean cleanup river interceptors. Notably, for every ticket sold, a tree has been planted through the global reforestation nonprofit organization, One Tree Planted.

Their signature LED wristbands have also been reworked to be 100% reusable, recyclable, and made from plant-based materials. Dancefloors at select shows are designed to generate electricity when fans jump. These are a few of the sustainability steps that Coldplay has taken.

Regarding CO2 emissions, the band states on their official website:

""Where we cannot reduce, we will be drawing down any unavoidable emissions following recognised best practices such as guidance within the Oxford Principles for Net-Zero Aligned carbon offsetting. We have teamed up with DHL as the tour’s Official Logistics Partner in order to minimise emissions from freight and transportation.""

They also add:

""As leaders in the field of sustainable transport and logistics, DHL support the tour by offering solutions to minimise logistics-related emissions and other environmental impacts, from advanced biofuels in the air to electric vehicles on land. Where we cannot reduce, we will be drawing down any unavoidable emissions following the guidance within the Oxford Principles for Net-Zero Aligned carbon offsetting.""

Some other steps that Coldplay have mentioned on their website are as follows:

SOLAR: We install solar photovoltaic panels in the build-up to each show, behind the stage and on top of PA and delay towers. The show batteries start charging as soon as we arrive at the venue.

SUSTAINABLE BIOFUELS: Across the tour we are utilising renewable diesel, a palm-oil free HVO-type (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) biofuel, produced 100% from renewable raw materials, primarily waste and residues such as used cooking oil. HVO use can lower generator carbon emissions significantly. HVO also fuels our trucking in as many locations as possible, meaning super-low emissions - as much as 75 to 95% reduced emissions, from these parts of our show transportation as well.

BATTERY SYSTEM: Prior to the tour we worked with experts to develop the first ever mobile, rechargeable show battery, made from recyclable BMW i3 batteries, which can power 100% of our show with renewable energy wherever we take it. We have a number of other batteries in use that we can charge from multiple sources including solar energy and even kinetic energy from the fans.

KINETIC ENERGY: We install kinetic floors in locations around the stadium so that the fans' dancing can be converted into energy and literally help to power the show. We also install electricity-generating power bikes so that fans can actively charge our show batteries.

GRID RENEWABLES: Whenever it is available, we use mains power from 100% renewable sources.

Notably, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin also pledged to take public transport whenever possible. He arrived in Cardiff by train for the band's shows at the venue.

Coldplay's partners for sustainable logistics, DHL, employ a carbon intelligence and monitoring system. For air transportation, DHL's GoGreen Plus program ensures Sustainable Aviation Fuel is used for the band's freight flights.

In June 2024, Coldplay announced that direct emissions from the first two years of the tour were 59% lower than their 2016-17 tour. DHL helped achieve an 85% reduction per flight compared to fossil fuels. That resulted in a 31% decrease in total transportation emissions in 2023.

New Delhi: Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance is developing one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects spread across 5,50,000 acres of dry land in Kutch, Gujarat. This entire area is three times the size of Singapore. This information was shared on Friday, August 29, by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani.

At its peak, the solar project will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day, making it among the fastest installations globally, said Mukesh Ambani.

The site could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity needs

Addressing the shareholders at the company’s annual general meeting, Ambani said that the site could meet nearly 10% of India’s electricity needs within the next decade. The project will connect seamlessly with Reliance’s marine and land infrastructure at Jamnagar and Kandla, enabling large-scale solar and hydrogen integration.

Production of green ammonia, green methanol, & sustainable aviation fuel

The company will produce and export green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel, positioning India as a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives. The company plans to scale up to 3MTPA (million tonnes per annum) of green hydrogen equivalent production capacity by 2032, while the initial focus will be on meeting Reliance’s own captive demand, said Ambani.

Reliance’s solar PV manufacturing platform is now operational

Ambani also announced that Reliance’s solar PV manufacturing platform has become operational, producing its first 200 MW of heterojunction technology (HJT) modules. These deliver 10% higher energy yield, 20% better temperature performance, and 25% lower degradation.

The platform will expand to 10 GWp per annum of integrated solar PV manufacturing capacity in the coming quarters and further to 20 GWp, making it the largest solar manufacturing facility and the most integrated single-site solar complex globally.

Reliance is constructing battery and electrolyser giga factories

Reliance is also constructing battery and electrolyser giga factories. The battery giga factory will start functioning in 2026 with 40 GWh annual capacity, expandable to 100 GWh, while the electrolyser giga factory will start by end-2026 with a capacity of up to 3GW per year, enabling large-scale, cost-competitive green hydrogen production.

Ambani said the integrated solar, battery storage, and hydrogen ecosystem under one roof will provide scale, cost and technology advantages, and supply chain resilience, creating long-term value as the global energy transition gathers pace.

RVNL touched yearly lows and there are many other public sector companies that could see fresh 52-week lows next week. IREDA and IRFC are also looking weak on technical charts. Praj Industries also faces selling pressure and the stock touched 52-week low during Friday's session. TopNews Team has reviewed news and technical levels for these stocks.

Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL): Navigating Earnings Headwinds Amid Contract Wins

RVNL reported a 40% year-over-year profit decline in Q1 fiscal 2026, sinking to Rs 134.36 crore, fueled predominantly by diminished revenue and operational challenges. Revenue from operations dipped roughly 4% to Rs 3,908.77 crore, while total income contracted 4.6% year-on-year to Rs 4,136.96 crore. This underperformance triggered a significant share price drop, with RVNL down about 24% year-to-date in 2025 and trading beneath crucial technical moving averages, reflecting bearish momentum.

The stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for continued short-term weakness. Meanwhile, fresh Letters of Acceptance from Southern Railway and IRCON International signal ongoing contract acquisitions that may bolster future revenue streams. Notwithstanding, RVNL's full fiscal year 2025 revenue missed analyst forecasts by nearly 9.5%, with earnings per share also falling short by 11%.

Analyst Perspectives on RVNL

Market sentiment for RVNL is cautious, as recent analyst ratings predominantly cluster around ""hold"" and ""strong sell"" recommendations, with no current ""buy"" endorsements. Price targets vary, averaging approximately Rs 272 for the next twelve months, ranging from Rs 204 at the low end to Rs 340 at the high end. Anticipated revenue growth is modest, forecasted at a CAGR of roughly 9.7% over the coming two years, lagging behind the broader construction sector's 13% growth rate. This positions RVNL amidst moderate growth prospects but with pronounced near-term margin pressures and operational risks.

REC Limited: Strong Fundamentals Amid Market Pessimism

REC Limited recently touched a fresh 52-week low around Rs 350, declining over 8% in a single week and falling approximately 44% year-on-year. The stock currently trades below all primary moving averages (5, 20, 50, 100, 200-day), reflecting a bearish investor outlook.

Despite these headwinds, REC exhibits compelling long-term financial health, boasting a return on equity of about 20.3% and a robust dividend yield exceeding 5%, signaling intrinsic value that appears undervalued in the short term. The company also announced record PBDIT of Rs 14,520.76 crore and profit after tax of Rs 4,465.71 crore in its latest disclosures. Institutional holdings remain strong at 34.72%, underscoring sustained institutional confidence.

Analyst Sentiment and Price Targets for REC Limited

From a coverage perspective, 14 analysts recently assigned REC a decisive ""strong buy"" consensus. Average price targets hover near Rs 525, with projections ranging from Rs 460 to as high as Rs 633. This analyst optimism reflects belief in the stock’s undervaluation and confidence in a recovery trajectory underpinned by solid fundamentals and positive earnings surprises.

Praj Industries: Challenges Amid Ethanol Market Uncertainty and Green Energy Ambitions

Praj Industries faces a difficult year, with shares down over 50% year-to-date and foreign portfolio investor holdings dropping to a six-quarter low near 16.9%. Persistent profit declines have marked the trend, including an 8.4% drop in Q1 consolidated revenue and a striking 94% plunge in profits. Market caution stems from achieving the 20% ethanol blending target (EBP20) without further mandates, dampening near-term growth prospects.

Geopolitical uncertainty, notably US tariff policies, has delayed capital expenditure and growth momentum. However, the company reported a healthy order intake valued at about Rs 7,950 million, which could offer some near-term revenue stability. Management highlights that India’s installed ethanol capacity now surpasses current blending needs, likely deferring additional expansions until policy revisions occur.

Analyst Views on Praj Industries

The stock carries a neutral rating from analysts, averaging a one-year target price of Rs 444, with a range from Rs 346 to Rs 580. This stance encapsulates cautious optimism, tempered by profit margin pressures and demand uncertainties. The company’s long-term vision targets Rs 100 billion in revenue by 2030, fueled by ventures into sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, biopolymers, and other clean energy sectors, buoyed by favorable US policies incentivizing clean fuel production and carbon capture.

Insights from Analysts and Sector Reports

RVNL’s mixed analyst ratings and price targets surface prominently on platforms such as TradingView and AlphaSpread without clear attribution. REC’s unanimously positive ""strong buy"" consensus derives from 14 analysts surveyed by MarketsMojo and others, underscoring institutional confidence. Praj Industries receives a balanced perspective from eight analysts featured on TradingView and MarketScreener, with Axis Securities offering commentary on cautious order flows and demand.

Strategic Conclusion for Investors

By August 2025, these three equities reveal markedly differing outlooks shaped by company-specific and macroeconomic factors. RVNL contends with immediate earnings setbacks but is buoyed by new project acquisitions that could foster operational stability. REC Limited, although grappling with near-term price declines, remains fundamentally robust, offering a potentially undervalued opportunity supported by strong institutional backing and positive analyst projections. Meanwhile, Praj Industries confronts significant headwinds attributable to ethanol blending policy stagnation and market hesitancy, yet its growth prospects in green and clean energy domains offer strategic promise.

Investors should carefully balance these elements against their risk tolerance and investment timelines, while paying attention to evolving sectoral dynamics and policy frameworks influencing infrastructure and sustainable energy sectors.

Summary

In August 2025, Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), REC Limited, and Praj Industries each present unique investment narratives shaped by recent financial results and market dynamics. RVNL's sharp Q1 profit drop and subdued revenue growth have sown investor caution, despite new contract wins. REC Limited, while trading near 52-week lows, boasts strong fundamentals and analyst optimism signaling potential undervaluation. Conversely, Praj Industries faces intense near-term pressure due to ethanol policy stagnation and geopolitical uncertainties, balanced by promising green energy diversification prospects.

Managing Director (Current Charge), Dhaka Bank

The Daily Star (TDS): How would you evaluate the current state of sustainable banking in Bangladesh?

A K M Shahnawaj (AKMS): Sustainable banking in Bangladesh has made remarkable strides in recent years, transitioning from a niche concept to a core strategic priority within the financial sector. The pivotal role of Bangladesh Bank — through its sustainable and green finance guidelines, refinancing facilities for renewable energy and energy-efficient projects, and mandatory sustainability reporting — has been instrumental in accelerating this growth. At Dhaka Bank, we have wholeheartedly embraced these initiatives, embedding environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations deeply into our lending and investment decisions.

While sustainable finance currently represents a growing segment of the credit market, the foundation is firmly in place for rapid expansion. With increasing awareness, advancing technical capacity, and evolving transition finance, we are confident that Bangladesh is well positioned to scale sustainable finance significantly to meet its climate and sustainable development goals. The progress so far inspires optimism for a green and resilient future.

TDS: What sustainable financing/refinancing schemes does your bank offer, particularly for SMEs, women entrepreneurs, or other environmentally responsible enterprises?

AKMS: Dhaka Bank is deeply committed to promoting sustainable finance and actively participates in Bangladesh Bank's refinancing initiatives targeting renewable energy, particularly solar power, energy-efficient machinery, waste management, effluent treatment, and eco-friendly industrial projects. For sectors such as Ready-Made Garments and large-scale manufacturing, we leverage programmes including the Refinance for Environment-Friendly Green Projects, the Technology Development Fund, and the Green Transformation Fund to facilitate the adoption of energy-efficient technologies.

For SMEs, we provide access to government and central bank refinance schemes, including the Tk. 25,000 crore CMSME programme at 7% interest, the agro-processing refinance facility, and the SME Foundation's revolving fund at 6%. Additionally, our Start-up Fund offers young entrepreneurs concessional loans of up to Tk. 80 million at just 4% interest.

We also provide targeted financing for businesses in rural areas, marginal traders, and women entrepreneurs, with concessional rates as low as 5%, including our Oditiya Loan designed specifically for women entrepreneurs.

Through these efforts, Dhaka Bank aims to promote inclusive growth and contribute to Bangladesh's sustainable development.

TDS: What initiatives has your bank undertaken to promote sustainable banking, and what measures have you implemented to reduce your own carbon footprint?

AKMS: At Dhaka Bank, sustainability is deeply ingrained in both our operational framework and corporate culture. We have dedicated Sustainable Finance Help Desks in every branch to integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risk assessments into our credit appraisal processes through the Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) matrix.

Furthermore, training and awareness programmes are conducted to cultivate sustainability-mindedness among employees, ensuring accountability and engagement throughout the organisation.

Internally, we have implemented several initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint. These include digitising workflows — for example, adopting a ""go green"" approach for bill collection — to significantly lower paper consumption, and upgrading to energy-efficient lighting across our branch network.

Moreover, Dhaka Bank has recently partnered with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to enhance our capacity for measuring and managing financed emissions. This collaboration underscores our commitment to transparency and accountability in assessing the environmental impact of our loan and investment portfolios, positioning us among the pioneers in Bangladesh to adopt globally recognised carbon accounting standards.

TDS: What challenges has your bank encountered in adopting and promoting sustainable banking practices?

AKMS: We face several challenges. Many borrowers lack the technical capacity to develop green projects and often perceive sustainable technologies as costly with delayed returns. The absence of standardised ESG data complicates impact assessment and risk evaluation. Although Bangladesh Bank's refinancing schemes are beneficial, the local market for green bonds and sustainability-linked loans is still emerging, limiting financing avenues for large-scale initiatives. Moreover, cultivating a sustainability mindset among clients and staff requires sustained education and incentives.

TDS: What are your bank's future plans to advance sustainable banking, and what support do you seek from the government?

AKMS: Our strategy focuses on three key pillars: scaling, innovation, and partnership. We plan to increase our green financing portfolio substantially, focusing on renewable energy generation, climate-resilient infrastructure, sustainable agriculture, and energy-efficient industrial modernisation.

We intend to introduce innovative financing instruments such as sustainability-linked loans, where borrowers receive better terms for meeting ESG targets, and explore partnerships with international climate funds to secure concessional financing for Bangladesh's green transition.

In terms of government support, fiscal incentives such as tax breaks for green investments, import duty exemptions on eco-friendly technologies, and targeted grants or subsidies will catalyse private sector participation. Capacity-building programmes are also vital — training entrepreneurs, stakeholders, and bankers in sustainable practices ensures long-term market growth and effectiveness.

A supportive, predictable regulatory environment combined with targeted incentives will be crucial for mobilising private capital at scale to meet the country's ambitious sustainable development goals.",https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2025/08/31/shahnawaz.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 20:56:10.209694

Esteemed Members,

Welcome to the 66th Annual General Meeting of your Company.

This annual meeting is not just a statutory occasion but a celebration of our shared journey — a journey built on trust, resilience, and a steadfast commitment to energise India’s progress.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each one of you for your continued confidence in the Company and for staying invested in our vision.

Business Outcomes

The year gone by reminded us that energy is never just about markets and molecules; it is shaped by the pulse of geopolitics.

The Russia–Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continued to cast a shadow on global stability. New fault lines in the Middle East, disruptions in the Red Sea, and heightened tensions around the Strait of Hormuz unsettled vital energy corridors. Towards the close of the year, tariff hikes in the United States added fresh headwinds, shaking investor confidence.

Against this backdrop of volatility and uncertainty, your Company delivered a resilient performance during 2024–25.

Sales volumes crossed the historic 100 million metric tonne mark, supported by beyond-capacity processing across 10 refineries.

Our 20,000 km pipeline network ensured seamless movement of hydrocarbons, underscoring the strength of our integrated model.

With over 40,000 fuel stations energising 3.2 crore customers every day, and Indane LPG trusted in 15 crore kitchens, IndianOil remains at the heart of India’s energy ecosystem.

Alongside refining and marketing, we maintained a strong presence in petrochemicals, natural gas, and E&P, reinforcing our diversified energy footprint.

On the financial front:

Revenue from Operations stood at ₹8.45 lakh crore, keeping us among India’s top three corporates.

Net Profit was ₹12,962 crore — the highest among OMC peers, though moderated from last year due to weaker refining margins, LPG under-recoveries, and exchange losses.

In Q1 FY 2025–26, your Company delivered its highest-ever quarterly sales and a consolidated net profit of ₹6,808 crore — nearly double that of the same period last year.

SPRINT: Powering Transformation

Resilience alone is not enough. To sustain leadership, we must evolve with speed and agility. With this vision, we launched Project SPRINT this fiscal.

SPRINT sharpens competitiveness across six focus areas:

Strengthening core businesses

Optimising costs

Reinforcing customer-centricity

Accelerating innovation and digitalisation

Nurturing talent

Advancing the energy transition

At its heart lies the 3Cs (Core, Cost, Customer) and 3Ts (Technology, Talent, Transition).

The impact is already visible:

One refinery is on track to become the first PSU refinery in India to achieve a Quartile-1 ranking in the Solomon Benchmarking Index.

Nearly half of new PSU OMC retail outlets since April 2025 have been IndianOil’s.

Non-fuel revenues grew 49% year-on-year in the first four months of this fiscal.

Cost optimisation initiatives are delivering higher efficiency and sustained profitability.

Reinforcing the Legacy

As India prepares to become the largest driver of global oil demand by 2035, your Company is scaling:

Refining capacity from 80.75 MMTPA to 98.4 MMTPA by 2028.

Pipeline network beyond 22,000 km, with 21 projects underway.

Petrochemicals capacity from 4.3 MMTPA to over 13 MMTPA by 2030, with a sharp focus on specialty chemicals.

We also advanced in upstream with 25 assets across India and overseas, including new hydrocarbon discoveries in Abu Dhabi, resumption in Libya, and acquisition of Mercator Petroleum in the Cambay Basin.

India’s Energy Lifeline

From fuel stations, LPG, and CNG to aviation, mobility, lubricants, and natural gas, IndianOil continues to be India’s most trusted energy partner.

Highlights of 2024–25 include:

14,000 EV chargers and 865 battery-swapping stations, advancing clean mobility.

68 Way Side Amenities and 138 Apna Ghar facilities for highway users and truckers.

LPG leadership strengthened with 45% market share and the launch of Chhotu Master (compact 5 kg LPG cylinder + cooktop).

Servo lubricants expanded to 45 countries, including the launch of Servo Futura eV for electric vehicles.

Natural gas sales surged 20% to 7.9 MMTPA; CGD JVs now cover 21% of India’s population.

Pioneering Innovation

Our R&D Centre is driving breakthroughs in green hydrogen, SAF, 2G ethanol, fuel cells, and carbon capture.

eCO₂Sorb, our patented enzyme-based carbon capture solution, is at pilot scale.

42 start-ups incubated under our Start-up Scheme have already generated 86 IPRs and 4 commercialized patents.

The upcoming New R&D Campus at Faridabad will lead frontier research in alternative energy and advanced sciences.

Transition to a Future-Ready Portfolio

We are transitioning into a diversified, integrated energy company anchored on three pillars:

Green Hydrogen – 10,000 TPA plant at Panipat (India’s largest).

Sustainable Aviation Fuel – India’s first ISCC-CORSIA certified SAF project; 30 KTPA from used cooking oil at Panipat.

Renewables – Clean energy portfolio scaling from 1 GW today to 18 GW in three years.

This green shift is supported by strong sustainability actions — 7 lakh trees planted, 89% wastewater reuse, GreenCo certifications, and a Net Zero by 2046 roadmap requiring ₹2.5 lakh crore investment.

Investments and Asset Optimisation

In 2024–25, IndianOil invested ₹40,000 crore, accounting for over one-fourth of MoPNG PSU CAPEX.

Over 160 projects worth ₹2.6 lakh crore are under execution.

Committed ₹1.66 lakh crore over five years with sharp focus on petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewables.

New revenue streams in bitumen, bunkering, LNG, cryogenics, and data transmission services are being seeded.

IOC Global Capital Management (IGCMIL) at GIFT City executed USD 500+ million in transactions, evolving into a Global Treasury Centre.

Driving Social Impact

In 2024–25, IndianOil spent ₹583 crore on CSR, touching 1.36 crore beneficiaries.

Healthcare focus: TB elimination, cancer care, sickle cell anaemia, dialysis centres.

Skilling & empowerment: Women, Divyangjan, and children rehabilitated through Badhte Kadam.

Growth for us is meaningful only when it uplifts lives.

Building Sports Champions

IndianOil athletes won 239 medals in 2024–25, including 85 global medals and India’s historic 29-medal Paralympics haul.

Our DivyaShakti initiative supports 100 para-athletes, half of them women. We remain committed to women’s hockey, para federations, and India’s “Road to LA 2028.”

Governance & Closing

Your Company upholds the highest standards of corporate governance, transparency, and preventive vigilance.

At the core of our journey lies one promise — energising lives with reliability, responsibility, and foresight.

I express my sincere gratitude to the Government of India, the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, regulators, banks, employees, stakeholders, and above all, our customers for their enduring trust and support.

With your continued encouragement, IndianOil will keep energising lives, unlocking new frontiers, and advancing our shared aspiration of a Viksit Bharat.

Thank You.

Managing Director, Eastern Bank

The Daily Star (TDS): How would you assess the current state of sustainable and green banking in Bangladesh?

Ali Reza Iftekhar (ARI): Over the past decade, sustainable and green banking in Bangladesh has made remarkable progress. When Bangladesh Bank first introduced its Sustainable Finance Policy and Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) guidelines, banks mostly treated them as compliance requirements. Today, sustainability has become a strategic priority for the country's leading institutions.

The banking sector now recognizes that financing cannot be separated from realities such as climate change, resource scarcity, and the demand for inclusive finance. Bangladesh Bank has accelerated this shift with green refinancing schemes, channeling affordable funding into renewable energy, waste management, and other green projects. The recent adoption of IFRS S1 and S2 on sustainability and climate disclosures has further aligned us with global standards.

Eastern Bank PLC (EBL) is proud to be ranked among the top ten sustainable banks in Bangladesh Bank's 2024 Sustainability Rating. For us, this recognition validates our long-term ESG commitments—but it is not a destination. It is a responsibility to keep moving forward.

TDS: What sustainable or green financing/refinancing schemes does your bank offer, particularly for SMEs, women entrepreneurs, or environmentally responsible enterprises?

ARI: At EBL, inclusiveness is central to our sustainable finance strategy. In 2024, 35.24% of our total term loan portfolio was directed to green projects—almost double the previous year. Overall, 89% of our portfolio now qualifies as sustainable finance.

We actively utilize Bangladesh Bank's refinancing schemes and have already disbursed over BDT 200 crore to renewable energy, energy efficiency, and waste management ventures. Beyond financing, we offer training, advisory support, and flexible repayment terms for SMEs and women entrepreneurs whose businesses embrace sustainability. We also mobilize foreign funding from DFIs such as IFC, DEG, FMO, OFID, and ADB, primarily for green investments.

To encourage innovation, our EBL Startup Explorer program, launched with Startup Bangladesh, directly finances green and impact-driven startups. We also partner with NGOs to provide tailored refinancing solutions to grassroots entrepreneurs. Our vision is clear: make sustainable finance accessible not just to large corporates, but also to SMEs, women entrepreneurs, and innovators driving change from the ground up.

TDS: What initiatives has your bank undertaken to promote sustainable banking, and how are you reducing your own carbon footprint?

ARI: Sustainability at EBL goes beyond financing—it is embedded in our operations.

Our Head Office is a green building, equipped with solar glass panels generating 16 kW of electricity daily, along with rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment facilities. We use hybrid vehicles, smart AC systems, and energy-efficient lighting to further reduce consumption.

We are steadily moving towards a paperless culture. By digitizing LC processing, we've reduced paper use by 40–45%, saving more than a million sheets each year. Our e-leave, e-appraisal, and e-learning systems cut paper use further. On the customer side, digital platforms like EBL Connect and SkyPay process billions of taka electronically, reducing the carbon footprint of cash handling while enhancing efficiency and convenience.

EBL is also among the first banks in Bangladesh to measure Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, including financed emissions, through the Joint Impact Model (JIM). Additionally, our partnership with DHL's GoGreen Plus program reduces 30% of emissions from trade document transport by using Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

TDS: What challenges has your bank encountered in adopting and promoting sustainable banking practices?

ARI: While progress is evident, challenges remain.

Data gaps: Measuring financed emissions across diverse industries remains difficult due to limited data quality and availability.

Awareness and capacity: Many borrowers—particularly SMEs—lack the technical know-how to adopt green technologies. Banks often need to invest in awareness and capacity-building before financing can be effective.

High upfront costs: Renewable energy or green building projects involve significant initial investment, discouraging entrepreneurs despite long-term savings. Here, concessional funding from Bangladesh Bank and DFIs plays a vital role

We believe stronger policy support—such as tax incentives for green technology and a carbon credit framework—would accelerate adoption across the financial sector.

TDS: What are your bank's future plans to advance sustainable banking, and what support do you seek from the government?

ARI: Looking ahead, EBL plans to introduce Green Deposit and Green Asset products, allowing customers to directly contribute to sustainable projects. We are also piloting a Climate Risk Diagnostic and Management Model with IFC and DEG, which integrates climate risk into credit decisions—making us one of the first banks in Bangladesh to embed climate risk into portfolio management.

To scale up these efforts, we seek government support in three areas:

1. Incentives for green investment — including interest subsidies, tax benefits, and accelerated depreciation for renewable and energy-efficient technologies.

2. Capacity-building programs — equipping SMEs and entrepreneurs with the skills to adopt sustainable practices.

3. A robust carbon market framework — enabling banks and businesses to monetize emission reductions and attract greater climate finance.

(Alaska Airlines) -- Hawaiian Airlines will blend sustainable aviation fuel on select flights between Osaka and Honolulu. --

The initiative supports Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines’ strategy to reduce carbon emissions and grow the SAF market.

Hawaiian Airlines today announced it will be incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on flights between Osaka, Japan, and Honolulu, Hawai‘i under a sales agreement between parent company Alaska Air Group Inc., and Cosmo Oil Marketing Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings Co., Ltd. Fuel deliveries beginning this month at Kansai International Airport will mark the first time Hawaiian Airlines has introduced SAF – which can lower life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

""Japan is an important international market for Hawaiian Airlines, and we appreciate Cosmo’s investment in locally sourced SAF – the most effective technology to lower our carbon emissions – that we are now using on our flights between Osaka and Honolulu.” -- Alanna James, Sustainability innovation directorHawaiian Airlines

The SAF traded under this agreement was commercialized following Cosmo’s receipt of a New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) subsidy from the Japanese government in 2021, aimed at establishing a supply chain model for SAF production from used cooking oil sourced domestically in Japan. Cosmo Energy Group’s facility will be the first to mass produce SAF in Japan and the SAF will come with ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU certifications. These certifications are part of the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) initiative, which recognizes compliance with international standards for sustainable products.

""SAF is one of our key decarbonization products and plays an essential role in the decarbonization of the aviation industry. We are delighted to contribute to the decarbonization efforts of global airline Alaska Airlines and its customers through SAF. Moving forward, we will continue to support the realization of a decarbonized society, starting with this collaboration, by promoting the use of SAF.” -- Naoki Takayama, President and representative directorCosmo Oil Marketing Co., Ltd.

The fuel will be produced by SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC, a joint venture formed by Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION, and REVO International Inc.

""Since 2021, with the support of the Japanese government, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, and NEDO, we have been working with JGC HOLDINGS CORPORATION, Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., and REVO International Inc. to commercialize SAF. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone involved for helping to build a major wave of domestic resource recycling through activities such as ACT for SKY and Fry to Fly.” -- Takeshi Takada, Representative SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC

The Cosmo Energy Group has worked to establish a supply chain to deliver Japan’s first locally made SAF, with the goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Group is also helping build social momentum through initiatives such as an ongoing pilot program to collect household used cooking oil at service stations for repurposing into SAF feedstock.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines – both founded more than 90 years ago to connect communities, bring people together, transport products, and enable economic growth – are committed to stewarding their environmental impact to create a durable long-term future for the company. As the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. carriers, Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have an ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 through investments in SAF, technology and fleet modernization, among other initiatives.

Chinese PFY prices started August on a minor hike due to steady overseas demand and firmer raw material prices.
In the US market, PFY prices followed China’s trend and rose in early August as tighter import availability was compounded by higher downstream buying.
Toward month-end, PFY prices stabilized, reflecting balanced procurement and normalized supply flows.
In the near future, PFY prices in China and the U.S. are expected to remain range-bound, with stability depending on the recovery in seasonal demand and volatility in feedstock prices.","In August 2025, prices of PFY in China and the United States moved in synchronized trajectory, reflecting similar market fundamentals. Both markets began the month on a positive note with strong procurement and upbeat export streams, but mid-month activities dampened pressure to close out the month in a more price range-bound atmosphere. Regardless of local differences in trade flows and production plans, the overall pricing trend of PFY remained synchronized, created by steady supply and moderate demand at textile and apparel markets.

Chinese PFY prices started August on a minor hike due to steady overseas demand and firmer raw material prices. Low PTA levels that limited cost-push support were countered by firm MEG prices to maintain production economics intact. Exports to the U.S., Germany, and India absorbed surplus availability, counterbalancing local softness in demand. Operating levels of production in the moderate-to-high range satisfied steady export orders. No material disruption was visible, and export markets priced competitively thwarted oversupply from cutting prices.

Towards the end of the month, however, declining PTA values and subdued apparel and home-textile offtake exerted downward pressure. With near-92% utilized spinning lines and hand-to-mouth buying at fabric mills, PFY prices softened before levelling off during the final week with unchanging operating rates and normalized purchasing.

In the US market, PFY prices followed China’s trend and rose in early August as tighter import availability was compounded by higher downstream buying. Import offers were raised by Asian vendors, and storm-related bottlenecks at Shanghai and Ningbo drove transit times out, increasing landed costs. Despite a small drop in freight levels, delivery frictions and cautious inventory management allowed sellers to resist deep cuts in prices.

Demand for PFY picked up for back-to-school and early fall programs, with apparel and home-furnishing categories maintaining steady penetration. A 1.75% sequential increase in apparel and accessories sales bolstered replenishment activity. Speculative buying remained in check, though buyers tolerated modest price increases in order to receive on-time delivery. Toward month-end, PFY prices stabilized, reflecting balanced procurement and normalized supply flows.

In the near future, PFY prices in China and the U.S. are expected to remain range-bound, with stability depending on the recovery in seasonal demand and volatility in feedstock prices. In China, preparations for autumn textile season may give mild support, while sustained weakness in local consumption and deteriorating PTA values may limit advances.

On the American side, import-side tightness is expected to ease with alleviating weather disruptions, but sustained demand from apparel and home-furnishing pipelines will underpin current levels of PFY price. Market participants will be closely observing feedstock cues and export dynamics, both sides navigating cautiously optimistic but supply-sensitive ground.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-30 16:56:21.115259

The company aims to capitalize on the growing demand for low-carbon fuels and the increasing adoption of renewable energy policies. Green Plains' strategy involves expanding its renewable energy production capacity, improving operational efficiency, and generating additional revenue through its nitrogen fertilizer business.

Green Plains (NASDAQ: GPRE), an ethanol producer, is undergoing a significant transformation from a consistent cash burn to a free cash flow positive business model. This transition is being driven by operational improvements and the realization of additional revenue streams through strategic investments in renewable energy and carbon capture technologies.

The company's strategy involves expanding its renewable energy production capacity, improving operational efficiency, and generating additional revenue through its nitrogen fertilizer business. Green Plains is leveraging the growing demand for low-carbon fuels and the increasing adoption of renewable energy policies to drive this transformation.

One of the key initiatives in Green Plains' strategic shift is the development of the Trailblazer pipeline. This pipeline, which is connected to three of the company's ethanol plants in Nebraska, will facilitate carbon capture and sequestration. The company plans to monetize the associated carbon credits, which are afforded by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to boost revenues and EBITDA. Initial estimates suggest that this project could generate between $100-$150 million in EBITDA, making it a transformative project for Green Plains [1].

In addition to the Trailblazer pipeline, Green Plains has committed four additional plants to a prospective sequestration project through Summit Carbon Solutions. This project is still in the permitting phase but is expected to be in service by the first quarter of 2027. The company aims to use the enhanced carbon footprint of its ethanol plants to become eligible for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which could provide an EBITDA uplift to the company's baseline ethanol business [1].

The company's valuation reflects its transition. Historically, Green Plains has produced volatile EBITDA, with an average of approximately $50 million from the base business. Adding the $125 million benefit from the Trailblazer sequestration project drives the company's EBITDA for 2026 to approximately $175 million. On a forward basis, the company currently trades at roughly 6x 2026 EBITDA, implying a solid value play once this project is fully operational [1].

The sale of the Obion plant for $190 million has also significantly de-levered the company and removed high-cost debt. This transaction provides another layer of value for shareholders, as the company's enterprise value has decreased from $1 billion to approximately $940 million after the sale [1].

However, risks associated with Green Plains' business include reliance on government regulation. Regulatory and government delays can present significant hurdles to realizing the projected cash flows for either of the company's CCS projects. The company's reliance on government entities presents regulatory risks to revenue collection [1].

In conclusion, Green Plains' strategic shift towards free cash flow positivity is driven by operational improvements, the realization of additional revenue streams through carbon capture and renewable energy investments, and the sale of the Obion plant. The company's valuation reflects this transformation, and the market appears to be underestimating the value of the Obion sale. However, regulatory risks remain a significant challenge for the company.

To the modern traveller, they are evolving into aspirational lifestyle spaces, marrying convenience, luxury, and technology—ultimately to create unforgettable experiences that are just as much a part of the journey as the destination itself. In exploring this transformation and the future of travel loyalty, Travel Radar spoke with Christopher Ross, Chief Brand Officer and EMEA Executive Chair at Collinson International, behind Priority Pass.

Airports as Destinations: A Psychological Shift

Airports have evolved far beyond their original role as transit points to becoming destinations in their own right, Ross explains. This transformation has been driven by technological advancements that streamline the airport journey, allowing travellers to move seamlessly… and immerse themselves in new experiences once past security.

World-class airports like Changi and Hamad International have set new benchmarks in automation, service, and experience. For brands, Ross notes:

Airports are no longer just points of transit—they are high-value stages for storytelling, engagement, and loyalty building. The brands that will thrive are those that see the airport as a pivotal touchpoint, investing in experiences, services, and environments that make the journey not only endurable, but aspirational and memorable.

Technology That Connects Emotionally

Technology is not only streamlining journeys—it is also enhancing the emotional experience of travel. According to Ross,

The top three technologies people say are improving their journeys today are digital boarding passes (71%), fast-track through security (68%), and advanced security scanners (62%). These innovations help reduce stress and free up valuable time, allowing people to relax, explore, and savour the airport experience rather than simply rushing from one point to another.

This smoother journey creates richer moments.

Ultimately, the technologies that make the journey smoother are also the ones that create space for richer, more memorable moments, helping travellers to connect more deeply with their surroundings, their companions, and the overall experience of travel.

Priority Pass and the Premium Mindset

Priority Pass offers a network of over 1,700 lounges alongside unique experiences from gaming hubs to sleep pods. Ross explains:

Recent additions include services such as access to health and wellness content on-the-go with TrvlWell. From digital mindfulness modules to guided walking tracks, these resources help ease travel anxiety, save valuable time, and create a smoother, stress-free journey.

Smart technology, seamless digital access, and personalised experiences form the backbone of Priority Pass’ premium approach. Ross continues, “whether it’s more destination choices, or exclusive value-added services, Priority Pass is dedicated to helping travellers get to where they are going with greater ease and comfort.”

Exclusivity, and Loyalty

Airport lounges have become a symbol of lifestyle and brand affinity. Ross underscores this:

Our global Value of Travel Benefits research found that 94% of customers say they would consider switching card providers if airport lounge access was removed – making it a critical offering for customer loyalty and retention.

By offering premium lounge access, brands signal that they understand their customers’ lifestyles and aspirations. Ross continues by explaining how “lounge access benefits create a halo effect for brands, positioning them as enablers of elevated travel experiences, which is especially important for customers who prioritise convenience and luxury.

Opportunities for Growth: Wellness, Dining, and Tech

Airport lounges are busier than ever, and travellers’ expectations are rising. To stay ahead of this demand, Ross explains:

We’re consistently expanding the breadth of our inventory through collaborations, strategic partnerships, and innovation, as well as direct investment in new airport experiences and travel services. He continues, While demand is surging, we’re also making a focused effort to ensure travellers have the relaxing, seamless experience they expect. We’ve invested in technology to transform the control and flexibility available to travellers, such as tech that streamlines capacity management by offering Pre-book capabilities and a fully digital waitlist solution through partners.

Airport 2030: Predictive, Personalised, and Human

Ross envisions airports as “far more digitally connected, predictive, and personalised.” Automation will handle routine processes, while human presence will remain crucial:

Many travellers still see a human presence as a vital anchor in the sometimes-stressful airport environment. In the UK, for example, travellers say human support is essential for customer service (67%), at security and border control (59%), and in lost-and-found services (49%), ensuring automation enhances rather than replaces human reassurance.

Cross-Industry Collaboration: The Key to Seamless Travel

Ross emphasises that the future of airports relies on collaboration across airlines, airports, tech innovators, and loyalty platforms:

Creating seamless, emotionally resonant airport experiences requires every player in the travel ecosystem—from airlines and airports to technology innovators, experience brands, financial services, and loyalty platforms—to work in harmony.

He also notes that, Priority Pass also offers wellness benefits, co-working spaces, airport transfers, car rentals, and access to attractions at destinations, ensuring every journey is memorable.

Reimagining the Terminal

If given the chance to redesign one element of the airport journey, Ross’ focus is clear:

Personally, I would redesign the airport terminal itself. Today’s savvy travellers expect experiences that are authentic and tailored to their unique lifestyles and preferences. By leveraging this data intelligently and responsibly, airports and travel businesses can shape benefits and loyalty programmes that truly resonate with customers, making the airport a more enjoyable, efficient, and personalised space for everyone, and in turn driving both loyalty and revenue.

Airports are now stages for luxury, innovation, and engagement. Priority Pass exemplifies this evolution, offering travellers choice, comfort, and memorable experiences at every step—transforming the journey itself into a destination.

Outlook for 2025 JAL enters late 2025 with strong momentum, a modernizing fleet, and rising passenger volumes.
The Bottom Line Japan Airlines advances into the second half of 2025 with confidence, modern aircraft, and strong inbound demand.","Japan Airlines is steering into 2025 with a dual focus capitalizing on Japan’s unprecedented inbound tourism surge while navigating macroeconomic headwinds such as currency fluctuations and rising operational costs. By modernizing its fleet and strategically expanding market presence, the carrier aims to strike a balance between sustaining growth from booming visitor demand and ensuring long-term financial resilience.

Japan Airlines (JAL) moves into the second half of 2025 with a determined growth strategy. Strong inbound tourism drives international demand, while domestic travel remains solid. The airline strengthens its market position by pairing upgrades on long-haul aircraft with the continued expansion of its low-cost subsidiary ZIPAIR Tokyo. This combination allows JAL to appeal to both premium and budget-conscious travelers, widening its influence across multiple segments.

Passenger demand remains a clear strength, yet cargo revenue no longer matches pandemic-era highs. JAL offsets this shortfall by diversifying revenue streams, including ventures with logistics partners. Even with strong fundamentals, the airline faces external risks such as currency volatility, fluctuating jet fuel costs, and new sustainability requirements.

Fleet Renewal and Market Reach

Japan Airlines is speeding up its fleet renewal by retiring aging long-haul aircraft and bringing in the Airbus A350-1000. The new jets deliver greater fuel efficiency and come equipped with refreshed premium cabins designed to attract high-value travelers. The airline places the A350-1000 on its key route linking Tokyo Haneda (HND) with Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), a corridor where demand for premium seating remains especially strong. By upgrading the passenger experience on this route, the carrier strengthens its ability to secure higher fares while solidifying its standing in highly competitive international markets.

The carrier intends to roll out the Airbus A350-1000 on additional long-haul routes, targeting key gateways such as New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles. At the same time, it is boosting seasonal capacity on popular leisure destinations to widen international reach. Its low-cost arm, ZIPAIR Tokyo, continues to grow with affordable long-haul services, complementing the premium network. These combined efforts enhance passenger loyalty and allow Japan Airlines to engage travelers across every segment of the market.

Economic Pressures

Macroeconomic conditions present the largest challenges for JAL. Currency swings directly influence travel demand. If the yen strengthens, Japan becomes more expensive for foreign tourists, potentially slowing inbound growth. A weaker yen, however, may discourage outbound leisure and business travel, affecting balance on the other side of the market. JAL must adapt quickly to these shifts to preserve revenue flows.

Fuel costs remain another critical factor. Jet fuel represents the airline’s biggest variable expense. Analysts expect softer prices through the remainder of 2025, but volatility poses constant risk. Any price surge could place immediate pressure on margins, limiting JAL’s ability to reinvest in growth and modernization.

Sustainability Mandates

Japan advances toward a 2030 requirement mandating a 10% blend of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). JAL must prepare to meet this target despite higher costs and limited global supply. The airline faces pressure to secure adequate SAF volumes while controlling operational expenses. Success in this area strengthens its environmental credibility, but failure could expose it to regulatory and financial strain.

By maintaining strong inbound passenger demand and pricing power in premium markets, JAL positions itself to absorb some of these challenges. Nevertheless, SAF compliance represents one of the most significant long-term hurdles for the airline.

Investor Sentiment

Investors maintain confidence in JAL’s outlook despite risks. Over the past year, the airline’s stock returned more than 25%, driven by strong travel recovery and supportive economic conditions. Earlier disruptions tied to global trade policy briefly lowered confidence, reducing JAL’s price-to-earnings ratio to around 9.2. As recovery gained pace, investor trust rebounded, lifting multiples above 11 by midyear.

Not all investors remain optimistic, however. Some hedge against uncertainty by short-selling, citing exposure to fuel volatility, currency fluctuations, and supply constraints. The Japanese aviation sector adds complexity, as only two major carriers—JAL and All Nippon Airways (ANA)—control the market. This duopoly creates stability but also means growth depends more on external factors such as aircraft deliveries and global economic shifts than on domestic competition.

Outlook for 2025

JAL enters late 2025 with strong momentum, a modernizing fleet, and rising passenger volumes. Its ability to capture both premium and budget travelers through JAL and ZIPAIR provides a clear competitive advantage. Currency trends, fuel markets, and sustainability regulations pose real challenges, yet the airline has shown agility in navigating turbulence before.

The path forward requires balancing innovation with financial discipline. By expanding long-haul capacity, investing in passenger experience, and adapting to regulatory shifts, JAL seeks to solidify its role as a leader in Asia-Pacific aviation. For investors, the picture remains cautiously optimistic: strong performance so far suggests resilience, but macroeconomic volatility means risks remain high.

The Bottom Line

Japan Airlines advances into the second half of 2025 with confidence, modern aircraft, and strong inbound demand. Its growth strategy hinges on capturing premium traffic with upgraded long-haul cabins, expanding low-cost options with ZIPAIR, and navigating external pressures such as fuel volatility and SAF mandates.

Japan Airlines is preparing for 2025 by modernizing its fleet and strengthening its market presence, aiming to harness Japan’s tourism boom while countering economic pressures like currency swings and rising costs.

The airline’s financial performance, bolstered by a recovering global travel sector, shows resilience and adaptability. However, success depends heavily on managing external risks that lie outside its control. For now, JAL demonstrates the ability to balance growth with caution, positioning itself as a carrier ready to compete on a global scale in an unpredictable environment.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Japan-Airlines-4-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 11:56:40.707994

Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney told shareholders on Saturday that the company will invest Rs 1.66 trillion over the next five years to scale up its traditional oil operations while pushing aggressively into petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewable energy.

Refining power: capacity to touch 98.4 mt

At the heart of IOC’s plan is a major upgrade of its refining business. The company will raise its crude oil refining capacity from the current 80.75 million tonnes per year to 98.4 million tonnes by 2028.

Expansion projects are underway at Panipat, Gujarat, and Barauni refineries.

The pipeline network will be scaled up to 22,000 km, supported by 21 ongoing projects.

New storage facilities, including in Nepal, will strengthen cross-border energy supply lines.

Petrochemicals push to cut imports

IOC is also turning its attention to petrochemicals, aiming to triple its output from 4.3 million tonnes today to more than 13 million tonnes by 2030. The focus will be on specialty chemicals, an area where India remains import-dependent.

Its retail presence of over 40,000 fuel stations will evolve into multi-energy hubs, integrating:

EV chargers and battery-swapping stations

CNG and LNG dispensing units

Expanded convenience services for India’s growing mobility market

Clean energy and the 2046 net-zero goal

A central pillar of IOC’s strategy is the energy transition. The company has earmarked ₹2.5 trillion for clean energy projects as it targets net zero operational emissions by 2046.

Key areas of focus include:

Expanding renewable power capacity from 1 GW to 18 GW within three years

Green hydrogen production facilities

Sustainable aviation fuel projects

Sahney stressed that this diversification will “future-proof IndianOil” while balancing national energy needs.

Natural gas and new business verticals

IOC’s natural gas segment is seeing rapid growth, with volumes rising 20 percent to 7.9 million tonnes annually. The business now spans:

49 geographical areas across 21 states

Coverage of 21 percent of India’s population

Beyond energy, IOC is expanding into allied businesses such as explosives, cryogenics, and shipping infrastructure, signalling its intent to tap into wider industrial opportunities.

Global headwinds, local resilience

Sahney acknowledged that global turbulence, from the Russia-Ukraine war to Middle East unrest and US trade barriers, continues to roil energy flows. Yet IOC posted record sales of more than 100 million tonnes in FY25, supported by:

A vast retail network reaching every corner of India

Strong pipeline infrastructure

LPG distribution to over 15 crore households

En France, le report à 2031 du contrôle des compensations carbone pour les vols nationaux illustre ce recul politique.","L’aviation produit 3 % à 6 % des émissions mondiales de CO2, sans compter sa contribution en vapeur d’eau et en oxydes d’azote. En 2021, au sortir de la crise du Covid, l’Association du transport aérien international (IATA) précisait les moyens d’atteindre la neutralité carbone à l’horizon 2050 : 81 % de l’effort reposait sur les carburants « durables » (sustainable aviation fuel) et sur les technologies de propulsion à l’hydrogène. Le reste passait par des compensations, par le biais de la géo-ingénierie et des achats de crédits carbone. L’avion vert était prêt à décoller !

Que sont devenues ces ambitions ? Le secteur a retrouvé son niveau d’avant Covid avec 5 milliards de passagers en 2025 et ses perspectives de croissance de 3 % par an pourraient le conduire à atteindre 10 milliards de passagers en 2050 alors que la Nasa travaille sur un avion hypersonique pouvant voler à Mach 5 (plus de 6 000 kilomètres par heure). À un tel rythme, les émissions de gaz à effet de serre pourraient tripler d’ici à 2050. Les prévisions traversent une zone de turbulences…

De fait, les promesses techniques et économiques ne sont pas au rendez-vous. Le recours à la biomasse et, ce qui est moins connu des passagers végans, aux graisses animales, se heurte à une offre insuffisante et à la concurrence d’autres secteurs avides de biocarburants à substituer aux énergies fossiles. De plus, l’origine des biocarburants autorisés pour l’aviation est très large, et inclut par exemple l’huile de palme si problématique.

L’hydrogène provient en majorité de sources non renouvelables. En outre, il exige des réservoirs quatre fois plus grands que pour le kérosène et d’être maintenu à – 253 °C pour rester liquide. Notons que les techniques de capture et de séquestration du carbone ne compensent aujourd’hui que 1 % des émissions mondiales de CO2 et que leur coût reste prohibitif.

Quant au système d’échange de crédits carbone Corsia (pour Carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) créé par l’Organisation de l’aviation civile internationale en 2016, il fait l’objet d’une rafale de critiques : trop d’exemptions prévues, flou sur la provenance des biocarburants, compensations forestières inefficaces… Or mettre en avant des solutions techniques irréalistes pour perpétuer les modèles existants constitue des allégations trompeuses sanctionnées par la loi.

À la suite d’une plainte pour greenwashing du Bureau européen des unions de consommateurs (le BEUC) déposée en 2023, la Commission européenne a ouvert une enquête sur vingt compagnies aériennes qui affirment que le transport aérien peut être durable, écoresponsable ou vert. En juin 2025, le BEUC a publié un rapport indiquant que, malgré quelques améliorations mineures, le compte n’y est pas.

Et il est loin d’y être… La directive Green Claims, anti-greenwashing, est happée par le tourbillon bruxellois de la casse des normes environnementales. En France, le report à 2031 du contrôle des compensations carbone pour les vols nationaux illustre ce recul politique. La coalition de pays, formée lors de la Conférence internationale sur le financement du développement tenue en juillet 2025, n’appelle ni à la sobriété, ni à la réduction des émissions qui aurait pu s’appuyer sur la taxation des billets de première. On se souvient du tollé provoqué par Jean-Marc Jancovici qui proposait d’instaurer non pas des prix dissuasifs, mais un quota individuel de quatre vols par vie pour réduire le trafic aérien.",https://medias.pourlascience.fr/api/v1/images/view/68a44a41e989363dd40bdd12/wide_1300/image.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 12:57:00.046773

Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney shared these insights during the company’s annual meeting, highlighting the strategic focus on meeting the growing demand for auto fuels alongside the global energy transition.

Expansion of Refining Capacity

IOC plans to increase its refining capacity from the current 80.75 million tonnes per year to 98.4 million tonnes by 2028. This growth will be driven by expansion projects at key locations, including Panipat, Gujarat, and Barauni. Sahney emphasized the company’s commitment to investing ₹1.66 lakh crore, which will primarily target the petrochemicals, natural gas, and renewable energy sectors. This strategic move is designed to balance the rising demand for auto fuels in India with the ongoing global shift towards sustainable energy solutions.

This includes the development of new storage facilities in Nepal. The company aims to boost its petrochemicals business significantly, increasing production from 4.3 million tonnes to over 13 million tonnes annually by 2030. A particular focus will be placed on specialty chemicals to reduce imports and enhance profit margins.

Diversification into Green Energy

In addition to its core operations, IOC is diversifying into green energy with a substantial investment of ₹2.5 lakh crore aimed at achieving net-zero operational emissions by 2046. This includes initiatives such as green hydrogen production, sustainable aviation fuel, and a significant increase in renewable power capacity from 1 GW to 18 GW within three years. The company is also enhancing its fuel station network, which exceeds 40,000 locations, by adding electric vehicle (EV) chargers, battery-swapping facilities, and CNG/LNG dispensing outlets.

Sahney noted that IOC is sharpening its focus on improving throughput per outlet and exploring non-fuel retail opportunities. The company is also venturing into emerging segments such as bitumen, bunkering, and LNG-based shipping. Furthermore, IOC is investing in coastal infrastructure and data transmission services, ensuring that every investment is made with long-term value creation in mind.

Market Leadership and Innovations

IOC continues to maintain its leadership position in the LPG market, holding a 45% share. The company has recently introduced BIS-certified 5 kg Chhotu Master cylinders, with the first retail outlet launched in Ahmedabad. Additionally, it has rolled out innovative products like XtraBoost nano-additized AutoLPG and Propane Plus for industrial customers. The reach of IOC’s Servo lubricants has expanded to 45 countries, further solidifying its market presence.

In the aviation fuel sector, IOC retains a commanding 54.5% market share and has opened new fueling stations in Srinagar and Rewa. The company’s natural gas volumes have surged by 20%, reaching 7.9 million tonnes annually, supported by global sourcing agreements. Its city gas business has expanded across 49 geographical areas in 21 states. Beyond energy, IOC is also making strides in the explosives sector with new plants in Neyveli and projects in Telangana and Maharashtra.

Challenges and Resilience

Sahney acknowledged the challenges facing the global energy sector, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, tensions in the Middle East, and disruptions in the Red Sea. These factors, along with new U.S. tariff hikes, have impacted trade flows. Despite these challenges, IOC has achieved significant milestones, surpassing 100 million tonnes in sales and serving over 32 million customers daily through its retail network. The company also supplies LPG to 150 million kitchens across India, demonstrating its resilience and commitment to meeting the energy needs of the nation.

SAF is currently the most effective tool to cut aviation emissions,” said Alanna James, Director of Sustainability Innovation at Hawaiian Airlines.

The SAF supplied under this agreement is produced from used cooking oil collected in Japan. It became commercially available after Cosmo received a subsidy in 2021 from the government-backed New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to develop a domestic SAF supply chain. The fuel carries ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU certifications, confirming compliance with international sustainability standards.

“SAF is a central part of aviation’s journey to cut emissions. We are proud to support the decarbonization goals of Alaska Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and their passengers. This partnership is an important step in promoting the wider use of SAF,” said Naoki Takayama, President of Cosmo Oil Marketing Co., Ltd.

The fuel will be produced by SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC, a joint venture of Cosmo Oil Co., JGC Holdings Corporation, and REVO International Inc. The group has been working since 2021 with support from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and NEDO to commercialize SAF.

“I want to thank everyone who has supported our work to establish Japan’s SAF supply chain. Through projects like ACT for SKY and Fry to Fly, we are building a system to recycle waste cooking oil into aviation fuel,” said Takeshi Takada, Representative of SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY LLC.

Cosmo Energy Group is also running a pilot program to collect used cooking oil at service stations as part of its goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Both Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. Their plans include investments in SAF, new technologies, and modern aircraft.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-10.png,N,,2025-08-30 07:56:56.879479

Therefore, it is necessary to include the climate impact of the non-CO2 emissions from burning SAF when quantifying the climate impact benefits of SAF.
In this study, we perform the Life Cyle Climate Impact Analysis (LCCIA) to evaluate the climate benefit of SAF.
Well-to-wake CO2e emissions results The well-to-wake CO2e emissions consist of two contributions: (1) the lifecycle CO2 emissions (production, distribution and combustion); and (2) the inflight non-CO2 emissions (PtW).
The flights at higher cruise altitudes usually have a higher non-CO2 climate impact contribution than flights with lower cruise altitudes26.","Aviation is an important economic sector that provides a fast and reliable means of transportation. However, in 2018, the sector was responsible for the emission of almost 1 Gt CO2, equivalent to 2.4% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions including land use change1. Lee et al. (2021) estimated that the share of anthropogenic effective radiative forcing from aviation was around 4%, including both CO2 and non-CO2 effects1.

The non-CO2 climate impact stems primarily from the releases of nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapour (H2O), and particle emissions. These non-CO2 effects have strong spatial and temporal dependencies and are associated with a high degree of uncertainty1,2. NOx emissions can lead to positive radiative forcing (warming effect) as they serve as a precursor for short-term ozone (O3) production but also cause a cooling effect as they destroy background methane (CH4) and the associated ozone (named as Primary Mode Ozone, PMO)3,4. Water vapour has a negligible greenhouse gas (GHG) effect when emitted in the lower levels of the troposphere due to its short lifetime, but when emitted at high altitudes (near the tropopause or in the stratosphere), its GHG effect becomes stronger due to its increased residence time5. Soot and sulfur particulate emissions have relatively small direct climate effects, but when H2O condenses onto these particles and freezes to form a contrail, this can lead to a significant positive forcing, especially at night6. In total, the non-CO2 effects represented roughly two-thirds of total aviation’s radiative forcing in 2018 considering the best estimate1.

One way to reduce aviation’s climate impact is by using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)7. For instance, aircraft operators are allowed to use SAF to reduce their carbon offsetting requirements through the Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS)8. The carbon footprint of SAFs is often quantified in grams of CO2 equivalence per megajoule (gCO2 e/MJ) by means of a Lifecycle Analysis (LCA), which allows the user to identify the environmental benefit of SAF compared to Conventional Jet Fuel (CJF)9,10,11. Based on these findings, a certain type of SAF can be promoted or discouraged by decision-makers. As mandated by regulatory frameworks, e.g., CORSIA, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (California), the current LCAs focus mainly on CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions produced from Well to Wake (WtW). The WtW scope is composed of two stages: (1) fuel production and distribution (Well-to-Pump (WtP)) and (2) fuel combustion (Pump-to-Wake (PtW)). Accordingly, 100% SAF has the potential to reduce the lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 94% compared to CJF, depending on the feedstocks and technology pathways, e.g., carbon capture11,12.

When it comes to the PtW non-CO2 emissions, burning SAF can reduce soot particles and thereby reducing contrail radiative forcing13. Meanwhile, SAF has little effect on the NOx emissions14. Therefore, it is necessary to include the climate impact of the non-CO2 emissions from burning SAF when quantifying the climate impact benefits of SAF. The previous work15,16 analyzed the inflight non-CO2 climate effects of SAF using the Global Warming Potential (GWP) with horizons of 20-100-500 years. It was concluded that the incorporation of these non-CO2 effects reduced the relative merit of using SAF, as SAF could not mitigate the non-CO2 climate impact. However, the analysis did not consider the fact that SAF is able to reduce the contrail climate impact17,18 because of the reduced soot emissions compared to CJF19,20. Moreover, recent work from Megill et al.21 tested climate metrics against requirements, such as the consistency between the climate impact evaluation based on a requirement and a scenario analysis. The analysis showed that Average Temperature Response (ATR) as a climate metric was better suited for aviation than, e.g. GWP.

In this study, we perform the Life Cyle Climate Impact Analysis (LCCIA) to evaluate the climate benefit of SAF. To do so, we quantify the climate impact of NOx, H2O and contrails from the PtW stage and convert them to the gCO2e/MJ value based on two climate metrics, GWP and ATR, respectively for time horizons of 20-50-100 years22,23. The resulting gCO2e/MJ values are then combined with the Lifecycle GHG emissions of the CORSIA Eligible Fuels to obtain the overall WtW GHG emissions of SAF24. Accordingly, we reflect on environmental benefits of SAF and show in the discussion that the GHG emission reductions can be increased by allocating SAF to long range flights. The overall approach includes an integrated modelling chain of emission inventory generation, climate impact calculation and Monte Carlo simulations. The details are described in the method section.

Climate impact of inflight emissions for CJF and SAF

Figure 1 shows the radiative forcing (RF) and the resulting near surface temperature change (∆T) caused by in-flight CO2, NOx, H2O emissions and contrails from the beginning of aviation to roughly 100 years after introduction of considerable amount of SAF (i.e., 1940–2130) for two cases: (1) 100% CJF (solid line) and (2) 100% SAF (dotted line). Case (1) assumes all aircraft use CJF from 1940 to 2130. For case (2), all aircraft use 100% CJF from 1940 to 2018, and in 2019 a perturbation is introduced that all aircraft use 100% SAF until 2130. The emission indices and calorific values of CJF and SAF are given in Table 1. The emission index of CO2 for SAF is based on the emissions at the engine tailpipe and does not include the reduction in Lifecyle CO2 in order to evaluate the CO2 equivalence for non-CO2 effects. Furthermore, the change in contrail RF for SAF in Table 1 is due to the reduction of soot number particles and is derived using the methodology from Grewe et al. (2021)25. The GHG emissions in Table 1 considers the amount of CO2 from combustion process. The RF and ∆T in Fig. 1 do not consider WtP emissions from fuel production and distribution. From 2019 onwards, the implementation of SAF will result in lower fuel consumption because of the higher calorific values of the fuel, which slightly reduces CO2, NOx, and soot emissions for given emission indices.

Furthermore, the CO2 emission index (EICO2) of SAF is lower than CJF, hence reducing the total CO2 emission, the corresponding RF and ∆T. Due to the increased H2O emission index (EIH2O) for SAF, the RF and ∆T related to H2O emissions for SAF are slightly higher. The NOx emission index (EINOx) is the same for both fuels, as NOx emissions are mainly affected by the engine architecture and combustion technology not the fuel itself14. The contrail RF of SAF is reduced by about 21% in 2130, mainly due to the reduced soot numbers of burning SAF. The reduction of soot number reduces the contrail lifetime, optical properties, and hence the climate impact18. More details about the RF derivations for SAF are given in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3. The Supplementary Table 4 compares the change of RF using SAF from different literatures and shows a large variation range from 20% − 50% depending on the model setups. While the current analysis falls into the variation range, further research is required to reduce the uncertainty of using SAF on the contrail radiative forcing.

CO2 equivalent factors for CJF and SAF

Based on the temporal evolution of ∆T in Fig. 1, the ATRi,H (average temperature response over a time horizon of H for an individual climate specie, i) is obtained. Accordingly, the CO2 equivalent (CO2e) factors of individual species as a ratio to the \({\text{ATR}_{\text{CO}_{2},\text{H}}}\) is derived (see Eq. (1)). These CO2e factors indicate the significance of non-CO2 effects on the increase of the average surface temperature compared to the CO2 emissions by CJF and SAF, respectively.

$$\:{CO}_{{2e,\:all,\:\:ATR}_{H}}=\:\frac{{\sum\:}_{i}{\int\:}_{2019}^{2019+H}{\varDelta\:T}_{i}\left(t\right)-{\varDelta\:T}_{i}\left(2019\right)\:dt}{{\int\:}_{2019}^{2019+H}{\varDelta\:T}_{{CO}_{2}}\left(t\right)-{\varDelta\:T}_{{CO}_{2}}\left(2019\right)\:dt}\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:$$

(1)

In Eq. (1), H is the time horizon. The subscript i denotes the climate species of NOx, H2O, CO2 and contrail, respectively. The temperature change in 2019 caused by species i emitted by global aviation before 2019 (i.e.,\(\:{\varDelta\:T}_{i}\left(2019\right)\)) is subtracted to eliminate the temperature change that already has happened before 2019.

In Fig. 2, the CO2e ratios of all individual climate agents for SAF and CJF are presented for three different time horizons of 20, 50 and 100 years. For the shorter time horizon, the CO2e is larger since non-CO2 effects have a stronger short-term climate impact. As the time horizon increases, CO2 emissions build up and the resulting warming effect becomes more prominent over the long term. Hence, the total CO2e ratios reduce.

CO2e ratios based on the GWP have also been calculated following the similar approach of Eq. (1), but based on the time integrated RF. The consequent CO2e ratios indicate how much radiation (stratospherically adjusted RF) is forced back by non-CO2 effects compared to CO2. The results for CO2e ratios based on GWP are present in Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 7 and agree well with available literature15 (see Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Table 9 for more details).

Well-to-wake CO2e emissions results

The well-to-wake CO2e emissions consist of two contributions: (1) the lifecycle CO2 emissions (production, distribution and combustion); and (2) the inflight non-CO2 emissions (PtW). In Table 1, the amount of CO2 emitted per MJ of fuel due to combustion are 73.3 gCO2/MJ for CJF and 70.2 gCO2/MJ for SAF. By multiplying these values with CO2e ratios in Fig. 2, the PtW CO2e emissions for the inflight non-CO2 effects can be derived. As a result, the PtW CO2e emission of CJF, due to the non-CO2 climate effects, is 167.9 gCO2e/MJ (based on the ATR100). Similarly, the PtW CO2e emissions for the non-CO2 effects of SAF is 147.7 gCO2e/MJ.

The PtW CO2e emissions of SAF for the non-CO2 effects can be flexibly included to any existing LCAs to obtain WtW CO2e emissions of SAF (see Eq. (2)). These novel WtW CO2e values thus represent the lifecycle climate impact in the format of gCO2e/MJ.

$$\:{\left[\frac{g{CO}_{2}e}{MJ}\right]\:}_{WtW}=\:{\left[\frac{g{CO}_{2}e}{MJ}\right]\:}_{WtP}+\:{\left[\frac{g{CO}_{2}e}{MJ}\right]\:}_{PtW}\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:$$

Figure 3 shows a set of WtW CO2e emissions considering the ICAO CORSIA eligible fuels and the CJF based on ATR100. The CORSIA core LCA emissions (in green) are taken from24. The Induced Land Use Change values (referring to the additional land used for fuel production, in pink).

Upon the inclusion of PtW non-CO2 effects, the equivalent CO2 emissions per MJ for CJF increases from 89 (the CORSIA LCA value, orange dotted line) to 256.9 [192.3-334.9] gCO2e/MJ (red dotted line). The PtW CO2e of SAF for the non-CO2 effects is about 147.7 g per MJ (blue bars in Fig. 3), which is slightly less than CJF (167.9 gCO2e/MJ). This indicates that the relative merit of using SAF increases mainly due to the reduction of contrail’s climate impact. For a shorter time horizon of 20- or 50- years, the CO2e ratios shown in Fig. 2 increase considerably, driven by the non-CO2 climate effects. Namely, using these shorter time horizons increases the non-CO2 emission reduction potential from SAF.

Furthermore, it is observed that some pathways like the palm oil (open pond) HEFA and corn grain EtJ, which previously had higher lifecycle emissions than CJF, now have lower WtW CO2e emissions than CJF. This is mainly because SAF contains less aromatics and decreases non-CO2 climate impact, i.e. the contrail impacts. It should be noted that in the RED (the legal framework used for the quantification of emissions reductions in the EU ETS), the standards set for a fuel to be classified as SAF are different. Nevertheless, the PtW values derived in this analysis are still applicable. We find that the intrapathway uncertainty increases which is aligned with the findings in15. If GWP based CO2e ratios were used instead of ATR based CO2e ratios to calculate the PtW results, the intrapathway uncertainty would decrease, as there is more uncertainty associated with calculating temperature change responses than radiative forcing responses.

While having one set of CO2e ratios for the entire fleet is convenient, it is not entirely fair for flights. The flights at higher cruise altitudes usually have a higher non-CO2 climate impact contribution than flights with lower cruise altitudes26. Therefore, flight-distance dependent CO2e factors are calculated for the clusters defined in Table 2 based on (great circle) flight distances. For each group, the ATR100 per climate species are calculated, and accordingly, cluster-specific CO2e ratios are derived for both CJF and SAF (the values are presented in the Supplementary Fig. 5). The main takeaway is that for the shorter-range flights, the climate impact reduction attained with SAF reduces compared to the long-range flights. The main reason is that short flights hardly reach contrail-forming altitudes. Therefore, the lower soot emissions from SAF will not benefit for contrail climate impact.

In this work, the PtW CO2e emissions based on the non-CO2 climate effects from NOx, H2O and contrails are newly derived and are combined with typical ICAO CORSIA LCA emissions to obtain the WtW CO2e emissions. Considering different climate metrics, the final LCCIA WtW varies. An example of considering the ATR100 metric shows that CJF has a WtW CO2e emissions of about 256.9 g per MJ. The LCCIA WtW for SAF varies from about 150 to 250 gCO2e/MJ depending on the exact SAF pathways. Furthermore, non-CO2 effects contribute to approximately 69.6% and 67.7% of the overall in-flight CO2e emissions of CJF & SAF respectively. Two possible ways to decrease this climate impact are by lean combustion engines with less NOx and soot emissions27 or by avoiding climate sensitive areas28,29,30. With the new LCCIA WtW CO2e emissions values, policy and decision-makers can make informed decisions about the climate impact reduction potential of SAF.

One of the primary reasons why non-CO2 effects are currently excluded from the quantification of emissions reduction using CORSIA and EU ETS (RED) is because of the uncertainty associated with their climate impact. We have investigated the impact of a range of uncertainties (see methods) on the equivalent emissions by running a Monte Carlo analysis that generates a whole range of different CO2e factors and pump-to-wake results (grey bars in Figs. 2 and 3). To ensure that non-CO2 climate impact is fairly and adequately accredited, the CO2e factor and PtW results of the Monte Carlo’s 5th percentile can be taken, meaning it is 95% certain that climate impact is at least higher than the accredited value. Moreover, to study the robustness of the model prediction, a sensitivity study has been performed for the NOx RF. By replacing the calculated NOx RF in the AirClim model with the values presented by Lee et al. (2021)1, we observed a significant drop in the magnitude of the CO2e factors (methodology bar in Supplementary Fig. 5), as the climate-chemistry model that was used in the development of AirClim is at the upper end of the ozone increases per NOx emission of the range given in Lee et al. (2021)1. Nevertheless, the variation is within the uncertainty range.

One limitation of this study is that the direct aerosol effects are not considered due to their relatively small values. The absence of sulfur in SAF reduces SO2 and volatile H2SO4 emissions, hence reducing the corresponding cooling effects. Therefore, the CO2e ratio for SAF is slightly underestimated in this regard15. On the other hand, the cooling effect of sulfur-related emissions might be roughly cancelled out by the direct warming effect of soot emissions (see Supplementary information section 7). The results of the ECLIF-II17 and ECLIF-III measurements31 indicate that sulfur particles possibly play a role in soot particle activation, as they are thought to increase the soot particle’s hydrophilicity. A higher soot particle activation will lead to a higher number of ice particles with smaller particle diameters, leading to a decreased sedimentation loss of ice particles and therefore longer contrail lifetime. The induced indirect global warming effects due to change in sulfur contents in SAF require thorough analysis.

Furthermore, a recent study32 indicates that at sufficiently cold temperatures and low soot emission regime (e.g., lean combustion), background sulfur and organic volatile particles can play critical roles in ice nucleation, hence the contrail radiative forcing. In such situations, the benefit of SAF in reducing the contrail climate effect requires further investigation.

The flight range based CO2e ratios shows that the reduction of CO2e emissions increases as the flight range increases, this implies that for limited availability of SAF, allocating it to longer flights with higher flight altitudes would allow more climate benefit, as suggested by33. Further, the previous study also33 showed that the allocation of SAF to night-time flights would have increased climate benefits, as especially the contrails at night have the highest climate impact. If distinct CO2e factors for day and night were used, this could lead to substantially lower CO2e factors for SAF at night and thereby much higher emissions reductions would be achieved per MJ of SAF. Nevertheless, due to the lifetime of contrails, they are advected into day regions, even if they are produced at night, which complicates, though not rule out, the target SAF use.

Moreover, lean combustion engines emit less NOx and soot and will cause a lower climate impact per unit of fuel used, which means that the CO2e factor should also be aircraft type dependent. Even more accurate CO2e factors could be made when they would also be weather type dependent as aircraft operators would then be incentivized to allocate their SAF to flights with the highest probability of e.g. contrails cirrus outbreaks. The more factors are considered by the CO2e factor, the more accurate the quantification of emissions reductions becomes and the better the incentivization of aircraft operators becomes to use SAF at the right time, in the right aircraft and for the right aircraft trajectory. However, this will also result in more work and cost and possibly require running weather simulations before take-off. Further work should focus on exploring different types of CO2e factors, their effect on aircraft operator behavior and the associated cost of making them. In addition, the knowledge and understanding of non-CO2 climate impact must be further deepened and uncertainties included in the assessment of mitigation options such as SAF to better understand the impact of those uncertainties on the mitigation potential.

The LCCIA method used to derive the WtW values is based on the climate response model, AirClim, which considers a global aviation emission inventory adapted for SAF usage, the growth of aircraft traffic and the relevant background atmospheric species, like CO2 and CH4. The entire modelling chain is explained in Supplementary Fig. 1. The detail of each element is described in this section.

Climate assessment

The calculation of global RF and temperature responses resulting from global aviation is performed using AirClim (version 2.0)34,35. AirClim is a non-linear climate-chemistry response model to estimate the atmospheric response, radiative forcing, and near-surface temperature changes resulting from the emissions of CO2, H2O, NOx and contrails. AirClim achieves this by combining emission perturbation data with pre-calculated, altitude- and latitude-dependent atmospheric input data obtained from 85 steady-state simulations performed with the ECHAM4 and E39/CA climate chemistry models. The Supplementary Table 5 shows the RF in 2018 calculated by AirClim model comparing to the literature1. To convert the RF to the temperature response, a set of climate sensitivity parameters were taken from the published literature35 and are used here in this study. The program does not account for the direct warming effects of soot aerosols nor the direct cooling effects of sulfate aerosols. Indirect aerosol-cloud interactions are omitted from consideration as these are very uncertain, and the climate impacts of CO and unburn hydrogen carbons (UHCs) are also disregarded as they represent a negligible portion of aviation climate impact1. A process flow diagram displaying the critical inputs and outputs of AirClim in the context of this research is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The three main inputs to generate a baseline 100% CJF scenario are (1) an emissions inventory, (2) a fuel background scenario, and (3) a CO2 and CH4 background scenario. For the background, we consider an increasing scenario to represent the growth of the air traffic and the involvement of the atmospheric concentrations.

Emission inventory

The emission inventory used for this research is generated using the Global Aviation Model Emission Inventory (GAMEI) developed in-house36. This model generates a 3D grid representing Earth’s atmosphere with a horizontal resolution of 1° by 1° and a vertical resolution of 1000 feet. The fuel consumption, NOx emissions, non-volatile particulate matters nvPM) and flown kilometres by global aviation in 2019 are calculated. To produce this 3D grid, flight departure and destination airports are taken from a flight database of 2019 from flightradar24 which also indicates aircraft type. For each flight, a trajectory is created and segmented into waypoints. At each waypoint, the aircraft’s performance metrics (fuel flow, rate of climb, and velocity) are calculated using BADA (EUROCONTROL) performance data. CO2 and H2O emissions are calculated by multiplying the used fuel at a certain waypoint with the emission indices of CJF for CO2 and H2O of 3.16 and 1.25 respectively. NOx emissions for each waypoint are calculated using the Boeing Fuel Flow Method 2 (BFFM2)37 and the ICAO Emissions Database (EDB). The result was an emissions inventory with 266.6 Tg fuel, 5.06 Tg NOx and 52.43 × 109 flown km for 2019. The emissions inventory is verified and validated with the emissions inventory from38 in Supplementary information (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1).

Fuel background scenario

The fuel background scenarios used in this study are the “Current Technology” (CurTec) and “Business As Usual” (BAU) scenarios taken from25 (Supplementary information). These are a top-down series of historic fuel use by global aviation and have been extended from 2100 to 2130. For this extension, an annual Revenue Passenger Kilometer growth of 0.5% per annum has been assumed from 2101 to 2150, and it is assumed that the [#pax/flight] will increase from 85 to 88 for both the CurTec as well as the BAU scenario. Lastly, for CurTec, it is assumed that the fuel efficiency stays 4.67 [kg/km] from 2100 to 2150, whereas for the BAU scenario, this [kg/km] is assumed to decrease with 0.25%/year in 2100 and 0.01%/year in 2150. The Supplementary Fig. 3 shows a good agreement between the temporal evaluation of temperature response using the emission inventory in this work when comparing the literature25 under the identify scenario.

CO2 and CH4 background scenario

Another important input for AirClim is a CO2 and CH4 background scenario. For this analysis, the SSP1-2.6 scenario from the IPCC is chosen. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios are five distinct socio-economic narratives used by the IPCC and in climate change research that predict different global futures based on varying societal developments39. SSP1 is the sustainability scenario based on so-called “green road” development. The 2.6 refers to the radiative forcing level, specifically 2.6 W/m2 by the year 2100. We have chosen SSP1-2.6 CO2 and CH4 background scenario, since during the assignment of emissions savings to players in the aviation sector, it must be assumed that all other sectors in all countries are also contributing to emissions savings. In the Supplementary Table 10, the effect of varying the CO2 and CH4 background scenarios is presented.

Uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo

The climate impact of non-CO2 effects is associated with a large uncertainty. To account for this, some of the model input parameters, like the CO2 and CH4 atmospheric residence times, the radiative forcing (RF) strengths and climate sensitivity parameters of all 6 modeled aviation climate agents (CO2, CH4, H2O, O3, PMO and contrail cirrus) are prescribed as uncertainty parameters with uniform uncertainty distributions. This gives a total of 11 parameters for which a uniform uncertainty distribution is prescribed and for which 2000 Monte Carlo simulations are done. 2000 simulations were chosen as by then; good convergence (with nominal/default values) was observed.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-13445-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_13445_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-08-30 04:56:08.462012

Jamnagar, the world's biggest single-site integrated refinery complex, has two refineries and is the main hub for Reliance's oil-to-chemicals business.
""Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world's largest Conventional Energy complex and the world's largest New Energy complex.
""It will enable cost-competitive green hydrogen production at global scale, backed by exclusive global technology partnerships, and strengthened by our in-house capabilities,"" he said.
This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives,"" he said.","Reliance Industries Ltd is doubling down its clean energy business with planned start of a mega battery production factory in 2026, a solar electricity generation project spread over an area three times the size of Singapore, and 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen capacity by 2032.

Making his debut at the company's annual general meeting, Anant Ambani, the youngest son of billionaire Mukesh Ambani and executive director of Reliance, said the company is building the world's most integrated new energy ecosystem -- from sand to electrons to green molecules.

The company is investing in producing every single piece of clean energy -- modules that will turn sunlight into electricity, batteries that can store the energy, electrolysers that can use such renewable energy to split water molecule to produce the fuel of the future -- hydrogen, giga factories to produce green hydrogen and its derivatives like green ammonia and green methanol for domestic and export market, make sustainable aviation fuel, and produce biofuels from organic waste.

Reliance -- India's largest conglomerate whose interest spans from oil and petrochemicals to telecom and retail -- had in 2021 unveiled a USD 10 billion plan spanning renewables, storage and hydrogen as it chased net zero emissions status by 2035.

The plan was to develop the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex at its integrated refinery complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat. Jamnagar, the world's biggest single-site integrated refinery complex, has two refineries and is the main hub for Reliance's oil-to-chemicals business.

The company using the same site to create platforms that will deliver a multi-pronged, gigawatt-scale clean energy ecosystem -- solar, battery storage, hydrogen -- all under one roof, he said.

""Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world's largest Conventional Energy complex and the world's largest New Energy complex. Jamnagar is the face of New Reliance and New India,"" he said.

Having started the first line for manufacturing of solar panels, the company is now looking to scale up to 20 GWp capacity in coming quarters, which would be the largest solar manufacturing facility and the most integrated single-site solar complex globally, he said.

""We have successfully produced our first 200 MW of HJT modules. These deliver 10 per cent higher energy yield, 20 per cent better temperature performance, and 25 per cent lower degradation,"" he said. ""We are scaling rapidly."" In parallel, it is rapidly constructing battery and electrolyser giga factories. ""Our battery giga factory will start in 2026. It will begin with 40 GWh per year capacity and expand modularly to 100 GWh per year,"" he said.

The electrolyser giga factory will also be operational by end-2026, with the ability to scale up to 3 GW per year. ""It will enable cost-competitive green hydrogen production at global scale, backed by exclusive global technology partnerships, and strengthened by our in-house capabilities,"" he said.

""At peak, we will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. This will be among the fastest installations globally. This single site could meet nearly 10 per cent of India's electricity needs within the next decade,"" he said.

""We will produce and export green ammonia, green methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. This will make India a global hub for cost-competitive green hydrogen and its derivatives,"" he said.

While the initial focus will be to meet Reliance's own large captive demand, it plans to scale up to 3 million tonnes of green hydrogen equivalent production capacity by 2032.

Reliance, he said, is also building compressed biogas (CBG) plants with an annual capacity of 0.5 million tonnes. ""Our target is to scale up to 500+ CBG plants by 2030,"" he said.

Ambani said the company is investing Rs 75,000 crore in a 1.2 million tonne PVC plant at Nagothane in Maharashtra, expansion of a PTA facility at Dahej in Gujarat and a 1 million tonne specialty polyester facility at Palghar.

""These projects are positioned to meet India's rising demand,"" he said. ""Our Hazira carbon fibre facility will be one of the world's three largest, serving aerospace, Defence, and Advanced Materials."" On Jamnagar refineries, it said the company was ""on course to realising the autonomous refinery"".

At Jamnagar, the firm has set up the world's largest Bioenergy Technology and R&D centre. Here, it is developing advanced enzymes, microbial consortia, and high-yield energy crops to boost biogas productivity.

""We are also realising our Chairman's (Mukesh Ambani) vision of growing energy plantations on wastelands. This includes building the world's first integrated energy hub, combining smart farms, modular CBG and green hydrogen plants, agrivoltaics, and batteries,"" Anant said.

""I am especially proud of our agrivoltaics business, where Compressed Biogas (CBG) and Solar PV are deployed on the same land. By capturing biogenic CO2 from CBG plants, these hubs will become platforms for green chemicals, aiming at fossil parity."" This model creates triple value for Indian farmers -- green gas, green electricity, and higher rural incomes.

The case, registered as DS618, centered on the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), which Indonesia argued discriminated against crude palm oil. The WTO panel sided with Indonesia, and the EU has agreed to amend RED II by February 24, 2026.

“We expect the European Union to respond sensibly and fairly to this ruling. We are optimistic the EU will implement the WTO decision on biodiesel,” said Djatmiko Bris Witjaksono, Director General of International Trade Negotiations, on Thursday, August 28, 2025.

The WTO found that the EU’s reasoning for imposing duties ranging from 8 to 18 percent on Indonesian biodiesel was not supported by sufficient evidence and recommended that the measures be adjusted. Under the ruling, the EU has fifteen months to comply, meaning the duties must be removed by November 22, 2026.

Djatmiko described Indonesia’s win as a signal to its trading partners to act carefully when drafting trade measures related to Indonesian commodities, stressing that all WTO members are obliged to ensure their policies are consistent with international trade rules.

Trade Minister Budi Santoso echoed this view, calling the ruling proof of Indonesia’s consistent compliance with global trade regulations, in contrast to the EU’s accusations. He said the WTO panel dismissed the EU’s claim that Indonesia pushed palm oil producers to sell raw materials at artificially low prices for the benefit of biodiesel companies. It also concluded that Indonesia’s export taxes and levies on palm oil could not be treated as subsidies, and that the European Commission had failed to show any real harm to European biodiesel producers, overlooking other factors that affect the market.

“Onboard Croatia Airlines’ A220, passengers can enjoy high-speed inflight Wi-Fi for the first time in the company’s history.","Playing a strategic role in Croatia’s transportation infrastructure, Croatia Airlines ensures optimal air connectivity across the country and internationally. Croatia Airlines is a full-service carrier that provides domestic and international air passenger and cargo transport services within Europe, as well as providing aircraft maintenance and professional training of aviation personnel.

In 2024, the company’s 35th year of operation, Croatia Airlines embarked on the largest project in its history, a complete fleet renewal with the Airbus A220. The first A220 aircraft was introduced to the fleet in July 2024, followed by the second in December of the same year, with the plan to have 15 new A220 aircraft in the fleet by 2027. During 2025, five new aircraft will be delivered (three have already arrived), five more in 2026, and the final three in 2027.

Davor Misic, Director of Operations and Fleet, joins us to elaborate on how this project will benefit the business and its operations moving forward. “Our fleet renewal project is the biggest project in the history of the company and is a significant step for Croatia’s economy and tourism, pushing boundaries and opening new possibilities,” Davor opens. “This project will facilitate further development, enabling successful and sustainable operations in the future. It also further confirms the position of Croatia Airlines as a strategically important segment of Croatia’s transport and tourism infrastructure.

“We’re constantly aware of the significance of Croatia Airlines for the country and its passengers, and this program will enhance operational efficiency, reduce environmental impact, and improve the overall passenger experience. With each new arrival, we are getting closer to achieving the goals of our post Covid-19 strategy while consistently following our mission and vision.

“Fleet renewal is one of the most complex decisions for any airline, as a wrong choice can lead to severe consequences. It is a strategic decision made for a long-term period of approximately ten-to-15 years and cannot be implemented over a short period of time. However, the Airbus 220 aircraft represent a new generation and are designed as an entirely new product. They offer the best performance in terms of efficiency and noise emissions, as well as premium experience for crew and passengers, thanks to innovative design and state-of-the-art technology. Airbus 220s are designed for the market segment of passenger aircraft with 100-to-150 seats, with a maximum range of up to 6700 kilometers.”

Croatia Airlines sets clear goals for the fleet modernization process, assessing multiple dimensions like increased efficiency, compliance with environmental regulations, simplified technical maintenance procedures, and enhanced passenger comfort. “The A220 features an innovative cabin design focused on comfort, with the widest seats and highest ceiling in its class, increased legroom, a quieter cabin, a wider aisle, more overhead storage space, and large panoramic windows that allow more natural light into the cabin,” Davor explains. “Onboard Croatia Airlines’ A220, passengers can enjoy high-speed inflight Wi-Fi for the first time in the company’s history. Each seat is equipped with USB-A and USB-C ports, a smartphone and tablet holder, and access to wireless digital content, all of which contribute to a more connected and personalized travel experience.

“Beyond fleet renewal, which represents a significant technological leap for us, achieving 25 percent lower fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions, Croatia Airlines has implemented ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 standards for environmental and energy management over recent years. We have started using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on selected flights and plan to replace airport service vehicles with electric alternatives.”

Croatia Airlines has been a member of Star Alliance since 2004, and this partnership remains vital for the company, offering collaboration, strategic advantages in global connectivity, reputation, and innovation. “Our membership of Star Alliance provides access to a global flight network, enhancing Croatia’s connectivity and attracting travellers from around the world,” Davor states. “Being part of the world’s largest airline alliance strengthens our reputation and reinforces our position as a reliable, high-quality carrier. We also partner with the Croatian airline, Trade Air, to ensure availability in markets where the airline does not operate direct flights or to increase capacity on existing routes.”

As our conversation closes, Davor turns to what’s facing Croatia Airlines in the remainder of 2025. “Our key priorities are centered around continuing the successful implementation of our fleet renewal program, with additional Airbus A2200 aircraft set to arrive,” he states. “Training our crew remains a top priority, as we must ensure safe and efficient operations with the new aircraft. We’re also strengthening existing strategic partnerships and exploring new route opportunities within Europe and the Mediterranean as we work to further improve connectivity and support Croatia’s economic growth.

“We’re focusing on further business optimization, fleet modernization, and enhanced competitiveness. Once the fleet renewal is completed, our focus will shift to consolidating the benefits of this investment, ensuring improved operational reliability, cost-efficiency, and environmental performance. Over the next five years, we aim to strengthen our role as Croatia’s national carrier by continuing to provide safe, high-quality, and reliable service, while supporting the country’s connectivity, tourism, and economic development.

“If there’s one final message, it’s that the time has come to visit Croatia. Zagreb, Split, Dubrovnik, Zadar, Pula, Rijeka, and Osijek are available to our passengers all year round,” Davor concludes. “Come and experience our warm hospitality, rich tourist offerings, natural beauty, cultural heritage, and the unique identity of each Croatian region.”",https://tlimagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/08/Croatia-Airlines-133-headline-image.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 02:56:09.107367

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Reward Proposition Spirit Airlines’ post-Chapter 11 restructuring embodies a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario.","Spirit Airlines’ recent Chapter 11 restructuring has positioned it at a crossroads, balancing aggressive debt reduction with existential liquidity risks in a volatile post-pandemic airline sector. The carrier’s March 2025 emergence from bankruptcy—marked by a $795 million debt-to-equity swap and $350 million in new equity—initially signaled a path to stability. However, its Q2 2025 net loss of $246 million and a 53% drop in liquidity to $407.5 million underscore the fragility of its recovery [1]. This analysis evaluates whether Spirit’s strategic restructuring can offset sector-specific headwinds, including fuel volatility, labor shortages, and shifting consumer preferences.

Strategic Restructuring: Debt Reduction and Operational Overhaul

Spirit’s Chapter 11 process focused on three pillars: deleveraging, fleet optimization, and cost restructuring. By converting $795 million in debt to equity and securing $350 million in fresh capital, the airline reduced its debt burden while retaining operational flexibility [2]. However, these measures have proven insufficient to address its $600 million free cash flow deficit for 2025 [3]. To bolster liquidity, Spirit has sold 23 Airbus aircraft and 14 spare engines, generating $449 million and $250 million, respectively [4]. These asset disposals, while necessary, highlight the airline’s reliance on short-term fixes rather than sustainable operational improvements.

Operational adjustments include a 27.7% reduction in flight capacity for Q3 2025 and furloughs of 270 pilots, reflecting a shift toward aligning capacity with “profitable demand” [5]. Yet, critics argue that Spirit’s restructuring lacks ambition, particularly in renegotiating aircraft leases or addressing its bloated cost structure [6]. For instance, its adjusted CASM ex-fuel rose to 8.77 cents in Q2 2025, outpacing the industry average of 7.36 cents in 2024 [7].

Sector-Specific Risks: A Perfect Storm for Low-Cost Carriers

Spirit’s challenges are compounded by broader industry trends. Fuel prices, averaging $87 per barrel in 2025, remain a significant cost driver [8]. Meanwhile, labor shortages—particularly in pilot and maintenance technician roles—threaten operational reliability [9]. Regulatory pressures, such as the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), add further complexity, with SAF priced at 4.2 times conventional jet fuel [10].

The post-pandemic demand landscape also favors premium services over budget travel. Spirit’s pivot to tiered fare classes (Spirit First, Premium Economy, and Value) aims to capture this shift, but its core customer base may resist paying for amenities it historically avoided [11]. This strategic tension mirrors broader industry struggles, as legacy carriers like Delta and Southwest achieve operating margins of 7.55% and 2.17%, respectively, while Spirit’s Q2 2025 margin hit -18% [12].

Liquidity Crisis and the Path Forward

Spirit’s liquidity position remains precarious. With $2.689 billion in debt and $1.1 billion in long-term repayments due in 2025, the airline has maxed out its $275 million revolving credit facility and secured a card-processing agreement that allows U.S. Bank to hold up to $3 million daily in collateral [13]. These measures, while stabilizing for now, signal a high-risk reliance on external financing.

The airline’s survival hinges on three factors:

1. Successful execution of cost-cutting measures, including further capacity reductions and lease renegotiations.

2. Securing additional equity or debt financing to bridge its liquidity gap.

3. Adapting its value proposition to retain budget travelers while monetizing premium demand [14].

However, the likelihood of another bankruptcy filing looms large. Aircraft lessors have already begun assessing interest in remarketing Spirit’s fleet, and management has warned of “substantial doubt” regarding the airline’s ability to continue as a going concern [15].

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Reward Proposition

Spirit Airlines’ post-Chapter 11 restructuring embodies a classic high-risk, high-reward scenario. While its aggressive deleveraging and operational overhauls provide a foundation for recovery, the airline’s liquidity crisis and structural challenges in the low-cost model pose existential threats. For investors, the key question is whether Spirit can execute its transformation without further bankruptcies—a feat that would require both operational discipline and favorable market conditions. In a sector where peers like Delta and Southwest enjoy robust margins, Spirit’s path to profitability remains fraught with uncertainty.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-30 05:56:22.737073

((Beijing Institute of Technology Press Co., Ltd/EurekAlert!) As the world grapples with climate change and dwindling fossil fuel reserves, biodiesel emerges as a promising renewable alternative to conventional diesel. However, the journey toward sustainable biodiesel production faces significant hurdles, particularly in selecting the right feedstocks that don't compete with food supplies. A groundbreaking comprehensive review reveals how artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning technologies are revolutionizing this field, offering unprecedented solutions to longstanding challenges.

Traditional biodiesel production relies heavily on edible crops like soybean, palm oil, and rapeseed – creating a problematic ""food versus fuel"" competition. With fossil fuels still accounting for 88% of global energy consumption, the urgency to develop sustainable alternatives has never been greater. Second-generation biodiesel, derived from non-edible sources such as algae and jatropha, presents an attractive solution but faces obstacles including high production costs and limited commercial viability. This is where deep learning enters the picture, offering a transformative approach to feedstock selection and production optimization.

The research demonstrates remarkable achievements through deep learning applications. ANNs have shown superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional statistical methods, with some models achieving R² values exceeding 90% in predicting crucial biodiesel properties like kinematic viscosity and cetane numbers. These neural networks excel at analyzing complex relationships between feedstock characteristics, production parameters, and environmental factors, enabling rapid assessment of diverse feedstock options without extensive experimental testing.

Particularly impressive are the results from hybrid deep learning models that combine generative and discriminative approaches. For instance, researchers using genetic algorithm-based support vector machines (GA-SVM) successfully optimized biodiesel production from waste cooking oil, while others achieved significant yield improvements by integrating ANNs with response surface methodology (RSM). These advances translate to substantial time and cost savings – critical factors for commercial viability.

The integration of deep learning with Internet of Things (IoT) technology promises to revolutionize biofuel production further. Real-time monitoring and optimization through IoT sensors combined with predictive modeling enable unprecedented control over production processes. This synergy allows manufacturers to adapt quickly to varying feedstock qualities and market demands while maintaining optimal efficiency.

Future applications include developing comprehensive ANN models applicable across diverse engine types and fuel variations, enhancing transferability between different geographical regions and feedstock types. The potential for multi-omics integration and advanced data augmentation techniques will address current limitations in dataset size and model generalization, opening doors to previously unexplored feedstock sources.

This comprehensive review underscores deep learning's pivotal role in accelerating biodiesel development as a sustainable fuel alternative. By dramatically reducing the time and resources needed for feedstock evaluation and process optimization, ANNs are breaking down barriers that have long hindered biodiesel's commercial expansion. The technology's ability to uncover hidden correlations within complex datasets not only advances scientific understanding but also paves the way for more efficient, environmentally friendly fuel production.

As we stand at the intersection of artificial intelligence and renewable energy, the innovative application of deep learning in biodiesel production represents more than technological advancement – it embodies our commitment to a sustainable future where renewable fuels can effectively compete with and eventually replace fossil fuels.

Speaking at the company’s annual general meeting for the first time, Anant Ambani, Executive Director and son of Chairman Mukesh Ambani, laid out the company’s vision to create one of the world’s most integrated renewable energy ecosystems — spanning solar modules, batteries, electrolysers, and green fuels like ammonia and methanol.

Reliance is investing in the entire clean energy value chain: from producing solar modules and energy storage systems to building electrolysers that use renewable electricity to generate hydrogen — seen as a key fuel for the future. The company also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel and biofuels from organic waste for both domestic use and export.

“We are building platforms to deliver a comprehensive clean energy ecosystem — solar, battery storage, hydrogen — all at scale and under one umbrella,” said Anant Ambani. The products manufactured at these giga factories will support 24/7 renewable electricity supply and help produce green chemicals including green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuels.

Jamnagar, already home to Reliance’s twin oil refineries — the world’s largest refining complex — is being transformed into the base for the company’s renewable energy ambitions. Construction of the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is progressing rapidly and is expected to become the world’s largest clean energy hub in terms of scale and integration.

“Jamnagar will represent both the legacy of conventional energy and the future of new energy,” Mr Ambani said. Reliance has already begun producing solar photovoltaic modules at its Jamnagar facility. The company aims to scale up to a capacity of 20 GWp in the coming quarters, making it the largest single-site solar manufacturing facility in the world.

So far, it has successfully produced its first 200 MW of heterojunction (HJT) modules, which offer better performance and durability compared to conventional modules.

Alongside solar, the company is also building battery and electrolyser giga factories. The battery facility, scheduled to open in 2026, will start with an annual capacity of 40 GWh and expand to 100 GWh in phases. The electrolyser plant, also set to be operational by the end of 2026, will have the ability to scale up to 3 GW annually — supporting cost-effective hydrogen production on a global scale.

In Kutch, Gujarat, Reliance is developing one of the largest single-site solar projects in the world, covering 550,000 acres of arid land. At full pace, the site will deploy 55 MW of solar modules and 150 MWh of battery containers every day. Once complete, it could supply nearly 10% of India’s electricity demand within the next decade.

The company’s logistics and port infrastructure in Jamnagar and Kandla will support export operations for green hydrogen derivatives such as ammonia and methanol.

“India can become a global leader in affordable green hydrogen and its derivatives,” said Ambani, noting that the initial phase of production will serve the company’s own needs before scaling to 3 million tonnes per year by 2032.

Reliance is also focusing on bioenergy. It is building compressed biogas (CBG) plants with a target capacity of 0.5 million tonnes per year, aiming to scale to over 500 plants by 2030.

To support this, the company has set up the world’s largest Bioenergy Technology and R&D Centre in Jamnagar, where it is developing advanced technologies to increase biogas yields, including enzymes, microbes, and high-efficiency energy crops.

As part of its broader clean energy strategy, Reliance is also launching integrated energy hubs that combine smart farming, biogas and hydrogen production, agrivoltaics (dual land use for agriculture and solar power), and battery storage. These hubs aim to capture CO2 from CBG plants for green chemical production, targeting cost parity with fossil fuels.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Anant-Ambani-Executive-Director.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 21:56:19.765130

As of 2025, Spirit operates 146 aircraft under operating leases with terms expiring between 2026 and 2043.
These leases account for $7.66 billion of its $14.729 billion in total future contractual obligations [3].
For contrarian investors, the allure of a potential rebound is undeniable, but the risks of a second bankruptcy filing—and the associated losses—remain formidable.","Spirit Airlines’ second Chapter 11 filing in less than a year underscores a liquidity crisis that has spiraled beyond even the most pessimistic projections. Emerging from bankruptcy in March 2025 with a $795 million debt-to-equity swap and $350 million in new capital, the airline initially appeared to stabilize its finances. Yet, by Q2 2025, it reported a staggering $246 million net loss, with liquidity reserves plummeting to $407.5 million—a 53% drop from Q1 2025 [2]. This collapse has forced the airline to confront a $600 million free cash flow deficit for the year and a debt burden of $2.689 billion, including $1.1 billion in repayments due in 2025 alone [4].

The airline’s lease obligations, a critical but underappreciated component of its financial strain, further complicate its path to recovery. As of 2025, Spirit operates 146 aircraft under operating leases with terms expiring between 2026 and 2043. These leases account for $7.66 billion of its $14.729 billion in total future contractual obligations [3]. Despite its recent restructuring, the airline failed to renegotiate these leases during its first Chapter 11 filing, a missed opportunity that has left it saddled with high leasing costs and an aging fleet of Airbus A320s [1]. This oversight has exacerbated its operational inefficiencies, with adjusted cost per available seat mile (CASM) ex-fuel rising to 8.77 cents in Q2 2025—well above the industry average of 7.36 cents [2].

The airline’s survival strategy hinges on aggressive cost-cutting and asset sales. It has sold 23 Airbus aircraft and 14 spare engines for $449 million and $250 million, respectively, while reducing Q3 2025 flight capacity by 27.7% to align with profitable demand [2]. However, these measures come at a cost: furloughing 270 pilots and grounding aircraft due to Pratt & Whitney engine issues have eroded operational flexibility and customer trust [4]. Meanwhile, its revolving credit facility—a $275 million lifeline—has been fully drawn, and its credit card processor is demanding additional collateral to renew its agreement [5].

For contrarian investors, the question is whether these steps can catalyze a sustainable turnaround. The airline’s restructuring aims to generate “hundreds of millions of dollars in annual operating savings” by rightsizing its fleet and redesigning its network [1]. Yet, the feasibility of this plan is clouded by external headwinds. Fuel prices remain elevated at $87 per barrel, and the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel—priced 4.2 times higher than conventional jet fuel—threatens to further strain its low-cost model [2]. Additionally, Spirit’s pivot to tiered fare classes (Spirit First, Premium Economy, and Value) may not offset the reputational damage from its cost-cutting measures [2].

The valuation risks for investors are stark. Spirit’s credit rating has been downgraded to CCC- by Fitch and Caa3 by Moody’s, reflecting its weak liquidity and high debt burden [5]. Its parent company, Spirit Aviation Holdings, has issued a “substantial doubt” warning about its ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months [3]. While the airline’s Chapter 11 filing in August 2025 provides a legal framework to renegotiate leases and reduce debt, the absence of a clear path to profitability—particularly in a market dominated by more efficient rivals—makes this a high-stakes gamble.

In the end, Spirit’s story is one of desperation and incrementalism. Its restructuring efforts, while necessary, lack the transformative vision required to compete in a post-pandemic aviation landscape. For contrarian investors, the allure of a potential rebound is undeniable, but the risks of a second bankruptcy filing—and the associated losses—remain formidable. As the airline navigates its latest crisis, the question is not whether it can survive, but whether it can thrive in an industry that has already moved on.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-29 21:56:28.290950

In 2024, Brazil launched its National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) to promote SAF adoption in its energy mix.
The NCGA says this naturally favors Brazil’s double-cropping of soybeans and corn while devaluing the lifecycle profile of the U.S. single-crop corn system.
The U.S. State Department objected, claiming the recommendation would “unfairly penalize” American farmers to Brazil’s benefit in global markets.
President Trump has already cut tax incentives for renewable energy and limited SAF benefits exclusively to producers and feedstocks from North America, where SAF is primarily made from corn ethanol.","The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) will hold a public hearing next Wednesday at the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington as part of its ongoing investigation into whether Brazil’s actions, policies, and practices are unjustifiable or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.

The Section 301 investigation—under which the U.S. can impose trade sanctions on foreign partners—may conclude within six months to a year, aligning with Brazil’s 2026 election calendar. In Brazil, government officials are convinced that tensions with the U.S. will persist through next year and could escalate further.

Some American business groups are using the investigation to increase pressure on Brazil. The American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), for instance, urged the Trump administration to intervene in a deal in which Anglo American is selling its nickel operations in Brazil to Chinese miner MMG, arguing the transaction would give China even greater control over global reserves of critical minerals.

Meanwhile, the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) is urging the USTR not only to demand compensation from Brazil for alleged losses in U.S. ethanol exports, but also to take aim at another perceived threat: Brazil’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) program.

Ethanol has become a major topic for Donald Trump when discussing trade with Brazil and holds significant political importance for Republicans. When President Trump issued his executive order to prepare retaliation tariffs at the start of his administration, Brazil was the first country mentioned, and ethanol was the first product.

U.S. corn producers broadly argue that Brazil’s rapid agricultural expansion in recent years has been “partly driven by protectionist advantages and decades of neglect regarding deforestation” in the Amazon and the Cerrado, enabling Brazil to seize market share from American farmers.

Additionally, they view Brazil as a “serious threat” to the long-term competitiveness of U.S. exports in the emerging SAF market, which is seen as key to the global aviation industry’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Brazil is viewed as a major potential supplier of the renewable fuel, which can be produced through various technologies.

In 2024, Brazil launched its National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) to promote SAF adoption in its energy mix. Airlines are required to increase SAF use by 1 percentage point annually until reaching 10% in 2036.

One complaint is that Brazil uses a carbon-neutral emissions model that assigns a premium to the lifecycle assessment of feedstocks from multiple crop cycles (main and second harvest) grown on formerly “degraded” pastureland. The NCGA says this naturally favors Brazil’s double-cropping of soybeans and corn while devaluing the lifecycle profile of the U.S. single-crop corn system.

The NCGA raises concerns that Brazil has emerged as a central player in international standard-setting bodies for biofuels, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

As an example, they noted that earlier this year, ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) approved a recommendation on multi-cropping based on the Brazilian model. The U.S. State Department objected, claiming the recommendation would “unfairly penalize” American farmers to Brazil’s benefit in global markets.

U.S. producers fear that as international bodies and foreign markets, such as Japan and the European Union, begin to accept Brazil’s sustainability claims related to its multi-cropping systems, U.S. export competitiveness could be severely impacted. They warn of potential declines in the commercial value of American agricultural production and farmland, lost export revenue, reduced profits, and higher financing costs and risks for U.S. farmers and ethanol producers.

“That’s why the U.S. State Department raised objections with ICAO,” NCGA said. “The USTR should join the State Department’s efforts to address Brazil’s troubling influence in these international markets.”

The NCGA is proposing the creation of a U.S.-Brazil working group 90 days after the USTR’s investigation, aimed specifically at addressing emissions modeling in international forums. The goal would be to “eliminate the unjust and scientifically unfounded burden that Brazil’s model imposes on the competitiveness of U.S. exports.”

It also called on the USTR to work with government counterparts to ban the use of Brazilian ethanol in the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program until U.S. producers gain reciprocal access to Brazil’s RenovaBio program.

The sustainable fuel market has significant potential.
Overcoming these barriers will require coordinated action across the sustainable fuel lifecycle.
The Question of Cost: Financing the Future of Sustainable Fuel The value of sustainable fuel is clear: It delivers cleaner combustion and higher energy density than its fossil equivalent.
However, the price differential between conventional and sustainable fuel in marine1 and aviation2 can be significant.","The race to net zero is on — and sustainable fuel has a critical role to play. With emission targets tightening, aviation and marine organizations are under pressure to reduce fossil fuel reliance, comply with evolving regulations and deliver on ambitious sustainability goals.

The sustainable fuel market has significant potential. Yet the technology and infrastructure required to scale cleaner fuel is in early development and vulnerable to fluctuations in government support. For producers and innovators, securing investment amid regulatory uncertainty is a persistent challenge.

Overcoming these barriers will require coordinated action across the sustainable fuel lifecycle. Insurance and risk solutions are key in this transition. By de-risking investment, protecting against volatility and enabling confidence in long-term planning, they can help unlock the capital and collaboration needed to move forward.

To explore how these challenges play out in practice and what’s needed to overcome them, Aon spoke with two leaders at the forefront of sustainable fuel innovation: Kwame Bekoe, CEO of AfriSAF, and Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet. Their insights offer a real-world view into the barriers facing producers and the opportunities that lie ahead.

At the Source: Upstream Challenges in the Feedstock Industry

The foundation of sustainable fuel’s success lies upstream in the sourcing of feedstock, where risks and opportunities are tightly interwoven. Feedstock refers to the raw biological materials, such as agricultural waste, used cooking oil or energy crops, that are converted into sustainable fuel.

Land use disputes, volatility in feedstock prices and fragmentation in the feedstock supply chain are just some of the challenges facing this industry. Yet innovators like Kwame Bekoe, CEO of AfriSAF, have a keen sense of its potential. His company connects feedstock owners in Africa and buyers via a digital marketplace, reducing agricultural waste, generating new income streams for local farmers and supplying the key ingredient for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

AfriSAF’s ambitions extend beyond aggregation. Plans are underway to build production facilities and export sustainable fuels to global markets. Buy-in from investors and insurers will be essential for these plans to become reality.

One of the biggest problems has been insufficient data. “The smallhold farmers we work with are unbanked and operate in an informal sector,” explains Bekoe. “By integrating these farmers into the formal sector and leveraging satellite, drone and AI-driven data, we can help de-risk agricultural operations and reduce insurance premiums.”

De-Risking the Roots: Insuring Feedstock Resilience

Backed by data, solutions like crop insurance and parametric cover can help stabilize income for smallholders, unlock capital and strengthen resilience across the feedstock supply chain — supporting a more investable and scalable starting point for sustainable fuel.

The Question of Cost: Financing the Future of Sustainable Fuel

The value of sustainable fuel is clear: It delivers cleaner combustion and higher energy density than its fossil equivalent. Its benefits extend beyond marine and aviation as organizations across sectors purchase the Scope 3 reductions as part of their own offsetting measures.

However, the price differential between conventional and sustainable fuel in marine1 and aviation2 can be significant. Subsidies, compliance costs, carbon pricing and private sector investment all play a role, but stakeholders face risk in terms of future revenue certainty and asset depreciation.

Scaling to the level required comes at a cost. “Capital is needed at every stage of development to support sustainable fuel infrastructure,” says Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet, a company that successfully pioneers alcohol-to-jet technology, transforming ethanol into SAF and renewable diesel.

While eight different technology platforms are certified for SAF production, many remain commercially immature. The steady flow of capital needed to advance these technologies is often inconsistent.

Funds like Breakthrough Energy have provided a blueprint for how risk-tolerant capital can accelerate clean energy innovation. But more investment channels must open.

“Some stakeholders will want projects to be fully de-risked before they deploy their capital, but in a new industry, you need investors that are willing to take more of a risk,” explains Samartzis. “We haven’t seen that balance yet, which is why companies like ours have taken on strategic investors who have a longer-term view and other motives for being in the industry.”

Insurance as a Bridge to Innovation Investment

By providing coverage for first-of-its-kind technologies and helping to stabilize risk profiles, insurers can enable early-stage investment and support commercialization. “There’s a real opportunity for the insurance industry to better understand what we’re building and to see the long-term upside,” Samartzis adds.

Shifting Regulations Fuel Uncertainty

Policy frameworks governing emissions, fuel standards and reporting are evolving across regions.

Government mandates and incentive schemes can be effective in encouraging adoption. In its early stages, LanzaJet partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy to receive funding that helped progress its technology. Today, the Ghana-based AfriSAF benefits from government policies designed to increase biofuel use.

Delays, inconsistencies and policy changes can, however, hamper planning — particularly for multinational operators spanning multiple jurisdictions. Weak enforcement mechanisms can undermine investor confidence in expected long-term returns.

For example, at the global level, the International Civil Aviation Organization has set a 5% reduction target for CO2 emissions by 2030,3 while the International Maritime Organization is aiming for net-zero emissions by or around 2050.4 However, regional policy remains fragmented and fragile. Incentives introduced by one administration can be rolled back by the next.

To counter this, governments must design frameworks that are not only ambitious, but also durable. They should:

Establish clear incentives to guide stakeholders toward desired outcomes.

Set enforceable milestones to ensure consistent progress and accountability.

Implement meaningful consequences for inaction to maintain momentum.

Negotiate robust contractual structures that include appropriate penalty and break clauses, offering certainty in case of changes to government policy or regulatory approaches.

Policy Shifts and Protection: Insurance for Regulatory Risk

Insurance can be pivotal in reinforcing confidence. By offering protection against policy-related disruptions or delays, insurers can help stabilize investment conditions and support the long-term development of sustainable fuel infrastructure. As the industry matures, insurance solutions that address regulatory uncertainty will be essential to maintaining momentum.

Insuring a Sustainable Future: From Insight to Action

Working toward universal sustainability will require collaboration among key industry stakeholders, including those producing and buying sustainable fuel. Governmental bodies and investors supporting the progress of the burgeoning industry will also be crucial.

Risk managers and insurance buyers need a new playbook — one that integrates risk insights into commercial and sustainability strategies from the outset. Insurance can be a key enabler throughout the sustainable fuel lifecycle. From crop insurance that supports upstream resilience, to risk transfer solutions that help fuel producers secure funding and coverage that empowers transport operators to adopt new technologies — the right insurance strategy can accelerate progress at every stage. Early engagement with expert insurance and risk advisors can tangibly improve project feasibility, stakeholder alignment and long-term value, turning today’s uncertainty into tomorrow’s competitive edge.

Among the signatories of the Declaration led by IICA are the Latin American Civil Aviation Commission (LACAC), the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) and the Pan American Liquid Biofuels Coalition (CPBIO).

IICA, as an international organization specializing in agricultural and rural development in the Americas, and CPBIO, created by IICA in 2023 and comprised of the main biofuel producers’ associations and their value chains, acknowledge the transformative potential of sustainable agriculture in supplying feedstocks for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The two entities promote the sustainable development of liquid biofuels as a key tool for decarbonizing the transport sector, and have identified SAF as one of the main strategic opportunities to integrate agricultural and energy value chains and the regional aviation sector.

The aviation sector is facing the urgent challenge of reducing net carbon dioxide emissions from its operations, in accordance with the Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) at its Forty-first Assembly, which establishes net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 as a global target.

Across the Americas, there is recognition of the fact that SAF, complemented by technological and operational improvements and carbon offsets, affords a strategic means for achieving the decarbonization goals established by the international community.

The harmonized positions in favor of SAF development, regulation and implementation in Latin America and the Caribbean have been adopted within the framework of LACAC’s mandate to promote regulatory harmonization and technical cooperation among countries in the region, as set forth in Resolution A24-03, which urges the establishment of public policies to incentivize SAF production and use, in keeping with the sustainability criteria adopted by the ICAO Council.

The Joint Declaration announced in Rosario by IICA, CPBIO, LACAC, IATA, ALTA, and OLADE presents a roadmap for coordinated regional action in relation to SAF, with special emphasis on capacity building, infrastructure development, regulatory frameworks and financial mechanisms.

Five points to foster SAF development in the Americas

Following an almost year-long debate process, the aforementioned signatories agreed on the content of the Fourth CPBIO Declaration, which focuses on SAF and consists of five key points:

First, to support and encourage Member States to adopt, develop, and strengthen harmonized regulatory frameworks in accordance with ICAO and LACAC guidelines, to facilitate the establishment of a robust, transparent and competitive SAF market, including certification mechanisms grounded in science, mutual recognition of standards, and technology neutrality.

Second, to support the design and implementation of national and intergovernmental public policies aimed at fostering sustainable SAF production and use, including fiscal incentives, concessional financing, risk mitigation mechanisms for infrastructure investments, subsidy schemes and differentiated pricing.

Third, to reaffirm the need to build sustainable value chains that integrate the agriculture sector, biofuel industry and aviation sector, while also ensuring the supply of certified feedstock, upholding social and environmental justice principles, and strengthening rural economies across the region.

Fourth, to acknowledge the urgent need to mobilize financial resources through the establishment of a multilateral fund for SAF capacity building and production, with the involvement of multilateral credit institutions, regional development banks, international climate funds and public-private partnerships.

Lastly, to commit to fostering close collaboration among the signatories of this Declaration and other relevant national, regional and international organizations in the development of roadmaps for SAF production and use, as well as in the collection of data, assessment of feedstock potential, impact analysis, and technical support for policy formulation.

The signatories reaffirm that SAF development, through inter-governmental cooperation and collaboration, affords a strategic opportunity to simultaneously advance the environmental sustainability goals of the aviation sector and the productive transformation of the agriculture and energy sectors.

Both IICA and CPBIO consider that cooperation and collaboration among governments, producers and the private sector will be key to facilitating a smooth, equitable and effective transition towards a net-zero carbon future for air transportation in the Americas.

According to Agustín Torroba, IICA Biofuel Specialist and Executive Secretary of CPBIO, SAF are the aviation sector’s best bet for meeting its climate commitments.

“The agriculture and aviation sectors will be key strategic partners in the production of SAF, especially in the Americas, enabling our region to become a global hub for SAF production”, he concluded.

St1 Nordic -konsernin vuoden 2025 ensimmäisen vuosipuoliskon liikevaihto oli 3,5 miljardia euroa, joka on noin 0,6 miljardia euroa vähemmän kuin edellisvuonna vastaavaan aikaan. Liikevaihdon pieneneminen johtui öljytuotteiden matalammasta hintatasosta sekä Göteborgin öljynjalostamollamme tehdystä osittaisesta huoltoseisokista. Vähittäismyyntimarkkinalla volyymit laskivat hiukan, kun taas laivaliikenteen polttoaineiden volyymit kasvoivat merkittävästi. Liikevaihdon maakohtainen jakauma säilyi aiempien vuosien kaltaisena, ja 20 % liikevaihdosta tuli Suomesta, 52 % Ruotsista, 27 % Norjasta ja vajaa 1 % Iso-Britanniasta.

Liikevoitto jäi -5,3 miljoonaan euroon, joka oli 153,7 miljoonaa euroa vähemmän kuin edellisvuonna. Tulos verojen jälkeen oli -3,4 miljoonaa euroa, kun edellisvuoden tulos oli 116,4 miljoonaa euroa. Jalostusmarginaali toteutui huomattavasti viime vuotta alhaisempana johtuen pääasiassa markkinatilanteesta mutta myös osittaisesta huoltoseisokista öljynjalostamollamme. Varasto- ja arvostuserät vaikuttivat tulokseen negatiivisesti tämän vuoden ensimmäisellä puoliskolla, kun vaikutus oli positiivinen vertailukaudella. Uusiutuvan dieselin ja lentopolttoaineen markkinoilla oli alkuvuonna ylitarjontaa. Näkymät eri markkinoilla ovat loppuvuodelle huomattavasti positiivisemmat.

Liiketoiminnan rahavirta oli 137,4 miljoonaa euroa. Investoinnit olivat yhteensä 117,3 miljoonaa euroa. Suurimmat investoinnit kohdistuivat jalostamomme osittaiseen huoltoseisokkiin, Shell-brändätyn asemaverkostomme muuttamiseen St1-brändiin St1:n yhden brändin strategian mukaisesti sekä uusiin sähkölatauspisteisiin verkostossamme. Lisäksi St1 sijoitti fuusioenergiaa kehittävään Novatron Fusion Groupiin.

Konsernin oma pääoma oli kauden lopussa vahva, 1369,0 miljoonaa euroa, ja omavaraisuusaste 54,9. St1 Nordic Oy:n yhtiökokous valtuutti hallituksen hankkimaan yhtiön omia osakkeita ja hallitus päätti hankkia tarjotut 219 420 osaketta.

Henrikki Talvitie, St1 Nordic Oy:n toimitusjohtaja:

Vuoden ensimmäisellä puoliskolla jatkoimme merkittävien energiasiirtymähankkeidemme edistämistä, mukaan lukien siirtymäinvestoinnit Göteborgin öljynjalostamollamme sekä Biorefinery Östrand -hankkeeseen Ruotsissa. Jälkimmäinen on merkittävin vähäpäästöisten polttoaineiden kehityshankkeemme, joka on käynnistetty yhteistyössä SCA:n kanssa. Jatkoimme myös energiasiirtymän tiekarttamme kehittämistä, minkä ensisijaisena tavoitteena on kasvattaa vähäpäästöisten energiamuotojen portfoliotamme.

Investoinnit pohjoismaiseen asemaverkostoomme

Yhden brändin strategiamme siirtyi toteutusvaiheeseen huhtikuussa, kun aloitimme vähittäismyyntitoimintojemme yhdistämisen St1-brändin alle Pohjoismaissa. St1:n yhden brändin strategia sisältää noin 630 Shell-brändätyn asemamme uudelleenbrändäyksen St1-asemiksi. Vuoden loppuun mennessä kaikki 1 250 St1-asemaamme muodostavat yhtenäisen pohjoismaisen energian jakeluverkoston. Investointi tukee energiasiirtymätiekarttaamme ja vahvistaa kykyämme tuoda asiakkaillemme yhä enemmän vähäpäästöisempiä energiatuotteita.

Vuoden ensimmäisellä puoliskolla jatkoimme sähköautojen latauksen ja biokaasun jakelun laajentamista. Avasimme 36 uutta sähköautojen latauspistettä, ja latausmahdollisuus on nyt tarjolla jo 175 asemallamme Suomessa, Norjassa ja Ruotsissa. Vahvistimme nesteytetyn biokaasun (LBG) jakeluverkostoamme 4 uudella asemalla Suomessa ja Ruotsissa. Ensimmäinen ensisijaisesti sähköautoilijoita palveleva energia-asemamme avattiin Oslossa, Norjassa – tarjoten sähköautojen latausta, autopesun ja myymälän.

Vähäpäästöisen energiaportfoliomme vahvistaminen

Helmikuussa solmimme strategisen, pitkäaikaisen kumppanuuden Novatron Fusion Groupin (NFG) kanssa kaupallisen fuusioenergian kehityksen vauhdittamiseksi. Yhteistyön tavoitteena on vähentää yhteiskunnan riippuvuutta fossiilisista polttoaineista ja vastata tulevaisuuden energiatarpeisiin. St1 toimii pääsijoittajana ja uutena hallituksen jäsenenä sijoitettuaan 13 miljoonaa euroa NFG:hen, tarjoten pitkäaikaista arvoa sekä liiketoiminta-, teollisuus- ja regulaatio-osaamista.

Ensimmäinen aurinkopuistomme Risholmenissa, Göteborgissa, alkoi tuottaa sähköä verkkoon kesäkuussa. Puistossa on 15 777 aurinkopaneelia, ja se tuottaa arviolta 8,5 GWh vuodessa, mikä vastaa noin 3 500 kotitalouden sähkönkulutusta.

Energiasiirtymä on edelleen tärkein vastuullisuusteemamme. Vastuullisen kasvun edistämiseksi luotamme tieteeseen, datalähtöiseen johtamiseen, ketteryyteen ja kustannustehokkuuteen keskeisinä mahdollistajina. Jatkamme investointeja ja osaamisemme vahvistamista tällä alueella.

Recently, the company announced record second-quarter earnings and raised its revenue forecast for fiscal 2026. AI systems are now key to its growth and climate goals.

Dell’s AI Servers Drive a Big Revenue Jump

In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, Dell saw rapid growth in its AI sector. Revenue reached a record $29.8 billion, up 19% from last year. Operating income rose to $1.8 billion, a 27% increase. Earnings per share jumped 38% to $1.70, with adjusted EPS hitting a record $2.32.

The standout? AI servers. Built on NVIDIA chips, these systems drove a 44% revenue increase in Dell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group. Sales of servers and networking soared 69% to $12.9 billion. The company shipped $8.2 billion in AI systems, secured $5.6 billion in new orders, and ended the quarter with an $11.7 billion backlog.

This momentum led Dell to raise its AI server sales outlook to $20 billion for fiscal 2026, a 33% increase. The total expected annual revenue is now between $105 billion and $ 109 billion, a 12% increase from last year.

PCs Lag as Enterprise Demand Surges

While AI boosted Dell’s growth, the PC segment lagged. Sales grew only 1%, mainly due to corporate upgrades as support for Windows 10 ends in October. This weak outlook impacted Dell’s near-term forecast, with Q3 EPS projected at $2.45, which fell short of Wall Street’s expectations. Shares dropped nearly 5% after hours.

Even so, a clear trend is emerging. PCs may grow slowly, but enterprise spending on AI and cloud infrastructure is reshaping Dell’s growth story.

The Sustainability Thread in Dell’s Growth

Dell is aligning its growth with climate goals. The company uses circular economy principles in its supply chain and customer relationships. It aims to reduce waste, enhance resource efficiency, and cut emissions throughout its product lifecycle.

Dell has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across its value chain. Its 2030 goals focus on energy efficiency, renewable power, and responsible sourcing. This shows Dell’s belief that technology can help drive a low-carbon economy.

Tackling Energy and Emissions

Its sustainability report says that Dell targets Scope 1 emissions, including fuel use from corporate jets and vehicles. The company plans to switch to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and work with providers to expand access.

For its fleet, Dell is optimizing vehicle types and numbers while adding more electric options. Electrifying its fleet may raise electricity demand (and Scope 2 emissions), but Dell is balancing this by speeding up its renewable energy transition.

Like many tech firms, Dell’s Scope 2 emissions—from purchased electricity—make up most of its footprint. To address this, Dell invests in renewable power through virtual power purchase agreements (vPPAs), joint PPAs, and renewable energy credits. It is also exploring new on-site solar projects to lessen grid reliance.

It is making significant efficiency improvements in its labs and data centers, where much electricity is consumed. These sites power the servers driving AI growth, making energy efficiency vital for operations and climate goals.

Dell is also tackling Scope 3 emissions throughout its value chain, focusing on two areas: purchased goods and customer product use. Separate targets address both areas.

As it moves toward its 2030 goals, other Scope 3 categories will account for a larger share of emissions. While Categories 1 and 11 are priorities, Dell monitors all Scope 3 sources for meaningful reductions.

The Role of Carbon Credits in Dell’s Net Zero Goals

Dell knows some emissions will remain, even with aggressive decarbonization. The company plans to offset no more than 10% of its baseline emissions with carbon removals, following best practices from the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM).

Currently, Dell is not engaging in large-scale carbon removals, focusing instead on its near-term 2030 decarbonization efforts. As technologies improve, Dell plans to acquire high-quality credits and removals to meet its net-zero target.

Building a Just Transition

Dell insists that the move to net zero must be fair. The company commits to sourcing renewable power only from projects that do not harm underserved communities. It integrates social responsibility into its supplier code, ensuring human rights and fair labor practices.

As a founding member of the Responsible Business Alliance, Dell requires suppliers to commit to decarbonization and respect for vulnerable workers. This involvement ensures its climate ambitions reach throughout its value chain.

Climate Resilience Through Digital Access

Dell views technology access as crucial for climate resilience. Its Solar Community Hub program offers solar-powered internet and computer access to underserved communities worldwide. By promoting digital inclusion, Dell aims to impact one billion lives by 2030, broadening the benefits of the clean energy transition.

Investors Ask: What’s Next?

With its stock outperforming the market this year, investors wonder about Dell’s next steps. According to experts, the answer likely lies in two areas:

Earnings trajectory – Analysts will watch if Dell can sustain its AI-driven growth amid weaker PC demand and margin pressures.

Sustainability execution – Stakeholders want Dell to show that its booming AI server business can grow without sacrificing climate commitments.

Dell’s guidance of $105–109 billion in annual revenue and $20 billion in AI server sales reflects confidence in growth and demand. Its detailed climate strategy indicates that Dell recognizes investors and customers want progress on emissions, not just profits.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2313072843.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 13:56:26.488947

The Ground Vibration Test procedure

Deutsche Aircraft stated that the achievement is a significant step forward in the Uplift programme, which is funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. The initiative is to accelerate the maturation of new technologies for sustainable aviation, which will boost the German innovative and economic value.

Ground vibration test is a procedure in aircraft development that determines the aircraft’s modal properties, including its natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios. According to the German aircraft manufacturer, ground vibration testing is essential information for validating structural dynamics and the refinement of numerical models used in flutter analysis and loads calculation.

During the test, the D328 Uplift was suspended with controlled air springs, and electrodynamic shakers were used on the structure, with 237 acceleration sensors capturing the dynamic response of the aircraft. The test period lasted over two weeks, and excitation occurred at more than 20 locations. The test outcome included three aircraft configurations, 45 hours of excitation time, and 50 distinct eigenforms identified.

Deutsche Aircraft gave thanks to the teams involved in the test, especially its partners at DLR. The company stated that the successful completion of the test marks a powerful demonstration of the possibilities when industry and applied research are in sync.

President Trump’s ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ Puts Oklahoma Agriculture First

By Senator Markwayne Mullin

“As a lifelong cow-calf rancher, I know firsthand the difficulties our farmers and ranchers face every day. Burdensome regulations, disease, recent natural disasters, and growing costs are just some of the challenges posed to farmers across the country. Agriculture is a way of life in Oklahoma and I’m proud to represent generations of family farms and ranches that work tirelessly to feed, fuel, and clothe our great nation.

With President Trump back in the White House and Secretary Brooke Rollins leading the way at the Department of Agriculture, America’s farmers and ranchers are receiving unprecedented levels of support. Signed into law in July, the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ secured huge wins for the Ag community and jumpstarted the support needed for our farms and ranches to thrive. The OBBB strengthens the farm safety net and provides longer-term certainty for farmers and ranchers.

For starters, we are making crop insurance more affordable for producers by redefining USDA’s experience threshold definition from five to ten years and extending coverage through 2031, allowing more producers to qualify for assistance over a longer period of time. The community will also see an extension of the 45Z clean transportation fuel production credit for Oklahoma feedstock and sustainable aviation fuel producers through 2029.

The OBBB also invests $60 million in scholarship support for students at 1890 land-grant universities serving historically black universities, including our very own Langston University in Oklahoma.

In recent years, disease has hit the Ag community hard. This bill provides $233 million annually, starting in 2026, to the National Animal Disease Preparedness, Detection, and Vaccine Bank Programs to protect cattle health in Oklahoma and across the nation from foreign animal disease outbreaks.

With the OBBB also codifying the Small Business tax deduction, farmers will save more of their hard-earned money by being able to deduct 20% of their business income. I am also proud to say that we are preserving family farms by codifying the Death Estate Tax exemption threshold at $15 million per individual and $30 million per couple, adjusted annually for inflation, to allow farmers who have spent generations building their operations to pass them down to their children and grandchildren. Farmers will no longer have to worry about their land and operation leaving the family.

Oklahoma’s farmers and ranchers drive our state and I’m proud to have worked with my colleagues to get these critical wins into the OBBB. I will always fight for the Agriculture community and continue to implement policies that will maintain our way of life for the generations to come.”",,N,,2025-08-29 14:56:36.867202

This month, Archie Brown, Sustainable Aviation Analyst, writes on The Emerging Risk in Europe’s Decarbonisation Strategy.

The cost of fuel and emitting for European airlines are rising rapidly. Driven not just by oil price volatility, but also by policy. IBA NetZero modelling indicates that the average implied fuel cost (1) for European airline operations (intra-European flights) stood at approximately €760 per metric tonne in 2024, increasing by an expected 9% in 2025 and 30% in 2030. This escalation reflects the cumulative impact of policies applied within Europe (note, Europe, not just the EU). While these initiatives are designed to accelerate decarbonisation, they also create a cost disparity compared to other regions, where such obligations remain limited.

(1) Implied fuel cost – the average cost of fuel at European airports, including Jet A, SAF blends and emissions policies

Figure 1. Average implied fuel costs for flights departing European airports, Source: IBA NetZero.

This disparity is already altering competitive dynamics. For example, Deloitte’s Airlines for Europe (A4E) analysis shows that on long-haul routes such as Nice-Tokyo with a routing via non-EU hubs like Istanbul (NCE-IST-HND) are shown to be 9.4% cheaper in 2024, before ReFuelEU kicks in, and 15.0% cheaper in 2030 with forecast ReFuelEU, EU ETS, and CORSIA costs.

Policies are already altering competitive dynamics. The cost advantage leads to notable market distortion. Under the ReFuelEU 2030 scenario for the NCE-HND route, Deloitte estimates 65% of business (passenger) leakage from operators with EU hubs to operators with non-EU competitors, corresponding to a carbon leakage of 26%. In other words, most passengers lost by EU carriers are captured by non-EU airlines, while over a quarter of the climate benefit is cancelled out as emissions are displaced or increased rather than reduced. The emissions are shifting beyond the EU’s regulatory scope through behaviours such as hub-switching, additional layovers, and destination changes to limit policy exposure. This may undermine both environmental outcomes and the competitiveness of European carriers, without corrective action.

Addressing this challenge requires further policy adaptation. The introduction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Border Adjustment Mechanism (SAF-BAM) is proposed, designed to apply an equivalent SAF cost to itineraries that bypass EU requirements through non-EU connections. Modelling suggests this measure could improve total demand changes for operators with EU hubs from -2.9% to -0.6% by 2030, significantly limiting carbon leakage. While not a bullet-proof solution, SAF-BAM represents a targeted improvement to maintain competitive balance and climate ambition.

The SAF-BAM proposal is similar to the EU CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism), a tariff set up in conjunction with the EU ETS to maintain the competitiveness of EU industries against imports that are not subject to direct EU carbon taxes. However, CBAM does not apply to aviation, hence the call from many for an expanded EU ETS to cover international flights to/from the EU.

Complementary measures, such as SAF cost incentives and broader international cooperation, will be critical to ensuring that Europe’s leadership in sustainable aviation delivers genuine global benefits rather than displacing emissions geographically.

Europe’s regulatory framework is reshaping airline costs and travel patterns. Without agile corrective mechanisms and bold ambition, these policies risk exporting traffic and emissions, diminishing their environmental benefit. This industry needs pragmatic steps that align decarbonisation objectives with the realities of a global aviation market.

By Sheersh Kapoor

At Reliance Industries’ 48th Annual General Meeting, Executive Director Anant Ambani called the company’s New Energy business its most “ambitious and transformational mission of this decade,” saying it had moved “from ambition to execution.”

Congratulating the entire leadership team of RIL’s Energy Business for their operational excellence in challenging times, Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani said he was confident they would “set global benchmarks in executing all their projects, making New Energy a large growth engine for Reliance.”

At Jamnagar, the Dhirubhai Ambani Giga Energy Complex is being built at record pace, with over 5 million manhours of engineering, 44 million square feet of building area – four times Tesla’s Gigafactory – and 7 lakh tonnes of steel, equal to 100 Eiffel Towers. It also involves 1 lakh kilometres of cable, enough to reach the moon and back.

“We are building the world’s most integrated New Energy ecosystem – from sand to electrons to green molecules – at a scale unmatched anywhere in the world,” Anant Ambani said. Products from the giga factories will deliver round-the-clock renewable power and produce green fuels such as ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Reliance has already produced its first 200 MW of HJT solar modules, which provide 10% higher energy yield, 20% better temperature performance, and 25% lower degradation. This platform will scale up to 20 GWp, making it the world’s largest and most integrated single-site solar facility.

A battery giga factory, starting in 2026, will expand from 40 GWh to 100 GWh annually, while an electrolyser giga factory, also due by 2026, will scale up to 3 GW to enable cost-competitive green hydrogen production.

Together, these platforms create a solar, battery storage, and hydrogen ecosystem under one roof, giving Reliance a competitive edge in technology, cost, and supply chain resilience.

In Gujarat’s Kutch, the company is building one of the world’s largest single-site solar projects across 5,50,000 acres, capable of meeting 10% of India’s electricity demand within the decade.

Reliance also plans to produce and export green ammonia, methanol, and aviation fuel, targeting 3 MMTPA of green hydrogen equivalent capacity by 2032.

“Jamnagar will be the cradle of both the world’s largest Conventional Energy complex and the world’s largest New Energy complex. Jamnagar is the face of New Reliance and New India,” Ambani told shareholders.

This marked a significant step forward: Airbus in Canada directly issued official sustainability credentials for SAF to a customer for the first time.

This landmark flight not only confirms Airbus' capability to provide proofs of sustainability (PoS) directly to customers and operators but also supports the industry's commitment to decarbonisation. With PoS credits for a 50% SAF blend applied through the mass balance process, this ferry flight conducted by Air France's 46th A220-300 named “VAISON-LA-ROMAINE”, represented more than 25 metric tons reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to fossil fuels.

“Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s. Air France-KLM is among the world’s largest buyers of SAF. Directly receiving SAF at delivery is a game-changer, increasing transparency and driving industry progress,” said Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability, Air France-KLM.

Since the announcement of the first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) delivery at Airbus site in Canada, enabling the Mirabel teams to use SAF for A220 production, customer acceptance, and test flights, this achievement solidifies Airbus' commitment to using SAF for internal operations as well as customer ferry flights across all its commercial aircraft assembly sites and delivery centers worldwide.

""In 2025 alone, we project cutting CO2 emissions by approximately 400 metric tonnes at our Mirabel site thanks to the 170,000 litres of pure SAF we will integrate to our activities,"" said Benoît Schultz, CEO of Airbus Canada. ""And we're pushing our ambition further with this ferry flight with PoS credits for 50% SAF – a significant step that comes just ahead of Air France’s 50th A220 delivery later this year. On a global scale, 78% of Airbus aircraft were delivered with SAF blend for the first half of the year, underscoring the importance our customers place on decarbonization.""

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already capable of operating with up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030. According to the PoS under CORSIA Sustainability Certification Scheme approved by ICAO, the SAF received at Airbus in Mirabel is certified for 85% reduction in GHG emissions on its lifecycle compared to fossil fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the aerospace industry’s progress towards decarbonization by 2050.

SAF management in Mirabel is done using mass balance, a chain of custody model in which a company accounts for volumes of certified products by looking at the volumes entering the operation and the equivalent volume of products leaving the operations as a measurement, minus any processing losses. As such, the SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel (Jet A-1) as per established industry standards and auditable bookkeeping.

Air France’s first A220-300s, part of a total firm order of 60 aircraft, have been flying on its medium-haul network since October 2021. The A220 delivers up to 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions per seat compared to previous generation aircraft. For more information on the A220 Programme, visit our A220 dedicated page.

About sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

SAF is a blended drop in fuel, certified against aviation fuel technical standards. It is a blend of a synthetic component made from renewable feedstocks and conventional fossil fuel. This blend, up to 50%, has the same characteristics as aviation fuels and are certified as such (e.g. Jet A/A1 (ASTM), Number 3 Jet Fuel (China), TS1 (Russia)).

As it is a drop in fuel, it does not require any change to the engines nor to the aircraft and its uptake and combustion has no impact on the safety of operations nor on maintenance tasks.

To be certified as ""sustainable"", the synthetic blend component must comply with sustainability standards, including minimum Green House Gas (GHG) savings. Hence, the GHG savings on a Life Cycle Assessment basis is only accounted for the synthetic blend component - and not for the conventional fossil fuel. Sustainability criteria is defined by regulations like ICAO CORSIA, EU RED, and UK SAF Mandate.

International demand has been primarily driven by record inbound tourism, and the airline's domestic traffic picture remains strong. Several product-driven upgrades on long-haul aircraft (including new premium cabins) have been coupled with the expansion of the ZIPAIR Tokyo network, giving the airline additional coverage of both the top and bottom of the market.

The airline's cargo revenue picture is weaker than its pandemic peaks, but the carrier continues to generate revenue in unique ways, such as through a joint venture with Yamato Holdings. The airline's seemingly bullish growth picture does have some notable risks, primarily volatility in the yen and jet fuel prices, alongside increased regulatory scrutiny regarding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates.

Company Specific Growth Catalysts

The airline continues to replace older long-haul aircraft with the Airbus A350-1000 on many flagship routes, and it will add the jet to its service from Tokyo Haneda Airport (HND) to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG). These jets feature upgraded premium cabins and will help build the airline's pricing power in this critical market saturated with business travelers.

The airline has further plans to deploy the Airbus A350-1000 on many routes to key US cities, such as New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles. A rise in capacity on seasonal routes will further help the airline expand its reach and develop a brand that generates passenger loyalty. The carrier's low-cost subsidiary, ZIPAIR, has also continued to grow its network, giving the airline an even broader reach within the market.

Macroeconomic Risks To Growth

Macroeconomic headwinds and tailwinds will have a major impact on Japan Airlines' growth prospects in the second half of the year. Inbound travel demand remains strong, primarily targeted by high inbound loads. The biggest confounding variable for the carrier at this point is the Yen, which has seen devaluations in recent years. Increases in the value of the yen over the next two quarters could lead to a decline in inbound tourist demand to Japan. However, a weaker yen could lead to lower business travel and outbound tourism.

Jet fuel, which remains any airline's largest variable cost and one over which it has somewhat minimal control, is also a concern for Japan Airlines. Most industry observers anticipate softer fuel prices throughout the second half of 2025, but any increase in prices could harm the airline's finances, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Japan also has a roadmap to the full-scale adoption of SAF, with a 10% blending mandate currently on the books for 2030, despite higher unit costs and supply-side cost pressures. Nonetheless, as long as the airline can continue servicing robust inbound demand and commanding a price premium in key markets, it should be in decent shape to overcome some of these concerning macroeconomic hurdles.

What Is The Bottom Line?

Investors, despite these potential risks, do appear to have confidence in the airline's prospects in the second half of the year. The airline's stock has provided investors with dynamic returns exceeding 25% over the past calendar year, mostly driven by waves of macroeconomic tailwinds.

During the initial period of economic turmoil following Trump's tariffs, investors lost some of their confidence in the airline's long-term prospects, with the stock trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of around 9.2. However, the airline would eventually see restored investor confidence with trading multiples rising beyond 11 over the course of the summer, according to Stock Analysis.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/japan-airlines-boeing-787-8-on-the-ground-at-an-airprot-shutterstock_218661910.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-29 12:58:56.364686

Analysts Forecast a Big Move in CVX Stock Chevron stock is up about 10% in 2025.
It’s also a little deceptive because of the spike in CVX stock since early April.
Chevron stock formed a death cross on August 20.
The analyst firm reiterated its Overweight rating on CVX stock and raised its price target to $197 from $186.","Concerns about inflation still dominate this market. In April and May, the immediate concern was that the Trump administration's tariff policy would cause a sharp spike in inflation. That hasn’t been the case, although some companies, particularly retailers, continue to report tariff headwinds.

However, the current concerns about inflation center around interest rates. The CME FedWatch tool puts the chance of a 25-basis point rate cut in September at around 87%. However, lower interest rates have a stimulative effect on the economy. That means that inflation will almost certainly increase, including for commodities like oil that have been in check so far in 2025.

That’s good news for a blue-chip stock like Chevron Corp. CVX. Here’s another reason. Dividend growth stocks are one of the only investments that give investors an opportunity to keep up with inflation.

Chevron has increased its dividend for 38 consecutive years, putting it in the exclusive category known as dividend aristocrats. However, the company also has a strong track record of delivering share buybacks to shareholders. In the company’s second quarter, Chevron delivered $5.5 billion to shareholders between dividends and buybacks.

Not a Contrarian Play

Energy stocks, particularly oil stocks, have been under pressure for much of the year. The problem with oil has been that companies like Chevron have increased their output for the last 12 months, and the market is well supplied. Plus, investors are concerned that alternative energy still represents an existential threat to oil and gas companies.

Lower interest rates may not immediately spark demand. However, if manufacturing and industrial output increase, that will be bullish for crude. Plus, if consumers get relief in time for the holiday season, it could spark a slight revival in transports, which would also be bullish for oil.

The alternative energy threat is really a win-win situation for Chevron. First, it will be years and more likely decades before the world has enough renewable energy sources to make oil less relevant. Until then, Chevron and other oil companies remain essential for economic growth.

At the same time, Chevron hasn’t been ignoring the alternative energy market. The company continues to spend billions on low-carbon initiatives, including:

Renewable fuels – Chevron is one of the largest producers of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel in the U.S. It has joint ventures, including with Bunge, to expand feedstock processing and distribution.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) – The company is developing CCS projects in California and the U.S. Gulf Coast, with the goal of storing millions of metric tons of CO₂ per year.

Hydrogen – Chevron is building out hydrogen fueling infrastructure in California and exploring opportunities in heavy-duty transport.

Renewable natural gas (RNG) – Through partnerships with agricultural operators, Chevron is converting methane from dairy farms into renewable gas for transportation.

Analysts Forecast a Big Move in CVX Stock

Chevron stock is up about 10% in 2025. That approximates its three-year average total return of around 8.8%. It also points to the range-bound conditions that have been in place for Chevron during that time. It’s also a little deceptive because of the spike in CVX stock since early April.

Chevron stock formed a death cross on August 20. However, the stock is stabilizing, and the pattern could be reversed quickly. The bullish sentiment is shared by UBS Group. The analyst firm reiterated its Overweight rating on CVX stock and raised its price target to $197 from $186. That’s an approximate gain of 20% from its consensus price target of $163.95.

The company won’t report earnings until early November. However, it could get a catalyst in the waning days of August. That’s when Chevron expects to receive the final ruling regarding the arbitration over Exxon Mobil’s claims to preemptive rights in the Staebroek block in Guyana. This arbitration was sparked after Chevron announced its merger with Hess, which was finalized in July.

,,2025-08-29 08:06:24+00:00,CBC,Investing in biofuel could help Canadian canola producers struggling with tariffs | CBC News,"Sam Maciag, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/canola-biofuel-option-1.7619401,"Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said biofuels are a great way to make better domestic use of Canadian canola.
The Canadian canola industry has been upended by international trade wars.
The change to a producer-based system essentially eliminated eligibility for Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel in the U.S., which reduces demand for Canadian feedstock like canola oil.
The 265-million-litre canola biodiesel plant opened in 2013 at the site of ADM's already-existing canola crushing facility.
He was stunned to learn the majority of Saskatchewan canola gets exported out of the country.","As Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe plans a trade mission to China to address recent tariffs the country imposed on Canadian canola exports, some of those impacted are eyeing up homegrown solutions.

Fred Ghatala, president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said biofuels are a great way to make better domestic use of Canadian canola. Those fuels include biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

""When you produce the fuels close to home, the economic value stays in the local economy. It's one of the best solutions to lower emissions [and] increase economic activity, while really not requiring people to change the way they operate,"" he said.

The Canadian canola industry has been upended by international trade wars. On Aug. 14, China imposed a provisional duty rate of 75.8 per cent on canola seed, on top of the 100 per cent tariff levied on Canadian canola oil and meal in March.

The new anti-dumping duty marked another escalation in the yearlong trade dispute that started when Canada imposed 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese-produced electric vehicles in August 2024.

It's a big deal for Canada — particularly for Saskatchewan. According to the Canola Council of Canada, growers produced 17.8 million metric tonnes of canola in 2024, with 55 per cent of that coming from Saskatchewan.

China is Canada's second-biggest canola export market behind the United States, to the tune of $4.9 billion last year.

Right now, the fuel standard policies around using canola oil are different across the country, which means some provinces are using a lot more than others. Ghatala said he sees it as an opportunity and pointed to British Columbia as doing the best, with 31 per cent renewable content in its diesel.

Saskatchewan has a renewable fuel standard that requires at least two per cent of the diesel mix to be renewable. Right now, about 2.5 per cent of the mix is renewable. When it comes to renewables in gasoline, Saskatchewan is doing even better at nearly 10 per cent, surpassing the provincial goal of 7.5 per cent.

Ghatala said the opportunities to use even more domestic canola oil would improve with access to biofuel refineries. But that takes investment — and he said investors need to know the government would support biofuel with policies that increase renewable fuel standard requirements.

Ghatala said Canadian plants are also competing with imported fuel from the United States. In January, the clean fuel production credit replaced the bio-diesel blenders credit. It offers varying amounts of credits based on fuel types and emission reduction. The eligibility is limited to U.S.-produced fuels, meaning producers in the States can sell their products for cheaper.

The change to a producer-based system essentially eliminated eligibility for Canadian biodiesel and renewable diesel in the U.S., which reduces demand for Canadian feedstock like canola oil.

""We don't have anything equivalent in Canada,"" Ghatala said, adding he'd like to see a competitive playing field.

In Canada, renewable diesel is being produced in B.C., Alberta and Newfoundland. Biodiesel is being produced in B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec.

Saskatchewan primarily provides canola feedstock that is turned into biodiesel and is exported to foreign markets where it can also be turned into renewable fuels.

The closest biofuel processing facility to Saskatchewan is operated by ADM, just across the Alberta border in Lloydminster. The 265-million-litre canola biodiesel plant opened in 2013 at the site of ADM's already-existing canola crushing facility.

The need for these kinds of facilities is why Josh Gustafson has added president and CEO to his title of farmer. He's behind Covenant Energy, which is in the process of building a $900-million renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel refinery in Lloydminster.

Gustafson farms near Macoun, in southeastern Saskatchewan. On his 14,000-acre farm, he grows red lentils, canola, durum and barley.

He was stunned to learn the majority of Saskatchewan canola gets exported out of the country.

""The desire to build [the plant] came out of seeing the need for domestic processing in Canada with our own homegrown canola,"" he said.

""It's an extensive refining process,"" he said, noting that it is expensive, and will also require precious critical minerals — something Saskatchewan is also trying to find a market for.

The Covenant plant is still in its engineering phase. Gustafson is expecting it to be operational by 2029.

It's something that could already be in progress in the province.

But in January, Federated Co-operatives Limited paused the construction of its own biodiesel and canola crushing project in Regina ""due to regulatory and political uncertainty, potential shifts in low-carbon public policy and escalating costs.""

Ghalta said without production capacity, the renewable fuel policies won't endure. In short, they need each other. The plant needs the incentives to compete and produce, and the production needs to happen to keep the policies viable and consumers engaged. Ghatala said if one drops off, so could support and investment.

Financial Risks and Labor Unrest Boeing’s cash position remains fragile.
Boeing’s next earnings report, scheduled for October 22, 2025, will provide critical data on whether its Q2 gains are sustainable [11].
Positive outcomes—such as progress on 737 MAX certification or a resolution to the labor strike—could catalyze further outperformance.
Boeing’s $618.54 billion backlog and strategic focus on sustainable aviation fuel partnerships by 2030 [1] offer long-term growth potential.","Boeing’s Q2 2025 earnings report marked a pivotal moment in its long-awaited turnaround. Revenue surged 34.9% year-over-year to $22.7 billion, driven by a 81% increase in Commercial Airplane segment revenue to $10.87 billion and a 10% rise in Defense, Space & Security (BDS) revenue to $6.62 billion [1]. The company’s net loss narrowed to $612 million, a 63% reduction compared to the same period in 2024 [2]. These figures suggest Boeing is stabilizing, but the question remains: Can this momentum endure amid unresolved risks?

Operational Gains and Strategic Shifts

Boeing’s improved performance stems from two key areas. First, the Commercial Airplanes segment has rebounded, with 737 MAX production stabilized at 38 units per month—a critical step toward regaining market share. This rate, while below pre-2020 levels, aligns with FAA requirements and supports the company’s goal of achieving positive free cash flow by Q4 2025 [3]. Second, the BDS segment has turned profitable, posting $110 million in operating income after a $913 million loss in 2024 [1]. This shift reflects stronger defense contracts, including a $2.8 billion deal with the U.S. Space Force [4].

However, these gains are tempered by persistent challenges. The 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 variants remain uncertified due to unresolved issues with the LEAP-1B engine’s de-icing system, delaying entry into a competitive narrowbody market [2]. Certification is now expected in 2026, a year later than initially planned, which could erode Boeing’s ability to capture market share from Airbus’ A320neo family [5].

Financial Risks and Labor Unrest

Boeing’s cash position remains fragile. While free cash outflows narrowed to $2.49 billion in the first half of 2025 (compared to $8.26 billion in 2024), the company still faces a $53.3 billion gross debt load, offset by $23 billion in cash reserves [1]. Analysts project further debt reduction by 2026, but this depends on sustained revenue growth and disciplined cost management [6].

Labor disputes add another layer of uncertainty. A strike by 3,200 defense workers in Missouri and Illinois, which began in August 2025, has paused contract negotiations until after Labor Day [7]. This strike, though smaller than the 2024 commercial jet strike, risks disrupting production of critical military aircraft like the F-15 and F/A-18. Union demands for improved retirement security and healthcare contributions highlight broader tensions between Boeing’s cost-cutting strategy and employee expectations [8].

Valuation and Market Sentiment

From a valuation perspective, Boeing appears undervalued. A DCF model estimates its intrinsic value at $324.06 per share, 27.3% above its current price [1]. The stock’s forward P/E ratio of 265.44 and a P/S ratio of 2.37x suggest mixed signals: while the former indicates high expectations for future earnings, the latter aligns with industry averages [9]. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, with 20 out of 25 rating the stock as a “Strong Buy” and an average 12-month price target of $258.17 [10].

Strategic Entry Point Considerations

For investors, the key question is timing. Boeing’s next earnings report, scheduled for October 22, 2025, will provide critical data on whether its Q2 gains are sustainable [11]. Positive outcomes—such as progress on 737 MAX certification or a resolution to the labor strike—could catalyze further outperformance. Conversely, delays or setbacks could reignite investor skepticism.

The risk-reward profile tilts in favor of long-term investors who can tolerate near-term volatility. Boeing’s $618.54 billion backlog and strategic focus on sustainable aviation fuel partnerships by 2030 [1] offer long-term growth potential. However, short-term risks, including regulatory scrutiny and production bottlenecks, remain elevated.

Conclusion

Boeing’s Q2 2025 results demonstrate that the company is on a path to recovery, but sustainability hinges on resolving certification delays, stabilizing labor relations, and maintaining financial discipline. While the stock’s valuation and analyst optimism suggest a compelling entry point, investors must weigh these positives against the likelihood of near-term headwinds.

During an engaging session titled “Ag Sector Innovations – Powering Sustainable Solutions in the Aviation Industry,” the audience learned how crops and ethanol are being developed into sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to help reduce emissions in one of the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors. Panelists highlighted innovations originating in the St. Louis region that are fueling progress on these efforts.

The panel was moderated by Andy Banker, anchor and reporter with KTVI Fox 2, and featured Dr. Yan Zhang, interim center director and director of research for the National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC) on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, and Jim Hedges, CEO of St. Louis-based CoverCress, Inc. (CCI).

Dr. Zhang explained that since its opening in 2003, NCERC’s focus has expanded from corn-to-ethanol production to scaling up technologies for biopolymers and various other fuels, including SAF. She noted that NCERC is working on the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway, one of eight approved processes for SAF.

“Among the eight pathways in this country, the ATJ is actually a very, very promising way to make a jet fuel to meet the 3-billion-gallon per year mark by 2030 in this country using ethanol from corn starch,” Zhang said. “However, right now there are some challenges. We are not there yet.”

She said the No. 1 challenge the corn-to-ethanol industry is working on is trying to lower the carbon intensity score. “For us, we just need to push a little bit more on the reduction of carbon dioxide emission from fermentation,” Zhang said. “NCERC has a demo-scale project planned in six months. If the results look okay, we will contribute a lot to the development.”

Hedges described how CoverCress Inc., an ag-tech company, is converting a once-noxious weed into a commercially viable crop for renewable fuel. “In a startup world, don’t build a solution in search of a problem. At CCI, we have built a solution to answer a problem,” Hedges said. “The problem is there’s a huge demand for renewable fuel, in this case sustainable aviation fuel. The demand is going to outpace what we can do as an individual company or as a crop. We don’t view other crops as competitors. We want to lift all these solutions up to fulfill the demand, so that the demand doesn’t go away because there’s a lack of solutions.”

He explained that CoverCress, the company’s main crop, is the first new crop introduced in the industry since canola about 60 years ago. It grows between corn and soybean seasons, creating a new revenue stream for farmers while improving soil health.

Hedges highlighted the strategic advantages of the St. Louis region for SAF research and development. “I’ve been in five different startups and I’ve never had the level of talent that I have at CCI,” said Hedges. “The ecosystem of Ag Tech in St. Louis rivals anything in the United States.” He highlighted the proximity to key agricultural stakeholders, access to talent, and a strong innovation community through the Danforth Plant Science Center, 39 North, and BioSTL noting that the local ag-tech ecosystem makes it possible to connect research, commercialization, and farmers efficiently.

Beyond improving carbon intensity scores, both speakers also addressed additional barriers to scaling up SAF production, including retrofitting facilities and encouraging farmers to adopt new crops, and delivering fuel at a competitive cost. But Hedges indicated the change for farmers is very minor, essentially just a few adjustments on the harvesting equipment around small grains. “The grain infrastructure, as it is, is robust and it will satisfy, but we’re going to have to do some adaptation to that infrastructure,” he said. “As we start to scale the product into the hundreds of thousands of acres and into the millions of acres, it’s super competitive; competitive enough that the investors we have are Bayer, Chevron and Bunge.”

Despite the challenges, both panelists expressed optimism about the growing market for sustainable fuels from both commercial and military aviation. Dr. Zhang noted, “We are very proud that my team actually got funding through the Department of Defense to research making SAF-qualified ethanol with feedstocks from Hawaii and tropical islands in the Pacific Ocean. We have the trust and we can do a good job for the future.”

The session also explored the timeline for adoption of SAF in aviation. Both panelists stressed that while the industry is still in its early stages, demand is strong and commitments from industrial partners are real. “We’re at the infancy of that shift,” Hedges said. “Every industrial company involved in aviation is committed, and the funding and innovation will help change the next generation of travel and fuel. As we start into that process of helping deliver on the demand, I can’t even imagine how much different it’s going be 10 years from now.”

Dr. Zhang emphasized the importance of progress for future generations, noting that, as a mother of two, she can see ahead how the next generation will benefit from these changes. “It’s hard to predict exactly how quickly aviation fuels will evolve, but if you have the energy and talent to contribute to change, it feels good to be part of it,” she said.

Banker called attention to Avina Clean Hydrogen’s plan to develop a $280 million SAF facility in the Metro East. “We’re eager to see that project moving forward and look forward to seeing what great new milestones lie ahead for today’s panelists and the rest of this burgeoning SAF industry.”

The inaugural Global Aerospace Summit was presented by the Leadership Council Southwestern Illinois in partnership with Madison County, St. Clair County, and Bi-State Development’s St. Louis Regional Freightway.

Collaboration and innovation: Essential for turning challenges into opportunities Reaching net zero carbon emissions is a daunting task that airlines cannot achieve alone.","By Preeti Jain, Head Net Zero Research and Programs, IATA

Since our commitment at the 77th IATA Annual General Meeting in October 2021 to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we are in a moment of retrospection and reflection to assess our journey so far. Achieving net zero emissions is a challenging task in view of the growing demand from a world eager to fly. At the same time, mitigating carbon emissions is an existential need and not an option.

Given that 2025 is the year of the 42nd ICAO Assembly for states to review their long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, it’s the opportune time for us to see what we have been able to catalyze, shape, and accomplish, and which solutions must be accelerated through supportive government policies to eventually achieve sustainable flying for our future generations.

Implementing net zero transition through concrete actions

One of the biggest challenges is converting ‘Net Zero’ commitments into credible actions. Aviation is a hard-to-decarbonize sector, requiring a multifarious approach through the combined effect of multiple CO2 emissions reduction measures. These include the accelerated adoption of new and innovative aircraft technologies, streamlined flight operations, carbon offsets, and the increased production and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). Airlines made a sincere commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 with optimism that it would be supported by sovereign policy frameworks and industry partners delivering solutions in an economically and timely prudent manner.

However, this is not happening as anticipated. Particularly in the area of SAF, the development and deployment of SAF is instrumental in mitigating industry carbon emissions by 65% by 2050. Although SAF production has doubled to one million tonnes of SAF in 2024 compared to the previous year and is projected to reach 2 million metric tonnes in 2025, it still represents less than 1% of overall jet fuel demand. This slow pace of SAF adoption, coupled with its higher price, has become a critical dampener to the airlines' decarbonization efforts. Furthermore, the anticipated growth in the offsets market and the momentum towards hydrogen-fueled planes are not propagating enough to sustain the aggressive 2050 timeline. We must realize the transition toward net zero carbon emissions is an economic opportunity and should not be missed.

Strengthening technical understanding to foster collective action toward net zero transition

IATA strives to refine and communicate the scientific and technical understanding of net zero solutions to our airline members and stakeholders at large. Our research objectives reflect the industry’s need for innovative solutions to achieve net zero carbon emissions. In this process, we collaborate across all actors to build understanding and consensus for changing the status quo of existing energy models and supply chains for different net zero solutions.

Last year, IATA released an updated version of the Net Zero Finance Roadmap that contains our detailed assessment of the necessary steps to accelerate the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In parallel, IATA has worked on building a comprehensive understanding of the key levers and produced several strategically important publications for the industry, including SAF production assessment, guidance on the use of hydrogen in aircraft and aviation infrastructure, assessment of contrail climate impacts, and studies on carbon dioxide removals (CDRs). All these initiatives will, in turn, help set a tone for net zero enablers and collective action.

Collaboration and innovation: Essential for turning challenges into opportunities

Reaching net zero carbon emissions is a daunting task that airlines cannot achieve alone. It requires collaboration among policymakers and stakeholders across energy, aviation, and financing institutions. While developing future-ready technologies, it is equally important to optimize current solutions which are available for deployment. Governments should support the aviation industry's use of solutions like SAF through harmonized, incentive-based policies, rather than restrictive regulatory framework and mandates.

It is good to remember that innovation lies at the heart of the sustainable future we envision today. Renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter’s ‘Theory of Innovation Cycles’ highlights the transformative power of innovation on economies, industries, and societies. The world has witnessed these cycles in the past, where risk capital and policies fostered new technologies before they became the norm. Just as past innovations have transformed various sectors, aviation now stands at a similar crossroads. Innovation in aviation should be supported, promoted, and propagated until new technologies and business models mature to transform existing energy systems. Developing cost-efficient and streamlined technologies is crucial for reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.",https://www.iata.org/contentassets/d1162bb5256f449ebe7f2491f5f743b8/net-zero-blog.jpg,N,,2025-08-29 04:56:13.636875

Plant construction is projected to start in the first half of 2026. The initial test flight is expected in 2027 and commercial flight service by 2030.

As much as 15% of JetZero’s pledged 14,560 employees — or 2,184 — could be contractors serving in full-time roles, the manufacturer confirmed Tuesday to N.C. Commerce Department.

Da Silva said JetZero doesn’t view the PTI’s aviation corridor, which includes Boom Supersonic, HAECO, Honda Aircraft Co. and Marshall Aerospace, as competition for employees.

“We’re coming to join you, not to displace you,” Da Silva said. “We’re happy to be here with you.”

Revolutionary, not evolutionary

Da Silva said the aviation industry has spent much of the past 60 years tweaking fuel and engine efficiency and passenger seating, but not the shape of the aircraft itself.

“There’s only so much you can extract from out of the (current) shape in terms of physics,” Da Silva said.

“JetZero’s approach is revolutionary because it does change the shape of the aircraft, using technology that has been studied for more than 35 years.

“We decided it was time to bring that technology to market because the materials are there to do it, the advent of AI, composite materials,” he said. “This time is ripe for the future of flight.”

Da Silva said JetZero’s Z4 blended wing aircraft should appeal to airlines and passengers searching for a more economic and climate friendly way to travel.

Da Silva said that because the Z4 aircraft will consume about half of the aviation fuel of current passenger aircraft, he said “airlines will be able to afford you a more affordable, lower-priced commodity.”

By reducing fuel consumption, Da Silva said the Z4 aircraft also significantly cuts down on carbon dioxide emissions.

“By cutting half of the fuel burn, you cut half of the emissions,” he said. “You can have a great evolution without even having to change the fuel source.”

Da Silva also talked about the challenges of air travel in current passenger aircraft as another selling point for JetZero.

“The shape of our airplane offers us the opportunity to change from what sitting in a tube feels like to sitting in your living room because you have this wide-open space that the airlines can shape in whatever way they want,” Da Silva said.

Da Silva drew a round of applause after saying “we are dimensioning the (passenger) bays in a way where the airlines cannot squeeze as much as they do today.”

“They won’t need to because they are burning 50% less fuel, they’ll be turning around their flight schedule quicker because passenger boardings and deplanings will be faster, servicing will be faster,” Da Silva said.

Background

North Carolina’s $450 million state economic incentive offer to JetZero became official on Aug. 6 as part of Gov. Josh Stein signing into law a mini-state budget bill.

The JetZero funding, provided over a six-year period, is included in House Bill 125 while House and Senate Republicans remain at an impasse over the overall budget bill.

JetZero jobs will include systems and aerospace engineering, supply chain, production workers, administrative and financial, human resources, research and development and customer service.

As JetZero begins to ramp up hiring, available jobs will be posted on its career page (job-boards.greenhouse.io/jetzero), as well as at NCworks.gov and GuilfordWorks.com.

The Z4 airplane, JetZero’s flagship model, is engineered with a blended-wing body to achieve up to 50% better fuel efficiency. The aircraft can seat between 200 and 250 passengers, fly up to 5,000 nautical miles and is compatible with existing airport infrastructure and sustainable aviation fuel.

JetZero is planning for a monthly production rate of 20 planes when five years into full production.

Plenty of infrastructure decisions remain for JetZero and the Piedmont Triad Airport Authority, foremost the size of the plant and how many acres the campus will require.

JetZero and the authority plan to dedicate the rest of 2025 to determining the shape of the plant and how best to fit the structure on the airport campus.

According to a presentation by the company, JetZero plans to pay an average annual wage of $89,340.

In exchange, the State Economic Investment Committee said the plant would be eligible for up to $1.57 billion in direct Job Investment Development grants.

The Guilford County Board of Commissioners confirmed at a special incentive hearing that the county will provide up to $75.9 million in performance-based incentives over 20 years.

Meanwhile, the Greensboro City Council approved paying $1,000 in incentives for every job created, which would make for at least a $14.56 million commitment.

Your business will be on the path to success if you land yourself at Teesside International Airport.

Since being brought back into public ownership in 2019, a consistent focus on estate and asset development has made the airport a prime location for top companies – with fantastic news stories spinning out of their arrival.

Willis Aviation Services is constructing its second twin-bay hangar to cater for its growing aircraft repair and overhaul operations, expanding the company’s thriving presence which recently saw it sign a new maintenance deal with Jet2.

Aircraft painting firm Airbourne Colours is also building a second facility, as it scores jobs with EasyJet, Jet2, Loganair, TUI and others, bringing even more jobs and apprenticeships to the site.

Aviation services and technology firm Draken, which currently operates two hangars for its £173m MoD contract, has signalled its further commitment with the airport as it seeks to build a new five-bay maintenance hangar with offices and workshops.

And FedEx, the world’s largest transportation company, has signed a five-year deal for an airfreight handling facility at Teesside – moving its operations from Newcastle. The airport already boasts its own cargo handling facility, with the latest screening technology, and is famed for its handling of urgent or last-minute goods.

Thanks to these, the airport recorded a year-on-year cargo increase of 130.7% in June 2025.

When it comes to import and export, as part of the Teesside Freeport’s customs zones, firms operating here will receive a range of tariff benefits, including duty deferral while the goods remain on-site and the suspension of VAT on goods entering the customs zone.

Businesses can also manufacture goods using the imports and add value, before exporting to international markets, without ever paying the full tariff on the original goods.

It’s not only aviation-related firms relocating here. Global car repair firm ABL 1Touch has become the first tenant at the south of the site, which offers high-quality office and Grade A industrial development opportunities across 270 acres, all with airside access if required.

ABL 1Touch’s Unit D is the first of four units which will be built to cover 130,000 sq ft with direct access to the road network via a convenient mile-long link road off the A67.

Like all the developments to come, the principle behind the 25,105 sq ft facility has been to provide a loose fit base build to each unit with a plug-and-play approach to meet individual requirements.

This has been established with an understood base performance that can be enhanced by an uplift in material choices as well as bespoke elements of fitout to suit individual tenant needs.

In total, Teesside Airport boasts 375 acres of developable land, including 5.2m sq ft/483,277 sq m of industrial, logistics and aviation development.

The airport has a strategy to become operationally net zero by 2030. This includes self-sufficient electricity for the site and tenants from an under-development solar array, a hydrogen vehicle refuelling station and involvement in sustainable aviation fuel research – helping your company meet its clean energy ambitions.
