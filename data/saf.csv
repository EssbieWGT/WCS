A traveler books a long-haul flight from Frankfurt to Singapore and notices a line item labeled “Environmental Surcharge.” It’s not optional, and it’s not tiny. For most economy passengers, it adds somewhere between €6 and €20. In business class, it can go much higher. At first glance, this might seem like a minor annoyance—another in a growing list of airline fees. But that small surcharge is the tip of a much larger shift: the full cost of aviation decarbonization is beginning to land squarely with the customer.

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is the aviation industry’s primary tool to cut lifecycle carbon emissions without fundamentally changing the airframes or propulsion systems that have defined commercial flight for decades. SAF can, in theory, slash emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional Jet A fuel. In practice, its contribution is far smaller today—less than 1% of global jet fuel use—but that share is growing rapidly, driven by policy mandates in the EU, UK, and Singapore, and increasingly by corporate net-zero travel programs. The catch is cost. SAF, whether derived from used cooking oil, forestry residues, or purpose-grown biomass, typically costs two to five times as much as fossil jet fuel. Synthetic e-fuels derived from green hydrogen are even more expensive—often eight to ten times—and face enormous scaling barriers.

According to the International Energy Agency, global SAF production was approximately 600 million liters in 2023, a twelvefold increase over 2019 levels but still a fraction of what is needed. The IEA projects that to meet net-zero aviation pathways, SAF will need to account for at least 10% of global jet fuel consumption by 2030, rising steeply thereafter. The EU’s Fit for 55 package mandates 2% SAF in 2025, 6% by 2030, and 20% by 2035 for all flights departing EU airports. Singapore will require 1% from 2026, scaling to 3–5% by 2030, and is introducing a SAF levy on tickets to fund that mandate. Airlines aren’t absorbing those costs; they’re passing them through.

This is something that’s built into my projection of aviation demand and decarbonization through 2100. Airlines aren’t charities and climate change is real, so the industry is going to have to pay for low-carbon power, and what costs there are will be born by passengers. Most projections ignore electric aviation, but I’ve discussed this with top people at Ryanair, aerospace engineers and electric aviation founders globally. We all agree that hybrid electric aviation for up to 1,000 km routes with 100 passengers is inevitable, and that will cut a lot of flights out of the jet fuel demand equation. Further, increased flight costs will significantly soften the demand increases seen from 1980 to 2019. COVID itself fundamentally altered the industry, with significantly less business travel in the Age of Zoom. Now there’s data on how airlines are already passing costs along.

This pass-through is happening in multiple ways. In Europe, full-service airlines like Lufthansa and Air France–KLM have implemented mandatory SAF surcharges that scale by route and class. Lufthansa’s fee can reach up to €72 for long-haul business class tickets. In Singapore, the government is levying a SAF charge directly on tickets. Finnair and United Airlines offer voluntary SAF contributions during booking, typically a few euros or dollars, framed as an easy climate action. Meanwhile, corporate travel programs have emerged as SAF buyers of last resort, with firms like Microsoft, Deloitte, and Boston Consulting Group paying premiums through programs like United’s Eco-Skies Alliance and Lufthansa’s Compensaid Corporate. These arrangements use book-and-claim accounting to decouple the physical fuel uplift from the emission reduction benefit, allowing companies to claim SAF-related reductions even if the fuel was burned elsewhere.

Yet the real story isn’t just how airlines are pricing SAF today. It’s how this dynamic reshapes aviation economics in the next decade. A 10% SAF blend, which may be mandatory in some jurisdictions by 2030, could increase total fuel costs by 20–30% if the price premium holds. That’s before factoring in airport blending logistics, certification costs, and potential penalties for non-compliance. Since jet fuel historically comprises 20–30% of airline operating expenses, this is a structural cost pressure that can’t be ignored. Airlines operate on thin margins. They will not, and cannot, absorb that burden alone. Ticket prices will rise.

The industry projects rising demand in spite of this, something I think is wishful thinking. Boeing and IATA forecast that global passenger traffic will double by 2040, citing long-term economic growth and expanding middle classes. But these projections rest on historical price elasticity that may no longer hold. Airfare inflation, driven by decarbonized fuel, is likely to cap growth earlier than IATA expects. Per analysis from Transport & Environment and others, a 20% rise in average ticket prices could reduce demand by 10-15% depending on the route and travel purpose. That would be enough to flatten growth curves, especially for discretionary leisure travel.

Moreover, decarbonization is not evenly distributed. Low-cost carriers with thinner customer margins and fewer business-class subsidies will face tougher choices. Ryanair has already warned that EU climate policies will raise average fares by €10 to €15 over the decade, and that’s with very low percentages of SAF. These aren’t abstract numbers. They will alter behavior. Short-haul trips under 1,000 kilometers may begin to shift to rail in Europe and East Asia, where infrastructure allows. Long-haul tourism may plateau as cost pressures mount. Business travel—already declining in relative terms since the pandemic—is unlikely to resume its former dominance, especially as virtual meetings and sustainability reporting norms take deeper hold.

As SAF mandates tighten, airlines will look for relief valves. Government subsidies, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act’s $1.25–$1.75 per gallon tax credit for SAF, provide temporary cushioning, but that’s also not something that is guaranteed to persist given the current Administration’s wrecking ball approach. Those incentives phase out within the decade in any event, and few governments are eager to fund unlimited fuel subsidies for an industry still perceived as a luxury emitter. Some airlines are lobbying for contracts-for-difference or other hedge instruments to reduce price volatility. But even with policy support, costs will not return to fossil-era baselines.

One consequence will be fleet innovation. As SAF costs climb, the incentive to use less liquid fuel grows. Turboprop aircraft for short-haul regional routes are already 30–40% more fuel-efficient per passenger-kilometer than regional jets. Battery-electric and hybrid-electric turboprops are under development by firms like Heart Aerospace, Ampaire, and others, with 19 to 100 seat configurations and ranges from 200 to 1,000 kilometers. These aircraft avoid most SAF costs altogether. By 2035, they are likely to be competitive for short regional hops, especially in jurisdictions with high carbon prices or SAF mandates. Airports may also adjust, shifting infrastructure investments toward regional mobility rather than long-haul expansions.

As I’ve noted, our biological waste streams are immense, with 2.5 billion tons of food waste annually alone, and more from agricultural, animal husbandry and forestry. I’ve assessed virtually all of the feedstocks and processing technologies and am comfortable that there is zero conflict between climate goals, feeding people and biofuel use for longer haul aviation and shipping. Further, shifting those waste streams into biofuels is an inherent climate benefit because a lot of them decompose anaerobically into methane, leading to big climate challenges. That points to bioSAF as the dominant pathway, not because it’s perfect, but because it’s available, certifiable, and cheaper than synthetic options. Green hydrogen-derived e-kerosene remains and will remain prohibitively expensive and power-intensive. Blue hydrogen, produced from fossil methane with carbon capture, being used for synthetic fuels will likely never reach the economic, regulatory or public acceptance thresholds needed for mass adoption in aviation.

We are seeing the start of the repricing of the sky. SAF is not a footnote—it is the future of aviation fuel, and it’s not and will not be cheap. Every surcharge and fare increase is a signal. As SAF blends rise from 1% today to 10% and eventually 20% by 2035, ticket prices will climb. Some travelers will fly less. Some routes will shrink. Short-haul aviation will start shifting to electric propulsion. The net result isn’t the end of flying, but a subtle inversion of the curve: fewer people flying more carefully, on planes that burn fewer liquids and more electrons, with costs and choices reshaped by carbon. The sooner we acknowledge this trajectory, the better we can navigate it.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-4-2025-09_46_34-AM-800x424.png,N,,2025-05-04 14:56:07.518303

The United States is facing a significant downturn in international tourism in 2025, with projections indicating a 5.1 percent drop in the number of travelers coming to the country. This marks a stark reversal from the previously anticipated growth rate of 8.8 percent. The impact extends beyond just the number of visitors; foreign visitor spending is expected to plummet by 10.9 percent, deepening the economic strain on the tourism sector.

This unexpected decline in international arrivals and spending is expected to have wide-ranging effects on industries dependent on tourism, from hospitality and retail to transportation and local businesses. While the U.S. had been preparing for a steady recovery following the pandemic, this sharp drop underscores the fragility of global travel in the face of shifting geopolitical and economic factors.

With a standout fourteen percent increase in international passengers, the airline has successfully capitalized on the growing demand from key US markets. This growth, fueled by a recovery in global travel and the airline’s expanding routes, highlights Japan Airlines’ ability to attract both inbound tourism and outbound business travel, positioning the airline for continued success in the highly competitive aviation industry.

Japan Airlines (JL) has announced outstanding financial results for fiscal year 2024-2025, driven by a strong 14% surge in international passenger traffic and strategic growth initiatives. The airline’s performance is also bolstered by substantial progress in its low-cost carrier (LCC) operations, full-service segments, and non-aviation business areas, as well as its sustainability efforts such as the adoption of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Japan Airlines’ Revenue Growth and Passenger Increase

For the fiscal year 2024-2025, Japan Airlines posted consolidated revenues of JPY 1,844 billion, marking a significant 11.6% year-on-year increase. This performance is the highest since the airline’s re-listing. The growth in revenues was primarily driven by a 14.4% increase in international passenger numbers, alongside steady increases in domestic travel, cargo operations, and other non-aviation business segments.

The airline’s operating expenses also saw a rise, climbing by 9.8% year-on-year to JPY 1,693.4 billion. This increase was largely influenced by the depreciation of the Japanese yen, higher fuel costs, and strategic investments in workforce expansion. However, despite these increased costs, Japan Airlines reported impressive profit growth. EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) rose by 18.7%, totaling JPY 172.4 billion, while net profit grew by 12.0%, reaching JPY 107.0 billion.

Robust International Passenger Demand

One of the key contributors to Japan Airlines’ growth was the sharp increase in international passenger demand. With international travel rebounding after pandemic-related slowdowns, the airline saw a 14.4% growth in international passengers. This increase was driven by a combination of recovering outbound business travel and rising inbound tourism to Japan. High-demand routes such as Tokyo-Narita (NRT) to Chicago (ORD) and expanded services from Osaka-Kansai (KIX) contributed significantly to this surge.

In addition, the airline capitalized on the revival of global tourism and business travel, with Southeast Asia, North America, and intra-Asia routes experiencing notable growth. The airline saw an 11.9% rise in international revenue as a result of these trends, solidifying its position as a key player in the global aviation market.

Operational Performance and Highlights

Japan Airlines’ full-service operations continued to show strong performance, contributing significantly to the company’s growth. Revenue from its full-service segment climbed by 9.8%, totaling JPY 1,451.8 billion. This growth was driven by sustained demand from inbound tourism, recovering business travel, and strong demand for high-value cargo. Operating profit (EBIT) from the full-service operations rose by 4.7%, reaching JPY 111.1 billion.

In the domestic market, Japan Airlines also saw continued growth in passenger demand. Domestic passenger numbers rose by 2.9% for the full year, with domestic revenue increasing by 3.7%. One of the highlights in the domestic market was the airline’s record-high load factor of 82.9% in the fourth quarter, which was bolstered by promotional campaigns and strong demand.

Strategic Expansion and Fleet Growth

Looking forward, Japan Airlines is actively expanding its network and fleet to accommodate increasing passenger demand. The airline plans to begin new direct flights between Tokyo-Narita (NRT) and Chicago (ORD) starting May 31, 2025. In addition, it will increase flight frequencies on its Honolulu routes from Osaka (KIX) and Nagoya (NGO) by July.

To further enhance its long-term growth, Japan Airlines plans to expand its fleet by adding ten Boeing 787-9s and twenty Airbus A350-900s from FY2027 onwards. These new aircraft will allow Japan Airlines to increase its seat capacity and enhance service offerings for both domestic and international routes.

Additionally, Japan Airlines has launched the “DEEEEP JAPAN” project in collaboration with the travel agency JTB, with the goal of promoting regional tourism across Japan. Starting from FY2028, Japan Airlines will begin replacing its Boeing 767 aircraft with more fuel-efficient Airbus A321neo models, initially for Tokyo-Haneda (HND) routes.

Financial Outlook and Future Projections

Japan Airlines’ solid financial performance has resulted in a boost to its annual dividend, which has been increased from JPY 80 to JPY 86 per share. Additionally, the year-end dividend has risen from JPY 40 to JPY 46. This reflects the airline’s strong earnings and its commitment to delivering value to shareholders.

For the fiscal year 2025-2026, Japan Airlines expects to maintain its positive momentum. The airline is forecasting total revenues of JPY 1,977.0 billion, with EBIT reaching JPY 200.0 billion and net profit growing to JPY 115.0 billion. The company attributes this optimistic forecast to continued demand for air travel, coupled with the airline’s ongoing strategic fleet and network expansions.

Japan Airlines has seen an impressive fourteen percent increase in international passenger traffic for fiscal year 2024-25, driven by strong demand from US markets. This growth underscores the airline’s expanding global presence and recovery in both inbound and outbound travel.

In conclusion, Japan Airlines’ record financial results for FY2024-2025 are a testament to its successful recovery following the pandemic. With growing passenger numbers, operational efficiencies, and strategic investments in fleet and network expansions, Japan Airlines is well-positioned for continued growth in the coming years.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-05-04T110242540.jpg,N,,2025-05-04 02:56:24.981928

As News.com.au reported, the minority stakeholder in the Utah Jazz bought a Bombardier 7500 capable of carrying up to 19 passengers and said he has ""a deep internal conflict"" about it. He cited personal security, running a global business from Australia, and fatherhood in a LinkedIn post as reasons for using the carbon-heavy mode of transport.

Why is it an issue when many other billionaires utilize large vessels such as private jets and yachts? For one, the amount of polluting gases regular private jet travel produces goes against Cannon-Brookes' stance on environmental issues.

He has been an active climate campaigner and is a key investor in SunCable's giant Australia-Asia PowerLink — a project to transport energy from solar farms in the Northern Territory to Singapore.

Per the Financial Post, his investment firm, Grok Ventures, attempted a 2022 takeover of Australia's AGL Energy to help the country transition from coal to more sustainable energy. The Financial Review reported that his influence and shares in the company encouraged AGL to close the country's biggest coal plant a decade ahead of schedule.

Carbon gases not only cause air pollution but are a major factor in the overheating planet and the unpredictable weather patterns that come with it. While these jets make up only a fraction of those gases — almost 2% of the industry's overall pollution — the figure is steadily increasing. The journal Communications Earth & Environment published a study in 2024 that said the polluting gases from private jets had increased by 46% over the past five years.

Some effort is being made to mitigate a portion of those toxins. VistaJet, a leader in private business aviation, is using biogenic sustainable aviation fuel created from used cooking oil. Others, including Flexjet, also use carbon offset programs — projects that reduce or remove pollution elsewhere to compensate for what flights produce.

How or if Cannon-Brookes will offset his private travel remains to be seen. Based on carbon footprint, a greener option may have been the low fuel-consuming Pilatus PC-12, a single-engine jet that's 10 times less polluting than a Bombardier Global 6000, per Aeroaffaires. At least the Bombardier 7500 has its pros, as ""approximately 85% of the materials used are recoverable,"" according to Runway Girl Network.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Mike-Cannon-Brookesimage-recxlAf0NNgIWZTp0.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 23:56:07.565943

With birth rates plummeting globally, countries face a future of shrinking and ageing societies driven by an unrelenting collapse in fertility.

Family structures and living arrangements previously imaged only in science fiction will become commonplace features of everyday life with an unprecedented collapse of procreative power.

These stark warnings of an era of pervasive depopulation were delivered at the 2025 Congress of the Asia Pacific Initiative on Reproduction (ASPIRE) in Singapore today.

Internationally respected political economist, Dr Nicholas Eberstadt, is supporting an ASPIRE campaign advocating for policy changes that will encourage family building, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.

Dr Eberstadt is the Henry Wendt Chair in Political Economy at the American Enterprise Institute where he is renowned for his demographic research and studies on international security. He is also a senior advisor to the National Bureau of Asian Research.

He told the ASPIRE Congress that between 1965 and 2015 the human fertility rate in births per woman fell by half and the “record breaking, jaw dropping” plunge has quickened in recent years in rich and poor countries alike.

Dr Eberstadt said by 2023 fertility levels were 40 per cent below replacement levels in Japan, 50 per cent in mainland China, 60 per cent in Taiwan and 65 per cent in South Korea. Sub-replacement trends are also evident in countries including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia.

“Labour forces will shrink all around the world due to the spread of sub-replacement birth rates with the old beginning to outnumber the young,” Dr Eberstadt explained.

“Societies will have to adjust their expectations to comport with the new realities of fewer workers, savers, taxpayers, renters, home buyers, entrepreneurs, innovators, inventors, consumers and voters.

“Dwindling workforces, reduced savings and investment, and unsustainable social outlays and budget deficits are all on the cards for today’s developed countries without sweeping changes in immigration, lifecycle earning and consumption patterns, and government policies for taxation and social expenditures.

“Super-elders of 80-plus years of age are the world’s fastest growing cohort. By 2050, there will be more of them than children in some countries. The burden of caring for people with dementia will pose growing costs – human, social, economic – in an aging and shrinking world.”

Dr Eberstadt said as families and societies assume new structures under long-term population decline, the challenge will be to develop new habits of mind, conventions and cooperative objectives.

“Policymakers will have to learn new rules for development in the midst of depopulation,” he explained. “Investors, likewise, will need new playbooks to profit from an altered environment of opportunity and risk.

“There will be less margin for error for investment projects, be they public or private, and no rising tide of demand from a growing pool of consumers or taxpayers to count on.

“Prosperity in a depopulating world will also depend on open economics, free trade in goods, services and finance to counter the constraints that shrinking populations impose. As the hunt for scarce talent becomes more acute, the movement of people will take on new economic salience and immigration will matter more than in does today.”

ASPIRE President, Dr Clare Boothroyd, said in response to the disturbing fall in fertility rates, a new ASPIRE special interest group would be created to harness expertise in population sustainability.

She will co-Chair the group with acclaimed reproductive endocrinologist, Professor Dominique de Ziegler from Foch Hospital in Paris.

“Humanity is entering uncharted territory in the phenomenon of depopulation, and it is a challenge that must be embraced by governments, industry, the education sector and the public to push for family friendly policies that encourage family planning,” Dr Boothroyd said.

The ASPIRE Congress at the Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre in Singapore has attracted more than 2,000 leaders from various disciplines in assisted reproduction to address latest advances and knowledge in fertility health.

NetJets, Inc. includes management and charter operator Executive Jet Management.

Concluding Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Warren Buffett said earlier today that he would recommend to the company’s board that Greg Abel assume his position as chief executive.

Abel is currently the vice chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.

He has been tabbed as Buffett’s successor for some time.

Berkshire Hathaway bought NetJets in 1998 for $711 million.

Buffett’s entry into the business aviation segment is widely credited for encouraging investment in the sector.

Kenn Ricci, chairman of rival Flexjet, recently talked about Buffett’s impact during an NBAA podcast:

‘We estimated we needed about $60 million to $80 million for core fleet buying used aircraft. We went out to the banks with my great idea…and maybe we had $7 million, $10 million in debt available…Then, in 1998, Warren Buffett bought NetJets. And every bank I had been to thought I was a genius all of a sudden. And they were all looking to get into the industry and we had $500 million. In some way, but for Warren endorsing our industry, I never would have found the debt capital to be able to build the inventory and go as fast as I did.’

The high-visibility Berkshire Hathaway platform has also promoted private aviation to a wider audience of businesses and HNW consumers.

NetJets programmatic offerings—guaranteed jet cards and fractional ownership—fill the gap between ad hoc charters and full ownership, encouraging more consumers to enter the segment.

At the end of 2024, NetJets had 9,106 employees.

Buffett and Airlines

In 2017, amid another round of airline investments, Buffett told shareholders, “You couldn’t pick a tougher industry.”

He also reprised his famous 2007 quote, “If a far-sighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.”

After his first airline investment in 1989, Buffett wrote, “In the case of our commitment to USAir, industry economics had soured before the ink dried on our check. As I’ve previously mentioned, it was I who happily jumped into the pool; no one pushed me. Yes, I knew the industry would be ruggedly competitive, but I did not expect its leaders to engage in prolonged kamikaze behavior. In the last two years, airline companies have acted as if they are member of a competitive tontine, which they wish to bring to its conclusion as rapidly as possible.”

Oxford defines a tontine as an annuity shared by subscribers to a loan or common fund, the shares increasing as subscribers die until the last survivor enjoys the whole income.

Buffett and NetJets

The private aviation business has proven to be as fierce and challenging to make a buck as the Part 121 airlines.

Berkshire Hathaway bought NetJets in 1998 for $711 million.

In 2010, Buffett wrote, “Even though NetJets was consistently a runaway winner with customers, our financial results, since its acquisition in 1998, were a failure.”

Buffett told shareholders that in his first 11 years of ownership, the private jet company incurred an aggregate pre-tax loss of $157 million.

Debt went from $102 million to $1.9 billion.

At the time, the legendary investor noted, “Without Berkshire’s guarantee of this debt, NetJets would have been out of business.”

In 2023, the late Charlie Munger told shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting, “NetJets has been remarkable. You can argue it’s worth as much as any airline now.”

American Airlines, the least valuable major airline at the time, was valued at around $9 billion.

For the industry’s dominant player, it put an exclamation point on what is one of aviation’s biggest turnarounds.

Last year, NetJets and its pilots agreed to a new contract.

It will grant cockpit crews an extra $1.6 billion in compensation over five years.

The move was viewed as an endorsement of NetJets and private aviation from America’s best-known and arguably most successful investor.

NetJets currently holds 2,000 options for new private jets from Bombardier, Embraer, and Textron Aviation.

This year’s Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting marked the second straight year that NetJets was not mentioned during the question-and-answer session.

NetJets Executive Moves

Last year, NetJets also quietly made an executive change, although it did not issue an external announcement.

Patrick Gallagher, NetJets’ President of Sales, Marketing, and Owner Services divisions, was named President of NetJets Aviation.

Sole trader Edd, was up against some of the largest corporations in the motor industry including Motul, Exol lubricants, Borg automative and KYP components.

He said: “I was really surprised, it was such a shock to be against the big boys and win.”

“Being sustainable is something I’m quite keen on and I’m hugely proud to be recognised on a national level.”

Edd, whose first job was delivering the Andover Advertiser, is now a renowned car consultant who travels around the UK and internationally to solve diagnostic problems when garages can’t figure out the issue.

With his work he has travelled to Milan, Geneva, Dublin, Sicily and around the UK but started to feel like ‘the mechanic with the biggest carbon footprint out there.’

He said: “Travelling everywhere, I became aware of my carbon footprint, and I started looking at what I could do to offset it and mitigate it.

“There are a lot of sustainability issues in this area that you can’t control but I’ve developed a real passion for it, and I strive to be more environmentally friendly in everything I do.""

One thing Edd does to reduce his environmental impact is that he offsets his carbon footprint via the Heathrow website when booking flights.

This allows him to compensate for his flight’s carbon dioxide production by purchasing sustainable aviation fuel.

READ MORE: Council 'reviewing policies' after Supreme Court's transgender identity ruling

To reduce the flight’s weight and impact, he also negotiates with garages to allow him to use their mechanical tools, allowing him to travel light with his diagnostic laptop and a small bag.

When he arrives at his destination, he doesn’t hire a car and instead will use public transport and walk as much as possible.

He said: “As a sole trader, there’s not one big thing I can do, but it’s just lots of little things.”

Edd noticed that his diagnostic laptop was generating large amounts of paperwork for each job, with sometimes up to 65 pages being printed for a bigger job.

He said: “It was producing reams of paper and using lots of ink which begins to mount up.

“It was mostly unnecessary and I was able to eradicate that.”

As the UK brand ambassador for Topdon who manufacture his diagnostic equipment, Edd was able to work with them to create different equipment which allows all the information which would have been printed to be turned into a digital report and emailed via Bluetooth instead.

Edd has also implemented smaller changes into his work, like using reusable gloves and car covers opposed to disposable ones.

His efforts to create a more sustainable motoring industry didn’t go unnoticed, and he was nominated for the Car and Aftermarket Trader environmental award by more than one source.

He said: “It was a big honour just to be there, and it was just little me sat there not expecting to win.

“The judges said they were impressed, and my passion for sustainability shone through.”

Edd has said he would love to support the awards next year, even if he is not nominated, as they are celebrating a great cause.",https://www.andoveradvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/19396011.jpg?type=og-image,N,,2025-05-03 14:56:25.948939

Die ADAC Luftrettung hat das weltweit erste Langzeitprojekt zum Einsatz von Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) im Luftrettungsbetrieb erfolgreich abgeschlossen. In einem dreijährigen Realbetrieb zeigten sich keine Einschränkungen bei Leistung oder Einsatzbereitschaft der beiden beteiligten Hubschrauber. Gleichzeitig wurde eine signifikante Reduktion von ultrafeinen Partikeln festgestellt. Das Projekt wurde in Kooperation mit dem Deutschen Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), Safran Helicopter Engines, Pratt & Whitney Canada und Airbus Helicopters durchgeführt.

Reduktion ultrafeiner Partikel im Flugbetrieb

Die Rettungshubschrauber „Christoph Rheinland“ und „Christoph Europa 1“ wurden mit einem SAF-Blend aus bis zu 38 Prozent nachhaltigen Rohstoffen wie recycelten Pflanzenfetten betrieben. Bei typischer Leerlaufleistung wurde eine Reduktion ultrafeiner Partikel um 44 Prozent festgestellt, bei normaler Einsatzgeschwindigkeit lag die Reduktion bei 33 Prozent. Auf den CO2-Ausstoß bezogen konnte über den gesamten Lebenszyklus des Treibstoffs eine Verringerung erreicht werden, da SAF fossile Bestandteile ersetzt.

Keine nachteiligen Effekte auf Technik und Triebwerke

Die eingesetzten Helikopter vom Typ Airbus H145 und H135 zeigten keine nachweisbaren Schäden oder höheren Verschleiß an Triebwerken im Vergleich zum herkömmlichen Kerosinbetrieb. Auch bei der Emission von CO2, CO und NOx wurden keine Veränderungen festgestellt. Die eingesetzten Triebwerke – Safran Arriel und Pratt & Whitney PW206B – sind derzeit für den Betrieb mit SAF-Mischungen bis zu 50 Prozent zugelassen.

Forschung und Entwicklung werden fortgesetzt

Die ADAC Luftrettung kündigte an, die Forschung weiter zu vertiefen und künftig einen höheren SAF-Anteil bis hin zu 100 Prozent anzustreben. Langfristig sollen auch synthetische E-Fuels (Power-to-Liquid) zum Einsatz kommen. Das Projekt startete im Sommer 2021 mit dem ersten SAF-Flug eines Rettungshubschraubers. Eine Ausweitung des SAF-Betriebs auf weitere Einsatzstunden ist geplant.

Kooperation mit Forschung und Industrie

Das Projekt wurde vom DLR mit einem mobilen Messlabor begleitet. Die Partnerunternehmen betonten die Bedeutung des Projekts für die Bewertung der Umweltverträglichkeit und technischen Verträglichkeit von SAF.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

INTERNATIONAL

Moving forward – The foreign ministers for the BRICS bloc, which met earlier this week, are looking forward to advancing the implementation of the 2024 BRICS Carbon Market Partnership agreement to strengthen collaboration among the members nations. The partnership will facilitate cooperation in the field of carbon markets, with a specific focus on capacity-building, the Presidency Declaration stated. The ministers also plan to establish a BRICS Laboratory on Trade, Climate Change, and Sustainable Development, to promote collaboration on mutually supportive approaches to trade and environmental policy. As well, the officials rejected unilateral, punitive, and discriminatory protectionist measures, not in line with international law, such as unilateral and discriminatory carbon border adjustment mechanisms (CBAMs), the statement added.

Backtracking concern – More than two-dozen investors who collectively manage £1.2 tln in assets have called on HSBC to reinstate its 2030 climate targets, which in February the bank said it would need to rely more on carbon offsetting to meet. At the same time, HSBC delayed its net-zero emissions targets for operations, travel, and supply chains to 2050. While the bank is also reviewing its targets for reducing financed emissions, and removed its chief sustainability officers from the executive board in Oct. 2024 as part of a wider reshuffle. The group of shareholders including Trinity College Cambridge and the Church of England is calling on the bank to urgently affirm it will continue to build on its climate progress rather than backtrack, and to undertake this process in dialogue with shareholders, said a spokesperson from ShareAction who coordinated the call to action ahead of HSBC’s AGM on Friday. (edie.com)

Unwanted advisory – The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) offered to advise this year’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil but talks did not progress, according to people familiar, reported by the FT. TBI, established by the former British prime minister in 2016, previously worked closely with both the UAE and Azerbaijan, hosts of COP28 and COP29 respectively, moves that proved controversial. In a recent report, Blair called for a reset of net zero policies in the UK, warning voters were being made to make too many ‘financial sacrifices’. His foreword to the report urged governments to change course on tackling climate change and said the COP process won’t deliver change fast enough. His critique of the annual forum would be viewed as deeply unhelpful by Brazil, one COP veteran said. People close to the Brazilian government have said it’s unlikely the TBI could win an advisory role with the country ahead of COP30, particularly given Brazil’s large and professional foreign service.

EMEA

Easy does it – Total nEHS-regulated emissions in 2023 were approximately 282.6 mln tonnes of CO2, a 2.6% decrease from 2022, according to an official report published by the German emissions authority this week. When adjusting for newly included fuels like coal, the reduction was about 3.8%, or 10.9 mln tonnes of CO2. In 2023, nEHS covered around 42% of Germany’s total GHG emissions, while the EU ETS covered around 43%. Combined, about 85% of Germany’s emissions were subject to carbon pricing DEHSt said. Main contributors to the nEHS emissions were from natural gas and diesel producers, each accounting for around one-third of emissions.

Investing in livelihoods – Singapore’s Temasek is helping the communities in Kenya’s Kitui and Baringo counties earn carbon credits through the plantation of 2.1 mln trees, local media outlet The Star has reported. Half of the carbon credits generated under the project will be issued to the investor, while 45% will be sold in the voluntary market and the revenue will be paid to the tree owners, it said. Initially launched in 2021, the project was stopped after a drought hit Kenya, affecting tree plantations. In Dec. 2022, Temasek extended a funding of $15,000 to Global EverGreening Alliance that went to the construction of the water sump-well, giving a big boost to tree-planting, livelihoods, and land restoration activities in the region.

Here are the facts – The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) has published a fact sheet on its legal CO2 removal and storage framework. The fact sheet provides information on current incentives and legal conditions for CCS and CDR technologies and is aimed particularly at project developers, buyers of negative emissions in the form of CO2 certificates, cantonal and municipal permitting authorities, and the interested public. It is available in German, French, Italian, and English.

Missing the mark – By lagging in carbon commodification, Gulf countries risk forfeiting significant revenue and losing access to critical funding for low-carbon technologies and fuels, according to Jan Haizmann of Zero Emissions Traders Alliance, in an opinion piece published for Zawya Projects. Gulf countries risk leaving money – a lot of money – on the table, he wrote, as they risk being left behind in scaling carbon finance. Moreover, they relinquish sources of funding for new fuels and technologies to meet their climate goals, Haizmann wrote.

Uncertain outlook – Chemicals company BASF reaffirmed its full-year earnings guidance on Friday, targeting 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and adjusted for one-off items of between €8 bln – €8.4 bln, up from €7.9 bln last year. During the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA fell 3.2% to €2.63 bln, broadly in line with market expectations. The German company warned the outlook was highly uncertain due to US tariffs and the unknown impact of how other countries respond. Net income in the Jan-March period dropped 41% to €808 mln. BASF plans to hold its 49% stake in two planned North Sea wind farms back to original owner Vattenfall, while retaining the Swedish utility as a renewable power supplier. The company is holding its annual investor meeting Friday. (Reuters)

Profit drop – Volkswagen’s first quarter operating profit for the core brand group dropped by 46.3%, due to EU carbon provisions and write-down on inventory related to US tariffs, the automaker said on Friday. The operating profit for the core brand group fell to €1.12 bln, from €2.08 bln a year ago, while its VW passenger car unit saw an 84.9% drop to €112 mln. In April, VW said it included a €600 mln provision for potential fines for missing European carbon emissions targets in first quarter results. (Reuters)

Carbon bomb financing – City of London banks have invested more than $100 bln into companies developing so-called ‘carbon bombs’ — huge oil, gas, and coal projects that would drive the climate past globally agreed temperature limits with hugely damaging consequences worldwide, according to a study by Leave It In the Ground Organisation (LINGO). Nine London-based banks, including HSBC, NatWest, Barclays, and Lloyds, have participated in financing companies responsible for at least 117 carbon bomb projects in 28 countries from 2016-23, the researchers found. If the projects advance, they will have potential to emit 420 bln tonnes of CO2, equivalent to over a decade of current global CO2 emissions. HSBC was found to financially support companies involved in the most such projects at 104 in total.

Rebranded – Climate finance company HeavyFinance, dedicated to advancing regenerative agriculture in Europe, has rebranded as InSoil to better reflect the firm’s broader focus on soil health and carbon credit generation, ArcticStartup reported on Friday. The company said it launched a €50-mln private credit fund to support projects with measurable climate impact, with the EIF committing €20 mln. The new capital will go towards widening access to its 0% interest Green Loans and accelerate the expansion of its Carbon Farming Program, aiming at enrolling 1 mln ha by 2026.

Green route – A ‘green shipping route’ between South Korea and the US will be established by 2027 as previously planned, according to national news agency Yonhap, which cited remarks by officials from the Korean ocean ministry. The two countries will cooperate to introduce eco-friendly ships, establish infrastructure for carbon-neutral fuels such as green methanol, as well as set up relevant standards. South Korea is also working with Australia to study the feasibility of another green shipping route, likely to be launched in the first half of 2029.

Adding clout – China has published a draft of the country’s first-ever environmental code, which should establish principles and guiding provisions, facilitate the integration of related legislation, and fill gaps in the current legal framework, state-owned news agency Xinhua reported. Currently, China has around 30 laws and more than 100 administrative regulations in the environmental field, including one announced last year for the operation of the national emissions trading scheme.

Full throttle – The world’s largest 100% battery electric ship is close being finished by a shipyard in Tasmania, Australia and will go on to transport passengers in South America, Renew Economy reported. The 130-metre, zero-emissions Hull 096 was built by shipbuilder Incat for South American ferry operator Buquebus. The vessel includes over 250 tonnes of batteries with an energy storage capacity of more than 40 MWh, four times larger than any previous maritime installation in the world. Incat will finish a final fit out, battery installation, energy system integration, and sea trials will take place later this year. The Hull 096 is the ninth vessel Incat has built for Buquebus, but the first that is zero emissions.

The outlet reported 38 lawmakers said they feared “parochial interests” would keep US President Donald Trump from fulfilling his promises to unleash American energy in a letter to House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo). An environmental research centre estimated in April that repealing certain tax credit provisions in the IRA could save $421 bln in federal spending by 2034.

Pivoting programme priorities – The US EPA has announced a new phase of organisational restructuring intended to improve operational efficiency and better align staff with the agency’s statutory responsibilities. The changes, made under President Trump’s executive order on workforce optimisation, affect the Office of the Administrator, Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, and Office of Water. Measures include the creation of new offices focused on state air partnerships, clean air programmes, and applied science, as well as the reallocation of over 130 technical and scientific staff to address backlogs in chemical and pesticide reviews.

Storage standards set – Ohio representatives introduced House Bill 170, which aims to establish a legal and regulatory framework for carbon capture and geologic storage in the state. The bill grants the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management exclusive authority over carbon sequestration activities, including permitting and oversight of underground injection wells classified under UIC Class VI. It establishes procedures for site permitting and consolidation, sets financial assurance and liability requirements, and outlines post-closure responsibilities. The bill also clarifies ownership of injected CO2 and limits liability for surface and subsurface property owners, except under specific conditions. The legislation follows the recent introduction of a similar bill by Ohio senators.

SAF research funding – A new bill in Minnesota would require the commissioner of the state’s Pollution Control Agency to pursue steps towards development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in St. Paul. HF 3280 would mandate the commissioner to contract an entity to design CO2 capture and transport infrastructure to produce SAF at the Metropolitan Water Resource Recovery Facility in the city. The bill would appropriate $300,000 from the state’s general fund in pursuit of this goal, inclusive of a report to be submitted no later than June 2029 that details capital and operation costs, workers employed, and an estimated volume of SAF to be produced annually.

Bills, bills, bills – Two California bills looking to increase transparency around cost impacts of transportation fuel regulations on consumers have recently progressed in the California legislature. Assembly Bill 555 (AB 555), which seeks to require California regulator ARB to submit quarterly reports to the Legislature detailing how its regulations affect fuel prices for Californian consumers, has been referred to the Assembly Appropriations Committee, with a hearing scheduled on May 7. Senate Bill 348 (SB 348), which has also been referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee, proposes to require ARB to revise LCF by Jan. 31, 2026 to reduce its financial burden on drivers. The bill mandates a full analysis of carbon credit pass-through costs, prioritises driver-focused policy changes, and calls for a balance between environmental goals and economic equity. It also requires a financial impact analysis whenever ARB adopts or revises regulations that directly affect drivers.

Shifting goalposts – Quebec modified the date it expects to publish and enact changes to its cap-and-trade programme on Friday. The province’s environment ministry (MELCCFP) updated its site detailing to indicate that it expects publication of proposed regulation or other legislative instruments in spring-summer 2025 and enactment of a by-law or other legislative instrument in fall-winter 2025. Previously those timelines listed were spring and fall 2025. Changes to the province’s joint carbon market with California have been long delayed, as market participants initially expected a key rulemaking document to be published in fall 2024.

Fuel rules – California’s ARB issued an advisory on Friday clarifying fuel compliance requirements for ocean-going vessels (OGVs) operating within 24 nautical miles of the California coast. The Ocean-Going Vessel Fuel Regulation mandates the use of marine gas oil (MGO) or marine diesel oil (MDO) with no more than 0.1% sulfur content, aligned with ISO 8217 standards. Vessels may use alternative fuels such as natural gas, methanol, and electricity if they are among those explicitly exempt from the regulation. Non-exempt alternative fuels like biodiesel or renewable diesel may only be used with an ARB-approved research exemption. The advisory also confirms that compliant pilot fuels may be used with exempt primary fuels and outlines the process for applying for research exemptions, including pre-approval requirements and emissions minimisation measures. Enforcement applies to vessels not meeting these requirements unless operating under an approved exemption.

Plugging away – Zefiro Methane, a US-based environmental services company focused on methane abatement, announced Friday that its subsidiary Plants & Goodwin secured new contracts to plug oil and gas wells from the Ohio state government. The contracts include ten wells located in Ashtabula county.

Cowboy country cash tracker – Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) announced a new interactive project map that allows stakeholders to pinpoint each of the 306 ERA-funded projects to-date throughout Alberta, across hundreds of cities, towns, and hamlets. The interface includes a series of dashboards and charts that provide a visual overview of ERA’s portfolio of nearly C$970 mln ($702 mln) worth of investments made over 16 years of advancing innovative technologies that contribute to economic growth and emissions reduction in the province.

Crossing fingers – Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said that she’s confident Dow’s C$9 bln ($6.5 bln) net zero petrochemicals project will proceed, even though the company said it was delaying construction until market conditions improve. The Path2Zero project, claimed to be the world’s first net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions ethylene and derivatives complex. It was planned to be located in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. Smith said that she spoke with CEO Jim Fitterling and said that it was just a matter of slowing down the timing of the project amid broader global uncertainty. (Calgary Herald)

Croaker encroachers – Two companies in Quebec were sentenced to pay C$35,000 ($25,300) in fines for causing damage to an area that is protected by the Species at Risk Act. The geographic area near Montreal is approximately 2 km squared and was protected by emergency order in 2016 to decrease habitat loss for the Western Chorus Frog and prevent activities that could harm the species. In 2023, Habitations Pilon and Les excavations Jacques Germain & fils were making changes to a billboard using heavy machinery, which caused damage to more than a quarter of the protected area – visible damage covered over 612 meters squared. Of the fines paid, C$30,000 will be directed to the Government of Canada’s Environmental Damages Fund and C$5,000 will be paid to the Receiver General for Canada.

VOLUNTARY

The future is now – IETA has published a paper on ‘The Digital Transformation of Carbon Markets’. In the report, the emissions trading association outlines its vision for what a digitally transformed carbon market could look like, suggesting that overall, the carbon market has generally been slow to fully embrace technological innovation. The organisation said that AI and other digital developments could speed credit generation, lower operational costs, and enhance market transparency and integrity.

New maps – Project proponents can now access Verra’s provisional versions of allocated deforestation risk maps for Cambodia and Guatemala. This is part of the standard’s new REDD jurisdictional methodology, within the module for Avoided Unplanned Deforestation (AUD). Under the module, proponents can conduct preliminary deforestation due diligence using this open-access data.

Growth plans – Imperative, a carbon project development company, has announced the appointment of John Nagulendran as Chief Growth & Investment Officer and member of the board of directors. Nagulendran will support CEO Scobie Mackay with identifying and executing the company’s capital and strategic growth plans. He will also lead strategic engagement with the company’s investors, governments, civil society ,and other stakeholders. Nagulendran previously spent 14 years at Switzerland-based Pala Investments where he was responsible for structuring and executing public and private equity raisings, project financings, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, and divestments in the natural resources and critical minerals sector. He was previously at Herbert Smith Freehills and Rajah & Tann.

AND FINALLY…

Dead men drink no CO2 – Spirits distributor Blue Caterpillar has entered a strategic partnership with UK-based Two Drifters Distillery to distribute the world’s first carbon-negative rum. Starting in June, the sustainably produced rums will be available in global travel retail and select domestic markets across the Caribbean and the Americas. Founded by Russ and Gemma Wakeham, Two Drifters operates entirely on renewable energy and removes over 1 kg of CO2 per bottle using carbon capture technology. Its eco-friendly practices also extend to packaging. The brand’s core range – Pure White Rum, Signature Rum, Lightly Spiced Rum, and Overproof Spiced Pineapple Rum – will be introduced through Blue Caterpillar’s network. The deal comes amid growing consumer demand for premium and environmentally conscious spirits. Both companies said the partnership responds to this trend, combining sustainability with high-quality rum.

The proposal—introduced as House Bills 4424-4425 and Senate Bills 235-236—aims to offer an income tax credit to those who produce or blend SAF for flights departing from Michigan, reports Michigan House Republicans.

SAF, made from renewable sources like corn or soybeans, is blended with traditional jet fuel to reduce carbon emissions from aviation. It is viewed as a cleaner alternative that can help the state meet future energy and environmental goals.

“Things are changing fast in Michigan,” said Rep. Jerry Neyer, a Republican from Shepherd. “Farmers are stuck in a ‘wait and see’ mode due to shifting federal policies. This plan gives them a clear signal: there’s a growing market for their crops in clean fuel production. It’s a practical way to cut emissions, grow the economy, and support our agricultural community.”

Sen. Sam Singh, a Democrat from East Lansing, said the measure is aligned with the goals of the state’s broader clean energy initiative. “It won’t be easy to decarbonize the aviation sector, but this is a smart first step,” he said. “By working with farmers and producers, we can reduce emissions while strengthening Michigan’s economy.”

Under the proposed legislation, producers and blenders of SAF would receive a $1.50 per gallon tax credit. Additional incentives would be available for achieving higher emissions reductions. The annual cap on incentives would be $4.5 million in the first year and $9 million annually over the following nine years.

Sen. Joseph Bellino, a Republican from Monroe, praised the plan for its potential to deliver long-term economic and environmental benefits. “This is a commonsense approach that supports local farmers and helps keep fuel prices stable, all while making aviation cleaner,” he said.

Il commercio verso gli Stati Uniti di questa preziosa risorsa, infatti, è bloccato.

L’ultimo carico diretto negli USA, che fino a pochi mesi fa erano il principale acquirente del prodotto, secondo Reuters sarebbe partito tra fine marzo e inizio aprile. Per comprendere l’importanza di questo bene, basta pensare che il valore dell’export cinese di UCO nel 2023 ha raggiunto i 2,64 miliardi di dollari (complessivamente 3 milioni di tonnellate), toccando livelli record. I trader cinesi, chiusa la via americana, cercano altri sbocchi – i dazi di Trump hanno portato anche all’aumento dei prezzi dei prodotti di Temu e Shein.

Richard Dickinson, capo del trading di Amarus Trading, una delle principali aziende del settore con sede a Shanghai, prevede che l’attuale situazione rimanga invariata nel medio termine. “Una parte delle esportazioni sarà dirottata in Europa e in nuovi mercati asiatici come Corea, Thailandia, Malesia e India”, ha dichiarato. Ma a cosa serve, effettivamente, l’olio esausto? Principalmente per la produzione di carburanti sostenibili, in particolare del Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Parliamo di una delle soluzioni più promettenti per ridurre le emissioni dell’aviazione civile – nel frattempo Airbus progetta l’aereo del futuro che, ovviamente, sfrutterà al massimo il SAF. L’Europa è in prima linea nella transizione verde e ha imposto una quota obbligatoria del 2 per cento di SAF nei carburanti per l’aviazione a partire da quest’anno, il che la rende un mercato particolarmente attrattivo per gli esportatori cinesi.

A quanto pare, sempre secondo le stime di Reuters, almeno metà delle esportazioni cinesi di UCO nei prossimi mesi saranno diretti verso l’Unione Europea. Come rivelato da Dickinson, pure in Asia le alternative non mancheranno: in Thailandia, Malesia e Giappone sono attivi o in fase di avvio almeno quattro impianti SAF, con una capacità produttiva annua complessiva di 700mila tonnellate. Un “fermento industriale” che potrebbe assorbire parte dell’UCO non più esportato negli Stati Uniti.

Senza considerare che la domanda interna cinese sta crescendo sensibilmente. Il Paese ha avviato nel 2024 diversi nuovi impianti per la produzione di SAF, tra cui quelli di di Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech, Haixin Energy Technology, Haike Chemical e Blue Whale Bioenergy. Dando un’occhiata alla ricostruzione di Reuters, la Cina consumerebbe già tra le 100mila e le 120mila tonnellate di UCO al mese per produrre carburante sostenibile, ma il volume è destinato ad aumentare con l’avvio di altri stabilimenti.

Insomma, in un contesto in cui il mercato globale cerca di ricalibrarsi, l’olio esausto – che di fatto è uno scarto – si sta trasformando in una risorsa strategica, capace di connettere politiche ambientali, economia circolare e geopolitica del commercio energetico.",https://images.everyeye.it/img-notizie/europa-invasa-dall-olio-esausto-cinese-opportunitA-ecologica-rischio-nascosto-v4-797430.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 13:56:13.769556

Ujjwala Yojana Expands Its Reach

The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), one of the government’s flagship social welfare schemes, has emerged as a cornerstone of energy access. As of now, the Ujjwala scheme has reached 10.33 crore households. Since its launch, nearly 222 crore LPG refills have been delivered to PMUY beneficiaries, with around 13 lakh refills being taken daily.

The government currently provides a targeted subsidy of Rs 300 per cylinder to all Ujjwala users. This initiative has also helped improve LPG usage among economically weaker households. Per capita LPG consumption has risen from 3.01 cylinders annually in 2019–20 to 3.95 in 2023–24. The current financial year is already showing higher consumption levels, with per capita use reaching 4.34 cylinders on a pro-rata basis as of October 2024.

Push for Biofuels and Ethanol Blending

In a major thrust towards greener fuels, India’s Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme has recorded a significant rise in ethanol supply—from 38 crore litres in 2013–14 to over 707 crore litres in 2023–24. This has translated into an average ethanol blending rate of 14.6 per cent during the current ethanol supply year, with blending already reaching 16.23 per cent as of December 29, 2024. Over 17,400 fuel stations are now dispensing E20 petrol (20 per cent ethanol).

The government also aims to develop 900 KTPA of Green Hydrogen capacity by 2030, with tenders for 42 KTPA already floated and another 128 KTPA in the pipeline. In aviation fuel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 have been set.

Additionally, the PM JI-VAN Yojana has been revised to include a wider range of advanced biofuels and extended till FY 2028–29. The amendments also allow brownfield and bolt-on projects to qualify for support.

Refining Capacity and Upstream Growth

India currently operates 22 refineries with a total capacity of 256.8 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA). Of these, 18 are in the public sector, three are privately owned, and one operates as a joint venture. The public sector contributes the lion’s share at 157.3 MMTPA.

The refining capacity is expected to grow to 309.5 MMTPA by 2028, driven by expansion projects in 11 PSU refineries and a new grassroots facility. In the upstream sector, 741 wells—including 132 exploratory and 609 development wells—were drilled in FY 2023–24. Natural gas production rose to 36.44 billion cubic meters (BCM) from 34.45 BCM the previous year. Additionally, 16,645 LKM of 2D and 15,701 SKM of 3D seismic surveys were conducted. A total of 12 new oil and gas discoveries were made under nomination and contractual regimes.

The government also acquired 42,944 LKM of 2D seismic data through airborne gravity and magnetic surveys, bolstering future exploration efforts.

Policy Reforms and Diversification

To attract new players and unlock smaller reserves, the government introduced the Discovered Small Fields (DSF) Policy in 2015. So far, three bidding rounds have been completed, resulting in 85 contracts, of which 55 remain active. Five fields are already producing, with cumulative output reaching 520 Mbbl of oil and 138 MMSCM of gas.

In the Coal Bed Methane (CBM) sector, 15 blocks have reached a production rate of 1.8 MMSCMD, with total production of 6.38 BCM and over $2.46 billion invested to date.

To reduce dependency on select countries, the ministry diversified its oil and gas imports during FY 2023–24. PSUs like IOCL and GAIL secured long-term LNG supply deals with ADNOC, UAE, locking in 2.7 MMT annually.

The government is also building strategic reserves. Under SPR Phase I, 5.33 MMT of storage was commissioned in Mangalore, Padur, and Visakhapatnam. Phase II, approved in 2021, adds another 6.5 MMT of underground storage at Chandikhol and Padur through public-private partnerships.

Road to Energy Independence

The government’s multi-pronged strategy to cut import dependency includes a broader switch to natural gas, promotion of biofuels like ethanol, compressed biogas, and biodiesel, and support for energy-efficient refinery processes. Ethanol blending alone has brought significant benefits: as of September 2024, farmers have received around Rs 92,409 crore in payments under the EBP programme. This has also led to foreign exchange savings of over Rs 1.08 lakh crore, crude oil substitution of 185 lakh metric tonnes, and CO₂ emissions reduction of about 557 lakh metric tonnes.

With a projected 20 per cent ethanol blend likely to contribute over Rs 35,000 crore to farmers annually, the government has also launched the SATAT initiative to scale up CBG for transport use.",https://www.bizzbuzz.news/h-upload/2025/05/03/1963608-energy.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 09:56:30.949686

Carton, Marina Efthymiou, James G",,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-89444-2_94,"The cost of HEFA-SAF and PtL-SAF is lower, but they are still more expensive than conventional jet fuel.
The LCA is used to evaluate the environmental impact of SAF production, ranging from the impact of feedstock production, sorting and refining to SAF production, transportation and use.
To be characterised as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) qualifying oriented, a biofuel should have a LCA result that meets certain sustainability criteria [10].
The ReFuelEU regulation requires fuel suppliers to blend a minimum share of SAF into all aviation fuel sold in the EU with the minimum share of SAF supplied at each EU airport.
Moreover, policy should support SAF uptake by also taxing aviation fossil fuel to close the gap and allow price parity.","There has been a lot of emphasis placed on the technological pathways for the production of SAF. By design, these SAFs are drop-in solutions, which can be directly blended into existing fuel infrastructure at airports and are compatible with modern aircraft [4] Having bigger diversity of pathways available is important as this allows SAF production from diversified feedstock. There are currently seven biofuel production pathways that are certified to produce SAF, which perform at operationally equivalent levels to Jet A1 fuel. The most widely used technologies of production that currently allow a 50% blend are:

Fischer-Tropsch (FT): This technology converts biomass or waste into liquid fuels using a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reactor.

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA): This technology converts vegetable oils or animal fats into liquid fuels using a hydro processing process.

Power-to-liquid (PtL): This technology uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, which is then used to synthesise liquid fuels.

Methanol to Jet technology can deliver e-jet fuel from renewable electricity, water, and CO2 or advanced biofuel from solid biomass feedstocks.

One of the biggest challenges for the further deployment of SAF is the cost, which is currently at least twice as high as conventional jet fuel (Fig. 1). During 2022, the average SAF price estimate was around USD 2,400/t, albeit with significant differences across regions. Moreover, the cost of producing SAF varies depending on the technology used and the feedstock.

The cost of FT-SAF is currently the highest, but it is expected to come down as the technology matures [5]. The cost of HEFA-SAF and PtL-SAF is lower, but they are still more expensive than conventional jet fuel. The availability of feedstock is also an important factor in the production of SAF [6]. Within a competitive market framework, increased production levels and expansion of the feedstock mix should exert downward pressure on SAF prices, progressively closing the gap to fossil-based jet fuel and easing the financial burden on airlines.

It should be noted that not all SAF are the same and the blended maximum with normal Jet fuel is currently 50%. Aromatics in jet fuel are needed for maintaining seal compatibility. A lack of aromatics can result in seal shrinkage which can lead to fuel leakage and seal failures with certain types of seals that exist in older legacy engine products, airframes, facilities and fuelling trucks. Fuel-seal compatibility is a key consideration for SAF certification and blending limits [7]. There is still a lack of clarity of research and current certification by aircraft manufacturers on the effect older aircraft and implications of going to 100% blending rates may have on the operating economics of older aircraft and the resultant maintenance costs for operators in developing or emerging economies.

It is likely that aviation will need between 330–445 million tonnes of SAF per annum by 2050. The scale-up will be a significant challenge. Up to $1.45 trillion worth of investment over the next 30 years will be required to develop this new energy system The Waypoint analysis (Table 1) provides scenarios about the SAF growth needed, but assumes that the jet fuel production plants come on line as exactly forecasted and have the required funding. This is a large assumption given the pressure from other modes of transport and the growth rate of air transport. There is still a clear production shortfall and the added factor of offtake agreements, which today are only in the forum of memorandum of understanding, raise doubts over each of these scenarios.

Current production intends to follow the F1 trajectory, but the expected policy environment in the next 2–4 years aims to shift towards the F1 high trajectory at a global level. The F1 high+ trajectory is very feasible, but extra policy initiatives are needed to reach that point: recent announcements suggest this could be a possibility towards the 2030 timeframe. Practicalities of financing, construction and production timelines around the world mean getting above F1 high + is unlikely before 2030.

Another pertinent point to the SAF discourse is the entire lifecycle analysis or Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) [8]. The LCA is used to evaluate the environmental impact of SAF production, ranging from the impact of feedstock production, sorting and refining to SAF production, transportation and use. LCA studies have shown that SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel [9]. The environmental impact of SAF depends on the technology used for its production and the feedstock sources. To be characterised as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) qualifying oriented, a biofuel should have a LCA result that meets certain sustainability criteria [10]. The Life cycle emission value is composed of two main elements: (1) Core Life Cycle Assessment emissions, which looks at emissions related to feedstock, fuel production facilities, transportation and fuel combustion and (2) Induced land-use change (ILUC) emissions which may require additional land use in the production with feedstock.

SAF without policy support would remain an underinvested private sector [11]. There are various policy options that can support SAF, such as blending mandates, excise duty reductions/exemptions, research, development and demonstration funding and financial de-risking measures. For example, the Biorefinery Assistance Program, established within the Farm Bill, provides a loan guarantee for companies that turn waste into renewable jet fuel. The most important legislative measures related to biofuels in Europe are the Renewable Energy Directive (RED), the Energy Taxation Directive and the Directive on the Quality of Petrol and Diesel Fuels (FQD). The EU’s recast RED II, which was ratified by the EU parliament in September 2023, sets out the EU's stricter bioenergy sustainability criteria and includes advanced biofuels & renewable fuels of non-biological origin for aviation as part of its higher renewable energy targets [12]. The regulation provides incentives, such as financial support for research and development, to promote SAF technologies and scale-up initiatives [13].

The intertwining of European and international regulations is catalysing a shift towards SAF in Europe's aviation sector. The ReFuelEU regulation requires fuel suppliers to blend a minimum share of SAF into all aviation fuel sold in the EU with the minimum share of SAF supplied at each EU airport. The minimum blend for SAF will be 2% by 2025, 6% by 2030, 34% by 2040 and 70% by 2050. The minimum share of synthetic aviation fuels will be 0.7% in 2030, 5% by 2035, 15% by 2045 and 35% by 2050.

Feedstock acquisition is a significant portion of SAF production cost and is linked to feedstock procurement, such as used cooking oils, agricultural residues, and dedicated energy crops [14]. Subsidies to the energy sector is a common practice and subsidies can support the supply of SAF (REF Efthymiou and Ryley, 2022). Direct subsidies for biofuels are only 6% (USD 38 billion) of the total amount and have mainly come from the EU (USD 11.4 billion) and the United States (USD 14.1 billion), whereas direct subsidies to fossil fuels exceeding the subsidies for renewable energy by a factor of 19 [15]. Europe needs to consider direct subsidies per output of biomass or input (indirect) subsidies for the production of biomass along with support to the full supply chain.

The technology and infrastructure needs for the scalability of SAF production processes like Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch necessitate substantial investment in technology and infrastructural development [15]. There is currently a need for increased investments in research to enable 100% SAF certification without blending requirements [16] which will allow wider deployment of SAF at scale and simplify consumption by operators with respect to infrastructure requirements at airports. Policy should further support Research and Development (R&D) of new technological pathways to scale up and deliver SAF.

In addition, regulatory measures like ICAO Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and net-zero emissions targets adopted by the aviation industry are important to support the uptake of SAF. Moreover, policy should support SAF uptake by also taxing aviation fossil fuel to close the gap and allow price parity.

This paper evaluated the SAF supply challenges to meet the forecasted supply of SAF, both from a mandated perspective, lifecycle analysis of fuel produced and from a feedstock cost. This paper concludes that central to the challenge will be price and availability of feedstock for the SAF quantities needed to fulfil current REFuelEU mandate. The paper also argued that the need for policy support and national government funding and incentives to build up SAF production infrastructure and stimulate supply.

Many challenges remain in the production and supply of SAF to meet the targets of 2050, with the price of SAF playing an important role. By a combination of scaling up of commercial PtL and SAF in general, the effect will be an improvement of lifecycle emissions performance as well as better economics for production. Despite the challenges, the outlook for the global SAF market is positive; with increasing demand for sustainable aviation solutions, combined with technological advancements and growing economies of scale, which are expected to drive the growth of the SAF market in the coming years and will help overcome price barriers in the long term.

The contribution of the paper is shedding light on the cost and production challenges that exist today and suggesting policy solutions that will allow the further deployment of SAF. More importantly, we want to highlight the need for effective policy support that considers effects like the Jevons paradox and the Green paradox of Sinn and approach decarbonisation policy in a system way.

The paper argues that further research and development into new production methods is essential for driving down production costs and discovering new, efficient production methods. By combining and prioritising these policy and incentive drivers, governments and institutions need to provide incentives for private sector participation, such as tax breaks or direct subsidies. The paper addresses the research gap of aviation decarbonisation by bringing together the policy and the free market performance of SAF highlighting the challenges.",https://static-content.springer.com/cover/book/978-3-031-89444-2.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 21:56:44.804292

Less than a year after announcing plans to establish a hydrogen-based aviation fuel hub at Pittsburgh International Airport, Pennsylvania-based natural gas producer CNX has quietly taken down the website on which it advertised the hub.

The move comes as the fate of the much-vaunted hydrogen industry — seen by the Biden administration as a way to power America while reducing climate-altering emissions — is in upheaval.

While a Biden-era rule dealt a blow to those in the gas and oil industry hoping to invest in hydrogen technology and offered greater financial incentives to the renewable energy sector, President Donald Trump is showing preference for fossil fuel-powered hydrogen. Meanwhile, the fate of those Biden-era tax credits — whether for renewable energy or fossil fuel — is up in the air as congress wades through the budget reconciliation process.

Under Trump’s guidance, the Department of Energy has indicated it plans to kill Biden-era funding for four renewable-powered hydrogen hubs in primarily Democratic regions while retaining funds for fossil fuel-powered hubs in mostly red states, such as South Dakota, Ohio and Kentucky.

California, along with Oregon, Washington and other regions, are on the Department of Energy’s “cut” list, according to Politico, which said it obtained a spreadsheet of the projects.

If the recommendations are ultimately adopted by the Trump administration, Pennsylvania would very much become a state divided. While a proposed hub in the Appalachian region that would run on fossil fuels is marked for approval, a hub mostly reliant on renewable energy near Philadelphia is marked for denial.

The seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs were a main plank of former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda, a $7 billion effort to establish a national network of hydrogen producers to slow the use of the fossil fuels largely blamed for global warming.

But with four of the hubs eliminated, the envisioned national hydrogen grid would become a patchwork, seemingly drawn along political lines and primarily powered by polluting sources of energy.

Julie McNamara, associate policy director for the Climate & Energy program at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists, said:

The hydrogen hubs program was intended to spur innovations and demonstrations on how best to advance hydrogen as a tool in the clean energy economy,

“Blatantly co-opting these funds for use as handouts to political supporters and favored polluters would be shameful, and fully undermine the program’s ability to achieve those aims.”

While the Pennsylvania hub fueled by natural gas would use methane to provide energy for the production of so-called blue hydrogen, the other hub would use renewable energy such as wind and solar to produce what’s known as green hydrogen. By itself, the burning of hydrogen does not produce carbon dioxide emissions.

CNX was originally involved in the former hub, known as ARCH2, but told the Pittsburgh Business Times in March that it had paused involvement in the project because of the uncertainty surrounding federal funding. CNX’s name was also deleted from the ARCH2 website.

CNX did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the hydrogen hub and the sustainable aviation fuel site in Pittsburgh.

A spokesperson for the airport said it,

Is continuing to move forward with its plans to become one of the first airports to have sustainable fuel production on-site.

CNX was initially one of 15 companies enlisted in the hub, with plans to contribute “low carbon” natural gas to power hydrogen production, which entails using steam to draw off the hydrogen atoms from methane molecules, an expensive and energy intensive process.

But the company’s evolving relationship with the hydrogen industry appears to have soured when the Biden administration finalized a long-awaited federal rule on a tax credit for hydrogen production called 45V.

That final rule, CNX argued, was “overly restrictive,” and failed “to create sufficient economic incentives” for the company to expand its production of methane released from abandoned coal mines, which it said was key to the growing hydrogen economy. CNX pitched its involvement in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel project in Pittsburgh as being dependent upon the outcome of the 45V rule.

McNamara said,

We saw the fossil fuel industry view 45V as a lucrative chance for profit,

“Not by truly reducing emissions, but by introducing loopholes that made it easier to qualify.”

CNX had previously lobbied for the intricacies of 45V to work out in its favor. A little more than a year ago, a CNX lobbyist pushed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office to lobby the federal government to ensure the Treasury Department’s hydrogen rule was lucrative for coal mine methane — a request to which the Shapiro administration agreed, Capital & Main reported at the time.

The value the rule gave to coal mine-derived natural gas came down to a series of arcane specifics in a formula that measures life-cycle emissions from beginning to end of the creation of a single kilogram of hydrogen.

CNX urged the Treasury Department to treat coal mine methane as carbon-negative with the assumption that it would otherwise leak into the atmosphere from inactive coal mines, releasing a more potent greenhouse gas than if it were captured and burned, which would release carbon dioxide. (Both are greenhouse gases, but methane is well understood to be around 80 times more potent in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe.) By ascribing to this captured methane a negative value, a tiny portion of it could be blended into a natural gas hydrogen feedstock and qualify for the highest tier of the 45V tax incentive, the same level as hydrogen produced with renewable energy.

But the final rule went against the pleas of CNX and companies like it, including the ARCH2 hub itself, which urged the Treasury Department to pass a methane-friendly rule in 2024, arguing it could “lead to a loss of $6 billion in private investments” otherwise and have “far-reaching consequences” for the hydrogen industry.

Sean O’Leary, senior researcher at the nonprofit think tank Ohio River Valley Institute, said:

It’s like the Treasury Department went out of its way to say, ‘We hear what you’re saying.

“And the answer is no,”

The ruling was seen as a win for environmentalists, who urged the Treasury Department to ensure that any projects receiving subsidies under the guise of being “clean” were in fact clean. They feared CNX’s proposal, and that of other fossil fuel producers, would’ve given natural-gas based hydrogen a tax boost equal to that for renewable, emissions-free sources of hydrogen.

How and whether the rule will be upheld by the Trump administration — which has shown strong support for fossil fuels and a general disdain for renewable energy — remains an open question, and one of concern to environmentalists. According to Bloomberg, the American Petroleum Institute, a national oil and gas trade group, has lobbied the White House to ensure fossil fuels can qualify for the highest tier of the hydrogen tax credit.

O’Leary sees CNX’s apparent exit from ARCH2 as a sign of the hub’s strained economics. In October, O’Leary authored a paper in which he noted that the hub had lost four of its development partners, while a handful of others were showing signs of financial stress.

O’Leary wrote,

This is not a resume that inspires confidence among prospective investors,

CNX’s reluctance to move forward signals a broader trend within the industry, O’Leary said in an interview with Capital & Main.

O’Leary said,

The wheels are coming off,

“Even after subsidies are taken into account, the economics still aren’t there to make many of these projects work.”

Another project development partner for ARCH2, KeyState Energy, is also showing signs of uncertainty. In February, a primary customer for its blue hydrogen, Nikola Corporation, a transportation company that had planned to use the hydrogen for a zero-emission truck fleet, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company plans to sell its assets.

KeyState CEO Perry Babb told Capital & Main the company had pivoted from its energy production project with Nikola to a new ammonia fertilizer project that has a committed customer, and will still rely on hydrogen and receive funds from ARCH2. The first payment from the hubs program has been doled out and KeyState will invoice for reimbursement soon, he said.

Babb said he still meets regularly with the remaining ARCH2 project partners, who are “all positive in expressing a way forward.” But he noted that, for years, he’s weathered regulatory uncertainty; the final 45V rule was the nail in the coffin for Keystate’s original plans to produce blue hydrogen under ARCH2. He said the company has also put its participation in the Pittsburgh Sustainable Aviation Fuel hub “on pause.”

He said,

Last May, I began to notice dozens of hydrogen projects being canceled,

“I had thought that it was essentially because the business case wasn’t sound.With the continued uncertainty around tax credits through the end of the Biden administration… we said, ‘That’s it. We’re done. We’re going to go where there’s a market that’s predictable.’”

While failing to find a partner in the Biden-era Treasury Department, CNX could soon turn to the state, where Gov. Shapiro is reupping a $49 million tax credit for hydrogen production as part of his “Lightning Plan,” a six-pronged portfolio of legislation designed to speed up the commonwealth’s clean energy economy.

Though supported by some state environmental groups, the plan caught the ire of others, like Karen Feridun, co-founder of the grassroots Better Path Coalition, who said in a statement that the Lightning Plan would “continue and even expand fossil fuel production.” On March 11, a group of Democratic senators and representatives introduced 12 cosponsorship memos, six in each chamber, carrying out Shapiro’s plan.

Feridun said of Shapiro in an interview with Capital & Main,

He’s going to do whatever he needs to do to try to keep [hydrogen] going,

“It’s a nice way to kind of provide cover for having a continued fossil fuel plan,” one that “sounds really good to voters.”

Should ARCH2 unravel, Feridun fears grassroots environmentalists would be tasked with tracking individual projects, without the cohesion of a hub offering guidance. Even so, she said there never was “a clear map that defined what the footprint of all of this was,” which left frontline communities in the dark.

Like O’Leary, Danny Cullenward, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said he now sees the hydrogen “hype” bubble beginning to burst. Though he believes hydrogen has an important, if niche, place in the clean energy transition, its economics don’t make sense in all uses unless heavily subsidized.

He said,

We basically set up a structure that said, at the end of this rainbow is a giant pot of gold.

And everybody said, ‘We’d all like to do that. That all sounds great to us

“I think now the cold, hard reality of, ‘Does hydrogen make sense? And in what applications would it make sense?’ is becoming a little bit more real.”

The whiplash of all this impacts Pennsylvania communities, many that are former oil, gas and coal towns learning that major projects they’d once planned for are no longer.

O’Leary said,

It’s immensely damaging,

“State or even county and municipal level governments, they’re making economic development choices based on these expectations.The distraction impact of what’s going on is just staggering.”

Commenting on the crude oil import outlook following recent US sanctions and the emerging tariff scenario, Sahney said the company was treading cautiously before signing term deals for Russian crude.","Indian Oil Corp. is looking to invest up to $11 billion over the next four-five years to expand its petrochemicals capacity as part of a business strategy in a shifting energy landscape, where demand for transport fuels could witness a slowdown, company officials said.

The expansions IOC is pursuing at its refineries would help in raising India’s biggest state-run refiner’s Petrochemical Intensity Index to as high as 15% by 2030 from 6%, officials added.

“The next phase of expansion, after the current capacity expansion in the refineries gets completed, we will go for, in a very big way, for petrochemicals expansion,” Chairperson AS Sahney said April 30 while releasing the company’s annual financial results.

IOC recently signed an agreement with the state government in Odisha to set up a petrochemicals complex at Paradip, which would be its largest investment at a single location. This will help expand IOC’s existing 15 million mt/year refinery capacity at Paradip.

The complex will have a dual-feed cracker and associated downstream units for producing a range of products, including phenol, polypropylene, isopropyl alcohol, high-density polyethylene, linear low-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and butadiene.

Key priority

Raising the petrochemicals intensity is the top priority for Indian refiners pursuing ambitious expansion strategies, government and refining officials said, as the sector is set to receive nearly $87 billion in investments over the next decade and account for more than 10% of the global petrochemicals sector growth.

A recent parliamentary committee report of the petroleum ministry recommended that India must expand its refining capabilities by diversifying the product mix and increasing focus on petrochemicals, biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, to help refineries adapt to changing market demand and reduce dependence on traditional petroleum products.

Of the several projects India is pursuing, about 58% of the increase is expected to come from brownfield expansions over the next three years, while the remaining would come from greenfield projects, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights’ analysts.

Key projects include IOC’s expansion of its Panipat, Paradip, Gujarat and Barauni refineries to raise their capacities and integrate petrochemicals units.

“While Indian refiners are betting high on petrochemicals, the industry is today seeing an oversupplied market. Even Reliance Industries Limited, the largest producer of petrochemicals in India, in their Q4 report, has admitted that significant demand and supply imbalances in downstream chemicals markets have led to multiyear low margins,” said Swathi Seshadri, energy specialist, petrochemicals, South Asia, at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Lower margins, crude imports

IOC’s gross refining margin for the fiscal year ended March 31 fell 60.2% year on year to $4.80/b, company officials said, reflecting lower returns from cracks in Asia’s third-largest economy. It had posted a GRM of $12.05/b in the previous fiscal year.

Refinery throughput at nine stand-alone refineries fell 2.4% year on year to 71.56 million mt in 2024-25 (April-March). In 2024-25, IOC’s domestic sales rose 3.3% year on year to 95.38 million mt, while exports fell 6.1% on the year to 4.92 million mt in 2024-25.

The company’s nine stand-alone refineries have a capacity of 70.25 million mt/year, accounting for 27.36% of India’s total refinery capacity. The refiner’s product portfolio includes gasoline, diesel, naphtha, jet fuel, petrochemicals and lubricants.

In the fourth quarter, IOC posted a 1.5% rise in refinery throughput to 18.55 million mt while its domestic sales rose 3.6% year on year to 24.6 million mt and exports fell 13% on the year to 1.34 million mt.

This market is experiencing consistent growth due to several key factors. The number of burn injuries is rising due to factors such as industrial accidents, domestic fires, and other hazards. Furthermore, advancements in treatment technologies and increased awareness and education about burn care contribute to this trend. Additionally, supportive government initiatives play a significant role in market development.

The demand for effective burn treatments is rising as the global population ages. Older individuals are more susceptible to slow-healing wounds and burn complications, which, in turn, increases the need for advanced burn care products. Moreover, technological advancements in burn treatment—including innovative burn dressings, biologics, and advanced burn wound assessment devices—enhance treatment efficiency and effectiveness.

By Based on products, the burn care market is categorized into five segments: advanced burn dressings, burn wound therapy devices, biologics, traditional burn care products, and other burn care products. Among these, the biologics segment is expected to register the highest CAGR during the forecast period. This growth is driven by the rising demand for advanced and effective treatment options for deep and complex burns. Biologics provide targeted healing, minimize long-term complications, and promote tissue regeneration, making them particularly suitable for treating severe burns. The increasing acceptance of these products among healthcare professionals and ongoing innovations in regenerative medicine are contributing to the strong and sustained growth of the biologics segment.

By Based on burn degree, the burn care market is divided into first-degree burns (minor burns), second-degree burns (partial-thickness burns), and third-degree burns (full-thickness burns). Of these, the second-degree burns segment accounted for the largest market share of the burn care market in 2024. This is largely because partial-thickness burns occur more frequently. These burns tend to destroy the epidermis and dermis; as such, they require the application of advanced burn care products, which drives consistent demand in this segment.

By geography, the market for burn care is divided into five main regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. North America dominated the burn care market in 2024 with the largest market share. This is primarily because countries like the US and Canada have well-developed healthcare facilities, supporting widespread access to advanced burn care products and treatments. The region also experiences a high rate of burn injuries. The availability of key players and constant investment in research & development further consolidate North America's position in the burn care market.

Specifically, camelina and safflower will be processed into low-carbon intensity oils and used as feedstock to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), a fully compatible drop-in replacement for conventional diesel fuel or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the decarbonization of air travel. This marks a significant step forward in feedstock innovation to produce renewable fuels in Europe.

Intermediate novel crops expand the available pool of low-carbon intensity feedstocks to produce renewable fuel, with emission reductions of up to 90% compared to conventional diesel. Repsol will utilize advanced technology in its industrial assets to convert these oils into renewable fuel, creating a new pathway for the development of renewable fuels in Spain.

The companies recently closed their previously announced transaction and are committed to ongoing research and development to explore further low-carbon feedstock opportunities to boost the supply of renewable fuels, including sourcing novel seeds from Spanish farmers.

“Renewable fuels are a fundamental pillar for Repsol on our road to becoming zero net emissions by 2050, and intermediate crops must play a key role in guaranteeing the supply of the low-carbon feedstocks necessary to produce these fuels. Our strategic alliance with Bunge, a world leader in the vegetable oils production sector, strengthens our capacity to achieve our shared vision of decarbonizing industry and mobility in the most efficient way,” said Juan Abascal, Repsol’s executive managing director of Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy.

The construction, maintenance and use of buildings accounts for 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions and as such the construction industry shoulders a huge responsibility when it comes to global sustainability.

Fortunately, forward-thinking architects, engineers and developers are redefining what it means to build with the planet in mind.

The new generation of sustainable construction projects are not only marvels of design and engineering, but powerful statements of what’s possible when creativity meets responsibility.

In this list, we explore ten of the most groundbreaking, environmentally-conscious construction projects from around the world.

One Central Park is a residential and commercial complex that stands as a shining beacon of green design. The building features more than 1,000 square metres of vertical gardens, a feat made possible by botanist Patrick Blanc’s innovative hydroponic systems. It also includes a massive heliostat—an array of motorised mirrors that redirect sunlight into shaded parts of the structure. These systems reduce heat gain, provide natural cooling and foster biodiversity in the heart of Sydney. It’s a visually arresting example of how technology and botany can work together to redefine high-rise living.

Khoo Teck Puat Hospital breaks the mould of utilitarian, resource-intensive healthcare environments. With gardens integrated into nearly every floor, it brings therapeutic nature into patients’ daily lives, supporting faster recovery and better mental health. Passive design features, such as natural ventilation and strategically placed openings, reduce the hospital’s energy use significantly. Rainwater is collected and reused for irrigation, and the landscaping is designed to support local biodiversity. This patient-centred approach proves that healthcare and sustainability can thrive side by side, making the hospital not just a place of treatment, but a sanctuary of healing.

This visually stunning structure is a testament to the power of natural materials. The bamboo sports hall at Panyaden International School was designed to blend with its tropical surroundings while minimising environmental impact. Bamboo was chosen for its rapid renewability and impressive tensile strength, offering the flexibility and durability needed for the structure. The building’s form takes advantage of natural ventilation and daylight, eliminating the need for artificial lighting or air conditioning. The project celebrates local craftsmanship and age-old construction methods, proving that low-tech solutions can yield high-impact sustainability.

CopenHill is where high design meets high ambition. Located on the outer edge of Denmark’s capital, it is a waste-to-energy plant that doubles as a public recreational space, burning non-recyclable waste to generate clean electricity and district heating for 150,000 homes. Its façade features aluminium bricks and glass, optimised for energy efficiency. But what really sets it apart is the rooftop—a ski slope, hiking trail, climbing wall and viewing platform that transform the plant into a local attraction. It exemplifies a new kind of multifunctional urban infrastructure, one that serves communities both environmentally and socially, turning utility into an experience.

The Bullitt Center isn’t just green—it’s regenerative. Built to last 250 years, it is one of the few structures worldwide to meet the rigorous standards of the Living Building Challenge. It produces all of its own energy through solar panels, manages water with a rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling system, and uses composting toilets to minimise waste. Constructed without toxic materials, the building also features timber certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. More than just an office space, the Bullitt Center is a bold statement on what the future of building must look like in the era of climate action.

Dubbed the greenest office building in the world, The Edge has become a symbol of what sustainable corporate architecture can achieve. With a BREEAM score of 98.36%, it holds one of the highest sustainability ratings ever awarded. The building uses an innovative array of 28,000 sensors to manage lighting, temperature and occupancy. Rainwater harvesting, solar panels and an aquifer thermal energy storage system contribute to its net zero energy profile. Deloitte, the building’s primary occupant, worked closely with developers to ensure the workplace supported both environmental and employee wellbeing. The result is a smart, self-learning building that sets a new global standard.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/ae2b408f8cefd92c74db642980016cf9:06735ee8cc5d3a08202cb4643af316f1/large-sustainability-top10-projects-cms-apr2025.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 19:56:24.131880

The company said the aircraft has the potential to cut fuel burn by up to 50% per passenger mile, while comfortably seating 250 passengers and flying up to 5,000 nautical miles.

JetZero's Path to Commercial Flight and Military Utility

JetZero's flagship aircraft, the Z4, is a high-capacity commercial plane designed to reshape both civilian and military aviation. With a demo flight scheduled for 2027, the Z4 targets long-haul commercial routes but also offers military potential, according to the company. The aircraft has multiple configurations including cargo transport and refueling tankers, two use cases that account for around 60% of the U.S. Air Force's total jet fuel consumption.

The Air Force's $235 million contract is meant to accelerate the development of JetZero's demonstrator aircraft and airframe technologies. JetZero is working closely with the Air Force, NASA, and the Federal Aviation Administration, which places it at the intersection of federal defense, aviation research, and commercial innovation.

In addition to military support, JetZero's commercial ambitions are gaining serious momentum, with United entering into a conditional agreement to order up to 100 aircraft, along with an option for 100 more.

Rethinking the Passenger Experience

Besides the focus on fuel savings, the aircraft's blended wing structure introduces a completely reimagined cabin layout. The company said that plans for the interior include larger, flexible seating, wider aisles, handicap-accessible lavatories, and dedicated overhead bins for each seat. The design also streamlines boarding, thanks to a wide main entrance and multiple aisles, reducing crowding and speeding up passenger flow.

The aircraft will run on conventional jet engines but is also compatible with sustainable aviation fuel blends. This opens the door to dramatic cuts in carbon emissions without requiring immediate overhauls of fueling infrastructure.

United And Delta Bring Commercial Aviation Expertise

JetZero's technology got a major boost when United and Delta airlines became strategic partners. While United has invested in the startup through its corporate venture arm, United Airlines Ventures, Delta supports the company with operational expertise and design collaboration.

Andrew Chang, managing director of United Airlines Ventures, emphasized the airline's vision: “If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network.”

Delta said it has also stepped in to co-develop the aircraft with JetZero, collaborating on everything from seating layout to operational integration. The airline's goal is to help push forward new technologies that align with its decarbonization efforts and improve the customer experience, it added.

JetZero’s Z4 is Optimized for Modern Airports and Airline Networks

Unlike other radical aircraft concepts, JetZero's Z4 is designed to integrate seamlessly into today's airport systems. The company is planning a strategic rollout that matches the operational reality of existing airline networks, avoiding costly infrastructure upgrades while maximizing adoption potential.

“JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience,"" Tom O'Leary, JetZero's CEO and co-founder, said.

With powerhouse partners like United, Delta, and the U.S. military behind it, JetZero may radically change the future of air travel. Between passenger experience upgrades, aggressive fuel efficiency goals, and sustainability targets, the startup is gaining altitude fast in both commercial and defense sectors.

While the Section 45Z production tax credit in the partisan Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was viewed as a replacement for the BTC, the U.S. biodiesel industry has been in real trouble since last year, when the BTC sunset loomed and no implementing regulations on the 45Z credit were even proposed let alone finalized in the two-plus years since the IRA became law. This delay along with disadvantages the industry faces as a result of implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard program have had significant adverse impacts on biodiesel producers, many of which are smaller facilities located in rural areas. Numerous plants have shut down, their workers laid off and assets lost.

“The expiration of the biodiesel blenders tax credit (40A) along with the lack of implementing regulations on Section 45Z have effectively shut the biodiesel industry down for all of 2025, with no end in sight,” said SABR Coalition CEO Joe Jobe. “This bill to extend 40A would turn the markets back on immediately because the implementing regulations for 40A are already in place and the markets understand them.”

The Section 45Z credit as it currently stands is not the answer. The incentive favors sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel over biodiesel. Many biodiesel producers will be fortunate to get a third of the value from the Section 45Z credit as they got from the BTC or be subject to significant red tape to potentially get a higher value. Meanwhile, some SAF producers may get up to $1.75 a gallon from the new incentive. In addition, much like European policies and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the 45Z credit discriminates against ag-based feedstocks like soybeans grown by American farmers. This improper discrimination is based on the failed modeling theory of indirect land-use change, but 20 years of real-world data shows those predictions never came true.

The two-year BTC extension would provide time for Congress to fix fundamental flaws in the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z and for the Trump administration to propose and finalize implementing regulations for the 45Z credit, which the previous administration had two and a-half years to do but didn’t. The SABR Coalition and its members believe retroactive reinstatement of the $1-per-gallon BTC, which has an anti-double-dipping provision allowing producers to claim either a credit under Section 40A or 45Z but not both, is critically necessary to not only revive the battered U.S. biodiesel industry, but to save it from extinction.

“The biodiesel industry is in a world of hurt,” Jobe said. “It’s not just the biodiesel industry that is largely shut down, but the entire value chain is shut down. Farmers can’t sell their beans to crushers, who can’t sell their soybean oil to biodiesel producers, who can’t sell their fuel to distributors and byproduct to glycerin refiners. And those fuel distributors can’t sell their fuel to truck-stop operators, and glycerin refiners can’t sell their refined material to numerous, wide-ranging industries that rely on it for their products, including sewage treatment plants that use glycerin and enzymes in their water treatment processes. So, this doesn’t just impact biodiesel producers—several separate industries are involved in the value chain, and they’re all being devastated by the biodiesel industry being shut down by government inaction.”

The SABR Coalition and its members are urging Congress to include the BTC extension marker bill in the budget-reconciliation process—the “big, beautiful bill.” SABR sent a letter to the House and Senate majority and minority leaders, in addition to the chairs of the House ways and means committee and the Senate finance committee, along with the White House, explaining how imperative it is to reinstate the BTC to restore commerce up and down the biodiesel value chain—from farmers to crushers, biodiesel producers, glycerin refiners, fuel distributors, truck-stop operators and other important sectors of the American economy.

Groups endorsing the 40A extension bill include:

– American Trucking Associations (ATA).

– Clean Freight Coalition.

– Energy Marketers of America (EMA).

– Illinois Soybean Growers.

– National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS).

– National Energy & Fuels Institute (NEFI).

– National Tank Truck Carriers.

– NATSO, Representing America’s Travel Centers and Truck Stops.

– Renewable Fuels Association (RFA).

– SIGMA: America’s Leading Fuel Marketers.

– Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition.

– Truckload Carriers Association (TCA).

“Decades of public and private investment—including from the soybean checkoff—to build out the domestic biodiesel industry is at risk,” said Ron Kindred, the chairman of Illinois Soybean Growers and a farmer from Atlanta, Illinois. “This legislation removes the uncertainty that is impacting everyone in the biodiesel value chain starting with soybean farmers, all the way down to distributors, retailers and consumers.”

Cosponsors of the bill include Reps. Andrew Garbarino, R-New York; Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota; Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania; Darin LaHood, R-Illinois; and Claudia Tenney, R-New York.

Now, he said, there is “resistance” to the Trump administration’s holds on Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities grants.
But he said the Trump administration’s decision to require groups that had already been made partners and gotten grants to reapply to continue in the program will slow down development and create uncertainty.
He also noted that the first Trump administration had pulled a dozen senior USDA executives from agencies into the business center it created and that the Biden administration had to “piece” back together management in the various agencies.
The current Trump administration organizational changes are on a much bigger scale, he said.","Robert Bonnie, the Agriculture undersecretary for farm production and conservation in the Biden administration, said Monday that he is “very concerned that USDA is being weakened” by the Trump administration’s staffing and budget cuts.

In his first public remarks on the Trump administration’s policies, Bonnie told the North American Agricultural Journalists at their spring Washington meeting that he is particularly worried about the loss of key personnel. Bonnie said he is prohibited from having direct contact with USDA officials for two years due to the ethics agreement he signed when he took his presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed post, but that he has learned that Tim Griffiths, the national coordinator of the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s sage grouse initiative, left USDA on Friday.

An email to Griffiths’ NRCS address in Montana on Monday resulted in the following automated reply: “I am sorry, but I am no longer available.” The response directed senders to another USDA official, and ended with “Your friend in conservation. Tim.”

Bonnie noted that the sage grouse initiative Griffiths led covers more than 9 million acres and “involves a couple thousand ranches in a voluntary, all incentive-based program.”Bonnie said it was terrible for USDA to lose “that type of leadership, creativity. Tim is one of many people lost.

“According to a biography on the Society for Range Management website, Griffiths has “spent his entire career working to achieve fish and wildlife conservation through sustainable agriculture and to reduce regulatory burdens associated with the Endangered Species Act. In 2011, Tim received the Secretary of Agriculture Honor Award for his work on the agency’s major sage grouse conservation initiative.” Bonnie also said that 75% of the federal government’s wildfire response “sits at USDA,” and that he is worried as the summer fire season approaches, the Forest Service is “going to lose senior people, the number of teams will be reduced.” Bonnie also pointed out that the Biden administration established relationships with Ducks Unlimited and other conservation groups, and that he worried that USDA will lose those relationships. Bonnie, who developed the Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities during the Biden administration but also worked at USDA during the Obama administration, noted that during the Obama administration farmers “ran the other way from climate policy,” but during the Biden years the government and the farmers worked together on agriculture and forestry. Now, he said, there is “resistance” to the Trump administration’s holds on Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities grants. The Trump administration has changed the Partnerships initiative into the Advancing Markets for Producers (AMP) initiative, and Bonnie has said he hopes that the administration will follow through on the original goals.

But he said the Trump administration’s decision to require groups that had already been made partners and gotten grants to reapply to continue in the program will slow down development and create uncertainty. Bonnie said he also worried about the impact of cutting back on USDA programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, and the loss of U.S. international leadership. He also noted that the first Trump administration had pulled a dozen senior USDA executives from agencies into the business center it created and that the Biden administration had to “piece” back together management in the various agencies. The current Trump administration organizational changes are on a much bigger scale, he said. On biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel, other departments are also involved, he said.The final guidance for the 45Z tax credit for biofuels was not completed because officials in an interagency process wanted to further examine a carbon calculator, but if the Treasury Department would put in place the peer review process established by the Biden administration, “farmers would be off the races on sustainable aviation fuel,” Bonnie said. But Bonnie said he is worried about the loss of leadership in all the agencies that play a role in biofuels. If the Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy Department and the Transportation Department pull back, “farmers are going to pay the price,” he said.

The awards, now in their second year, are presented by TheBusinessDesk.com in partnership with Clarion, Deloitte, and the Swinton Estate. They celebrate companies that are making lasting, positive contributions to society and the environment.

This accolade is a testament to Jet2’s dedication to creating a more sustainable future, demonstrating its leadership in the aviation industry. The company’s efforts were acknowledged for implementing clear sustainability strategies, achieving significant milestones, and continually working towards a greener tomorrow.

A Comprehensive Sustainability Strategy

Jet2’s updated Sustainability Strategy is built around three key pillars: In the Air, On the Ground, and In Resort. The strategy’s scope extends to tackling Scope 3 emissions across its supply chain, reflecting the company’s commitment to reducing its overall environmental impact.

One of the standout aspects of the strategy is Jet2’s new climate transition plan, which aims for tangible, immediate actions to reduce the airline’s carbon footprint. The company has set a target to reduce carbon emissions per revenue passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK) by 35% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. This ambitious goal means reducing emissions from 67gCO2/RPK in 2019 to 43.55gCO2/RPK in 2035.

Key Sustainability Achievements

Jet2 has made notable investments to decarbonize its fleet, with a firm commitment to purchasing 146 Airbus A321 neo aircraft. These new aircraft will result in up to 20% reduction in CO2 emissions per passenger and are 50% quieter than their predecessors, helping Jet2 achieve its carbon reduction goals while providing a more comfortable experience for passengers.

The company has also prioritized eliminating single-use plastics, replacing them with biodegradable and recyclable alternatives. This initiative alone has successfully removed 22 million single-use plastic items from Jet2’s supply chain each year.

To further enhance fuel efficiency, Jet2 has incorporated cutting-edge technologies like the split-scimitar winglets on 60 of its Boeing 737-800NG aircraft. These modifications have resulted in reduced fuel consumption through improved aerodynamic performance.

A Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

In its efforts to reduce its environmental impact, Jet2 has introduced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its operations. The company began using SAF at key airports such as London Stansted, Bristol, and Malaga, well ahead of the mandatory SAF requirements set to take effect in the UK and EU in January 2025. This proactive approach highlights Jet2’s leadership in the industry and its commitment to adopting greener fuel alternatives.

Ground Operations and Electric Equipment

Jet2 has also focused on electrifying its ground operations, with over 50% of its ground service equipment now fully electric. This effort significantly reduces carbon emissions from the company’s non-flying operations and contributes to the overall sustainability of its business.

Jet2holidays’ Sustainable Hotels Collection

In addition to its work on the airline front, Jet2holidays has expanded its Certified Sustainable Hotels collection. This growing collection, now with over 1,200 hotels, provides customers the option to choose accommodation that meets rigorous sustainability certifications, furthering Jet2’s commitment to responsible travel.

Recognized as an Industry Leader

In recognition of its efforts, Jet2 has earned a platinum rating for airline sustainability in the CAPA 2023 sustainability benchmark report, placing it among the top ten airlines globally for its sustainability performance. The airline ranks 4th out of 100 airlines in carbon emissions per revenue passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK), cementing its status as a leader in environmental responsibility.

A Social Value Framework for Communities

Jet2’s Sustainability Strategy goes beyond environmental considerations. The company has introduced a social value framework that focuses on supporting its employees and the communities where it operates. This framework addresses eight key areas: training and development, well-being, inclusion and access, health and safety (within the company), and jobs and skills, communities, partnerships and ethics, risk and safety (outside the company).

This holistic approach to sustainability not only benefits the environment but also fosters positive change in the communities Jet2 serves, ensuring that its efforts extend beyond business operations.

Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays said: “I am very proud of what we have achieved since launching our first sustainability strategy in 2021 and this award reflects the investment and hard work that has gone into that. We are basing our strategy on technologies and tangible actions that we know are available to us now, rather than what may or may not be available in the future, however we continually monitor to see where we can embrace new technologies. Our tangible steps include investing in new and more fuel-efficient aircraft, using SAF, launching a Certified Sustainable Hotels collection, removing millions of single use plastics from onboard our aircraft, and utilising technologies such as split-scimitar winglets. Our strategy clearly sets out our vision to accelerate our sustainability journey whilst supporting our colleagues and the communities where we operate, and we will continue to make this a critical area of focus.”

Jet2’s recognition at the Yorkshire Sustainability Excellence Awards is a well-deserved acknowledgment of its ongoing commitment to sustainability. From investing in new aircraft to reducing single-use plastics and promoting sustainable travel options, Jet2 is paving the way for a greener and more responsible aviation industry.

Off the pitch, the club is also making waves as a leader in sustainability efforts, positioning itself as one of the greenest football clubs in Europe.

As fans cheer their goals and victories, the club is also scoring major points in its mission to cut carbon emissions and adopt environmentally friendly practices. Through ‘The Red Way‘ strategy, Liverpool aims to reduce its environmental footprint and set new standards for sustainability in the world of elite football.

The Red Way: Liverpool’s Blueprint for Sustainability

Liverpool FC’s journey to sustainability officially began in 2021 with the launch of The Red Way. It is the club’s award-winning strategy to minimize its environmental impact.

The plan focuses on three pillars: people, planet, and communities. It aligns with 16 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. On the environmental front, Liverpool has set clear targets:

Halve operational carbon emissions by 2030

Achieve net zero by 2040

Achieve carbon neutrality in merchandising by 2030

In its 2023–24 Red Way report, the club outlined key achievements:

96% of all energy at club sites came from renewable or low-carbon sources

Football operations emissions were 100% offset

Overall carbon emissions fell 12.5% compared to 2022–23

A 15% reduction in emissions from its 2019–20 baseline

In transportation, LFC invested in Sustainable Aviation Fuel to eliminate all emissions from domestic flights. Its team buses are powered by Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil, cutting emissions by up to 90% compared to diesel.

The club worked on biodiversity and planted over 1,000 trees and hedges. They also added honeybee habitats with 60,000 bees. Plus, they grew half a tonne of food for their kitchens.

The legendary Anfield pitch is now fully recyclable. Old turf is repurposed into benches and other materials for community projects like the orchard at the AXA Training Centre.

The club’s operations have been recognized through ISO certifications:

ISO20121 (sustainability management)

ISO45001 (health and safety)

ISO50001 (energy management)

Liverpool has committed to global efforts by signing the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework and the UN’s Race to Zero. They pledge to cut emissions in half by 2030 and aim for net zero “as soon as possible.”

A Game-Changing Collaboration: Direct Air Capture with 1PointFive

In 2025, Liverpool strengthened its sustainability efforts. It partnered with 1PointFive, a subsidiary of Occidental that focuses on Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology.

Under this collaboration, LFC calculates the carbon footprint of its merchandise — from production to delivery — and purchases carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits to offset those emissions.

DAC is a cutting-edge solution that removes CO₂ directly from the atmosphere. Liverpool’s purchased credits are tied to STRATOS. This facility will be the largest DAC in the world that can capture 500,000 tonnes of CO₂ each year.

According to LFC Chief Commercial Officer Ben Latty:

“Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do at the club. Through The Red Way, we are dedicated to reducing our carbon footprint and driving positive change for our people, planet, and communities.”

This innovative step positions Liverpool as one of the first clubs to embed carbon removal directly into fan merchandise. Beyond offsetting, it also encourages supporters to make carbon-conscious choices, deepening fan engagement on climate action.

How Liverpool Compares: Sustainability Efforts of Rival Clubs

Liverpool FC is seen as one of the leaders in football when it comes to protecting the environment. But Liverpool is not alone. Two of its biggest Premier League rivals, Manchester City and Arsenal, are also working hard to make their clubs more environmentally friendly.

Manchester City’s Sustainability Initiatives

Manchester City has added many green actions to its Etihad Campus. Like Liverpool, it signed the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework and promised to reach net-zero emissions by 2030.

The club uses 100% renewable electricity in its stadium and buildings. It has installed over 10,000 solar panels at the City Football Academy and the Joie Stadium. Man City is also strong in waste management. It sends zero waste to landfills and recycles over 90% of waste on matchdays.

To cut travel emissions, the club encourages fans to take public transport or bike to games. The club’s buildings use energy-saving lights and water-saving systems. In 2023, Manchester City won the Sustainability Team of the Year award at the Football Business Awards for all these efforts.

Arsenal FC’s Green Efforts

Arsenal FC is another club known for its green leadership. It was the first Premier League club to put in a large battery storage system at its Emirates Stadium. This system stores extra renewable energy for later use.

The club aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. It has an interim goal of reducing Scope 1 and 3 emissions by 42% and Scope 3 emissions intensity by 52% by 2030, versus 2021 levels.

Like Manchester City, Arsenal uses 100% renewable electricity to power its Emirates Stadium and low-carbon gas to lower emissions. It has installed a 3MW battery storage system.

The club has cut down on single-use plastics in food stands, drink areas, and its shops. It also runs projects like tree planting and wildlife protection to help nature near the club.

Between 2019 and 2023, Arsenal cut its operational emissions by 20%. It signed the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework too. Through its “Arsenal for Change” campaign, the club encourages fans to take part in environmental activities.

All three clubs show a strong commitment to protecting the environment. Liverpool stands out because it uses carbon removal technology in its merchandise and leads in biodiversity work. Manchester City is strongest in waste management, while Arsenal leads in energy storage and community nature projects.

Overall, here is how the three Premier League clubs compare in terms of the following environmental metrics.

A Growing Collective Responsibility in Football

Liverpool, Manchester City, and Arsenal’s initiatives reflect a larger shift: elite football clubs are starting to recognize their role in fighting climate change.

Beyond clubs, fans, governing bodies, and sponsors are pushing for greener practices. The Premier League launched a Sustainability Strategy in 2023 and recently published an update. This plan urges all 20 clubs to cut emissions, reduce waste, and engage with communities.

The Sports Positive League Table ranks Premier League clubs based on sustainability. It helps set standards and boosts competition in ESG practices. Liverpool has consistently ranked in the top three, alongside Arsenal and Manchester City.

Beyond the Premier League, the push for greater environmental responsibility in football is becoming a global movement. Clubs worldwide are stepping up. They aim to cut emissions, reduce waste, and support sustainable practices on and off the field.

In Germany, VfL Wolfsburg stands out as a leader in sustainable football. The club, owned by Volkswagen, has been carbon neutral since 2012. This makes it one of the first in European sports to adopt large-scale environmental initiatives.

Wolfsburg uses 100% renewable energy, and they harvest rainwater to irrigate the pitch. The club also offers eco-friendly transport for fans and staff.

In the Netherlands, Ajax Amsterdam has embraced renewable energy and circular economy principles. The Johan Cruijff Arena is Ajax’s home stadium. It uses solar panels, wind energy, and a 3-megawatt battery storage system. This system is one of the largest in Europe and runs on recycled Nissan Leaf car batteries.

The arena’s green design includes LED lights, water-saving tech, and waste separation systems. These features help cut down the environmental impact of major sports events.

Moving to North America, Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer (MLS) has made strong commitments to sustainability. The club offsets travel emissions for the team. It also promotes zero-waste matchdays at Lumen Field. Plus, it partners with local groups for urban reforestation and community solar projects.

Sounders FC helped start MLS WORKS Greener Goals. This league-wide initiative focuses on making American soccer more environmentally friendly.

Even smaller clubs are stepping up. In England’s League Two, Forest Green Rovers has been widely praised as “the greenest football club in the world”. The club has set a global standard for sustainable sports infrastructure. Their fully vegan stadium menu, organic pitch, and solar-powered stadium lead the way.

These examples show that Liverpool, Manchester City, and Arsenal are part of a much broader shift. More clubs are using new solutions and sharing best practices. This helps football make a bigger impact on climate action.

A New Competition Off the Field

As Liverpool FC chases silverware on the pitch, it is also chasing leadership in sustainability off it. With bold targets, innovative partnerships, and award-winning initiatives under The Red Way, the club is setting standards that go beyond football. And as its Premier League rivals also raise their ESG ambitions, the competition for sustainability leadership is only set to grow.

Winning matches is important. But setting a strong example in the fight against climate change? That could be one of the most meaningful goals of all.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2279399373.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 17:56:25.247038

This sector is driven notably by government mandates, differentiating it from other renewable energy segments.

Countries like the U.S., Brazil, and India are promoting alcohol-based SAF derived from feedstocks such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, beets, and various oilseed crops to bolster their agricultural economies.

Many SAF projects are nearing their Final Investment Decision (FID), although they face some hurdles related to costs and technical challenges. Traditional oil and gas companies are expected to play a critical role in progressing SAF due to their established cash flow, existing infrastructure, and supply chain advantages. On the other hand, smaller independent producers actively seek investments to fund their initiatives.

Addressing the cost challenges of Sustainable Aviation Fuel adoption

One of the most significant hurdles to adopting sustainable aviation fuels is its cost. Currently, biofuel-based SAF is priced at two to three times the cost of traditional jet fuel. The cost of eSAF can be six to eight times higher. The aviation industry operates in a highly competitive environment characterized by slim profit margins and substantial liability tied to safety regulations, posing a considerable challenge. Spending two to eight times more on fuel is unsustainable for many airlines unless these expenses constitute only a small fraction of their overall fuel costs.

The initial European mandate requiring a 2% SAF blend may appear minimal, but the gradual increase will be significant in the near future. Consequently, one of the options for airlines is to pass this added cost on to consumers. For instance, if the average ticket price is $500, a 2% SAF blend could result in a $10 increase in ticket prices. This raises the critical question: would customers be willing to pay an additional $10 for a flight that incorporates 2% SAF?

A shared hope among the aviation industry and SAF producers is that SAF production costs will decrease over time achieving cost parity with fossil fuel generation in certain countries.

The SAF movement has commenced, promising to lower emissions by 80-90% compared to traditional jet fuel. However, the pressing challenge now is to accelerate SAF projects to meet net-zero emissions targets by 2050. To address this, both capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX), alongside technical challenges, must be overcome.

Several digitalization and electrification strategies can potentially expedite the progress of SAF projects, aiming to lower overall costs and enhance efficiency. These initiatives are critical to unlocking the full potential of SAF and achieving sustainability goals in the aviation sector.

Unified power & process management

Historically, power management and process automation have operated as distinct entities, a division that has hindered facilities from maximizing efficiency. However, the gradual electrification and integration of renewable energy sources into the power mix are driving a transformative shift toward the simultaneous management of both energy carriers—molecules and electrons. In the context of the eSAF pathway, green hydrogen is produced through energy-intensive electrolyzers, which account for approximately 60-70% of operational costs.

This convergence of decarbonization, digitalization, and the need to lower capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenses (OpEx) is prompting the industry to reassess traditional methodologies in process automation and power management.

Energy companies are increasingly recognizing digitalization as a vital enabler of their business objectives, eager to leverage its potential, even though the route to implementation can be complex. For many organizations, the logical initial step is to integrate power and process management systems. The subsequent phase involves applying this unified approach across the entire lifecycle of the plant to ensure continuous value optimization.

By merging power management with process automation during the design phase, facilities can achieve a digital interconnection of power and processes that facilitates critical data capture. Using this data in a digital twin, which simulates the plant’s operational lifecycle. Incorporating real-time performance data allows the integrated power and process digital twin to deliver significant advantages, including:

Up to 20% savings in overall CapEx while keeping projects on schedule

A 10% reduction in process energy costs

Up to a 35% decrease in direct CO₂ emissions

A 15% reduction in downtime

A 3% overall improvement in profitability

Electrification

Green electricity offers the fastest pathway to decarbonization, facilitating operational improvements in process duration and controls. Biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel plants share many characteristics with small chemical plants. They feature reactors, tanks, towers, compressors, pumps, boilers, and heaters. In a typical chemical plant, the primary power source remains predominantly fossil-based, accounting for 80-90% of energy use. The remainder is sourced from grid electricity (10-20%). In the case of eSAF, the integration of electrolyzers elevates electrification from 10-20% to a substantial 60-70%.

Significant opportunities exist to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through electrification, such as electrifying boilers, heaters, compressors, and pumps. By moving towards greater electrification within these facilities, companies can streamline operations and contribute to meaningful emissions reductions.

Microgrid optimization enhanced by AI

The integration of renewable energy sources and battery storage into the electrical grid, alongside traditional fossil fuel power, presents both challenges and opportunities for optimizing energy costs and advancing decarbonization efforts.

This shift allows prosumers to sell excess electricity back to the grid, enabling strategies such as arbitrage. Where they utilize low-cost energy for charging batteries and reselling during periods of high demand. As a result, microgrid optimization emerges as a crucial consideration for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) producers. Aditionally, Artificial Intelligence analyzes and optimizes energy sources, safety, and profitability.

Modularization and standardization

Currently, aside from the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway, SAF production pathways remain primarily in pilot or small-scale commercial phases. Developers and process original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are adopting a modular design approach based on three key factors:

Individual process units that easily transport and deploy near feedstock sources

Pilot plants scaled up economically by adding additional modules

Standardization of processes to reduce engineering and construction costs.

Carbon tracking

SAF off-takers will demand proof and certification of the carbon intensity associated with the SAF fuels they procure. In response, SAF producers must effectively track carbon intensity throughout the value chain, particularly during the production process. A comprehensive carbon index will be necessary to meet regulatory mandates and support claims for carbon credits. Tracking carbon intensity will involve monitoring the following:

the overall SAF produced

the carbon intensity of feedstocks

the amount of energy consumed during production and transportation

Biofuels and SAF are essential components of the energy transition. Their successful integration into the aviation sector requires concerted efforts to address cost barriers, leverage technological advancements, and ensure supportive policies are in place. Without these measures, the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in aviation remains a formidable task. The biofuels and SAF segments have already started and are accelerating ahead; digitalization and electrification is boosting this transition.",https://blog.se.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1167642565-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-03 01:56:33.045594

(PRL) has permanently ended conventional processing activities at Petroineos Manufacturing Scotland Ltd.’s 150,000-b/d Grangemouth refinery complex on the Firth of Forth in Scotland (OGJ Online, Sept. 13, 2024).

As of Apr. 28, Grangemouth refinery was no longer processing crude oil, PRL confirmed to OGJ in an e-mailed statement.

“[PRL] has invested £50 million (US$66.4 million) in creating a modern import and distribution terminal capable of receiving finished fuels by sea for onward distribution to customers around the country,” said Iain Hardie, Petroineos’ regional head of legal and external affairs.

“From 29 April, we will be importing all the products necessary to meet Scotland’s demand for transport fuels,” Hardie added.

Confirmation of the closure follows PRL’s late-2020 announcement of its intention to begin rationalizing capacity before ultimately ending operations in second-quarter 2025 amid a collision of global market pressures and the global energy transition, the combination of which left the 1924-built refinery unable to economically compete with more modern and efficient sites in the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Africa, as well as limited demand for key fossil-based fuels produced at the site (OGJ Online, Nov. 19, 2020).

PRL extended its appreciation to Grangemouth’s workforce, about 400 of which were set to lose employment with the refinery’s shutdown.

“Our colleagues have shown incredible commitment, dignity, and resilience during months of uncertainty regarding the future of this [refinery], through the consultation period, phased shutdown, and the start of refinery decommissioning. It has been a challenging period, but their professionalism has ensured security of fuel supply to our customers across Scotland and beyond,"" Hardie said.

PRL is a joint venture of INEOS AG’s Ineos Investments (Jersey) Ltd. (50.1%) and China National Petroleum Corp.’s PetroChina Co. Ltd. (PetroChina) subsidiary PetroChina International (London) Co. Ltd. (49.9%).

Grangemouth’s future

The refinery’s shuttering comes just more than a month after the UK and Scottish governments released results of a £1.5-million ($2-million) feasibility study executed by Ernst & Young Global Ltd. that outlines nine low-carbon and renewable energy business models most likely to attract private investment for securing the industrial site’s future (OGJ Online, Mar. 21, 2025).

Known as Project Willow, the plan—backed by £25 million from the Scottish government and £200 million from the UK government—includes investments such as:

Waste: Hydrothermal upgrading (breaking down hard-to-recycle plastics); chemical plastics recycling, acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) biorefining (breaking down waste material).

Biofeedstock: Breaking down Scottish timber into bioethanol; anaerobic digestion of bioresources and digestate pyrolysis; hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA), entailing conversion of Scottish cover crops into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel using low-carbon hydrogen.

Offshore wind conduit: Replacing natural gas with hydrogen; using low-carbon hydrogen to produce methanol for subsequent conversion to SAF; producing low-carbon ammonia from hydrogen for shipping and chemicals.

Both the UK and Scottish governments said they work with Petroineos to market the proposals set out in Project Willow and seek investor interest to support businesses and stakeholders in a goal to bring forward investible propositions for the site within the next 12 months.

Unforgiving workforce?

In the wake of the refinery’s closure, Unite the Union (Unite)—the country’s largest trade union—issued an Apr. 29 statement in which it warned political leaders of electoral consequences for failing the refinery’s workforce and the broader Grangemouth community.

“The UK and Scottish governments have utterly failed to protect refinery jobs at Grangemouth, and thousands face losing their jobs as oil refining in Scotland ends,” said Sharon Graham, Unite’s general secretary.

“There are projects like SAF production which can be accelerated to protect jobs, and…pave the way for Grangemouth to become a world leader in green aviation,” Graham said.

Unite cited an impact assessment by PwC that concluded the Grangemouth refinery makes an economic contribution of £403.6 million/year and that “almost 3,000 workers [relied] on the refinery’s operations.”

“[B]oth [the UK and Scottish] governments have effectively allowed China to shutdown Scotland’s capacity to refine fuel, as it hopes to use Grangemouth as an import hub,” Graham contended.

“Workers will not forget or forgive,” she said.

Graham pointed out that while Project Willow has identified nine possible projects for the site, “under [PRL’s] proposals, most of these [projects] would not start for several years after the site had closed and jobs had been lost.”

Unite believes many of the potential projects “could be fast tracked and implemented now,” including “a rapid move to convert the existing refinery to [SAF] production…starting with co-processing [of renewable feedstock with conventional crude].”

“Instead, not one job will be saved at the refinery, not one job will be created for years by Project Willow, and not one penny of the £200-million National Wealth Fund can be unlocked without private investment,” said Derek Thomson, leader of Unite Scotland.","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/05/6815029eacfa13120c4aaa06-250502petroineos_refining_ltd.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-05-02 19:56:37.683623

Sustainable Aviation’s Duncan McCourt said: “The Revenue Certainty Mechanism can’t come quickly enough.” But he noted: “SAF will be a global commodity and the UK will [have to] import large quantities.”

The aviation industry has a “credible” plan to reach net zero by 2050, Sustainable Aviation chief executive Duncan McCourt told delegates at the Abta forum.

But he acknowledged: “It’s not without significant challenges, not without significant uncertainty and no doubt there will be significant periods of discomfort.”

McCourt warned: “The political pressure is likely to increase. Aviation will be the biggest emitter [of carbon] by 2040, so it’s incumbent on aviation to do all it can to address this.”

He insisted: “The tools now exist to take carbon out of flying. All the elements of the technology already exist. We know the science of how to do it, but we haven’t got the scale.”

McCourt said aviation leaders fear that if the industry does not move fast enough, it faces “the risk of stranded assets and regulations restricting demand growth”.",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/074/Shutterstock-airline-fuel_Main.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 12:56:34.141048

Revenue dropped to $47.89 billion from $51.88 billion a year earlier. However, the company held firm because of strong oil and gas output and steady LNG profits, and more interestingly, its carbon credits investment.

The report revealed that production rose 4% year-over-year, averaging 2.55–2.57 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. New output from Brazil, the U.S., Malaysia, Argentina, and Denmark helped drive this growth. Gas prices stayed high, partly balancing weaker oil prices.

Power and LNG Boost TotalEnergies Amid Refining Woes

The LNG business posted $1.3 billion in adjusted net operating income. While LNG trading met expectations, gas trading struggled due to Europe’s volatile markets and geopolitical tensions.

Power operations also grew. The segment generated over $500 million in income and $600 million in cash flow. Key deals, like acquiring Germany’s VSB and investing in battery storage, supported this growth.

Still, downstream operations faced headwinds. Weak refining margins and issues at French and U.S. facilities cut into profits. Petrochemical and biofuel margins in Europe also declined, adding pressure.

Carbon Credit Spending Hits Record High

TotalEnergies spent $2 million on carbon credits in Q1 2025. That’s double what it spent in Q1 2024. This massive spending aims to cut emissions and reach its net-zero target by 2050.

Robust Backing for Nature-Based Projects

A significant segment of its investment supports nature-based solutions like forest protection, regenerative farming, and wetland conservation. By the end of last year, TotalEnergies had collected 13.7 million verified carbon credits. Each year, the company plans to invest $100 million in carbon projects.

Between 2025 and 2030, TotalEnergies will build a stock of 50 million carbon credits.

These projects can potentially deliver at least 5 million metric tons of CO₂e credits annually by 2030.

From 2030, the company will start using high-quality carbon credits to offset its remaining Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

The aim is to build a strong portfolio of trusted projects that support global rules and ensure the credits are real and long-lasting. Additionally, the company expects these projects to bring long-term environmental and social benefits.

It expects to reach 37 million verified credits by 2030 and 53 million by 2050. These projects could also generate $770 million for local communities.

$100 M Deal with Anew Climate and Aurora Sustainable Lands

TotalEnergies signed a $100 million deal with Anew Climate and Aurora Sustainable Lands last year. The project protects 300,000 hectares of forests across 10 U.S. states—Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

This partnership supports sustainable forest management and boosts the forests’ ability to absorb carbon. It also helps local communities by improving land use and preventing environmental damage. The carbon credits generated help offset the company’s remaining emissions.

What Makes Total Energies the Top Net-Zero Player

Last year, the LNG giant launched the “Our 5 Levers for Sustainable Change” initiative. The goal was to engage all employees in reducing emissions by boosting energy efficiency and adopting low-carbon technologies across its operations.

GHG Emissions Fell in 2024

The company cut emissions from operated sites by more than 36% in 2024 compared to 2015. Notably, over 200 emission-reduction projects helped slash 1.3 million tons of CO₂e.

However, recently the company raised its 2025 emissions goal to 37 Mt CO₂e per year. It aims to cut net Scope 1+2 emissions by 40% by 2030 (vs. 2015 levels). This also includes using 5 million carbon credits from nature-based projects, as explained before. Subsequently, these offsets will be used only for residual emissions from 2030 and consumed gradually at about 10% per year.

By end-2024, TotalEnergies had invested around $750 million in emissions reduction. These investments save 1.5 Mt CO₂e each year and cut energy costs by over $100 million annually.

However, emissions from flexible power generation rose slightly. This happened due to the addition of combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) in the U.S. and U.K., which support TotalEnergies’ low-carbon electricity expansion.

Still, overall emissions dropped 25% from 2015 levels.

The carbon intensity of upstream oil and gas assets also fell from 21 kg CO₂e/boe in 2015 to 17 kg CO₂e/boe in 2024.

All these figures make TotalEnergies one of the top industry performers.

Scope 3 and Scope 4 Emissions

In 2024, TotalEnergies helped reduce global emissions by 65 million tonnes of CO₂e through LNG sales, as many customers replaced coal with gas for power generation. Although gas increases Scope 3 emissions, it enables cleaner energy and avoids more emissions overall. These are classified as Scope 4 emissions.

The company also avoided 18 million tonnes of CO₂e in 2024 and is aiming for 150 million tonnes of emissions by 2030. This makes 90 Mt from LNG and 60 Mt from renewables while keeping Scope 3 emissions below 400 Mt.

Methane Emissions Drop Drastically

Methane emissions dropped from 64 kt in 2020 to 29 kt in 2024—a 55% cut. TotalEnergies beat its 2025 target early and now aims for a 60% cut by 2025, and an 80% cut by 2030 compared to 2020.

Digital Tools Boost Efficiency

The company is using digital tools to cut emissions smartly. In Exploration & Production, the ForCFR app links carbon forecasts with oil and gas output. In Angola, it helped cut 179 kt CO₂e annually by optimizing well operations.

Another example is: at the Normandy, Donges, and Feyzin refineries, the CarbOptim app tracks energy use in real-time and helps cut steam and energy waste.

2025 Carbon Intensity Reduction Target

TotalEnergies has raised its 2025 carbon intensity reduction target from 15% to 17%, aiming for a 25% emission cut by 2030. That means delivering the same energy with fewer emissions, or more energy with the same carbon footprint. Most of the progress will come from boosting clean electricity, cutting oil use, and growing gas and bioenergy.

Joins Google for Clean Energy

In January 2025, TotalEnergies teamed up with Google Europe to help power its Dutch data centers with 24/7 clean electricity by 2030. They’ll combine Google’s green power deals and add battery storage to handle renewables’ ups and downs. Similar deals are already in place with U.S. tech firms

Switch to Low-Carbon Power by 2025

TotalEnergies aims to power all its refining and chemical sites in Europe and the U.S. with 100% low-carbon electricity by 2025. This target will be achieved through initiatives like the Go Green project in Port Arthur, Texas.

Additionally, last year it achieved 26 GW of gross installed renewable electricity capacity, targeting 35 GW by 2025 and reaching 100 GW by 2030.

With this progress, TotalEnergies plans to become one of the top five global producers of renewable electricity (wind and solar), excluding Chinese companies.

Latest Projects

In April 2024, TotalEnergies started the Marsa LNG project in Oman. The plant will run on power from a 300 MW solar farm and emit less than 3 kg CO₂ per barrel of oil equivalent.

Also, the company approved the GranMorgu oil project in Suriname.

This all-electric project will use advanced tech to cut emissions below 16 kg CO₂ per barrel of oil equivalent.

Additionally, it aims to:

Become a key producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), targeting 1.5 million tonnes annually by 2030.

In 2024, the company’s gross biomethane production capacity rose to 1.2 TWh per year

Hydrogen Plans Take Shape

This is part of its long-term plan to decarbonize its operations and energy products.

TotalEnergies is expanding its clean hydrogen portfolio with multiple projects across Europe. In France, it’s building biohydrogen units at La Mède and Grandpuits refineries with Air Liquide, targeting annual CO₂ cuts of 130,000 and 150,000 tonnes respectively.

In the Netherlands, a 250 MW offshore wind-powered electrolyser in Zeeland will supply 30,000 tonnes of green hydrogen from 2029, reducing refinery emissions by 300,000 tonnes yearly.

Furthermore, tolling agreements in Belgium and France will see Air Liquide operate electrolysers in Antwerp (130 MW) and Normandy (100 MW), each producing 15,000 tonnes of hydrogen annually and cutting 150,000 tonnes of CO₂ per site by 2027.

Despite market challenges, TotalEnergies continues to invest in clean energy and climate action. Its rising carbon credit purchases highlight how big energy players are using voluntary carbon markets to decarbonize. Thus, its role for a lower-carbon future is of utmost significance.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_2079480685.jpg,N,,2025-05-02 12:56:38.464470

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Report Scope:

Based on fuel type, the biofuel segment is projected to account for the largest share during the forecast period.

Based on fuel type, the biofuel segment is projected to account for the largest share during the forecast period due to several primary factors related to the availability of feedstocks, technology maturity, and regulatory backing. Biofuel production is done from feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural residues, animal fats, and other biomass feedstocks. Technologies such as Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes are established and already qualified for use in biofuel production and are becoming more scalable and easier to retrofit into existing aviation fuel infrastructure. This technological availability provides biofuels with an important start over other types of SAF, which remain at more advanced commercial development stages. Additionally, biofuel production has a broad and increasingly sustainable supply chain, using waste and non-food biomass, which assists in solving both environmental and economic issues. Moreover, the lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reduction potential of biofuels up to 80% over that of traditional jet fuel renders it a strong near-term solution for airlines aiming to achieve carbon reduction targets. Airlines and producers of SAF are increasingly signing long-term offtake contracts for bio-based SAF, further supporting demand and investment in this area. All factors, such as technological maturity, regulation support, and the ability to reduce emissions short-term, make biofuel the dominant fuel in the SAF industry.

Based on biofuel conversion pathway, the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) segment is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.

Based on biofuel conversion pathway, the ATJ segment is projected to register the highest growth during the forecast period due to its high potential to meet the environmental and the aviation industry's demand for sustainability. This technology involves the conversion of alcohol-based feedstocks into hydrocarbons with a jet-range, yielding sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The appeal of the ATJ pathway is in its capability to utilize widely available and renewable alcohol feedstocks, some of which are derived from waste or lignocellulosic biomass, resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional fossil-based jet fuels. With regulatory demands and international aviation treaties, such as CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), the market for SAF will grow exponentially, thereby increasing growth in ATJ technologies. In addition, various investments in research and infrastructure are contributing to the commercialization of ATJ processes. Large industry participants and governments are entering strategic partnerships to increase production and simplify certification procedures for ATJ-derived fuels. The adaptability of the ATJ pathway to fit within traditional refining infrastructure and conformity with today's aircraft engines makes it even more attractive. With airlines and airports globally aiming to decarbonize, the ATJ segment will play a leading role in reshaping aviation fuel supply chains, thus making it the most rapidly growing biofuel conversion process.

US bill would extend expired biofuel credits

US bill would extend expired biofuel credits

New York, 1 May (Argus) — Legislation soon to be introduced in the US House would extend expired biofuel incentives through 2026, potentially providing a reprieve to refiners that have curbed production this year because of policy uncertainty. The bill, which will be sponsored by US representative Mike Carey (R-Ohio) and some other Republicans on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, according to a person familiar, could be introduced as soon as today. It would prolong both the long-running $1/USG for blenders of biomass-based diesel and a separate incentive that offers up to $1.01/USG for producers of cellulosic ethanol. The credits expired at the end of last year but under the proposal would be extended through both 2025 and 2026. The incentives would run alongside the Inflation Reduction Act's new ""45Z"" credit for clean fuel producers, which offers a sliding scale of benefits based on carbon intensity, though the bill would prevent double claiming of credits, according to bill text shared with Argus . The 45Z credit is less generous across the board to road fuels — offering $1/USG only for carbon-neutral fuels and much less for crop-based diesels — and is still in need of final rules after President Joe Biden's administration issued only preliminary guidance around qualifying. The proposal then would effectively offer a more generous alternative through 2026 for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and cellulosic ethanol but not for other fuels that can claim the technology-neutral 45Z incentive. That could upend the economics of renewable fuel production. Vegetable oil-based diesels for instance could claim the blenders credit and earn more than aviation fuels that draw from the same feedstocks. According to Argus Consulting estimates, aviation fuels derived from wastes like distillers corn oil and domestic used cooking should still earn more than $1/USG this year, conversely, since 45Z is more generous to aviation fuels. Extending the biodiesel blenders credit would also allow foreign fuel imports to again claim federal subsidies, a boost for Finnish refiner Neste and the ailing Canadian biofuel startup Braya Renewable Fuels but a controversial provision for US refiners and feedstock suppliers. The 45Z incentive can only be claimed by US producers. The blenders incentive is also popular among fuel marketer groups, which have warned that shifting subsidies to producers could up fuel costs. The proposal adds to a contentious debate taking place across the biofuel value chain about what the future of clean fuel incentives should look like. Some industry groups see a wholesale reversion to preexisting biofuel credits — or even a temporary period where various partly overlapping incentives coexist — as a tough sell to cost-concerned lawmakers and have instead pushed for revamping 45Z. A proposal last month backed by some farm groups would keep the 45Z incentive but ban foreign feedstocks and adjust carbon intensity modeling to benefit crops. Republicans could keep, modify, extend, or repeal the 45Z incentive as part of negotiations around a larger tax bill this year. But the caucus is still negotiating how much to reduce the federal budget deficit and what to do with Inflation Reduction Act incentives that have spurred clean energy projects in conservative districts. Uncertainty about the future of biofuel policy and sharply lower margins to start 2025 have led to a recently pronounced drop in biodiesel and renewable diesel production . President Donald Trump's administration is working on new biofuel blend mandates, which could be proposed in the coming weeks, but has said little about its plans for biofuel tax policy.

The Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil Market was valued at USD 27.2 Billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 92.1 Billion by 2034, rising at a CAGR of 13%.

The growing shift toward renewable energy sources is rapidly elevating HVO's role as a sustainable fuel alternative across industries. As global economies pivot to reducing dependence on fossil fuels, HVO is emerging as a critical solution for meeting decarbonization goals. Its ability to serve as a drop-in replacement for traditional diesel, combined with cleaner combustion and lower greenhouse gas emissions, is pushing demand among major sectors, including transportation, aviation, and industrial power generation.

Several governments, particularly in North America and Europe, are stepping up mandates to cut carbon emissions with policy frameworks like tax credits, blending mandates, and emission caps that directly encourage the use of HVO. These policies are opening new growth opportunities for HVO producers and reinforcing their importance in the global shift toward greener energy. Increasing public and private investments in advanced biofuels and next-generation feedstocks are further enhancing the market outlook as companies explore innovative ways to scale HVO production while keeping costs competitive. As more industries seek to meet ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals, the focus on clean-burning, low-carbon alternatives like HVO continues to intensify, fueling rapid adoption across both developed and emerging economies.

In 2024, the food and feed crops segment dominated the HVO market with a 68.7% share and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 12.4% through 2034. The widespread use of food and feed crops in HVO production is largely driven by their abundant availability, robust supply chains, and the well-established agricultural framework supporting them. Crops like soybeans and rapeseed are pivotal in supplying the oils required for efficient HVO production, ensuring a steady feedstock supply to meet growing biofuel demand. While concerns around food security and land use are gaining attention, policies across regions still back crop-based biofuels, further propelling market growth.

The market is also segmented by grade, covering premium grade, standard grade, basic grade, and specialty grade. Among these, the standard grade HVO segment generated USD 10.6 billion in 2024 and is set to grow at a CAGR of 12.7% from 2025 to 2034. Standard grade is increasingly preferred due to its balance of cost, performance, and versatility, making it an ideal choice for transportation, industrial operations, and power generation. It meets stringent emission norms while remaining economically viable compared to higher-end premium grades that are typically used in niche, high-performance sectors.

Regionally, Europe's Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil Market reached USD 10.3 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 12.6% through 2034. Europe continues to lead the global HVO landscape, driven by powerful regulatory backing and escalating demand for renewable fuels.

Our dedication to climate protection is exemplified through our insurance of innovative projects like the Montana Renewables facility in Great Falls, Montana.

Montana Renewables: A Leader in Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Sustainable Aviation Fuel provides a lower-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel. It is a ""drop-in"" fuel, which means it can be used with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure – a significant advantage in terms of simplifying the adoption process. As the second-largest producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the United States, Montana Renewables is at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF could contribute around 65% of the emissions reductions the aviation industry needs to be net zero by 2050. Making this happen will require a huge increase in SAF production. The Montana Renewables facility is set to expand significantly, with the help of a $1.44 billion loan from the Department of Energy (DOE). This expansion will increase the facility's production capacity to approximately 315 million gallons of biofuels annually by 2028, with a significant portion dedicated to SAF.

The Importance of SAF, Renewable Diesel, and Hydrogen

The growth of SAF is parallel to the production of Renewable Diesel (RD), as both use similar feedstocks and processes. Montana Renewables is also pioneering the use of green hydrogen in its conversion process, further lowering its operations' carbon footprint.

The expansion of Montana Renewables will boost SAF production and contribute to the supply of RD, providing low-carbon mobility fuels worldwide. This dual production capability is vital for the large-scale adoption of SAF, enabling airlines to commit seriously to its use.

SCOR's Broader Commitment to Renewable Energy

Our support for Montana Renewables is part of SCOR's broader strategy to foster a sustainable and resilient future. In 2023, we launched a dedicated New Energy Practice to support the ongoing energy transition needs of our clients. This practice offers comprehensive insurance solutions for a wide range of low-carbon technologies, including wind farms, solar farms, hydrogen1, carbon capture, and biofuels.

Looking Ahead

After this step, the fuel is further distilled to meet fuel quality specifications (namely ASTM 7566).
The final result of this distillation process is Sustainable Aviation Fuel.
Used to power aircrafts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has a similar makeup to conventional jet fuel, but a smaller carbon footprint due to the feedstock and technology it’s produced by.
As a drop-in fuel, SAF can be mixed in a ratio of up to 50% with conventional jet fuel to power modern-day airplanes without altering the plane’s storage, delivery, or fueling systems.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel SAF

is an alternative fuel that is being marketed as a solution to the aviation industry’s carbon intense nature. It is made by collecting waste materials such as cooking and vegetable oils, animal fats, and food scraps as feedstock. This feedstock is then pre-treated, removing any impurities and contaminants. The feedstock is then refined by removing the oxygen from the feedstock by adding additional Hydrogen in a process called hydrodeoxygenation, the resulting Hydrocarbons then go through a process called isomerisation which adjust the properties of the fuel. After this step, the fuel is further distilled to meet fuel quality specifications (namely ASTM 7566). The final result of this distillation process is Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Used to power aircrafts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has a similar makeup to conventional jet fuel, but a smaller carbon footprint due to the feedstock and technology it’s produced by. As a drop-in fuel, SAF can be mixed in a ratio of up to 50% with conventional jet fuel to power modern-day airplanes without altering the plane’s storage, delivery, or fueling systems.",https://scontent-iad3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/494280963_1197818072384680_5632909569345837980_n.jpg?cstp=mx678x452&ctp=s678x452&_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=b96d88&_nc_ohc=KIPtpE3FC_oQ7kNvwFMX_J0&_nc_oc=AdlxBdiYccvkaSdRPksKvQlpr3byVbYyfC4u1kC3Ot5kl2j3XeWohwTqigNbzjbsHzzwoAWvCrb7fLPfk5lxZOZH&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.xx&_nc_gid=MbKLjcA_EAJt0slAFNBvtA&oh=00_AfG7nH1WfDtbHITxvxpEC06ku3yoYzkPHII9KCUqSEKNKQ&oe=681AC895,N,,2025-05-02 10:56:41.128828

Among the top 10 largest planes in the world are aircraft made for military use, like the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, which the U.S. Air Force uses to haul weapons and supplies, but could carry 350 people if it were used solely for personnel. And there's the Stratolaunch, which looks like two planes connected at the wing. While it's larger than any other plane, is now only used for testing hypersonic flight systems, and was mostly created for rocket launches.

That leaves the Airbus A380 as the largest plane currently flying in 2025, making it one of the most iconic airplanes in aviation history. It carries a whopping 545 passengers if it's outfitted in a typical setup where there are four classes in the plane, but if you made every passenger fly in economy class, it could fit 853 passengers. And as you would expect from those statistics, this thing is massive. The wingspan is 261.8 feet and its height clocks in at 79.1 feet. It has four engines and two full passenger decks, so its interior measures 5,920 square feet — over twice the size of an average home.

The Airbus A380 has an interesting history. It was first manufactured in 2007, and production ceased in 2021, a span of 14 years. This is because demand was far less than Airbus had originally predicted. Instead of sitting among ever-greater amounts of people in a plane, passengers were much more interested in being able to take faster, more direct routes. Passenger jets with incredibly long ranges, like the A380's sister aircraft the Airbus A350, became much more en vogue. Also, the A380 faced strong competition from Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which has a similarly large body, and costs far less to operate.

Another hiccup came when travel slowed in the year 2020 with the rise of COVID-19. It's no surprise that a plane with such a high capacity wasn't as in demand when most people were avoiding travel due to the fear of spreading or contracting the illness. Airbus A380 planes were placed in the desert for storage during the early part of the pandemic, but came out of hibernation by the end of 2021, when travel increased sharply — part of why it's still possible to catch a flight on an Airbus A380 to this day.

In its production heyday, the Airbus A380 was ordered 251 times by 14 different airlines. It's most commonly seen in the Emirates fleet, as the airline purchased 123 of the aircraft, making it the largest customer. Between April 1, 2023 and the same date in 2024, FlightRadar24 reports, Emirates completed over 54,000 flights of the Airbus A380, over two-thirds of the total flights the aircraft took in that year. Many of those flights were going in or out of Dubai, the airline's hub, so you can consider that the most likely place to find this aircraft.

Emirates outfits is Airbus A380s with private first-class cabins and shower spas, giving a luxury twist to a vehicle originally made for hub-to-hub commuter flights. But the airline also says it's trying to become better for the environment. Airbus says the massive airplane performed a successful test flight in March 2022 using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel that was primarily made of used cooking oil.

""Compared with conventional jet fuel,"" says the U.S. Department of Energy, ""100% SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% depending on feedstock and technology pathway."" Airbus said in 2022 that all of its planes were certified to use a mixture of half sustainable fuel and half kerosene, with a goal of certifying them for 100% sustainable fuel by 2030.

Leeham News: We do a Corner series about the state of developments to improve the emission situation for Air Transport. We try to understand why development has been slow.

We have since we started in October last year looked at:

Alternative, lower emission, propulsion technologies, ranging from electric aircraft with batteries as energy source, different propulsion hybrids and new concepts for Jet-fuel and hydrogen gas turbine engines.

We have also reviewed recent research on the role of CO2, NOx emissions, and Contrails generated by airliners.

Last week, we summarized the present situation around SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

Before we proceed, we shall examine some facts about the scale of the emission/global warming influences from Air Transport.

Some data around Air Transport

When discussing the influence global Air Transport has on our climate and specifically the problem of global warming, and the actions we spend money on to mitigate these effects, it can be helpful to know some data around the issue:

We presently have around 25,000 airliners that fly routes around the globe every day (Figure 1). The aircraft flies from one to two missions per day, typical for a dedicated Cargo aircraft, to the usual two missions per day for a long-haul widebody (one long and one short filler mission). The single-aisle airliner, which is usually used for domestic flights, flies around six to eight missions per day, with the regional airliners completing around the same number of sectors daily.

The global Air Transport fleet consumes about 300 million tonnes of Jet-A1 fuel when flying these routes. As there is a mathematical direct relation between consumed fuel in a gas turbine engine and the generated CO2 (each kg of Jet fuel generates 3.16kg of CO2), we have a yearly emission from Air Transport of 950 million tonnes of CO2.

On average, each active airliner consumes 12 tonnes of Jet fuel and generates 38 tonnes of CO2 annually.

The amount of Jet fuel consumed per passenger mile varies depending on the aircraft type that flies the route. For the present generation of aircraft, midsized and large aircraft are about twice as efficient per transported passenger as a 19-seat commuter aircraft.

For a 30 to 50-seat aircraft, we have an efficiency which is about 160% to 180% lower per transported passenger mile than the latest generation single-aisle aircraft like the Airbus A321neo or the forthcoming Boeing 737 MAX 10.

Once we reach the 70 to 80 seat turboprops, we talk about a 125% difference in efficiency per passenger mile, which is also valid for the 100 to 130 seat regional aircraft.

What does this all mean for reaching our emission goals

We shall use these numbers in the next Corners to put the investments and actions done so far to lower Air Transport Emissions into a more global and longer-term perspective.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/By-Bjorn-Fehrm.png,N,,2025-05-02 04:56:14.506945

Geneva, 2 May 2025: Wizz Air Holdings Plc (""Wizz Air""), one of the most sustainable European airlines, announces passenger and CO2 emission statistics for April 2025.

Wizz Air carried 5.4 million passengers during the month of April, a 10.8% increase year on year. Seat capacity increased 11.4% YoY, resulting in a load factor of 89.8%, down 0.5ppt on last year's load factor of 90.3%.

During the month:

· With Easter falling entirely in April this year, our new fiscal year started strongly, with a seasonal increase in passenger numbers in the month, as anticipated. We expect this seasonal effect to normalise in the months ahead, consistent with historical trends. While overall demand was strong, load factor was modestly lower due to one-directional VFR traffic patterns during the Easter holiday period.

· The airline group launched its carbon roadmap. 'Flying Towards Net Zero'. This focuses on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a critical decarbonization lever. This could deliver a further 25% reduction in emissions by 2030.

· Wizz Air continues to be one of the lowest emission airlines, reporting a further decline in CO2 emissions per RPK in April, down 2.5% YoY, to 51.3 grams.

The fuel was delivered to the Katowice International Airport in Pyrzowice, which is an important step towards decarbonization of air transport in Poland. It is also a clear indication of the company’s readiness to provide comprehensive services in the new regulatory environment, which from 2025 requires the use of SAF at the level of least 2% of the total weight of aviation fuel at airports meeting the definition of EU airport.

SAF is an alternative to traditional fossil fuels. It is produced from vegetable oils, animal fats and agricultural waste, among others. The product can contribute about 65% of the emissions reductions needed for the aviation sector to reach net zero emissions by 2050*. In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 October 2023, as at 1 January 2025, all EU airports handling more than 800,000 passengers per year (or 100,000 tons of cargo) are required to use SAF at a rate of no less than 2% of the total weight of aviation fuel. Given these criteria, eight airports in Poland will be subject to this obligation.

Adam Sikorski, CEO of Unimot S.A, says:

At Unimot Aviation, we have strong logistics facilities that allow us to operate quickly and efficiently

We want to be not just a supplier, but a comprehensive partner for airlines and airports in Poland – supporting them in adapting to new regulations and building a more sustainable future for aviation. In the context of global efforts to reduce emissions, alternative fuels such as SAF will only grow in importance,

The delivery to the Katowice Airport culminated with UNIMOT Aviation Services refueling an Airbus A320 aircraft for the 23 April 2025 flight to Marsa Alam (RMF), Egypt. It was the first refueling of a cruise plane with SAF in Poland.

The plan, House Bills 4424-4425 and Senate Bills 235-236, would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which will be purchased and used for flights departing Michigan.
The SAF is then blended with regular aviation fuel to help reduce the amount of carbon that’s emitted into the atmosphere.
This bipartisan plan is a practical solution that will reduce emissions, promote economic growth, and take care of our farmers.
“I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state.","State Rep. Jerry Neyer and State Sens. Sam Singh and Joseph Bellino on Thursday announced their plan to jumpstart the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry in Michigan. The plan, House Bills 4424-4425 and Senate Bills 235-236, would establish an income tax credit for the producers and blenders of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which will be purchased and used for flights departing Michigan.

SAF is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel. It’s produced using bio-renewable products like ethanol or diesel which are manufactured from crops like soybeans or corn. The SAF is then blended with regular aviation fuel to help reduce the amount of carbon that’s emitted into the atmosphere.

“Whether we like it or not, things are changing in Michigan,” said Neyer, R-Shepherd. “New clean energy standards are quickly approaching, and pending policy changes from the feds have left corn and soybean farmers with a ‘let’s wait and see’ mentality. And who can blame them? The demand for their products could change with one press conference. This bipartisan plan is a practical solution that will reduce emissions, promote economic growth, and take care of our farmers. By incentivizing the private sector to produce and blend SAF here in Michigan, we can encourage cleaner skies and boost the agriculture industry at the same time.”

“This bipartisan plan will make aviation fuel more accessible and affordable and will help us realize the global vision we spelled out in our landmark Clean Energy Future plan,” said Singh, D-East Lansing. “Decarbonizing the aviation sector will not be easy, but we have to start somewhere. Working collaboratively with our farmers and producers will simultaneously reduce carbon emissions in our atmosphere and support our Michigan economy. By tackling this monumental task, we continue to prove that Michigan is a global leader in protecting our environment.”

The legislation would provide a $1.50 per gallon tax credit for those who purchase, produce, or blend sustainable aviation fuel. The credit is designed to directly support farmers and the businesses that develop and supply cleaner-burning, ethanol-derived aviation fuels. If greater emissions reductions are reached, additional incentives are available. There is a maximum incentive cap of $4.5 million annually in first year, and $9 million annually thereafter for the next nine years.

“Access to sustainable, reliable, and affordable energy products is critical to long-term economic growth,” said Bellino, R-Monroe. “I am proud to be part of a commonsense, bipartisan approach to enlisting Michigan farmers in the effort to provide cleaner aviation fuel in our state. It is a proactive solution that supports our local farmers, boosts our agriculture industry, and better ensures stable fuel costs — all while also helping cut harmful emissions.”

Created by TheBusinessDesk.com in partnership with Clarion, Deloitte and the Swinton Estate, the awards are in their second year and recognise businesses that are making permanent and positive changes to society and the environment.

Jet2 was recognised for taking significant steps to build a sustainable future, implementing clear strategies and achieving notable milestones.

The company’s updated Sustainability Strategy outlines these targets and objectives across three pillars: In the Air; On the Ground and In Resort, along with an enhanced focus on supply chain Scope 3 emissions.

The award recognises this work, which includes:

A new climate transition plan, focused on existing technologies and tangible actions that can be taken currently. This will see Jet2.com reduce its carbon emissions per revenue paying passenger kilometre (gCO2/RPK) by 35% in 2035 compared to 2019 (43.55gCO2/RPK in 2035 vs. 67gCO2/RPK in 2019).

Investing billions into decarbonising its fleet, with a firm order for 146 brand-new Airbus A321 neo aircraft. These aircraft reduce CO2 emissions per passenger by up to 20% and are 50% quieter than the aircraft they are replacing.

Reducing single-use plastics on flights by switching to biodegradable and recyclable alternatives. This initiative alone has substituted 22 million items of single-use plastic from the company’s supply chain each year.

Using new technologies to provide real-time operational data and analysis that drives fuel savings. Jet2 has installed split-scimitar winglets onto 60 of its Boeing 737-800NG aircraft, reducing fuel burn through improved aerodynamic efficiency.

Incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in its operations, including using SAF at London Stansted, Bristol and Malaga airports before the introduction of the UK and EU SAF mandates came into effect in January 2025.

Electrification of Jet2.com owned ground service equipment, with more than 50% of Jet2.com ground service equipment now fully electric.

Launching and expanding Jet2holidays’ Certified Sustainable Hotels collection, giving customers the option to choose accommodation that meets a sustainability certification – with over 1,200 hotels now in the collection.

Jet2.com has already been recognised as an industry leader in reducing carbon intensity emissions, achieving a platinum rating for airline sustainability in the CAPA 2023 sustainability benchmark report*. This means Jet2.com is among the top ten airlines globally for sustainability performance and ranked 4th out of 100 in carbon emitted per revenue passenger kilometer (gCO2/RPK).

In addition, Jet2 has also created a social value framework within its Sustainability Strategy which is aimed at supporting colleagues and the communities where Jet2 operates. This addresses eight areas of focus, four which are within Jet2 (training and development, well-being, inclusion and access, health and safety) and four which are outside the company (jobs and skills, communities, partnerships and ethics, risk and safety).

Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays said: “I am very proud of what we have achieved since launching our first sustainability strategy in 2021 and this award reflects the investment and hard work that has gone into that. We are basing our strategy on technologies and tangible actions that we know are available to us now, rather than what may or may not be available in the future, however we continually monitor to see where we can embrace new technologies. Our tangible steps include investing in new and more fuel-efficient aircraft, using SAF, launching a Certified Sustainable Hotels collection, removing millions of single use plastics from onboard our aircraft, and utilising technologies such as split-scimitar winglets. Our strategy clearly sets out our vision to accelerate our sustainability journey whilst supporting our colleagues and the communities where we operate, and we will continue to make this a critical area of focus.”",https://www.jet2.com/assets/img/favicons/favicon-32x32.png?etag=YsKwERf1ATeyItxXx7wBOQ==,N,,2025-05-02 07:56:30.831539

Additional information is available on the North Dakota legislature website.","North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong on April 15 signed a bill creating a low-carbon fuels fund that is designed to help the state’s ethanol producers lower the carbon intensity (CI) of the fuel they produce, increase local demand for corn, and help producers capitalize on the opportunity of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The legislation, SB 2333, was introduced by North Dakota Sen. Terry Wanzek on Jan. 20. The North Dakota Senate on Feb. 14 voted 42 to 2 to approve the bill. The state’s House voted 65 to 25 in favor of the legislation on April 4. Armstrong signed the bill into law on April 17.

The new low-carbon fuels fund replaces North Dakota’s current ethanol production incentive, which was a program designed to provide aid to the state’s ethanol producers during adverse times when ethanol prices were unusually low and/or corn prices were unusually high.

According to statements made by Wanzek during a congressional hearing held earlier this year, the state’s ethanol plants have all grandfathered out of the program are no longer eligible to receive funds. Yet, the production incentive has a continuing appropriation of 40% of all sums collected for the registration of farm vehicles, he said. As of late January, the balance of the program was approximately $6 million.

SB 2333 reallocates that funding to a new low carbon fuels fund that will distribute incentives to ethanol facilities for eligible projects to increase efficiency and decrease the CI of their production processes. Eligible projects under the program would include the construction of new infrastructure or replacement of existing infrastructure for CO2 capture and storage, beneficial use of CO2, energy efficiency enhancements, or ethanol yield improvements.

Distributions made under the newly created program are limited to 50% of the cost of eligible capital projects and may not exceed $3 million per biennium. In addition, cumulative distributions per facility are limited to $10 million over a 10 year period, beginning with the first distribution to the facility.

The state agency tasked with implementing the program may use up to $1 million from the fund to contract with an entity to develop a CI verification progress.

Additional information is available on the North Dakota legislature website.

‍ 2024 Production and Market Dynamics The 2024 production figures further underscore the urgency.
Less than 30% of planned SAF production projects have secured financing, indicating a major bottleneck in scaling the industry.
Regulators fear that ""book and claim"" might concentrate SAF production at a few sites, undermining broader market development.","As part of its broader renewable energy transition, Europe has set ambitious goals for the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). However, leading European airlines are now sounding the alarm: without significant increases in production, these targets may become unattainable by 2030.

‍

Current Status of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production

Three months after the European ""RefuelEU"" regulation came into force — requiring airlines to use 2% SAF from 2024, scaling up to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050 — the aviation sector remains concerned. Despite a doubling of global SAF production between 2023 and 2024, sustainable fuels still account for only 0.5% of total jet fuel consumption. Moreover, SAF remains two to three times more expensive than conventional kerosene, and supply levels fall far short of demand.

‍

A Troubling Outlook for 2030

According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, Europe could face a 30% shortfall in SAF supply needed to meet the 6% mandate by 2030. In addition, synthetic SAF (e-SAF) production is projected to miss its target by 45%.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has openly stated that it is now evident the SAF supply will not meet the 6% goal by 2030. Without immediate measures to boost production, he and other industry leaders argue that the timeline should be revised.

‍

2024 Production and Market Dynamics

The 2024 production figures further underscore the urgency. Instead of the anticipated 1.5 million tonnes, global SAF production barely exceeded 1 million tonnes. Moreover, purchase commitments for SAF dropped by 74% in volume last year, leading to a 45% decrease in SAF prices — yet this did not stimulate higher sales.

Neste, Europe's largest SAF producer, faced stockpiling issues and had to delay commissioning a new facility in Rotterdam. Meanwhile, 29% of airlines have taken no action toward their 2030 SAF goals, largely awaiting a potential price drop.

Investment in new production facilities remains sluggish. Less than 30% of planned SAF production projects have secured financing, indicating a major bottleneck in scaling the industry.

‍

Proposed Solutions: Virtual Fuel Certification

Airbus and other stakeholders are advocating for a ""book and claim"" system. This mechanism would allow airlines to purchase SAF certificates even if the actual fuel is consumed elsewhere. This would help carriers meet their regulatory requirements even at airports without SAF availability.

While the aviation sector broadly supports this idea, the European Commission has expressed concerns. Regulators fear that ""book and claim"" might concentrate SAF production at a few sites, undermining broader market development.

‍

Conclusion

Without rapid intervention to scale up SAF production and streamline regulatory frameworks, Europe's aviation sector risks missing crucial decarbonization milestones. Stakeholders urge policymakers to act swiftly, ensuring that the clean energy future for aviation remains within reach.

He thinks most farmers believe trade policies need to be reformed even if it comes with some hardship.
Higher corn and soybean prices in Brazil and Argentina will fuel further acreage expansion, and their trade ties with China strengthen.
The impact on U.S. soybean and corn farmers isn't limited to a short-term price shock: This is a long-lasting ramification that changes the global supply structure.""
Bulk corn accounted for 80% of exports in 1990 but only 60% in 2024, as value-added products exports grew.","The usual suspects are all here, and the pressure's building.

Mother Nature's at the bar ordering up a round of something, leaving us all wondering if this is going to be a two-drink happy hour or three-day bender.

Geopolitics recently added steroids to its workout regime. It's all jacked up and picking fights, collateral damage and consequences be damned.

The market is thriving on the drama, working the room, taking bets and counting the dollars that slip into his pocket.

If this were a movie, I'd say settle in and get some popcorn. This is going to be good.

But it's not. Farming is your livelihood, and if I were to ask, you'd probably say it's an important part of your legacy, too. It's a lot harder to revel in the drama when you're entangled in it, when your success or failure is on the line.

""You have to give it your best effort and hope that things shake out better down the road,"" said South Dakota farmer Tregg Cronin. He thinks most farmers believe trade policies need to be reformed even if it comes with some hardship. ""I think the universal thing is: Guys do not want a repeat of 2018-2019.""

Soybeans bore the brunt of President Donald Trump's first trade war with China, which resulted in $27 billion of lost agricultural exports and left farms reliant on ad hoc Market Facilitation Program payments to pay the bills.

A study by the American Soybean Association and National Corn Growers Association states a new trade war could cost corn and soybean farmers $5 to $8 billion in lost production value each year. Higher corn and soybean prices in Brazil and Argentina will fuel further acreage expansion, and their trade ties with China strengthen.

The study can't ""account for the permanent implications from the loss of the United States' reputation with trading partners, as evident in the fact that U.S. agriculture today is still rebuilding from the 2018 trade war. ... The impact on U.S. soybean and corn farmers isn't limited to a short-term price shock: This is a long-lasting ramification that changes the global supply structure.""

This is happening alongside another long-term change with implications for U.S. ag: declining global population, especially in our most established markets, Terrain Senior Rural Economy Analyst Matt Clark argued.

""The idea of producing as much as possible and exporting the excess will likely not be a financially sound business plan in 20-plus years,"" he said, pointing to the corn market's success as a blueprint for other commodities. The development of ethanol not only created new value-added industry but also reshaped the export market. Bulk corn accounted for 80% of exports in 1990 but only 60% in 2024, as value-added products exports grew.

Clark said the U.S. ""should continue to strategically develop new export markets to enable some long-term viability while recognizing the strong need to develop value-added products for both domestic and export markets.""

A worthwhile goal, present challenges notwithstanding. The Trump tariffs could accelerate this process if it helps establish new trading relationships rather than hinder them. Policy support for the development and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel would move the needle. But, as with everything the administration does, we'll have to wait and see what actually happens, not just which way the wind is blowing.

He’s citing a Michigan news source though, so he probably prefers fuel like his water. That’s overlooking the plethora of reasons we should move away from Jet-A for more than just the health and environmental standpoints, too.

Yeah, destroying millions of acres of farm land on the most productive land in the US (Midwest) for solar is a smart thing. Land that is not as susceptible to ""climate change"" Land that will never be usable for crops again.

I should have prefaced the ""BS"" by meaning politically driven. Alternative energy sources should be looked into.

Unlike rankings that rely on ambitious pledges or aspirational goals, 42kft.com’s methodology stands apart by emphasizing tangible achievements in environmental impact. While commitments like “Net Zero by 2050” are important, they serve as baseline expectations rather than distinctive factors in this ranking. Instead, the platform focuses on airlines that demonstrate actual progress in areas such as fleet modernization, sustainable technology adoption, and active environmental programs.

The airline rankings take several crucial factors into account, reflecting how far each airline has come in their environmental efforts. These include:

Fleet Age: A critical ranking factor, as newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft tend to have a significantly lower carbon footprint. However, global aircraft delivery delays, largely due to post-COVID supply chain issues and regulatory hold-ups, have impacted airlines’ ability to modernize their fleets at the pace they desire.

Fleet Renewal and Firm Orders: Airlines with strong commitments to renewing their fleets with more efficient aircraft are prioritized. The commitment to sustainability becomes evident through substantial orders for eco-friendly planes that promise to reduce emissions and enhance operational efficiency.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): Airlines are rated based on their investment in SAF, an alternative fuel source that reduces the aviation industry’s carbon emissions significantly compared to traditional jet fuel. The adoption and use of SAF is a key milestone for airlines aiming to reduce their environmental footprint.

Recycling and Waste Reduction Initiatives: Airlines demonstrating leadership in waste management, recycling efforts, and reducing waste sent to landfills are also given high marks. This reflects a holistic approach to sustainability beyond just fuel consumption.

Technological Innovations: The implementation of cutting-edge technologies aimed at improving fuel efficiency, reducing emissions, and enhancing overall sustainability practices are taken into account. This includes aircraft innovations, advanced ground operations technology, and initiatives to reduce the environmental impact of airport infrastructure.

Verified Carbon Offset Programs: Airlines that have adopted verifiable carbon offset programs—programs that offset their emissions through environmental projects—are recognized for their commitment to mitigating their carbon footprint.

Annual Environmental Impact Reporting: Transparency is critical in the environmental space. Airlines that produce regular, comprehensive reports on their environmental impact are considered more credible and are rewarded for providing clear insights into their sustainability strategies.

IATA Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) Compliance: Compliance with the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) environmental standards further strengthens an airline’s sustainability credentials. IEnvA certification reflects a commitment to global environmental best practices.

Investment in Electric and Hybrid Aircraft Technologies: As the aviation industry looks to the future, investment in electric and hybrid aircraft technologies is seen as a key element in reducing emissions. Airlines that actively invest in these emerging technologies are leading the way towards a more sustainable aviation sector.

42kft.com’s unique ranking system provides a reliable and in-depth snapshot of how airlines are progressing in their environmental efforts.
