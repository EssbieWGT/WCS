Moreover, aviation and maritime shipping share a common challenge to decarbonization – they carry extremely heavy loads and have very limited opportunities for refuelling.
The result is a more sustainable alternative to marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and gasoline.
“Honeywell continues to drive innovation in the areas that our customers need most,” Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, was quoted by Interesting Engineering.

Together, these two sectors account for a whopping 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and that figure is likely going to rise as more goods are shipped and more flights are booked each and every year. But a new biofuels breakthrough may provide a long-range fuel alternative for the heavy transport and aviation industries.

Emissions from the aviation sector have quadrupled since the 1960s, even as flying has become more than twice as energy efficient. And as incomes rise around the world and more and more people fly, emissions will continue to climb. Today, just 10% of the global population uses air travel, but that’s set to change in the near future as global economies continue to develop.

Maritime shipping, meanwhile, remains reliant on heavy fuel oil, also known as bunker oil, the second dirtiest fossil fuel in the world after coal. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, if the maritime shipping industry was a country, it would rank as the sixth-highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.

Moreover, aviation and maritime shipping share a common challenge to decarbonization – they carry extremely heavy loads and have very limited opportunities for refuelling. As a result, they need fuels that are extremely energy dense. As a result, “the energy density of oil-based fuels is particularly important in these sectors,” according to Barron’s.

Until now, biomass has not been a feasible option for its replacement, as “the supply of waste oil feedstock is not sufficient to meet demand.” However, Barron’s noted in its 2020 report that “biofuels from cellulosic crops and agricultural wastes are possibilities for the future.”

Well, the future is now. Honeywell, a conglomerate corporation headquartered in the United States, has unveiled a new system that can reportedly convert biomass into ready-to-use renewable fuels. The novel Biocrude Upgrading process technology is designed to run on byproducts from agriculture and forestry to divert waste into a cheap and abundant source of biomass. The result is a more sustainable alternative to marine fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and gasoline.

“With higher energy density than many current biofuel alternatives, this renewable marine fuel can extend a vessel’s range without requiring costly engine upgrades,” Honeywell said in a press release posted earlier this week.

The ability to pivot to biofuels without changing engine infrastructure is a critical selling point of the new product. Plus, Honeywell is sweetening the deal by reducing risk and streamlining deployment of the new technology through prefabricated modular plants. One of the things that makes shipping and aviation so hard to abate is that the infrastructure and investments that uphold the sector are “locked into high-carbon pathways for decades.” As such, alternative fuel sources, including biofuels, are needed “for disruption to break through carbon lock-in and path dependency” according to a paper published in the scientific journal Environmental Innovation and Societal Transitions in September of last year.

Making a biofuel that is easy to use and cost-effective is therefore critical to creating disruption and driving real change in the shipping and aviation industries. “Honeywell continues to drive innovation in the areas that our customers need most,” Ken West, president of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, was quoted by Interesting Engineering. “The maritime industry has a real need for renewable fuels that are immediately available and cost-effective. Our Biocrude Upgrading processing technology can be delivered in modular form, offering savings from the point of installation through to refining and use.”

The biofuels industry is coming off of several boom years in a row, but there is some concern that policy changes could put a damper on the sector. Continued free trade with Canada will be critical to the success of an endeavor like the Biocrude Updating technology, as the country is a critical source of feedstock from its agricultural and forestry sectors. The Trump administration got off to a rocky start in this regard, and only time will tell how future fuel standards and trade policies will unfold.

The key driver? Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a biofuel made from renewable resources that reduces carbon emissions and is integral to achieving Europe’s ambitious carbon-neutral goals. With recent regulations, such as the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, the aviation industry is witnessing a transformative shift in fuel consumption.

What Are SAF Mandates?

Since January 2025, European airports have been mandated to blend a minimum of 2% SAF with conventional jet fuel. This percentage will increase incrementally, reaching 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. These regulations are part of the European Union’s broader strategy to decarbonize the aviation sector. ReFuelEU Aviation, an EU regulation first drafted in 2021, aims to make SAF the primary fuel for aircraft departing from European airports, bolstering sustainable aviation while fostering innovation and growth in the biofuel sector.

The Role of SAF in Decarbonization

The EU’s SAF mandate plays a critical role in achieving the aviation industry’s carbon neutrality by 2050. Aviation contributes significantly to global emissions, and while carbon offsetting strategies exist, SAF provides a tangible solution for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. As SAF production scales, its environmental benefits will only increase, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and helping meet global climate goals.

Challenges to SAF Production and the Need for Investment

Despite the positive impact of SAF, production in Europe is not without its hurdles. SAF is still in its early stages of development, and Europe’s capacity to produce it is far from meeting the growing demand. The cost of SAF production is high, and regulatory uncertainty remains. While countries like the US have provided financial incentives to encourage SAF production, Europe’s reliance on regulatory measures, like the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, falls short in addressing the upfront investment challenges faced by SAF producers.

Europe’s SAF Supply Chain Needs Strengthening

The current SAF supply chain in Europe is still underdeveloped. While demand is increasing, the supply remains limited, creating an imbalance in the market. Europe’s refineries are adapting to produce SAF, but with geopolitical challenges and concerns about feedstock supply chains, such as the reliance on used cooking oil, the region faces risks that may hinder long-term sustainability. To address these challenges, policymakers must focus on strengthening the SAF supply chain through incentives, clearer legislative frameworks, and better financial backing.

Aviation Leaders Push for Clearer Legislation

The aviation industry is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but experts argue that more coordinated financial support is needed. Business aviation manufacturers and industry stakeholders have urged the EU to simplify regulations and provide stronger financial incentives. According to Kyle Martin, VP of European affairs at the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), a shift in focus towards innovation and competitiveness, rather than solely sustainability, is vital for achieving both goals.

At the same time, European authorities have expressed caution about the pace of SAF development. In February 2025, the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe warned that further EU support was necessary to meet the ambitious targets set for 2050. The alliance called for a more comprehensive SAF industrial policy, increased financing, and a reduction in the regulatory burden.

The Future of SAF in Europe: Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Next-Generation Fuels

As Europe looks to expand its SAF production capabilities, next-generation fuels are gaining attention. Power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, produced using green hydrogen and carbon feedstocks, offer a promising alternative to current SAF pathways. Europe is exploring these innovative solutions as part of its commitment to reducing reliance on traditional fossil fuels. While PtL fuels hold significant potential, they are still in the pilot phase, and scaling up production will require substantial investment and technological advancements.

Opportunities for Travelers: A Greener Way to Fly

For global travelers, the shift towards SAF means cleaner air travel options in the future. Major airports in Europe, including Paris Le Bourget, London Luton, and London Farnborough, are leading the way in SAF adoption. As demand grows, airports and airlines are working to ensure SAF availability for passengers. This transition not only benefits the environment but also aligns with travelers’ increasing desire for sustainable travel options.

By supporting the adoption of SAF, travelers can contribute to a greener aviation industry while enjoying the benefits of cleaner, more sustainable flights. As Europe’s aviation industry navigates these challenges and opportunities, the future of air travel looks brighter and more eco-friendly than ever.

Conclusion: Europe’s Bold Steps Towards a Sustainable Aviation Future

Europe’s commitment to sustainable aviation through SAF mandates is a significant step in the fight against climate change. While challenges remain in scaling production, the EU’s proactive approach is setting the stage for a greener future. By prioritizing SAF, Europe is not only reducing aviation emissions but also paving the way for a global shift towards sustainable travel.

With commercial aviation contributing an increasing share of global greenhouse gas emissions due to growing demand for air travel, sustainable fuel alternatives are seen as crucial for decarbonizing the sector, reported by Newsweek.

Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural and biological engineering at the university, explained that their research addresses both scientific and engineering challenges and allows the industry to take next steps.

He also stated that this technology could be applied to other types of oils to produce SAF and could even replace petroleum-based compounds used in plastics.

He described this discovery as having great potential for business opportunities and economic development.

The researcher's technology is based on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a thermochemical process that converts organic waste into crude oil. This ""biocrude"" is then purified and refined using hydrogen and catalysts, removing elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur to produce jet fuel, reported by Newsweek.

For the study, the team used waste from a nearby food processing plant. Every year more than 30 percent of food production worldwide is wasted, from farms, transportation, stores, and homes. When this waste ends up in landfills or water treatment systems, it emits greenhouse gases upon decomposition. Converting it into jet fuel reduces these emissions and recycles materials that would otherwise contribute to climate change.

The HTL process isn't limited to food waste; it can use a variety of feedstocks. According to the researchers, the process mimics the natural geological conditions under which fossil fuels form, compressing wet biomass under high temperature and pressure to produce biocrude.

The team's final SAF product successfully passed Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening tests set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration and meets all standards for use in aircraft engines without any admixtures.

According to a statement detailing the innovative approach, the researchers utilized a process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which employed a thermochemical reaction to convert ordinary food waste into a basic biocrude oil.
When discussing the versatility of their biocrude jet fuel, the team noted that the ability to use food waste as a fuel source is critical, since over 30% of the world’s food is wasted every year “at all levels” of the supply chain.
Although the food waste for experiments came from a nearby food processing facility, Summers’ team said that the HTL process can be applied to other organic waste products.
This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm.” The paper, “From food waste to sustainable aviation fuel: cobalt molybdenum catalysis of pretreated hydrothermal liquefaction biocrude,” was published in Nature Communications.","Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U of I) have successfully converted food waste into a form of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that they say meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends.

The team suggests that their approach, which helps reduce dependence on fossil fuels for aviation applications and redirects otherwise discarded food waste from landfills where it generates more greenhouse gases, could help the aviation industry meet its “ambitious” goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

According to a statement detailing the innovative approach, the researchers utilized a process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which employed a thermochemical reaction to convert ordinary food waste into a basic biocrude oil. This process is similar to how natural processes create crude oil, which is used to make a wide range of products, including automotive and aviation fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth,” explained the study’s lead author, Sabrina Summers, from the U of I. “It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil.”

Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I, said the goal of their research was to upgrade the biocrude oil generated during the HTL process into transportation fuels “that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure.”

The first step in the team’s process involved removing impurities from the biocrude oil. These unwanted contaminants included things like moisture, salt, and ash. Next, Summers and colleagues employed another process, called catalytic hydrotreating, to remove additional unwanted components of the biocrude oil, such as sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. The team stated that upon completion of these steps, the remaining biocrude was almost entirely composed of the hydrocarbons required to produce jet fuel.

The final step to make viable SAF involved catalyzing the hydrocarbons. According to the team’s statement, they tested several options before settling on cobalt molybdenum as the “most effective” catalyst to drive the needed chemical reactions. During the hydrotreatment portion, the research team also fine-tuned the catalyst and hydrogen loads, temperature, and overall retention time until they achieved the optimal conditions for producing the desired fuel.

Once the conversion process was completed, the team said they tested their final batch of SAF against the “rigorous standards” for quality and purity set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. As hoped, the team said their sample passed “Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests” and successfully met “all specifications for conventional jet fuel.” Notably, the team said their fuel met these standards without the need for any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

When discussing the versatility of their biocrude jet fuel, the team noted that the ability to use food waste as a fuel source is critical, since over 30% of the world’s food is wasted every year “at all levels” of the supply chain. Although the food waste for experiments came from a nearby food processing facility, Summers’ team said that the HTL process can be applied to other organic waste products. These include otherwise discarded materials, such as biowaste, algal blooms, sewage sludge, swine manure from farming, and other forms of agricultural residue that are high in base hydrocarbons.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonize jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” explained ABE professor and the study’s corresponding author, Yuanhui Zhang.

When discussing the potential applications of their research, Zhang noted that their work has helped solve the scientific and engineering problems associated with converting food waste into usable jet fuel, and it is now time for industry to “step in.”

“The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF,” he explained. “It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds, for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development.”

To highlight potential areas that could benefit from this type of biocrude-to-jet-fuel process, Zhang developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, in which he said SAFs provide a valuable contribution to circularity.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away,” he explained. “In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm.”

He said the goal should be clearly reflected in the conference’s final declaration.

The proposal builds on recent analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which estimates that global output of biofuels and synthetic fuels could reach 28 exajoules by 2035, four times today’s levels, if existing policies are fully implemented. Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3 percent of global energy consumption, with nearly 80 percent derived from liquid biofuels.

The proposal builds on recent analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which estimates that global output of biofuels and synthetic fuels could reach 28 exajoules by 2035, four times today’s levels, if existing policies are fully implemented. Currently, sustainable fuels account for only 1.3 percent of global energy consumption, with nearly 80 percent derived from liquid biofuels.

According to the IEA, these fuels have already helped cut global oil demand by 2.5 million barrels per day in 2024. They are also seen as one of the few practical options to decarbonize sectors that are hard to electrify, such as aviation, shipping, and heavy industry, while reducing countries’ reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Brazil, host of the upcoming COP and the world’s largest bioethanol producer, intends to make the summit a launchpad for an international coalition on sustainable fuels.

High costs remain a hurdle

Despite their potential, sustainable fuels still face major economic obstacles. The IEA estimates that biofuels currently cost 2.7 to 3.8 times more than conventional fossil fuels.

Even so, the impact on consumers would be limited, given the small blending ratios and the relatively low share of energy costs in final goods. Incorporating 15 percent of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into jet fuel, for instance, would raise ticket prices by only 5 to 7 percent, according to the agency.

The agency recommends bold policy measures combining production incentives with the integration of biofuels into carbon markets.

Meeting global production targets will also require massive investment, about $1.5 trillion between 2024 and 2035 under the IEA’s accelerated scenario. The agency recommends bold policy measures combining production incentives with the integration of biofuels into carbon markets.

Yet market signals remain mixed. Shell and BP recently scrapped bioenergy projects in Rotterdam, citing unfavorable economic conditions. For IRENA, such setbacks highlight the need for stable, coordinated international policies to attract capital and build investor confidence.

If governments can agree on a shared pathway and create supportive market conditions, biofuels could become a cornerstone of the global energy transition in hard-to-abate sectors. Without binding commitments, however, IRENA warns that the promise of sustainable fuels risks remaining symbolic.

La Camera said he hopes COP30 will mark the moment when biofuels move from rhetoric to action, driving a transition that blends technological progress with social equity.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/3d73084984522720ff642af4fe747b0b_S.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 13:16:35.502128

Strange as it might sound, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign believe that they’ve figured out a process to make that unlikely scenario a reality–at least on a small scale.

Writing this week in Nature Communications, the agricultural engineers outlined a strategy for taking excess food waste, converting it into biofuel, and then “upgrading” that fuel into jet fuel that can go straight into a plane without requiring additional changes to the aircraft’s infrastructure. They compared their food-waste-derived fuel against industry benchmarks and found that it met all the necessary standards for conventional jet fuel.

Though these findings are still more of a proof of concept, they open up the exciting possibility of using food waste (which there’s certainly no shortage of) to help the aviation industry move closer to its ambitious goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions within the next three decades.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang said in a statement.

Planes lag behind cars in emission reductions

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that transportation accounted for roughly 29 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2022 alone. Of that, about seven percent came from commercial aircraft. Modern cars have reduced emissions in recent years, in part thanks to the shift toward electric battery power. And while battery-powered airplanes are theoretically possible for some short flights, they simply don’t provide enough energy to power a passenger jet traveling across the country(jet fuel carries around 50 times more energy per kilogram than conventional lithium-ion batteries. As a result, jets have lagged behind cars in reducing emissions.

But what about so-called biomass-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)? Some estimates suggest that SAF, which largely refers to fuels derived from organic materials, could reduce emissions from flying by up to 80 percent, compared to conventional jet fuel. While ethanol and other biomass-based derivatives have been available for cars for decades, they have remained more elusive for airplanes because their chemical composition does not meet the much stricter requirements necessary for jet fuel.

Upgrading biomass to jet fuel

Meeting these requirements is where food waste comes in. In this new experiment, the team started by collecting food waste from nearby food-processing plants. They then used a chemical process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which essentially mimics the way the Earth naturally creates crude oil from organic matter over millions of years, except without all the waiting. HTL kind of acts like an advanced “pressure cooker” to fast-forward nature’s timeline.

With plenty of crude oil extracted from the food scraps, the researchers then set out to convert it into jet fuel through a two-part process. The first step involved removing salt, ash, moisture, and other impurities. After that, they used a cleaning process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate other undesirable elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. What remained were the specific hydrocarbons required to make jet fuel. They tested different catalysts and found that cobalt–molybdenum stood out as the most effective and commercially available metallic catalyst for driving the chemical reactions needed to refine the oil into aviation fuel.

The team took their food-waste derived aviation fuels and tested it against current fuel standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. It passed the screening test and met industry requirements without needing to introduce any special additives. That means, the fuel would theoretically power a commercial airplane.

The findings are a first step to show aviation fuel derived from food waste is at least possible. Actually making enough of it to supply an entire passenger jet, however, is another beast altogether. Scaling up at this level requires time, resources, and deep pocket books outside of academia.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in,” Zhang said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/h_QV8on.MDdFhpBESYgrow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/popular_science_109/bf5fb9a73591bdf0eb70112c6ffd3df2,N,,2025-11-01 14:56:19.932772

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming - an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel - a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting - and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point - it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Carsten Spohr, the CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, described the results as a “positive turning point” for the Lufthansa.
This had the positive effect of reducing the financial burden resulting from flight irregularities by more than 200 million euros.","The Lufthansa Group has reported another robust third quarter in operating profits as it’s increased its revenue by 4% year-on-year to 11.2 billion euros (last year was 10.7 billion euros). The Lufthansa Group reaffirmed its outlook of anticipating a significant increase in earnings for the year as a whole.

Results of the Third Quarter

It was the strongest quarter in terms of revenue in the history of the Lufthansa Group. The company generated an operating profit (adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT) of 1.3 billion euros, which was similar to the previous year.

The operating margin for this period was 11.9%, lower than the previous year that was at 12.5%. Operating profit for the first nine months amounted to 1.5 billion euros, up 300 million euros on the previous year.

Carsten Spohr, the CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, described the results as a “positive turning point” for the Lufthansa.

“We have had the best summer in terms of our flight operations in the last decade – with regularity of over 99 percent and a double-digit improvement in punctuality […] In combination with numerous digital innovations, upgraded services, and newly designed lounges, passenger satisfaction rose significantly in the third quarter. With employee satisfaction also reaching new highs across the Group […].”

Spohr also noted concerns about Germany’s competitive position as a business hub, saying,

“Germany as a location for business is benefiting less and less from our success, as shown by the fact that domestic flights within Germany have halved since 2019 due to regulatory cost developments.”

Improved Results in the First Nine Months

In the third quarter, the Lufthansa Group welcomed around 42 million passengers on board its passenger airlines, up from 40 million last year. Despite a 3% increase in seat capacity, load factor rose in the third quarter slightly to 87.5%.

Overall revenue for the passenger airlines grew slightly to 8.9 million euros in the third quarter, generating an operating profit of 1.2 billion euros.

For the first nine months of 2025, passenger airline revenue totalled 23 billion euros, 3% growth compared with the previous year. Adjusted EBIT improved by roughly 10% from the last year to 914 million euros.

There were some key factors for this positive development such as lower fuel cost, improved result from equity investments and the absence of the financial impact of strikes in 2024.

In addition, the Lufthansa Group also recorded an improvement in punctuality by 10% compared to last year, through the stabilisation of flight operations in the first nine months. This had the positive effect of reducing the financial burden resulting from flight irregularities by more than 200 million euros.

Employee satisfaction and outlook

The Lufthansa Group saw an improvement in employee satisfaction in its annual employee ‘involve me!’ survey, that showed the highest engagement levels within the last decade since it began. The engagement index scored an average value of 3.9 out of 5, as compared to last year, the survey recorded a 2.2 out of 5 score.

The outlook for the fourth quarter seems to indicate a more stable demand from the number of advance bookings. The current booking status for Lufthansa is on par with 2024.

With ongoing global uncertainties, the Lufthansa Group remain optimistic and confirmed its forecast for the full year and expects an operating result (adjusted EBIT) to be significantly above the previous year.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Lufthansa_Airbus_A320-214_D-AIZL_MUC_2015_01.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 13:00:36.761939

In its formal comments submitted to the EPA, the organization warned that failure to act could cost U.S. soybean farmers between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion in crop value over the next two years, citing estimates from the World Agricultural and Economic Environmental Services (WAEES) model, reports Iowabiodiesel.org.

Grant Kimberley, Executive Director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board, said that biomass-based diesel contributes about 10 percent of the value of each bushel of soybeans grown in the U.S., adding that this support is critical as farmers face record yields amid uncertain global markets.

The IBB’s comments also highlighted the vulnerability of Iowa’s independent biodiesel producers, who lack the financial strength of larger companies to cope with extended periods of policy uncertainty. Kimberley warned that losing these producers would be a major setback for the renewable fuels industry, eliminating years of investment and removing key local markets for Iowa’s farmers at a time when they can least afford it.

The organization urged the EPA to reallocate all small refinery exemptions for 2023 through 2027, finalize Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) before the next compliance year begins, and maintain strong volume targets to ensure stability for farmers and producers.

IBB expressed appreciation for the EPA’s recognition of the expanding production capacity and feedstock investments driving growth in U.S.-made biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel. However, the group stressed that delays in finalizing the rule leave the biomass-based diesel sector uncertain and unable to plan future investments. Kimberley noted that Iowa farmers are already preparing for the next planting season and need clarity to make informed decisions.

According to a national study commissioned by Clean Fuels Alliance America, Iowa’s biodiesel industry supports 12,000 jobs and generates $3.5 billion in economic activity each year. In 2024, the state’s 10 operating biodiesel plants produced about 350 million gallons, making Iowa the leading biodiesel-producing state in the country.

The Apec AI Initiative is another step in the right direction, he said.","– As artificial intelligence (AI) evolves, governments must invest more in preparing their workers and cannot leave it to the market, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.

Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) economies can lead these efforts by reskilling and upskilling workers, redesigning jobs, and building trust in AI, so they are not caught on the backfoot, PM Wong said on Nov 1.

“By doing so, we can ensure that the returns from AI investments will accrue not just to the owners of capital, but also to workers, and importantly to all our people,” he said to leaders of the 21 economies around the Pacific Rim which make up the grouping.

Singapore’s focus is on the application and use of AI, he said.

As a small, compact and digitally connected city state, it cannot on its own develop leading-edge AI foundation models. But it can use them to develop and make applications with the “biggest impact” in areas like finance, logistics, healthcare and advanced manufacturing, PM Wong said.

Singapore cannot do this work alone, and is keen to cooperate and exchange best practices with other Apec economies, he added.

In a session themed Preparing For A Future-ready Asia-Pacific, PM Wong said that AI will drive the next wave of growth.

“It will uplift productivity, and transform the way we work and live,” he added, as he laid out ways to spearhead cooperation in harnessing the technology.

AI is already transforming industries in Singapore, he said on the second day of the Apec Economic Leaders’ Meeting, the highest-level meeting at the annual summit which is running from Oct 31 to Nov 1 in Gyeongju, South Korea.

Outlining what needs to be done to unlock the technology’s potential, PM Wong said Apec economies must build up the capabilities of their workforces and prepare workers.

With every new wave of technology, some jobs will disappear and new jobs will be created, and historically, the net impact has been positive – meaning more net jobs have been created.

But there is no economic law that guarantees this will automatically happen, PM Wong said.

“Just because it happened in the past doesn’t mean it will also happen in the future. We cannot leave this to the market.”

Apec economies also need to build trust in AI, he said.

That is why Singapore is playing an active role in global efforts to advance AI standards – so that there is an overall framework for innovation and users know that they are using responsibly developed systems, he added.

To do so, Singapore has set up the AI Verify Foundation to set such standards in partnership with the private sector. It now has more than 170 members including companies like Hitachi, Google and OpenAI, he noted.

The foundation was set up in 2023 to boost AI testing capabilities and assurance to meet the needs of companies and regulators globally.

Earlier in 2025, Singapore also convened leading experts to formulate the Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities, a document aligning views on the development, assessment, and control of AI, he noted.

PM Wong also urged Apec economies to keep data corridors open, because data is what powers AI models.

Singapore supports the Apec Cross-Border Privacy Rules System, which facilitates the free flow of data with trust, in order to promote AI innovation, he said.

Trade pacts like

the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement

– which Singapore, Chile and New Zealand signed in 2020 – can also enable data flows.

On how Apec can take the lead on these efforts, PM Wong said the member economies have AI expertise and experience.

He commended 2025’s Apec summit host South Korea for convening the first Apec Digital and AI Ministerial Meeting.

The Apec AI Initiative is another step in the right direction, he said. It will promote greater cooperation on AI through policy exchanges and capacity-building projects, and foster investments in AI infrastructure.

“Singapore looks forward to working with Apec economies to ensure that our societies benefit from AI,” he said. “Together, we can put AI to work on the problems that matter most, so our people can prosper together.”

The informed professional has been wondering how the aviation and maritime industries can meet aggressive net-zero mandates when Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable marine fuel supply is limited and significantly more expensive than conventional fuel. The core challenge has been the lack of a scalable, cost-effective feedstock and the technical difficulty of converting raw, inconsistent biomass into a high-quality, “drop-in” fuel that performs like its petroleum counterpart.

Analysis

This innovation is driven by the market need for a cost-competitive, scalable SAF solution that does not compete with food crops. The scientific discovery centers on a new chemical process that efficiently handles the complexity of raw biomass. The existing challenge involves high logistics costs for transporting bulky agricultural and forestry waste to a central refinery. This new process converts the waste into a dense, lower-carbon biocrude at the collection site.

This on-site conversion dramatically cuts transport costs and solves the technical challenge of refining the biocrude into high-quality, ready-to-use fuel. Think of this new process like a decentralized coffee grinder that turns bulky beans into a dense, shippable concentrate right at the farm, making the final brewing (refining) process simpler and cheaper at the main facility.

Outlook

This technology implies a significant shift in the sustainable fuel supply chain, moving production closer to the feedstock source. The next signal to watch for is the announcement of major commercial-scale partnerships with large agricultural producers or forestry companies, and the first deployment of the modular plants. If the modular design proves to accelerate project timelines as promised, it will unlock a new, geographically distributed supply of low-cost SAF that can quickly scale to meet regulatory mandates.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sustainable-Resource-Management-and-Circular-Economy-Integration-in-Modular-Infrastructure-Design.jpeg,N,,2025-11-01 17:00:11.570769

The Rolls-Royce UltraFan is the world’s largest technology demonstrator jet engine. It is designed to test a range of new technologies for next-generation jet engines. The UltraFan has a massive fan diameter of 3.5 meters (140 inches), larger than the world’s most powerful jet engine, the GE9X (3.4 meters, 134 inches).

The company aims to test thrust performance and propulsive efficiency over a range of 25,000 to 110,000 bf thrust. The UltraFan promises greater fuel efficiency than existing engines, lower carbon emissions, and compatibility with alternative fuels.

Redefining propulsive efficiency through the design

The propulsive efficiency of a turbofan engine depends on various factors, the most important of which is bypass ratio. It is the ratio of the airflow entering the engine core to the airflow bypassing through the secondary duct.

With the ultra-large fan and a compact core, Rolls-Royce is set to hit a home run with the demonstrator design. A unique combination of carbon/titanium fan blades and a new engine core architecture will maximise fuel burn efficiency while reducing emissions.

The UltraFan design benefits from advanced manufacturing and material technologies. Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) techniques are used to produce major components of the engine. Such 3D techniques allow building of industrial objectives in successive layers using digital models.

Unlike traditional subtractive technologies that relied on grinding and machining of metal blocks, the ALM method reduces material waste and allows the creation of intricate designs. The technique also minimises component weight while increasing the accuracy and precision of complex parts.

The UltraFan’s Power Gearbox also holds a world record

The Ultrafan is a geared design featuring the world’s most powerful accessory gearbox, termed Power Gearbox (PGB). In 2021, UltraFan’s PGB set a world record by reaching 64 megawatts (87,000 horsepower) during a test in the company’s facility in Dahlewitz, Germany. Enough to power a small city, the Power Gearbox demonstrated sheer performance and durability – the two parameters essential for next-generation engines.

Dr. Holger Klinger, the subsystem executive of PGB at Rolls-Royce, stated,

“Reaching this record is another great achievement that showcases the performance and durability of this key component for our UltraFan programme. The power gearbox technology is central to the success of the next generation of Rolls-Royce jet engines, and I’m proud to see us pushing the engineering boundaries again.”

Apart from power, endurance, and reliability validation, the PGB demonstrated successful testing on the Altitude Rig, simulating different phases of flight.

First successful tests of the UltraFan

In November 2023, Rolls-Royce completed the first successful tests of its UltraFan demonstrator engine to maximum power. The manufacturer conducted the tests at its Testbed 80 facility in Derby, UK. The first tests were conducted using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), demonstrating strong compatibility with alternative fuels. Rolls-Royce stated that the tests were in line with expectations and that several futuristic technologies were tested during the run.

The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, states,

“Hitting full power with our UltraFan demonstrator sends a strong message that we are leading the way in the transition to more efficient and sustainable aviation. This fantastic milestone puts us in a strong position to support the plans of our customers as they develop the next generation of super-efficient aircraft.”

The Rolls-Royce UltraFan demonstrator is scalable to both widebody and narrowbody aircraft. Rolls-Royce states that commercial versions of the type may emerge in the early 2030s. The technologies built on the UltraFan enable 25% greater fuel efficiency than first-generation Trent engines, and 10% greater efficiency over the Trent XWB engine.

The facility includes a 100 kW solar array, battery storage, an electrolyzer, and hydrogen storage tanks.

Statkraft has confirmed its plans to streamline operations by selling several assets across different geographies. “In line with the refocused strategy launched in June, Statkraft is reducing the number of countries and technologies, including offshore wind, green hydrogen and biofuels,” said the hydropower company, fully owned by the Norwegian state, in an emailed press release.

Topsoe has signed an offtake agreement to provide its Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) technology for Forestal's Triskelion e-methanol plant in Galicia, Spain. “The SOEC's will be delivered from Topsoe's manufacturing facility in Herning, Denmark, which is nearing the final stage of readiness for industrial-scale production,” said the Danish company, adding that Forestal should take the final investment decision (FID) for the Triskelion project in Q2 2026, with commencement of operations planned for 2028.

The forum gathered more than 1,000 participants from over 50 countries, including senior executives from international and domestic companies across the energy, agriculture, finance, pharmaceuticals, and consulting sectors.

Thirteen commercial agreements worth $3.8 billion were signed in the presence of Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov.

Opening the forum, Bektenov said that Kazakhstan remains open and predictable for long-term investments and continues to maintain direct dialogue with investors.

“Kazakhstan remains an open and predictable country for long-term investments. Building a relationship of trust with investors is an integral part of our investment policy. I invite everyone to make full use of the opportunities available for developing business in Kazakhstan. We are ready to provide comprehensive support at every stage of project implementation,” said Bektenov.

He emphasized that the country is shifting toward a model in which the government not only supports but also initiates projects in partnership with investors. Over the first nine months of 2025, Kazakhstan’s gross domestic product grew by 6.3%, while investment in fixed capital increased by 13.5% to 13.8 trillion tenge (US$26.04 billion).

“This reflects our continued commitment to decarbonize the logistics industry by promoting SAF accessibility and affordability to more businesses,” he added.

Launched in 2023, GoGreen Plus products are based on true value chain decarbonization.

SAF is produced from s sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and other residues.

In neat form and over the lifecycle, it significantly cuts greenhouse gas emissions by around 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel.

GoGreen Plus is part of the DHL Group’s measures to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Specifically, ADNOC, together with co-investors and technology partners including G42 and Microsoft, is advancing a programme to reduce methane emissions and achieve zero routine flaring across its operations by 2030.

The report highlights that these efforts leverage AI-driven platforms, IoT sensors, and advanced analytics to monitor operations in real time, optimise flare management, and support scaling carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Cross-industry collaboration is central to progress: Microsoft’s investment in Twelve and partnership with Alaska Airlines demonstrates how captured CO₂ can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel, while engagements with low-carbon cement and near-zero emission steel producers show how AI can catalyse broader low-carbon innovation across supply chains.

The Powering Possible Report shows that while AI investment is rising, organisations are increasingly pragmatic about its deployment. Executives emphasise that aligning AI ambitions with physical infrastructure, workforce readiness, and grid capacity is critical. AI is now being deployed for predictive maintenance, operational optimisation, and emissions monitoring. ADNOC, for example, uses AI-powered flare monitoring to deliver real-time data that supports regulatory compliance and emission control strategies, reducing emissions in a cost-effective manner.

However, challenges persist and survey data in the report highlights that workforce skills gaps remain a top barrier, cited by 39% of respondents, while data quality and cybersecurity also rank highly.

Cultural factors—such as trust in AI recommendations versus traditional experience—have emerged as additional hurdles. Companies are responding by upskilling staff, providing AI literacy training, and embedding responsible AI frameworks into operations.

The report also underscores the need for supportive policies and regulatory alignment. While a loose regulatory landscape can encourage rapid development, the absence of comprehensive frameworks may hinder long-term adoption. Policy modernisation, regulatory sandboxes, and incentives for clean energy are essential to enable scalable AI deployment and sustainable energy transformation.

Along those lines, the Delta SkyMiles program has just launched such a promotion, with an interesting twist (thanks to Joe for flagging this).

New Delta Elevate Your Status promotion launches

Delta SkyMiles members have the opportunity to qualify for a higher Medallion elite status tier in 2026, with the new Elevate Your Status promotion. This opportunity is available between November 1 and December 31, 2025, and it’s intended for US-based SkyMiles members.

Specifically, eligible members can make a one-time purchase of Medallion Qualifying Dollars (MQDs) to help them reach the next elite tier. MQDs are the primary metric by which elite status in the SkyMiles program is awarded nowadays. The interesting twist here is that 100% of the proceeds (excluding processing fees) will be used to support Delta’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) program.

In order to be eligible for this promotion, you must be in one of the following categories, not too far from the next tier:

Be a SkyMiles non-elite member with between 4,500 and 4,599 MQDs (to earn Silver status)

Be a SkyMiles Silver member with between 9,000 and 9,999 MQDs (to earn Gold status)

Be a SkyMiles Gold member with between 13,500 and 14,999 MQDs (to earn Platunum status)

Be a SkyMiles Platinum member with between 25,500 and 27,999 MQDs (to earn Diamond status)

Every 100 MQDs cost $300, and Delta takes an 8.3% cut

When I first read about this promotion, I assumed that you’d basically be paying the “going rate” for MQDs. In other words, if you wanted to acquire 500 MQDs with this promotion, I assumed you’d have to spend $500 on sustainable aviation fuel. So instead of getting flights for the money you spend, you’re instead just be doing something good.

But no, it’s actually not quite that “generous.” The cost for every 100 MQDs is actually $300. So yeah, if you’re 1,000 MQDs short of qualifying for an elite tier, you could either spend $1,000 on a Delta ticket, or spend $3,000 on this venture. With that kind of a conversion rate, maybe we should call them MQPs (Medallion Qualifying Pesos)? 😉

For what it’s worth, Delta is partnering with Norway’s Choose on this program. Oh, and Delta’s “processing fee” is 8.3%.

Everyone can decide for themselves whether this offer is worth it or not. I’ll of course mention that the value of airline elite status has certainly decreased over the years, given how much tougher upgrades have become. And the SkyMiles program is particularly unrewarding in terms of upgrades, award redemption rates, etc.

Bottom line

Through the end of the year, the Delta SkyMiles program is letting some members buy up to the next elite tier. The good news is that you’re actually contributing to Delta’s sustainable aviation fuel initiative. The bad news is that one MQD will cost you $3, so this sure isn’t cheap!",https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Delta-Boeing-757-200.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 01:56:12.078776

Introduction – What is SAF?

When we think about an industry’s decarbonization potential, we typically first ask the question: “Can it be electrified?” If the answer is no, this is usually labeled a hard-to-abate industry. Aviation – representing ~3% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually, with its high energy density requirements – is one such industry. In the absence of feasible electric aviation at scale, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the best lever we have at our disposal for airline decarbonization, with IATA estimating that 65% of aviation’s pathway to net zero will come from SAF usage.

SAF is a broad term referring to any fuel that can be “dropped in” (more accurately, blended) as a jet fuel replacement, resulting in a reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions – typically a 50–90% reduction in carbon intensity compared to conventional jet fuel. SAF supply pathways differ primarily by feedstock and production method – there are 11 ASTM-approved pathways today, including pack leader HEFA (fuel derived from used cooking oil), ATJ (fuel derived from ethanol or other alcohols), and “eSAF” (synthetic fuel generated using captured carbon and green hydrogen).

State of SAF Today

There are several advantages that SAF enjoys which make it potentially more politically resilient than our resident renewables. One of the major supply pathways is sourced from corn production (which, at least in the US, enjoys large bipartisan support), and many oil & gas refineries and logistics assets can be retrofitted to support SAF production, providing a tangible way for traditional energy companies to participate in the energy transition.

Yet despite these relative political advantages – and the weight of the aviation world on its shoulders – SAF production and consumption have been severely limited. Global production in 2024 represented only ~0.3% of jet fuel use (~350 million gallons), with this number expected to reach ~0.7% in 2025. Airlines for Europe (A4E), a lobby group, recently stated that airlines will not likely be able to meet the EU’s 6% sustainable aviation fuel mandate by 2030 because of a lack of SAF production capacity. Much of this becomes less of a mystery when we reveal the cost: SAF’s Levelized Cost of Fuel (LCOF) is typically 3–10× the cost of conventional jet fuel. In an industry notorious for paper-thin margins, this is not sustainable.

The Case for Book and Claim

How can SAF simultaneously come down the cost curve and attract outside investment or project finance without fear of stranded assets? The only realistic answer is increased bankability through longer-term offtakes. Currently, roughly 50% of signed SAF offtake agreements are one-year contracts, and 70% are under five years (DOE, Pathways to Commercial Liftoff). These are not bankable contracts that provide enough de-risking capacity for cheaper sources of financing to enter and supplement today’s largely VC-, CVC-, or balance sheet–driven capital stacks. This is where Book and Claim comes in.

Book and Claim is a custody model used in commodity industries that separates the actual physical product from its environmental attributes. Applied to SAF, this means that an airline operating entirely in Europe could purchase and claim the environmental attributes of SAF produced and consumed in Brazil. The clean fuel is still burned, providing carbon abatement compared to baseline jetfuel, while the environmental benefit is claimed by the purchasing airline. While a hot topic in aviation lately, this is not a new concept. For example, when you read the headline—“NextEra signs 500 MW clean energy deal with Meta to power new data center”—Meta is not actually receiving physical delivery of the electrons. Electrons go where physics dictates, not where the invoice says. This is the beauty of the Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (VPPA): the offtaker signs a financial contract at a fixed price for electricity from a plant that isn’t co-located with its operations. Meta locks in predictable power pricing, the developer secures a long-term offtake with a blue-chip counterparty that it can present to financiers, and the messy physical delivery is removed from the equation. While not the exact same model (VPPA’s incentive is primarily for price hedging), this procurement mindset can and should transfer to the use of Book and Claim for SAF.

As mentioned earlier, SAF production is heavily dependent on feedstock availability, which is naturally constrained to specific geographies and, for the most part, consists of perishable biogenic products that are difficult to transport. For example, the U.S. and Brazil alone are expected to hold nearly 30% of global biomass feedstock potential for SAF production by 2030 (IATA Global Feedstock Assessment). Yet airlines operate globally, with Asia and Europe leading policy mandates for fuel blending. This geographic mismatch is exactly what the Book and Claim custody model solves.",https://whartonenergyclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wharton-Energy-Club-150x150.png,N,,2025-11-01 08:56:46.167622

While the company's shares have reacted positively to the announcement, its underlying financial fundamentals present a more complex picture. The central question for investors is whether this massive order can provide the sustained momentum needed to overcome broader industry challenges and steer the company toward lasting profitability.

A Landmark Agreement and Its Market Impact

The company has entered into a binding supply agreement with Allied Biofuels FE LLC for up to 2 gigawatts of its PEM electrolyzer systems. This contract is designated for a new facility in Uzbekistan that will focus on the production of sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel. When combined with a previous 3-gigawatt collaboration in Australia, the total contracted capacity with Allied partners reaches a substantial 5 gigawatts.

This agreement ranks among the largest electrolyzer deals announced in 2025, representing a tangible step forward in the company's strategic execution. The market's initial response was favorable, translating into notable share price gains. However, a critical hurdle remains: the final investment decision for the Uzbekistan project is not anticipated until the fourth quarter of 2026.

Financial Performance: Growth Tempered by Losses

The company's robust order intake contrasts with its mixed financial forecasts. Revenue for the current quarter is projected to be $179.14 million, which would represent a modest year-over-year increase of 3.1 percent. Looking further ahead, estimates for the current and next fiscal years stand at $707.53 million and $850.63 million, respectively, pointing to potential growth of 12.5% and 20.2%.

However, the profitability outlook reveals a more challenging path:

* The current quarter is expected to show a loss of $0.13 per share.

* The present fiscal year is forecast to conclude with a loss of $0.62 per share.

* A turnaround is not projected until the following year, with analysts predicting a profit of $0.31 per share.

Navigating a Challenging Industry Landscape

Plug Power's recent commercial successes are unfolding against a backdrop of significant sector-wide pressures. The broader hydrogen mobility segment is confronting considerable obstacles, evidenced by several major automakers scaling back their hydrogen fuel cell initiatives. General Motors and Stellantis are among those who have either halted or significantly curtailed development efforts for light-duty vehicles.

These corporations cite high costs and an underdeveloped refueling infrastructure as primary reasons for their strategic pullback. This industry-wide deceleration poses a potential threat and has already led to a marked reduction in the global demand forecast for fuel cell stacks in light vehicles throughout 2025.

The pivotal issue remains: Is this monumental contract sufficient to propel Plug Power through these industry-wide turbulences and finally pave its long-awaited path to profitability?

The new A350F aircraft will strengthen Korean Air’s cargo operations from its hub at Incheon International Airport (ICN), one of Asia’s busiest freight gateways. With this conversion, the airline now holds orders for a total of 33 A350 aircraft.

Korean Air A350F Order

Airbus EVP of Commercial Aircraft Sales, Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, called the move a major endorsement of the A350F’s performance in the large freighter segment.

The A350F is currently the only all-new large freighter under development. It features the industry’s largest main deck cargo door and a fuselage optimized for standard pallets and containers.

More than 70% of the airframe is made from advanced lightweight materials, giving the aircraft a take-off weight 46 tonnes lower than comparable models.

Performance, Efficiency, and Environmental Compliance

The A350F can carry up to 111 tonnes of payload and fly up to 4,700 nautical miles (8,700 km). Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, it delivers up to 40% lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to previous-generation freighters with similar range and capacity.

It is also the only freighter designed to meet ICAO’s enhanced CO₂ emissions standards set to take effect in 2027. This compliance positions the A350F as a key part of the global shift toward sustainable air cargo operations.

Airbus A350 Family Growth

As of September 2025, the Airbus A350 Family has accumulated 1,445 orders from 63 customers worldwide, including 65 for the A350F from 10 cargo operators and one leasing company.

For Korean Air, the updated order now includes 20 A350-1000s, seven A350Fs, and six A350-900s—two of which have already been delivered. The airline also has 39 Airbus A321neo aircraft on order, reinforcing its ongoing fleet modernization strategy across both passenger and cargo operations.

Airbus Gets Major Order from South Asian Carrier

Vietjet (VJ), Vietnam’s largest private airline, has turned its June Memorandum of Understanding into a firm purchase for 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft. The agreement reinforces Vietjet’s rapid growth plan and continued fleet modernization efforts.

With this order, Vietjet now holds commitments for 280 A321neo aircraft, further strengthening its partnership with Airbus and aligning with the carrier’s regional and global expansion strategy.

The firm order for 100 A321neo aircraft marks a pivotal step in Vietjet’s long-term growth strategy. This deal follows closely after the airline’s order of 20 A330neo widebody aircraft in May, confirming its position as a key Airbus customer in Asia.

According to Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, the agreement represents more than a commercial transaction—it’s a symbol of trust and shared ambition for sustainable connectivity. The deal also reflects Vietjet’s focus on cost efficiency and route flexibility, particularly in high-demand markets across Asia-Pacific.

Airbus Executive Vice President Benoît de Saint-Exupéry highlighted the operational benefits of the A321neo, noting that the aircraft’s efficiency and performance will help Vietjet achieve competitive economics and operational commonality across its fleet.

Sustainability and Performance Advantages

The Airbus A321neo is the largest model in the A320neo Family and is known for its extended range, reduced fuel burn, and lower emissions. Featuring next-generation engines and Sharklets, it cuts fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions by more than 20%, while reducing noise by 50%.

Vietjet’s decision to prioritize the A321neo supports its environmental targets, as the aircraft can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today, with Airbus aiming for full SAF capability by 2030.

This aligns with the industry-wide goal of reducing aviation’s carbon footprint while maintaining network flexibility and comfort for passengers.

Strengthening a Long-Term Partnership

Vietjet’s growing Airbus fleet underscores a strong and strategic partnership between the two companies.

By combining the A321neo’s narrow-body efficiency with the A330neo’s wide-body range, Vietjet is well-positioned to serve both domestic and long-haul international routes from Tan Son Nhat International Airport (SGN) and other key hubs.

As of September 2025, more than 7,100 A321neo aircraft have been ordered by nearly 100 airlines worldwide, solidifying its position as one of the most successful single-aisle aircraft programs globally.

The partners also presented a specially curated cultural collection titled ""Pulse of the Silk Road, Symphony of Airways,"" comprising a mulberry silk scarf, porcelain items, and commemorative badges embedded with NFC chips. Tapping a smartphone against a badge unlocks a ""wearable digital archive"" of forum highlights, artistically blending aviation and cultural heritage.

The forum's influence also took to the skies: China Eastern Airlines rolled out the North Bund Forum-themed experience on nearly 400 flights arriving in Shanghai. A notable example was the October 17 ""City Window"" themed flight MU244 from Milan to Shanghai, produced together with Shanghai City News Service. Through carefully designed cabin displays and interactive activities, passengers experienced Shanghai's vibrant culture and urban energy at 30,000 feet, transforming the flight into a dynamic showcase of the city.

As a core partner in the development of the Shanghai international aviation hub, China Eastern Airlines has supported Pudong International Airport in achieving national leadership in both passenger and cargo throughput. Since 2024, China Eastern Airlines has launched 23 new medium- and long-haul international routes, reaching 21 ""Belt and Road"" partner countries and 36 destinations. With the upcoming inauguration of the Shanghai-New Zealand-Argentina route by year-end, China Eastern will become the first mainland-based Chinese airline to connect all six inhabited continents and rank first in number of international destinations served.

Through infrastructure developments such as the Hongqiao Air-Rail Transfer Center and off-site city terminals, China Eastern Airlines is strengthening the Yangtze River Delta's integrated air-ground transport network. In 2024, the airline facilitated 8.358 million international transfer passengers at Pudong International Airport, representing 80.9% of the airport's total. In the first half of 2025, the figure grew to 4.795 million - a year-on-year increase of 26.8% - underscoring its pivotal role in boosting Shanghai Pudong's international transfer performance.

SAF is expected to deliver the largest share of the air transport sector’s decarbonisation contribution over the next three decades. The International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) Long-Term Aspirational Goal and regional policies, including the European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, position SAF as the primary route to reducing aviation emissions while maintaining global freight capacity. ReFuelEU requires SAF blending to rise from minimal use today to 70 percent by 2050, representing a structural shift in how airlines procure and manage fuel.

However, the current availability of SAF remains limited. Production capacity is constrained, and costs remain between three and five times higher than conventional aviation fuel. Feedstock supply, certification processes, and regional policy mismatches further restrict scalability. “SAF currently costs three to five times more than conventional jet fuel, and expanding production requires significant capital investment,” said Arnaud Brolly, Founder and Chief Executive of Impact, which operates a marketplace for SAF certificates.

Forwarders and shippers are increasingly seeking SAF-based services to meet their own emissions reduction commitments. Leading logistics operators have introduced programmes allowing customers to purchase SAF-linked emission reductions for individual shipments. Several airlines have also expanded SAF purchase options at booking level. This is creating new commercial models in which both airlines and forwarders act as intermediaries between SAF producers and cargo customers.

Certification has become essential to prevent double counting and ensure emissions claims are auditable. SAF certificates decouple the environmental attribute of the fuel from its physical use, allowing airlines to claim Scope 1 reductions and shippers to claim Scope 3 reductions using the same verified emission savings within established accounting rules. CHAMP, for example, has supported customer reporting needs through data-backed documentation linked to its hydroelectric-powered data centres. “Customers need audited data to report emissions accurately,” said Marjorie Guerrero, Executive Assistant to the CEO and ESG Coordinator at CHAMP.

Operational efficiency, data systems, and technology integration

With SAF supply limited in the near term, carriers and cargo handlers are pursuing operational efficiency measures to reduce emissions intensity. Flight planning optimisation, improved aircraft weight and balance systems, and ground efficiency measures are delivering incremental reductions. Aircraft models continue to improve in efficiency, but fleet renewal cycles remain constrained by supply chain lead times and capital availability. Industry reports indicate that the global commercial fleet is ageing due to extended asset lifecycles and delivery backlogs.

Digitalisation is central to both emissions reduction and reporting readiness. Automated tracking, network planning optimisation, and sensor-based fleet management are enabling more accurate fuel burn measurement and resource allocation. Scope 3 reporting, in particular, requires standardised data exchange between airlines, forwarders, and shippers. Industry surveys show that data alignment remains a primary barrier to credible sustainability reporting. “Data collection and alignment across stakeholders is one of the areas where companies struggle most,” Hughes said.

Artificial intelligence and Internet of Things tools are being integrated to support predictive resource management, real-time visibility, and continuous emissions tracking. However, the increased use of data-intensive systems introduces energy sourcing implications. McDermott highlighted that digital infrastructure planning will have to integrate renewable power availability.

“Technology is essential to efficiency gains, but energy supply for data architecture must be aligned with sustainability objectives.”

The growth of sustainability-linked finance is also changing the investment landscape. Financial institutions are increasingly applying emissions and governance criteria to lending and investment conditions. Some financing agreements require ongoing sustainability performance reporting, linking interest rates or credit access to verified outcomes. Industry advisers note that sustainability-linked finance is accelerating board-level engagement and influencing procurement decisions for IT systems, vehicles, equipment, and facilities.

Collaborative frameworks are emerging to support alignment and benchmarking. Tiaca’s BlueSky sustainability assessment programme provides companies with structured evaluation and comparison tools across multiple dimensions, including environmental, social, and governance factors. Such frameworks are being used to identify gaps, prioritise investment, and compare performance across regions and business models. “Assessment tools like BlueSky are helping companies benchmark sustainability performance and prioritise investment,” Hughes said.

The direction of policy and regulatory development indicates that sustainability reporting and fuel transition requirements will tighten further. As compliance expands, airfreight stakeholders are focusing on building resilient data systems, integrating SAF-based commercial models, and coordinating emissions strategies across supply chain partners. The sector’s decarbonisation path will require sustained investment, cross-industry collaboration, and continued development of verifiable reporting practices. “The next generation of sustainability leaders will need both technological insight and operational expertise to drive meaningful change,” McDermott said.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_410592669-1080x720.jpeg,N,,2025-10-31 17:01:12.777398

FLEET EXPANSION

On Friday, the budget airline announced a two-month partnership with Bulgarian national carrier Bulgaria Air to boost capacity during the holiday season.

In December and January, two Airbus A320ceo aircraft will fly four domestic routes from Manila to Cebu, Davao, Iloilo and Cagayan de Oro.

Under the arrangement, Bulgaria Air will provide the aircraft, pilots, maintenance and insurance, while Cebu Pacific will supply cabin crew.

To meet long-term growing demand, Cebu Pacific last year ordered 152 Airbus jets worth US$24 billion. The order begins in 2029 and will be delivered through 2035, Szucs told CNA.

Amid a global aircraft shortage caused by supply chain disruptions, some airlines have turned to China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing. Szucs said the competition is healthy for the industry.

“It's great that there is potential for another manufacturer of jets coming onto the scene. Competition improves products and also improves economics,” he said.

He added that Cebu Pacific would consider COMAC planes once they receive international certifications.

“COMAC will have to go through the certification requirements, principally with the FAA and ISSA,” he said, referring to the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration and the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) Standard Safety Assessment.

“That's clearly on their milestones, and it's clearly going to happen at some point. As soon as COMAC is available, it's something that we will consider.”

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

As airlines worldwide race toward net-zero emissions, Szucs said he believes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers the most practical way forward.

SAF is a liquid fuel made from feedstock including waste oil and fats. It can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.

Unlike hydrogen or electric alternatives, sustainable aviation fuel can be used immediately with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure.

Other proposed technologies would require modified or new aircraft engines, infrastructure and regulatory systems that do not yet exist at scale.

Despite its promise, the main challenge with sustainable aviation fuel is its limited availability and high cost. It accounted for just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production in 2024, and is between two and five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

“All aircraft today and for the foreseeable future will need hydrocarbon fuel, and SAF is the way. Airlines need to explore ways of how we can get more SAF produced on an economic scale,” he said.

Szucs noted that unlike fossil fuels, which are concentrated in certain parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel has one clear advantage: it can be produced locally – potentially stimulating domestic economies in the process.

FLEET MODERNISATION

The Cebu Pacific CEO said the most impactful step airlines can take today is upgrading to more fuel-efficient aircraft and engines.

Currently, about 72 per cent of the carrier’s all-Airbus fleet is fitted with advanced engine options that reduce fuel burn by around 18 per cent, Szucs said.

Beyond aircraft upgrades, another practical way to reduce the industry’s carbon footprint is electrifying ground operations and vehicles such as airport buses, pushback tractors and baggage carts, he added.

“Everyone’s got an obligation to make sure they're taking the steps on what I consider to be the low-hanging fruits. That's deliverable today.

The process begins with hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of waste feedstock, such as by-products from a nearby food-processing facility, turning organic waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude then undergoes catalytic hydrotreating using a cobalt-molybdenum catalyst to strip out unwanted elements such as nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen. The result: a hydrocarbon blend that passes Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and meets specifications for conventional jet fuel.

The researchers emphasize that food waste is just one viable feedstock; the HTL platform can process a wide range of biowaste, including sewage sludge, algal blooms, swine manure, and agricultural residue. That flexibility helps avoid the food-versus-fuel debate, supporting a true circular bio-economy model. According to lead author Sabrina Summers, the engineering work “solves the science and engineering problems” so that industry can scale the approach.

From a design and engineering perspective, this work is significant for several reasons: it provides a drop-in solution that operates within existing jet-fuel infrastructure; it addresses the twin challenges of carbon emissions and waste management; and it creates business-model opportunities at the intersection of food processing, waste conversion, and aviation fuel supply. The path to commercial scale remains: cost control, feedstock logistics, catalyst lifetime, and refinery integration must still be addressed. For engineers involved in process design, systems integration, and sustainability road mapping, this research underlines that waste streams can become high-value inputs in high-energy domains such as aviation.

Therefore, if future air travel is to be sustainable then one key question that we must answer concerns our ability to produce aviation fuel in a sustainable manner.
In this regard, we need to address the critical challenge of scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the United States to satisfy the government’s goal of meeting 100 percent of aviation fuel demand with SAF by 2050.

Upfront payments uniquely change this pattern, enabling miscanthus production in the Midwest while switchgrass remains dominant in the Southern U.S.","It is now well known that air travel by humans has risen and that it will continue to rise in the foreseeable future. Therefore, if future air travel is to be sustainable then one key question that we must answer concerns our ability to produce aviation fuel in a sustainable manner. In this regard, we need to address the critical challenge of scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in the United States to satisfy the government’s goal of meeting 100 percent of aviation fuel demand with SAF by 2050.

Since current SAF production is only a fraction of total jet fuel use, scaling up requires a shift from food-based feedstocks to high-yield, low-carbon, cellulosic biomass sources such as miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn stover. However, the problem is that miscanthus—despite its high yield and carbon sequestration potential, entails large upfront establishment costs, longer maturity periods, and greater yield uncertainty, which discourage adoption by farmers with limited credit or higher risk aversion. On the other hand, switchgrass and corn stover, while lower yielding, pose fewer financial and intertemporal risks.

New research sheds interesting light on the potential of cellulosic feedstocks — specifically perennial bioenergy crops like miscanthus and switchgrass, and the crop residue corn stover — to provide a low-carbon alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel. The point to note is that the adoption of these feedstocks, particularly high-yielding miscanthus, is hindered by significant barriers for farmers, including high upfront establishment costs, delayed returns, and risks that differ from conventional annual crops like corn and soybeans.

The research demonstrates how different farmer characteristics, i.e., risk aversion, time preferences (discount rates), and access to credit, influence the supply and mix of these feedstocks. Furthermore, it evaluates the cost-effectiveness of two alternative carbon payment designs in overcoming these barriers and incentivizing the production of feedstocks that maximize carbon mitigation.

Integrated, economic-biogeochemical modeling yields three noteworthy provoking insights. First, the characteristics of U.S. farmers affect their feedstock choice and SAF supply. Under a “Low-Constraint” scenario (meaning low risk aversion, low discount rate, and access to credit), farmers predominantly choose the high-yielding, low-carbon miscanthus at moderate biomass prices, leading to substantial SAF production. In contrast, “High-Constraint” farmers (meaning highly risk-averse, present-biased, and credit-constrained) overwhelmingly prefer the lower-yielding but less risky switchgrass, resulting in up to 48 percent lower SAF production at the same biomass price. Importantly, credit constraints are the single most significant barrier to miscanthus adoption.

Second, the design of carbon payments is pivotal. The research under discussion compares an “Annual Payment” (which is a yearly payment per ton of carbon dioxide mitigated) with an “Upfront Payment” (which is a lump sum paid in the first year for the total carbon mitigated over a 15-year crop lifespan).

For credit-constrained farmers, upfront payments are far more effective. Put differently, upfront payments are more cost-effective per dollar spent on carbon mitigation for this group. In contrast, for farmers with access to credit, annual payments are generally more cost-effective. These farmers, less burdened by initial costs, respond better to a steady income stream and choose the most efficient feedstock for carbon mitigation in their region without needing a large upfront sum.

Third, the spatial pattern of feedstock production shifts with policy and farmer characteristics. Without carbon payments, “High-Constraint” farmers avoid miscanthus even in the high-yielding Midwest. Upfront payments uniquely change this pattern, enabling miscanthus production in the Midwest while switchgrass remains dominant in the Southern U.S. This demonstrates that effective policy can alter the geographic distribution of bioenergy crops.

Policies that ignore farmer heterogeneity are likely to overestimate the potential for bioenergy crop production. One-size-fits-all policies, such as tax credits like annual payments, may fail to engage credit-constrained or risk-averse farmers. Instead, a targeted approach is necessary. Policymakers should consider hybrid incentives that include upfront cost-share components or risk-mitigating instruments like insurance, tailored to the carbon performance of different feedstocks and the financial realities of different farmers.

In sum, we learn that the successful decarbonization of aviation through SAF depends not only on feedstock agronomy and conversion technology but critically on the nuanced design of economic incentives that account for the diverse risk, time, and financial constraints of the farmers who will ultimately produce the necessary biomass.

Australia is emerging as one of the world's most promising markets for renewable fuel. A Deloitte report commissioned by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation highlights a AUD$36 billion opportunity to develop a world-leading low-carbon liquid fuels (LCLF) industry capable of cutting emissions by 230 million tons by 2050 and strengthening the country's energy independence.

Australia imports ~80% of its liquid fuels, spending more than AUD$50 billion in 2023 alone, while exporting AUD$3.9 billion in potential LCLF feedstocks. With less than 50 days of fuel reserves currently held onshore, well below the International Energy Agency's recommended 90 days, the country's reliance on imports leaves it vulnerable to global disruptions.

Recognizing this imbalance, the Australian federal government has prioritized low-carbon liquid fuels under its Future Made in Australia initiative, providing access to the AUD$1.7 billion Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund to support the development of a LCLF industry, which includes SAF and renewable diesel.

With major airlines like Qantas and Virgin Australia targeting net-zero emissions by 2050, demand for locally produced SAF is expected to surge, creating strong momentum for investment and development across the region.

This milestone builds on XCF's international expansion strategy, built on capital-efficient, regionally tailored partnerships that accelerate global SAF adoption. It follows the June 2025 Memorandum of Understanding entered into with Continual Renewable Ventures Pty. Ltd., which laid the foundation for today's binding agreement.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, commented, ""Our partnership with New Rise AU accelerates XCF's global expansion strategy and underscores the scalability of our modular renewable fuel platform. Australia combines strong policy momentum, growing aviation demand, and abundant feedstock resources, creating an excellent environment to develop renewable fuel facilities. Through New Rise AU, we're deploying our renewable fuel platform to a new market, enabling rapid growth and efficient capital use while helping drive Australia's clean energy transition. This partnership showcases how XCF's platform transforms opportunity into impact, opening new markets, fueling sustainable growth, and shaping the future of renewable energy.""

Renzo Petersen, CEO of New Rise AU, added, ""The launch of New Rise Australia represents true collaboration between XCF Global and Continual Renewables, a partnership built on a shared vision to accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Together, we intend to create a unified platform that brings together XCF's modular site design with Continual Renewable's local expertise to unlock opportunities within Australia's unique energy landscape. This is not simply a design deployment; it's the foundation for a long-term, self-sustaining renewable fuel industry that drives investment, creates jobs, and accelerates Australia's transition to energy independence. Together, we're demonstrating how collaboration can be transformed into capability, and how capability becomes the clean energy that fuels Australia's future.""

Building on today's milestone, the parties intend to execute a definitive licensing agreement within 60 days, following customary diligence and regulatory review. The definitive agreement will include detailed provisions for intellectual property, branding, governance, performance milestones, and long-term operational coordination.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/XCF_Logo_XCF_Global_Vertical_29092024_eac06fc7f9.png,N,,2025-10-31 12:01:56.808216

In Europe and the United States—the main production hubs—SAF is three to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.
“Petrobras is ready to supply renewable jet fuel (SAF) using Brazilian-developed technology as early as 2025, ahead of international requirements,” the company said, without giving a firm start date.
Latam Airlines is also monitoring domestic SAF production.
“That’s why the company supports public policies to encourage SAF production and use, ensuring a fair and affordable transition for the industry and passengers,” the statement said.","Worldwide, the aviation sector has pledged to reach net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050. In Brazil, regulatory changes take effect in 2027, requiring airlines to cut emissions by at least 1% through the use of sustainable fuels.

According to consulting firm Bain & Company, the transportation sector accounts for 16% of global greenhouse-gas emissions—and 40% of those are considered hard to decarbonize through electrification. Aviation alone is responsible for about 2.5% of total global emissions.

In this context, sustainable fuels are viewed as the most viable short- and medium-term solution for reducing transport-sector emissions. Yet Bain estimates SAF’s share of global aviation fuel will rise only from about 1% today to 21% by 2050—based on national targets for its use, said Felipe Cammarata, a partner in Bain’s energy and natural resources practice in South America.

Brazil adopted its own targets under the Fuels of the Future Law, enacted in 2024. Under the law, airlines operating domestic flights must cut their emissions by 1% through the use of SAF starting in 2027, with the requirement gradually increasing to 10% by 2037.

Eduardo Calderon, director of operations, control, and sustainability at Gol, said the industry is concerned about the 2027 mandate, especially since Brazil still lacks domestic production of the biofuel. “Our concern is the 2027 target. Importing doesn’t make sense—and 2027 is right around the corner,” he said, noting that the higher cost of SAF is also a challenge. In Europe and the United States—the main production hubs—SAF is three to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

While waiting for domestic supply to emerge, airlines are focusing on other measures to curb emissions, chiefly fleet renewal. Gol’s new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft emit 15% less CO₂ than the previous generation—a gain also achieved by other manufacturers.

In parallel, Gol is testing a pilot carbon-offset project based on the “Book & Claim” model, which allows it to buy carbon credits generated by other airlines abroad that have flown using sustainable fuel. The federal government is now debating whether to recognize this mechanism for official emissions accounting. “It’s a two-way street,” Mr. Calderon said. “Right now we offset through SAF used abroad. But once we start producing in Brazil, we won’t have to export the fuel to claim its sustainability attributes. It’s an important step while SAF isn’t physically available here.”

Several projects are under development in Brazil, with production expected to begin only after 2028. These include initiatives by Petrobras, Refinaria Riograndense, and Acelen. Petrobras is also developing renewable jet fuel using the same co-processing technology already applied to its renewable diesel. “Petrobras is ready to supply renewable jet fuel (SAF) using Brazilian-developed technology as early as 2025, ahead of international requirements,” the company said, without giving a firm start date. The earlier target had been mid-2024.

Latam Airlines is also monitoring domestic SAF production. The group has pledged to source 5% of its fuel from SAF by 2030. “Latam is committed to leading aviation’s transformation in South America and meeting the global goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 through energy efficiency, new technologies, SAF, and carbon offset via ecosystem conservation,” the company said in a statement. It described SAF as an “essential pillar” of decarbonization. Still, it acknowledged that its current cost remains a barrier. “That’s why the company supports public policies to encourage SAF production and use, ensuring a fair and affordable transition for the industry and passengers,” the statement said.

Azul also classifies SAF as a strategic issue in its operations and remains committed to the 2050 reduction goals. “To meet those goals, the use of SAF is essential,” said Filipe Alvarez, Azul’s sustainability and governance manager. “That’s why, even before the Fuels of the Future Law was approved, Azul was already working consistently to develop Brazil’s SAF supply chain, particularly through collaboration with the Brazilian Union of Biodiesel and Bio-kerosene (Ubrabio) and the National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program (ProBioQAV) under the Ministry of Mines and Energy.”

Airports are also taking action. According to a joint survey by the Ministry of Ports and Airports (MPor) and the Association of Private Port Terminals (ATP), the Brazilian airport sector invested R$138.4 million in environmental initiatives in 2023 and 2024. Key decarbonization measures include replacing fossil-fuel systems with lower-impact alternatives such as electric ground-support equipment for aircraft.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/kltoCoOIdRoBgOKbqPwHV69Gdkc=/1200x/smart/filters:cover():strip_icc()/i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/3/R/0as3S9SCil6albfAPQQQ/foto30emp-101-saf-b4.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 09:56:12.726076

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reports that Europe is on track to meet its target for adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030. The move is good news for flying greener—but it brings travel implications as well.

What the target means

Under regulations like ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, SAF will gradually replace conventional jet fuel on flights departing from EU airports. The target calls for increasing SAF shares, making flights more sustainable. EASA says the industry is moving forward.

In 2024 EU-wide SAF supply reached about 0.6 % of aviation fuel. While small, it already cut roughly 714 000 tonnes of CO₂—roughly equal to 10 000 flights between Madrid and Paris.

What this means for you as a traveller

If you’re planning a holiday or a business trip across Europe, here’s what to consider:

You might choose flights on airlines emphasising SAF use. These carriers could market themselves as greener.

While direct flight paths remain largely unchanged, cost pressures may rise as airlines invest in SAF infrastructure. Some smaller carriers could adjust their route networks.

Airports in remote or less-served regions might face slower uptake if SAF distribution is uneven. That could affect connectivity for travel off the beaten path.

The hurdles ahead

Despite strong progress, hurdles remain. SAF currently costs roughly €2 085/tonne compared to about €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel. That price gap means scaling SAF remains challenging for many airlines.

Moreover, most SAF feedstock still comes from outside the EU: around 69 % as of recent data. Finland is Europe’s largest SAF producer, contributing about 10 % of the supply.

Travel-friendly destinations and shifting routes

For world travellers keen on exploring hidden European gems, the SAF shift presents both opportunity and caution. On the plus side: greener flights mean you can feel better about your carbon footprint when visiting scenic isles, countryside airports or cultural towns.

On the caution side: smaller airports may lag in SAF access. If airlines serving them struggle with cost or logistics, your connections could change. For example, you might land at a larger hub and transfer via ground transport rather than fly direct into lightly served airports.

Smart travel planning tips

Check if your airline has announced SAF-related sustainability efforts.

When flying to remote destinations, allow buffer time in your schedule in case carrier networks adjust.

Consider alternative transport options from major hubs—train or ferry may replace a direct regional flight.

Look for flights labelled with “lower emissions” or “eco-friendly fuel” offerings (some carriers offer them).

Why this shift matters for global travellers

The aviation sector accounts for a significant chunk of emissions. SAF is seen as one of the most effective means to bring those emissions down in the next decade. The EU estimates that SAF uptake will help reach the climate goals set for 2030 and beyond.

For you, the traveller, that means you can continue to explore Europe with more confidence in the long-term sustainability of air travel. From Lisbon to Lapland, from Mediterranean islands to Alpine valleys—you’re part of a broader move toward cleaner skies.

Looking ahead

EASA emphasises that a functioning reporting system is in place and that initial SAF deliveries are happening across Member States. The agency says the first annual technical report marks an important milestone for future efforts.

If all goes well, by 2030 airlines operating across Europe will blend significantly more SAF into their fuel mix. For your future flights this could mean slightly different aircraft, slightly different fuel sourcing, but many of the same beautiful destinations. What changes is the travel footprint you leave behind.

Final thoughts

Flying across Europe remains a seamless adventure for travellers from around the world. But as sustainability becomes integral to aviation, the experience subtly shifts. Routes may evolve, carriers may adjust, but the goal remains: to keep exploring Europe’s rich tapestry of places with less impact on the planet.

The formal signing ceremony, live on day three of the FII9 event, marked a pivotal milestone in RedCloud’s expansion into the Kingdom—aligning with Saudi Vision 2030 and the country’s strategic focus on digital transformation and supply chain modernization. The joint venture, RedCloud Arabia, will deploy RedAI’s algorithmic infrastructure to digitize and transform FMCG trade across the country.

The Company and Kayanat held joint meetings with key players within the Saudi FMCG Industry—who are believed to represent around 20% of the $61Bn market 3 —supporting a targeted launch date of December 2025.

“FII9 was a catalytic event for RedCloud, where we heard from industry leaders to heads of state who shared our concern for global trading challenges including spiraling consumer prices and the waste of critical resources,” said Justin Floyd, CEO and Founder of RedCloud. “Bloomberg built the intelligence foundation for financial markets. Google built it for the internet. Supply chains are next. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be a pioneer and leader in solving this problem and we are delighted to work with Majid and his team on expanding RedCloud’s intelligence foundation for global trade, moving human guesswork and manual trading to algorithmic transformation.”

“For nearly 90 years, Saudi Arabia has powered the world through reliable and affordable energy supply chains. Today, that same advantage will fuel the world’s AI factories,” added Majid Alghaslan, Founder of Kayanat. “Our collaboration with RedCloud reflects Vision 2030’s ambition to transform the Kingdom into a global hub where technology, data, and intelligence redefine trade—building predictive, autonomous, and sustainable economies of the future.”

RedCloud Arabia intends to focus on localizing RedAI’s capabilities to serve Saudi distributors, retailers, and manufacturers, enabling smarter purchasing decisions and addressing inventory shortfalls. The Company believes that traditional AI and LLMs train on public internet data, while RedCloud trains its models on private b2b supply chain data that can’t be accessed by the AI incumbents. The Company’s platform has already demonstrated success in high-growth markets such as Nigeria, Brazil, and South Africa, and is now poised to bring similar impact to the Middle East.

The announcement follows significant operational momentum for RedCloud: the Company more than doubled customer numbers year-over-year in the first half of 2025, launched a new partnership strategy for payments and financial services to maximize working capital across supply chains, and expanded its technology ecosystem through the NVIDIA Connect program alongside existing partnerships with AWS and Snowflake.

FII9 convened around 600 global leaders 4 including heads of state, speakers and innovators under the theme “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth.” RedCloud’s presence at the event underscored its commitment to building the intelligence foundation for the FMCG industry—from manufacturer to retailer—within Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, and beyond.

GEELONG, Australia, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carbon Revolution plc (Nasdaq: CREV) (the “Company”), a Tier 1 OEM supplier and the leading global manufacturer of lightweight advanced technology automotive carbon fiber wheels, today announced that it has reached agreement with Orion Infrastructure Capital (“OIC”) to provide a further up to US$7 million of funding. The Company also reports the cancellation of two electric vehicle (“EV”) wheel programs, which is consistent with the weakening of demand across the broader EV market.

Further US$7 million of OIC funding

Of the up to US$7 million of OIC funding, US$5 million was released on October 31, 2025, in exchange for the issuance of additional senior secured notes. The notes will have substantially the same terms as the Company’s existing senior secured notes outstanding (the “Existing Notes”). In connection with this funding tranche, the Company will also issue to OIC penny warrants to purchase an aggregate number of shares equal to 5.0% of the Company’s shares outstanding.

The release of the second US$2 million tranche of funding is subject to the agreement of both parties, with funding to occur on a date no earlier than March 31, 2026. As part of this funding, both OIC and the holders of Existing Notes have agreed to partial payment in kind, in lieu of cash, for certain interest payments until July 2026 and a further deferral of the commencement of principal repayments to January 2027.

Program cancellations and important business update

As previously disclosed in the Company’s release of July 25, 2025, the Company has a number of new programs entering, or expected to enter, production in the near-term, however, as a result of a decline in the volume of wheels ordered or projected to be ordered by certain customers, the Company revised its revenue forecasts downward and slowed its initial short-term expansion plans.

The Company has continued to experience lower than expected demand for certain programs, especially those tied to the EV space. The weakening of the broader EV market has led to the early cancellation of two programs by a customer, which the Company had initially expected to contribute substantial wheel volumes. The Company is pursuing claims in relation to these cancelled programs.

In addition, as disclosed in the Company’s release of June 3, 2025, the Company is currently not in compliance with certain Nasdaq continued listing requirements. The Company has submitted a plan of compliance to Nasdaq where it has sought an extension in accordance with its plan and is waiting for Nasdaq’s determination. However, even if such plan is accepted, the Nasdaq staff only has the discretion to grant an exception for regaining compliance until November 26, 2025.

Notwithstanding the additional US$5 million of OIC funding announced today (and the expected release of a further US$2 million of OIC funding), the Company expects that it may need to obtain additional funding in the short term and is actively seeking other strategic alternatives to be completed within this fiscal year (ending June 30, 2026).

In order to obtain sufficient liquidity to fund its business and operations, the extent of which funding need is partially dependent upon the outcome of the customer claims being pursued by the Company mentioned above, as well as to contribute towards regaining compliance with Nasdaq continued listing requirements, the Company is exploring other potential strategic and financing options, a portion of which may need to be obtained significantly earlier than the end of the Company’s fiscal year. The Company makes no assurances that it will be able to secure any of the aforementioned on satisfactory terms, or at all.

Geneva, Switzerland, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) (""SEALSQ"" or ""Company""), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI, and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products, today announced a new initiative leveraging the expertise of its subsidiary IC’Alps to develop integrated cybersecurity and functional safety solutions for the global automotive industry.

This initiative aims to position SEALSQ at the forefront of protecting next-generation autonomous and connected vehicles against emerging cybersecurity threats. Autonomous and software-defined vehicles are becoming highly interconnected digital platforms, relying on over-the-air (OTA) updates, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, and advanced sensor fusion capabilities. However, classical cryptographic systems, such as RSA and ECDSA, are vulnerable to future quantum computer attacks, which could compromise vehicle control systems, data integrity, navigation, and safety.

With autonomous vehicles becoming mission-critical systems, cybersecurity and functional safety must evolve together. SEALSQ plans to leverage its secure semiconductor technology in combination with the expertise of its subsidiary IC’Alps, a leader in custom ASIC design for safety-critical industries.

Because it is cheaper and always safer to prevent, rather than correct failure consequences, IC’Alps applies Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) as a core methodology to detect, mitigate, and prevent potential systematic failures as early as possible. As ASICs frequently power critical system functions in automotive, IC’Alps integrates DFMEA (Design FMEA) into its design strategy in full compliance with IATF 16949 and other safety-sensitive industry standards such as medical devices (ISO 13485) and aeronautics (AS 9100 / JISQ 9100 / EN 9100). This proactive approach aims to ensure reliability, quality, and long-term operational integrity.

Additionally, these processes can directly support customers targeting ISO 26262 certification and developing systems across ASIL-A to ASIL-D levels. FMEA is a cornerstone of the technical risk management process under IATF 16949, ensuring robustness in design and production by anticipating and preventing failures that could affect yield, reliability, and safety. IC’Alps has developed and continued to develop critical IP blocks and complete ASICs for demanding automotive applications for worldwide leading semiconductor players, and Tier 1 suppliers , up to ASIL certification.

With IC’Alps’ expertise in DFMEA, ASIC development rigor, and activities dealing with ISO 21434 (automotive cybersecurity), SEALSQ ensures its secure silicon meets the highest standards of both cybersecurity resilience and functional safety for the automotive industry.

https://www.icalps.com/fr/how-fmea-tools-translates-to-automotive-asic-design-at-icalps/

Why Post-Quantum Security is Critical for Autonomous Vehicles

As vehicles evolve into fully connected, software-defined systems, cybersecurity is no longer optional, it is foundational to safety, reliability, and consumer trust. Post-quantum security represents the next frontier in protecting these intelligent platforms from emerging threats including:

Imminent quantum vulnerability: Classical encryption protecting vehicles today will be breakable by quantum computers.

Growing connectivity risks : Constant OTA and V2X interactions expand attack surfaces.

Future-proofing safety and trust: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) implementation ensures long-term vehicle integrity and secure autonomy.

""The future of mobility must be secure by design, not only for today, but for the quantum era,"" said Carlos Moreira, Founder & CEO of SEALSQ. ""By combining SEALSQ’s post-quantum cybersecurity leadership with IC’Alps' world-class ASIC safety methodology, we aim to ensure autonomous vehicles remain protected, reliable, and trusted for decades ahead.""

About SEALSQ:

SEALSQ is a leading innovator in Post-Quantum Technology hardware and software solutions. Our technology seamlessly integrates Semiconductors, PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), and Provisioning Services, with a strategic emphasis on developing state-of-the-art Quantum Resistant Cryptography and Semiconductors designed to address the urgent security challenges posed by quantum computing. As quantum computers advance, traditional cryptographic methods like RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are increasingly vulnerable.

SEALSQ is pioneering the development of Post-Quantum Semiconductors that provide robust, future-proof protection for sensitive data across a wide range of applications, including Multi-Factor Authentication tokens, Smart Energy, Medical and Healthcare Systems, Defense, IT Network Infrastructure, Automotive, and Industrial Automation and Control Systems.

MIAMI, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wrap Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: WRAP) (""Wrap"" or the ""Company"") , a global leader in innovative non-lethal public safety technologies company, today announced that the Company’s BolaWrap® Instructor Course has been recertified through the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST) National Certification Program (NCP).

Originally certified in 2023, this 2025 renewal indicates that Wrap’s core non-lethal training curriculum continues to meet the national standard for police and corrections education established by IADLEST and adopted by Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) organizations across the country. National Certification is currently accepted in 37 states, with several states working on legislation to make NCP certification mandatory, positioning Wrap’s training content for broader adoption and agency-level credit eligibility.

The IADLEST National Certification Program, launched in 2015, was created to establish a single, rigorous national standard for law enforcement training. Courses submitted for NCP must meet strict criteria in content, instructor materials, and student support. All submissions are evaluated by a panel of law enforcement training experts to ensure that certified courses fulfill or surpass state POST requirements and can be credited for mandated continuing education. For agencies, this external validation helps lessen administrative workload and supports liability mitigation by demonstrating that officers were trained according to an accepted national standard.

Wrap’s 2025 recertification includes several significant upgrades to the BolaWrap® Instructor Course, supporting the Company’s non-lethal pre-escalation strategy and the expanded deployment of the BolaWrap® 150:

Curriculum refocused on non-lethal criteria and hands-on control tactics founded in policy;

Focus on “when” and “why” Best BolaWrap techniques and tactics, not just device operation;

Redefined success metrics on compliance or control without resorting to higher levels of force, achieved through sight, sound, sensation, and, when needed, restraint;

Refreshed field-use videos, scenarios, and analysis to reflect real-world applications.

The Company expects this recognized training credential to support Wrap’s 2026 training and engagement strategy under WrapTactics™ by making non-lethal instruction more accessible to operators, instructors, and allied public-safety professionals seeking to improve outcomes in their communities. As Wrap develops additional training modules, including those built in collaboration with other law enforcement training leaders, the Company plans to evaluate future courses for NCP submission to maintain a high-value, credible training portfolio.

Wrap’s public safety portfolio includes the non-lethal BolaWrap® 150 device, the WrapReality™ immersive training platform, WrapVision™ body-worn camera and evidence management system, WrapTactics™ training programs, and next-generation counter-UAS solutions, all designed to provide safer, scalable, and cost-effective technologies for public safety, defense, and critical infrastructure customers.

About Wrap Technologies, Inc.

Wrap Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq: WRAP) a global leader in innovative public safety technologies and non-lethal tools, delivering cutting-edge technology with exceptional people to address the complex, modern day challenges facing public safety organizations.

Wrap’s BolaWrap® 150 solution leads in pre-escalation intended to provide law enforcement with a safer choice for nearly every phase of a critical incident. This innovative, patented device deploys a multi-sensory, cognitive disruption that leverages sight, sound and sensation to expand the pre-escalation period and gives officers the advantage and critical time to manage non-compliant subjects before resorting to higher-force options. The BolaWrap 150 is not pain-based compliance. It does not shoot, strike, shock, or incapacitate, instead, it helps officers strategically operate pre-escalation on the force continuum, reducing the risk of injury to both officers and subjects. Used by over 1,000 agencies across the U.S. and in 60 countries, BolaWrap® is backed by training certified by the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training (IADLEST), reinforcing Wrap’s commitment to public safety through cutting-edge technology and expert training.

Wrap Reality™ VR is a fully immersive training simulator to enhance decision-making under pressure.

As a comprehensive public safety training platform, it provides first responders with realistic, interactive scenarios that reflect the evolving challenges of modern law enforcement. By offering a growing library of real-world situations, Wrap Reality™ is intended to equip officers with the skills and confidence to navigate high-stakes encounters effectively, which we believe leads to safer outcomes for both responders and the communities they serve.

WrapVision is an all-new body-worn camera and evidence management system built for efficiency.

Designed for efficiency, security, and transparency to meet the rigorous demands of modern law enforcement, WrapVision captures, stores, and helps manage digital evidence, ensuring operational security, regulatory compliance, and enhanced video picture quality and field of view.

The WrapVision camera, powered by IONODES, boasts streamlined cloud integration and final North American assembly, with a critical made-in-America roadmap projected for early 2026. This track helps ensure data integrity and helps eliminate critical concerns over unauthorized access or foreign surveillance risks.

America’s Fastest Growing Beer—American Rebel Light—and the NHRA continue to deliver a winning combination at the racetrack and on national TV, leveraging national sponsorships to transforming race-day fan passion into lifelong customer brand loyalty

Nashville, TN, Oct. 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Rebel Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: AREB)—the unapologetically patriotic lifestyle brand behind American Rebel Light Beer ( www.americanrebelbeer.com ), America’s Patriotic, God-Fearing, Constitution-Loving, National Anthem-Singing, Stand Your Ground Beer —heads to Las Vegas with a full-throttle presence at the 25th Annual Dodge NHRA Nevada Nationals powered by Direct Connection , the fifth of six Countdown rounds (Oct. 30–Nov. 2). American Rebel is the primary sponsor with TSR Nitro for Matt Hagan’s Dodge//SRT Hellcat Funny Car and John Hall’s Buell Pro Stock Motorcycle, backed by national coverage on FS1 and full-weekend streaming on NHRA.TV .

For American Rebel Light Beer, NHRA weekends are more than exposure—they’re a connection with Americans who build, tune, race and drink what they love. The energy in the pits, on the track and captured on the national TV broadcast turns into real-world momentum at the shelf, accelerating distribution and fueling repeat purchase with a light lager built for clean, crisp refreshment.

“ NHRA weekends are where our brand meets America face-to-face. Teaming with TSR Nitro, John Hall and the NHRA on the sport’s biggest stages turns race day excitement into repeat purchase behavior. That’s the power of the American Rebel Brand with motorsports fans—one unmistakable combination that converts fans into lifelong customers of America’s Patriotic Beer, American Rebel Light,” said Andy Ross, CEO, American Rebel .

NHRA fans are hands-on, flag-forward, and fiercely loyal—people who keep their word and back brands that back America. That’s the American Rebel customer. When race fans pick up American Rebel Light, they’re not just reaching for another light beer; they’re choosing a beer that reflects their values and tastes—a beer that shows up where they show up, from the starting line to the checkout line. Motorsports like the NHRA + American Rebel Light Beer is the right partnership, in the right place, at exactly the right time.

Matt Hagan, Driver of the American Rebel Beer Dodge//SRT Hellcat Funny Car

Hagan rolls into The Strip at Las Vegas Motor Speedway as one of the defining forces of the Countdown— second in Funny Car, 112 points out of the lead , and on a track where he’s at his best: four Las Vegas wins and 11 career final rounds at this venue. Las Vegas marks Hagan’s 371st Funny Car start and 17th Nevada Nationals appearance —proof of a driver who knows how to channel the desert air into speed. “ Vegas is always big in the Countdown. The altitude can make power tricky, but our Dodge//SRT Hellcat has always responded here, ” Hagan said.

TSR Nitro’s two-car firepower sharpens the spear. Tony Stewart arrives sixth in Top Fuel , giving the organization a one-two punch as the championship chase tightens. Between them, the duo owns six combined wins at The Strip (Hagan with four)—and the experience to make every qualifying session count.

NHRA + American Rebel - America’s Patriotic Brand bring maximum horsepower

From Top Fuel to Funny Car to Pro Stock Motorcycle, American Rebel + NHRA is a natural fit: intense, authentic, and built for fans who show up early and stay until the last pair fires. That alignment is paying off. American Rebel Light Beer —a premium domestic light lager brewed without corn, rice, or added sweeteners —comes in at ~100 calories, 3.2g carbs, 4.3% ABV with a crisp, clean finish and lighter feel. Distribution now spans 15 states — AR, CT, FL, IN, IA, KS, KY, MN, MS, MO, NV, NC, OH, TN, VA —with chain activation growing as fast as the fanbase. The roar at the track becomes loyalty in the aisle.

Andy Ross

“Put American Rebel Light on Matt Hagan’s Funny Car and John Hall’s Pro Stock Motorcycle and you get a megaphone and a direct connection to the most responsive fans in motorsports. It’s a formula that grows distribution, moves cases, and builds a community of lifelong fans and customers for American Rebel Light Beer.” — Andy Ross, CEO, American Rebel

John Hall and the American Rebel Pro Stock Motorcycle

John Hall brings serious momentum to Las Vegas on the American Rebel Beer Buell , with two national event victories this season—Norwalk and Reading heading into the Nevada Nationals. Hall is a racer’s racer—sharp on the tree, relentless on race day—and his connection with fans mirrors the way American Rebel shows up in communities across the country. “ John Hall is a true rebel—he races with heart, honor, and the kind of determination that defines the American spirit. He’s out there proving what it means to Rebel Up ! ” said Andy Ross .

Forward-Looking Statement

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, expectations regarding American Rebel Holdings, Inc.’s (“American Rebel” or the “Company”) future performance, distributor partnerships, market expansion, brand visibility, consumer demand, and shareholder value creation. Specifically, statements related to anticipated distribution growth, new market entries, potential distributor agreements, and strategic business development initiatives are forward-looking in nature.

Such statements are based on current assumptions, estimates, and projections about the Company’s business and industry, as well as management’s beliefs and expectations. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These risks include, but are not limited to: changes in consumer preferences and purchasing behavior; competitive pressures in the beverage industry; supply chain disruptions or production limitations; regulatory changes affecting distribution, labeling, or marketing; the Company’s ability to secure, maintain, or expand distributor and retail partnerships; the outcome and timing of contract negotiations; the success and availability of marketing and promotional activities; and the risks detailed in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2025.

Additionally, the Company appeared before a Nasdaq panel on September 30, 2025, to address its stockholder equity deficiency, which was not cured prior to the expiration of the 180-day extension in August 2025. Since June 30, 2025, the Company has initiated multiple transactions — including debt conversions, minority equity investments, and equity issuances — that were not reflected in its Q2 FY2025 Form 10-Q. Management believes these actions have collectively positioned the Company above the $2.5 million minimum stockholder equity threshold required by Nasdaq. However, the Company is currently awaiting the panel’s decision, which will be based upon both the Company’s presentation and the Nasdaq staff’s recommendations. There can be no assurance that the panel will concur with management’s position or render a favorable ruling.

Any forward-looking statement made herein speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict all of them.

At September 30, 2025, the loan and investment portfolio’s unpaid principal balance (""UPB""), excluding loan loss reserves, was $11.71 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.64%, compared to $11.61 billion and 7.03% at June 30, 2025. Including certain fees earned and costs associated with the loan and investment portfolio, the weighted average interest rate was 7.27% at September 30, 2025, compared to 7.86% at June 30, 2025. The decrease in rate was primarily due to additional delinquent and modified loans along with a decline in SOFR in the third quarter of 2025.

The average balance of the Company’s loan and investment portfolio during the third quarter of 2025, excluding loan loss reserves, was $11.76 billion with a weighted average yield of 6.95%, compared to $11.53 billion and 7.95% for the second quarter of 2025. The decline in the weighted average yield was primarily due to an $18 million one-time reversal of accrued interest on previously modified loans, along with additional delinquencies and rate modifications in the third quarter of 2025.

During the third quarter of 2025, the Company recorded a $17.5 million net provision for loan losses associated with CECL, which was net of a $5.5 million loan loss recovery. At September 30, 2025, the Company’s total allowance for loan losses was $246.3 million. The Company had twenty-five non-performing loans with a UPB of $566.1 million, before related loan loss reserves of $22.9 million, compared to nineteen non-performing loans with a UPB of $471.8 million, before loan loss reserves of $36.4 million at June 30, 2025.

In addition, at September 30, 2025, the Company had eight loans with a total UPB of $183.1 million (before related loan loss reserves of $15.3 million) that were less than 60 days past due classified as non-accrual, compared to three loans with a total UPB of $56.9 million at June 30, 2025. Interest income on these loans is only being recorded to the extent cash is received.

During the third quarter of 2025, the Company modified 19 loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty with a total UPB of $808.6 million, of which 18 loans with a total UPB of $775.2 million, contained interest rates based on pricing over SOFR ranging from 3.10% to 5.00% and were modified to provide temporary rate relief through a pay and accrual feature. At September 30, 2025, these modified loans had a weighted average pay rate of 4.83% and a weighted average accrual rate of 2.87%. In addition, of the total modified loans for the third quarter, $36.2 million were non-performing at June 30, 2025, and are now current in accordance with their modified terms.

During the third quarter of 2025, the Company recognized a $48.0 million cash gain from one of its equity investment assets.

Foreclosed on two loans with a UPB totaling $122.5 million and sold one $10.1 million real estate owned property. Additionally, in October 2025, the Company foreclosed on an additional five loans with a total UPB of $127.4 million.

Financing Activity

The decrease in the weighted average interest rate was primarily due to a decline in the SOFR rate during the third quarter of 2025.

The average balance of debt that finances the Company’s loan and investment portfolio for the third quarter of 2025 was $9.96 billion, as compared to $9.52 billion for the second quarter of 2025.

Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have found an innovative way to turn everyday food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Their new process, published in Nature Communications, could help the aviation industry achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2050.

The technique uses a method known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which applies high heat and pressure to convert food waste into a thick biocrude oil—similar to how crude oil naturally forms underground. This biocrude is then cleaned and refined using hydrogen and catalysts to make it suitable for jet engines.

Dr. Sabrina Summers, lead researcher from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, explained that HTL can process various waste sources, including food scraps, animal manure, sewage sludge, and crop residues. This flexibility makes it ideal for creating renewable fuels from agricultural and industrial by-products.

After purification, the biocrude undergoes catalytic hydrotreating, which removes impurities such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The team discovered that a cobalt molybdenum catalyst was the most efficient for refining the fuel. The final product passed all ASTM and FAA jet fuel standards—proving it can power aircraft without blending with fossil fuels.

Professor Yuanhui Zhang, who led the project, emphasized that the technology offers vast potential for scaling up. “Our research provides solutions to engineering challenges and opens doors for industries to commercialize sustainable aviation fuel,” Zhang said. He added that this innovation not only supports environmental goals but also strengthens economic development by turning waste into valuable resources.

This research demonstrates how circular bioeconomy principles can reshape industries by reusing waste, reducing pollution, and creating sustainable products for the future.

ReFuelEU requires suppliers to blend increasing shares of SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050.
ERA calls on EU policymakers to urgently revise the ReFuelEU Regulation to ensure Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is scaled up fairly and efficiently across all regions and align ReFuelEU implementation with the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) funding priorities.
A revised framework would accelerate SAF deployment, strengthen competition, deliver genuine emissions reductions, and protect Europe’s essential air connectivity.","The European Regions Airline Association (ERA) has released a study, revealing that the uneven implementation of the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation is creating structural disadvantages for regional carriers and the destinations they serve.

The research shows that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply is heavily concentrated at major hubs, leaving many smaller airports without access and exposing Europe’s most remote communities to rising costs, compliance burdens and reduced connectivity.

ERA’s airline CEOs stress that, while the sector is fully committed to achieving net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, ReFuelEU’s current rollout risks penalising smaller and regional airlines and isolating the communities they serve.

Montserrat Barriga, Director General of ERA said: “Europe’s green transition cannot come at the cost of territorial regional cohesion. If ReFuelEU continues on its current path, Europe risks seeing airlines go bankrupt and losing vital air connectivity.”

Under the Destination 2050 roadmap, SAF is expected to deliver the largest share of aviation’s emission reductions. ReFuelEU requires suppliers to blend increasing shares of SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 70% by 2050.

However, ERA members report that early implementation is ‘fragmented and unfair’, pushing airlines to redesign their network and threatening the viability of some routes.

ERA calls on EU policymakers to urgently revise the ReFuelEU Regulation to ensure Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is scaled up fairly and efficiently across all regions and align ReFuelEU implementation with the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) funding priorities.

Vietjet Seals The Deal The deal comes as Vietjet converted its Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus into a firm order for 100 A321neos.
Including aircraft operated by Vietjet Thailand and Vietjet Qazaqstan, the group has 121 aircraft, comprising A320-200s, A321-200s, A321neos, and A330-200s.
Prior to the Vietjet deal, Airbus had received 289 A321neo orders in 2025, including 75 from Avolon, 55 from BOC Aviation, and 40 from United Airlines.","Vietnamese low-cost carrier Vietjet has confirmed an order for 100 Airbus A321neo aircraft as part of its fleet modernization strategy. The order brings its total commitment for the A321neo to 280 aircraft.

Vietjet is already a large Airbus customer and A321neo operator. With its growing order book, the carrier will more than triple its fleet in the coming years. Meanwhile, Airbus continues to grow its backlog for the A320neo family, with over 7,100 A321neos ordered by nearly 100 customers as of September 30, 2025.

Vietjet Seals The Deal

The deal comes as Vietjet converted its Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus into a firm order for 100 A321neos. The MoU was signed at the Paris Air Show in June, marking a significant milestone for both companies. At the time of the agreement, Airbus reported that the carrier had options for an additional 50 aircraft. The finalization of the contract reflects Vietjet’s commitment to fleet modernization and network expansion.

The A321neo is the largest member of the A320neo family, offering longer range and more seating capacity. Airbus markets the aircraft as being 20% more fuel-efficient and 50% quieter than previous-generation single-aisle jets. As with the manufacturer’s other in-production aircraft, the A321neo is capable of operating with 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target to increase to 100% within the next five years. Speaking about the order, Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said:

“This is not merely a commercial contract, but a symbol of trust, aspiration, and a shared vision for sustainable development and global connectivity.”

Growing The Partnership With Airbus

The A321neo order follows Vietjet’s May 2025 order for 20 A330-900s. The contract doubled the airline’s firm orders for the A330neo to 40 aircraft. The new-generation widebody will allow the Vietnamese carrier to increase flights on high-capacity routes across Asia-Pacific and launch new long-haul routes to Europe. The A330-900 is the larger of the two A330neo variants.

Vietjet currently operates an Airbus-strong fleet, although it briefly leased a COMAC C909 for six months and took delivery of its first 737 MAX. Including aircraft operated by Vietjet Thailand and Vietjet Qazaqstan, the group has 121 aircraft, comprising A320-200s, A321-200s, A321neos, and A330-200s. The airline also has orders for over 400 aircraft, including the A321XLR and Boeing 737 MAX. Last month, Vietjet welcomed its latest Airbus A330, with registration VN-A820.

Vietjet flies to over 18 domestic destinations and 37 international destinations in the Asia-Pacific region. Its Airbus single-aisle jets are deployed to nearly 50 destinations, while the widebodies are deployed to seven destinations from Ho Chi Minh City. According to Cirium, an aviation analytics company, the top widebody route is from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. The route sees up to 37 weekly flights. It is followed by Nha Trang to Hanoi with daily flights and Melbourne to Ho Chi Minh with five weekly flights. The top narrowbody route is also between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh with up to 117 weekly flights each way.

Growing The A320 Family Order Book

As of the end of September 2025, Airbus has received over 11,200 orders for the A320neo family, including 7,142 A321neos. The manufacturer has delivered 1,859 A321neos worldwide. Some of the largest customers include IndiGo and Wizz Air. Prior to the Vietjet deal, Airbus had received 289 A321neo orders in 2025, including 75 from Avolon, 55 from BOC Aviation, and 40 from United Airlines.

This report examines the transition from waste oils to next-generation fuels, assessing the scaling of renewable diesel, SAF, ethanol, and biodiesel alongside the emergence of synthetic fuels, ammonia, and methanol, and highlighting the feedstock shift toward residues and algae as the sector looks beyond 2030.

Global transport is under pressure to decarbonize, with heavy-duty vehicles, aviation, and shipping proving difficult to electrify. This report explores how alternative fuels are scaling, from today's reliance on renewable diesel, SAF, ethanol, and FAME biodiesel to tomorrow's frontier solutions, such as synthetic fuels, green and blue ammonia, and green and blue methanol.

Backed by mandates such as the EU ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and IMO's 2050 decarbonization targets, low-carbon fuels are attracting investment and corporate commitments from leaders like Maersk, Finnair, and United Airlines. Yet sustainability constraints on waste oils are driving a feedstock transition toward residues, MSW, and algae, with commercial availability still a decade away. This report offers critical insights into technology pathways, policy frameworks, and market opportunities shaping the future of low-carbon fuels.

Key Highlights

Transport emissions are projected to reach 8,019 MtCO? by 2030, with heavy truck emissions having risen at a 2.3% CAGR between 2000 and 2020, underscoring the urgency of diversifying decarbonization pathways.

Renewable diesel (RD) capacity is forecast to grow at a 16% CAGR between 2025 and 2030, with North America leading the way, followed by Europe and Asia.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is set to expand at a faster 36% CAGR over 2025-2030, supported by the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandating a 6% SAF blend by 2030 and voluntary airline commitments, such as United Airlines targeting 10% SAF by 2030.

Innovation in synthetic fuels, ammonia, and methanol is advancing, with shipping already leading methanol adoption, for example Maersk has over 25 methanol-fueled vessels on order, backed by offtake agreements with producers such as Orsted and Methanex.

The feedstock transition is underway: current reliance on waste lipids (animal fats, used cooking oil, vegetable oils) is constrained, driving investment in lignocellulosic residues, MSW-to-fuel, and algae, which offer scalability, circularity, and significant lifecycle emission reductions.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Annual Technical Report found that 0.6% of Europe’s supplied aviation fuel for 2024 was SAF. This percentage needs to increase rapidly, but nevertheless saved 714 kilotonnes of carbon emissions, the equivalent of around 10,000 flights between Madrid and Paris.

Overall, EASA believes the EU is on track to achieve its 6% blending target in the next five years. Whether the bloc hits its interim target of 2% SAF in 2025 will be assessed at the close of this calendar year.

China is Europe’s biggest supplier of biofuel

EASA’s findings also highlight the ongoing cost obstacles to SAF adoption. Currently, the average price of SAF sits at €2,085/tonne, compared to €734/tonne for conventional jet fuel. Until the cost becomes more competitive, it is difficult to see how SAF use can scale successfully. Earlier this year, Airlines for Europe (A4E) criticised the EU for imposing SAF mandates without taking action to create a viable SAF market. Nevertheless, EASA’s report affirms progress on the 6% target.

Europe’s biggest producer of SAF is currently Finland, responsible for 10% of supply. However, 69% of feedstock originates outside of the EU, with China the biggest supplier.

Maria Rueda, EASA’s safety management, sustainability and global outreach director, said:

This first annual technical report marks an important milestone and makes clear that the EU has taken important first steps.

A functioning reporting system is now in place, initial reporting compliance levels are solid, and SAF delivery is happening across multiple member states. This report sets an important benchmark for our sustainability efforts in the future.

The team converted food waste into biocrude oil through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), which can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil and then they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel. They said this approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

The process is detailed in Nature Communications and could help the aviation industry meet its 2050 net-zero ambition.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE).

For this project, the researchers used waste from a food processing facility. Globally, over 30 per cent of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain, from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, leaving behind the hydrocarbons needed for fuel.

After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimise the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel.

They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the US Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample is said to have passed Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel without requiring additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang said.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said",https://s44864.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sabrina20ummers.webp,N,,2025-10-31 05:56:25.902326

Air India’s progressive steps under his leadership underscore how Indian companies can responsibly innovate while contributing to national and global environmental goals.","Dr. Nilay Ranjan’s professional journey spans over two decades across government, non-profit, and corporate sectors, powered by a dedication to sustainability and social responsibility.

Since joining Air India Limited as Head of Sustainability and CSR in September 2024, he has been instrumental in driving the airline’s transition towards greener operations.

Under his leadership, Air India signed a game-changing MoU with Indian Oil Corporation in 2025 for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply, part of India’s ambition to achieve 5% SAF blending by 2030 and align with global net zero objectives.

“Sustainability is not a separate agenda; it’s core to future business viability,” Dr. Ranjan asserts. This piece traces his career journey, his impact at Air India, and the broader implications for India’s clean aviation future.

From Rural Development to Corporate Leadership

Before emerging as a CSR leader, Dr. Nilay Ranjan cut his teeth as a Rural Development and Convergence Expert with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), working on government flagship rural employment initiatives such as MGNREGS.

His foundational work in rural convergence and policy formulation laid the groundwork for his systemic understanding of sustainable development challenges in India. Dr. Ranjan himself notes, “My time in rural development ingrained the importance of inclusive growth and multi-stakeholder collaboration.”

With a PhD in International Relations from Jawaharlal Nehru University and executive education from the Indian School of Business, he transitioned into corporate CSR at Idea Cellular Ltd (later Vodafone Idea), where he oversaw CSR strategies for education, health, livelihood, and environmental initiatives.

His role evolved into managing ESG frameworks and a diversified grant portfolio covering over 24 NGOs before shifting to lead Education programs at Reliance Foundation. At every stage, his approach was anchored in aligning corporate goals with social impact, reflecting a balance of empathy and pragmatism.

Leading Air India’s Green Transformation

Dr. Ranjan took the helm of Air India’s Sustainability and CSR division at a time when the aviation sector faced increasing pressure for climate accountability.

His leadership crystallised in the August 2025 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Indian Oil Corporation, pioneering the supply of ISCC-certified Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) derived primarily from waste cooking oil and bio-waste at Indian Oil’s Panipat refinery.

This SAF partnership underpins India’s policy to blend 5% of sustainable fuel by 2030, positioning Air India at the forefront of India’s decarbonisation efforts and aligning with International Civil Aviation Organization’s CORSIA program to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Complementing the fuel transition are operational efficiencies through digital tech adoption Air India has implemented SITA OptiFlight and eWAS systems, which optimise flight routing to cut fuel burn and reduce approximately 35,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.

Additionally, the airline is renewing its fleet with the acquisition of 570 new aircraft, all focused on enhancing fuel efficiency and lowering environmental impact.

Dr. Ranjan comments: “Sustainability in aviation demands an integrated approach fuel, technology, fleet, and people.” His push emphasises systematic transformation rather than isolated measures.

Multi-Stakeholder Approach for Holistic Impact

Dr. Nilay Ranjan’s unique strength lies in bridging sectors and perspectives. Air India’s CSR and sustainability thrust under his guidance includes not only fuel and tech innovation but also advocacy and community development.

Employee engagement programs foster sustainability awareness inside the organisation, while procurement policies prioritise eco-friendly vendors. Beyond the airline, Dr. Ranjan spearheads CSR projects in education, skill empowerment, and environmental stewardship inspired by his tenure at Reliance Foundation.

His philosophy is deeply systemic: “True sustainability thrives when we create shared value across environmental, social, and economic dimensions, rather than fragmented efforts.”

Air India’s inclusive sustainability narrative passionately involves government regulators, corporate partners, civil society, and local communities building a coalition for transformative, long-term impact.

The Logical Indian’s Perspective

Dr. Nilay Ranjan’s journey exemplifies the power of expertise, commitment, and ethical governance in corporate sustainability. Air India’s progressive steps under his leadership underscore how Indian companies can responsibly innovate while contributing to national and global environmental goals.

This story is a clarion call for more organisations to embed sustainability as a business imperative, not just a compliance mechanism.

The Logical Indian believes that such leadership inspires vital conversations around the intersection of economic growth and environmental preservation.

Even if fulfilled, they will displace only a sliver of fossil jet fuel.
Capacity projections fall short Even factoring in every planned project globally, total SAF capacity is expected to reach 18 million tonnes by 2030, which is less than 5% of the anticipated jet fuel demand.
Utilisation rates compound the problem: existing plants operated at just 24% in 2024, leaving 3 million tonnes idle due to limited feedstock and weak demand.
For every tonne of fossil jet fuel replaced, another tonne will be added through expanded flying.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has become aviation’s favourite headline act in the race to net zero. Airlines trumpet offtake deals, airports celebrate the first SAF refuelling, and energy majors showcase refinery conversions. But behind the marketing gloss lies a sobering statistic: even under the most optimistic assumptions, SAF will replace only about 5% of global jet fuel use by 2030

Carbon Tracker’s Fuel Disclosure report shows that while global aviation emissions have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, actual production of alternative jet fuel remains negligible, just 1 million tonnes in 2024, or 0.3% of total jet fuel consumption.

Offtake commitments

Airlines have signed a wave of offtake agreements, but these commitments still cover less than 2% of potential 2030 consumption. Many of them are non-binding memoranda or letters of intent. Even if fulfilled, they will displace only a sliver of fossil jet fuel.

Carbon Tracker’s analysis of 54 million tonnes of such deals between 2020 and 2024 found that half the volume under non-binding agreements was delivered, but the rest remains uncertain.

The report describes a “chicken-and-egg” dynamic: offtakers are hesitant to sign long-term agreements, while producers are unwilling or unable to expand capacity without them.

Capacity projections fall short

Even factoring in every planned project globally, total SAF capacity is expected to reach 18 million tonnes by 2030, which is less than 5% of the anticipated jet fuel demand.

Utilisation rates compound the problem: existing plants operated at just 24% in 2024, leaving 3 million tonnes idle due to limited feedstock and weak demand.

In realistic terms, assuming 80% utilisation, all projects combined would supply about 13.5 million tonnes, meeting only 17–30% of additional fuel demand expected from traffic growth. For every tonne of fossil jet fuel replaced, another tonne will be added through expanded flying.

A price problem that won’t go away

Even as production ramps up, cost remains a formidable barrier. HEFA-based fuels, which dominate 82% of SAF output, sold for $1,800–2,780 per tonne in 2025, more than double fossil kerosene’s $715 average.

Feedstock costs account for up to 90% of production expenses, and the limited supply of used cooking oil or animal fats is pushing prices higher.

Without large-scale subsidies or carbon pricing, the premium of SAF will continue to deter adoption. Airlines with slim margins—fuel already represents about 25% of operating costs—cannot absorb these increases indefinitely.

What it means for the Middle East

Gulf carriers operate some of the world’s densest long-haul networks. These routes rely on high-energy fuels, where SAF substitution matters most but is the most challenging to achieve.

With global supply centred in Europe and North America, regional airlines face a procurement challenge. Unless local production emerges, the Middle East risks paying a premium for imported SAF or falling behind in sustainability metrics as EU and UK mandates tighten.

The region’s oil majors, including ADNOC, ENOC, and Aramco, are beginning to explore SAF refining and e-fuel ventures, but most are still at the pilot scale. The window to secure feedstock and technology partnerships is narrowing fast.

Carbon Tracker concludes that while truly sustainable alternative jet fuel will play a role in decarbonising aviation, “it may power a portion of long-haul flights but is unlikely to scale sufficiently to make a significant dent in aviation emissions.” For Middle East aviation leaders, the message is clear: investing early in synthetic fuels, hydrogen, and efficiency technologies will be crucial to hedge against a coming supply crunch.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/10/31/sean-wang-UzFwyYIB84Q-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 05:56:35.215463

Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil and then they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel. They said this approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

The process is detailed in Nature Communications and could help the aviation industry meet its 2050 net-zero ambition.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE).

For this project, the researchers used waste from a food processing facility. Globally, over 30 per cent of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain, from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, leaving behind the hydrocarbons needed for fuel.

After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimise the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel.

They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the US Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample is said to have passed Tier Alpha and Beta pre-screening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel without requiring additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang said.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/3vxoowan/sabrina20ummers.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 05:56:52.943423

At the launch, Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said he looked forward to a “substantial outcome” by the next Apec Summit.

Topics to be considered under the Gepa include new environmental goods such as sustainable aviation fuel; non-physical environmental goods such as carbon credits; and trade-related climate measures.

These were recommended by officials from the three countries after several rounds of discussions, under a joint working group on trade and the green economy established in November 2024.

The aim is to set common rules and standards in these areas, said PM Wong. In doing so, the Gepa will modernise trade and investment policies to support the flows of such goods and services, lowering barriers to trade while accelerating the green transition.

It will also unlock opportunities in the green economy for companies and create good jobs, he added.

Collaborative spirit

“In the past, we have tended to see growth and sustainability as competing priorities,” said PM Wong in his speech at the launch. “But technological breakthroughs have challenged this assumption.”

Green energy sources are becoming viable alternatives to fossil fuels, and capital is flowing into low-carbon and energy-efficient solutions – showing that growth and sustainability can be mutually reinforcing, he said.

“Trade can facilitate our collective green transition, by facilitating cross-border flows of the goods, services, technologies and finance that enable it.”

New Zealand PM Christopher Luxon said that as the rapid pace of global regulatory change creates more complexity for businesses, countries must work together to help reduce the burden of compliance, with greater cooperation and coordination.

Pioneering partners

“Singapore is proud to partner Chile and New Zealand in this endeavour,” said PM Wong. “We may be three small countries, but we have a proven track record of pioneering innovative agreements together.”

He cited how the three countries and Brunei started the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership, which evolved into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership.

The three countries also started the “first-of-its-kind plurilateral Digital Economy Partnership Agreement”, he added. “This continues to receive interest from other aspiring economies – a sign of the value which others see in it.”

Highlighting that the three countries are like-minded partners in sustainability efforts, Chile President Gabriel Boric flagged the value of the agreement as an example, saying: “I know other countries are looking to what we are doing.”

PM Wong encouraged the officials to be bold in developing the Gepa, and “look beyond conventional approaches, embrace new ideas, and draw on private-sector insights”.

“I am confident that by joining hands, we can turn trade into a force for good, catalysing economic growth while doing our part for the environment and global climate action.”

Then, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil. The last step is refining it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn the oil into aviation fuel.

The university also said this approach can be applied to a number of feedstocks and types of oil, which could potentially lead to a new direction overall for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil,” said lead study author Sabrina Summers. “The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure.”

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Across the world, over 30% of food is wasted each year at all levels of the supply chain — including farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service and households.

U of I said food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, so recycling waste helps promote sustainability. HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including:

Food

Sewage sludge

Algal bloom

Swine manure

Agricultural residue

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said corresponding study author Yuanhui Zhang.",https://www.wcia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2024/09/snapshot-28-e1726074501173.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-30 21:16:32.061328

(“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today shared its perspective on the rapidly evolving global policy landscape shaping the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

The scale of the challenge – and opportunity – is immense. According to the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions. In 2024, global SAF production totalled only ~330 million gallons – about 0.3% of total jet-fuel demand. Meeting 2050 decarbonization targets will require an estimated 27% compound annual growth rate in production capacity and the construction of 5,000 – 7,000 new facilities worldwide. This gap represents one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition, with analysts projecting the SAF market could exceed ~$25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050.

Governments are responding. Across major markets, policymakers are using mandates and incentive schemes to accelerate SAF adoption. Today, more than 2 billion people globally live in countries with SAF blending mandates or strong incentives, such as tax credits – by 2030, this number is expected to grow to more than 4 billion people.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge aims to expand domestic consumption of SAF to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.

In Europe,the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates that SAF make up 2% of all jet fuel by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050, creating one of the largest mandated clean-fuel markets globally.

The UK has coupled mandates starting from 2% in 2025 and increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 with revenue-certainty mechanisms that help cover the price premium between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Across Asia-Pacific, countries including Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and Singapore are developing frameworks that combine blending targets, tax incentives, and infrastructure funding to stimulate both production and demand.

“Global demand for SAF is shifting from ‘if’ to ‘how fast,’” said Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF. “Mandates, incentives, and procurement are converging to drive volume. These dynamics underscore the value of XCF’s early-mover advantage and modular design, which we’re now extending globally through partnerships such as with New Rise Australia, a venture that is expected to develop three SAF sites across the continent to meet Australia’s growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.”

XCF highlighted three dynamics that will shape the next phase of growth:

Diverse toolkits, common direction. Regions may use different policy levers – mandates, subsidies, tax credits, or procurement – but they all point toward accelerating adoption.

Technology mix evolution. HEFA remains the dominant pathway in the near-term, while policy frameworks are creating headroom for emerging pathways to scale toward 2050 targets.

System reliability. Airlines and fuel suppliers need dependable volumes, transparent carbon accounting, and logistics that work across borders. Producers with operational capacity and credible expansion plans will lead.

“As SAF adoption transitions from pilot programs to long-term supply, reliability and verifiability become the new currency of trust,” Dange added. “XCF is building the backbone of that transition by advancing the infrastructure and partnerships needed to make SAF the new standard across global aviation.”

Here are my priorities for the 2026 Port of Seattle budget this year.

Strengthening pathways to workforce development programs for English Speakers of Other Language (ESOL)

I am proud of our state’s diversity and here in King County, data tells us that nearly 25% of our population are foreign-born. My staff and I learned that with this rich diversity, access to English language classes have long wait lists in order to gain the language proficiency to enter workforce development pathways for aviation and maritime industries. This is why I am supporting resources for English Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) pathways as one way to address workforce shortages reported by industry partners.

Continued support for Maritime High School operations

Maritime High School graduated its inaugural class in June. That is an exciting benchmark and testament to this innovative approach to high school education. I believe supporting Maritime provides options for young people who leave the classroom with industry credentials and ready to enter the maritime workforce upon graduation or go on to continue their education at post-secondary institutions. Whatever choice these young people make, it is an investment in them and a win for the maritime workforce.

A summit on sustainable maritime fuels convened by the Port of Seattle

The Port of Seattle is deeply committed to sustainability and climate action, detailed in our Century Agenda goal of becoming the greenest port in North America. Working with many different partners across public and private sectors, we have helped grow the conversation and ecosystem for sustainable aviation fuel. Now we are looking to do the same for sustainable maritime fuels by bringing together thought leaders across the many sectors with a summit to build pathways and relationships toward collective action.

Growing shipbuilding readiness as an economic development strategy for Washington state

Washington state has a strong shipbuilding legacy, but the industry has been shrinking for decades. The opportunity is ripe to reinvigorate the industry while also introducing advanced technologies to build low-emission and zero-emission vessels that can power trade and transport for decades to come.

Community-focused activations

With the refurbished and reactivated Seattle waterfront, we have an opportunity to say thank you to community members for their support in building a truly world-class public space, stretching from Pioneer Square to Interbay. I have requested resources to support increased activation to deepen the connection to our maritime heritage, our waterfront, and our being a port city with local residents and communities next summer, as we host the World Cup and also celebrate the 250th anniversary of our nation’s founding.

Reducing those emissions and otherwise making jet travel more sustainable is critical.

Aviation companies, both large and small, are responding with green initiatives. Understanding what they are can help you find the right partner for your next flight.

The Environmental Impact of Aviation

All forms of travel can have an impact on the environment, but flight is a major offender. Private flights, in particular, are harmful.

Researchers say private jets are 5 to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes. In one study of data from 2023, researchers found that private flights contributed at least 15.6 Mt CO2 in direct emissions.

This problem isn’t fading, as more people are using private flights. In the UK alone in 2022, private jets took off an average of once every six minutes.

Industry Commitments to Sustainability

Air transport professionals understand that their work can lead to environmental damage. They’re responding in significant ways.

For example, in 2021, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) passed a resolution committing its member airlines to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Similarly, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was developed as a global measure that’s designed to limit carbon emissions from international flights.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One important contribution to green aviation involves the development of new forms of fuel. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is made from feedstocks instead of fossil fuels, and it can be used to power all sorts of aircraft.

According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 24.5 million gallons of SAF were consumed in 2023.

United Airlines is one such customer. Less than 1% of their overall fuel consumption is SAF, but the company hopes to use more in the future.

Carbon Offset Programs

Carbon offsetting involves investing in carbon reduction projects to compensate for the carbon emissions associated with the flight. The IATA says more than 50 airlines use programs like this.

Offsets don’t reduce emissions directly. However, they can help other programs to grow, which could reduce the impact of a flight.

Innovations in Aircraft Technology

Changes in technology can also help mitigate the environmental impact of flights. Current changes include the following:

Electric- and hydrogen-powered aircraft

Lightweight materials for plane construction

Advanced aerodynamic designs for aircraft

Improved engine fuel efficiency

Optimized flight operation

Airlines Leading the Green Initiative

Major airlines are examining the data and making changes to their operations and programs. These are a few of the companies embracing green technology:

United Airlines

United Airlines has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Importantly, they’re trying to accomplish this goal without using carbon offsets.

United Airlines is using efficient aircraft, trying sustainable fuels, and collaborating with partners to help them streamline their operations.

JetBlue Airways

JetBlue Airways is working hard to achieve carbon-neutral status for all domestic flights. They’re also looking at incorporating new sustainability initiatives.

Initiatives include reusing materials, trying new fuels, and investing in sustainable aircraft startups.

Emirates

Emirates has invested in new aircraft, and the company claims to have one of the youngest fleets in the industry. All of the aircraft meet emission standards.

Emirates also uses flight-planning systems to ensure their routes are optimized and don’t need too much fuel. The company also uses alternate fuels on some flights.

Harbour Air

Harbour Air is the first carbon-neutral airline. The company uses a combination of carbon offsets, new fuels, and on-the-ground optimizations to ensure they don’t use more fuel than needed. They also partner with companies like Ostrom Climate to continue to innovate.

Charter Operators Embracing Sustainability

Jet charter companies are integrating sustainable practices into their operations. Each company is doing something a little different, but the result can include optimized flights and a reduced level of emissions.

Wheels Up

Private company Wheels Up has launched a SAF program. Customers can choose this option for their flights when booking, ensuring they take direct action against climate change.

VistaJet

Private company VistaJet has taken many steps toward sustainability. Those steps include the following:

Maximizing their fleet use

Adding new aircraft with high environmental ratings

Using carbon offsets

Advocating for SAF

JetLevel Aviation

JetLevel Aviation has committed to fleet modernization, focusing on acquiring aircraft equipped with reduced emissions technology. The company also partners with operators who prioritize eco-friendly flying.

Challenges & the Road Ahead

While airline operators are doing their part to reduce the impact of flights on the environment, more work must be done. After all, these steps just reduce emissions without eliminating them.

Companies must continue to innovate and grow, looking for new ways to use fuels that are eco-friendly. Consumers must also demand change from their operators to ensure they keep the environment in mind.

How You Can Contribute

As a consumer, it’s critical to choose partners with robust sustainability programs. If you find a company like this, be willing to pay a little more for your flights. This small increase in price could entice the company to further embrace the work.

You can also pay close attention to changes in green innovation. Instead of accepting simple carbon offsets, look for ways to support new aircraft and fuels.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

After refining the biocrude oil and removing impurities, the team’s fuel passed all American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) prescreening tests for conventional jet fuel.

Zhang said the discovery could open the door to large-scale production and new economic opportunities. “Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.

The project also supports a “circular bioeconomy,” Zhang added. “In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” he said.

30 October 2025

Appoints seasoned industry leader as founding Chief Executive Officer

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has set up the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the Singapore air hub and support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy. SAFCo is set up as a non-profit Company Limited by Guarantee wholly owned by CAAS. Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS, will chair SAFCo’s Board. Ms Tan Seow Hui, a seasoned leader in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed as its founding Chief Executive Officer (see Annex A for Ms Tan’s curriculum vitae).

2 The setting up of SAFCo follows the passing of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on 14 October 2025, which allows for the implementation of SAF policies for air transport in Singapore and empowers CAAS to collect a SAF Levy, to set up a SAF Fund and to procure, manage and allocate SAF and SAF environmental attributes (EAs)1 or to establish and appoint a central procurement entity to carry out these functions. More details on the SAF Levy amounts will be shared later.

3 Through SAFCo, CAAS seeks to build a transparent and integrated SAF demand market that brings together airlines, corporate buyers of SAF, fuel producers, carbon market platforms2 and stakeholders across the aviation fuel chain in Singapore to aggregate demand, stimulate investment and accelerate the use of SAF:

a) SAFCo will centrally procure SAF using the SAF Fund to achieve the 1% SAF target in 2026, for flights departing Singapore. The amount of SAF procured by SAFCo will increase accordingly when the SAF target is raised to 3–5% by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF. SAF and SAF EAs will be sourced through a transparent competitive tender process from SAF suppliers that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA. With predictable cashflows from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will be able to go into longer-term, competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and affordable SAF supply.

b) Beyond the regulated demand from the SAF Levy, SAFCo will also aggregate voluntary SAF demand from organisations seeking to purchase SAF to reduce their air travel or supply chain carbon footprint credibly and cost-effectively. The demand from the SAF Levy forms a scalable baseload, enabling SAFCo to negotiate attractive pricing for SAF and SAF EAs, and to anchor long-term supply agreements. Businesses that participate in SAFCo’s voluntary SAF purchases can leverage this baseload to unlock economies of scale. They can also gain access to competitively priced and verified SAF and SAF EAs through SAFCo and avoid the need to set up their own procurement systems.

4 As a new entity, SAFCo’s immediate priorities will be to establish robust governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy collection systems and processes and build manpower and procurement capability, while engaging stakeholders on the implementation, ahead of the first SAF procurement in 2026. SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand programme for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF Levy. SAFCo will reach out to businesses and airlines to encourage them to partner SAFCo and use its central procurement mechanism for voluntary SAF purchases. Conversations are ongoing; SAFCo will provide more details on the side of the Singapore Airshow in February next year. Interested businesses and airlines are encouraged to reach out to SAFCo at safcoadmin@safco.com.sg.

5 SAFCo will also support the development of the SAF supply ecosystem in Singapore and the region. With predictable and stable cashflows, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still nascent SAF market. This approach aims to encourage investment in SAF production capacity and the development of SAF-related carbon markets in Singapore and the region.

6 Mr Han Kok Juan, Director-General, CAAS and Chairman of SAFCo said, “Singapore is taking a pragmatic, balanced and action-oriented approach to advancing sustainability in the aviation sector. The setting up of SAFCo is another concrete step forward. Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF Levy collected and activate a SAF ecosystem which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

7 Ms Tan Seow Hui, Chief Executive Officer of SAFCo said, “I am honoured to lead SAFCo at this pivotal stage. My priority will be to put in place credible and scalable frameworks, partnerships and processes to ensure that SAFCo delivers on its mandate to aggregate demand, procure SAF efficiently, and manage SAF EAs transparently. By working closely with airlines, businesses and suppliers, we aim to facilitate greater SAF adoption in the region and contribute to the decarbonisation of aviation.”

1 SAF environmental attributes is a value representing the difference in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of SAF throughout its life cycle and those of the same quantity of conventional aviation fuel throughout its life cycle. SAF environmental attributes may be used by a person to meet offsetting requirements applicable to that person under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization or other similar programmes, or reported by a person as carbon emissions reduction from the use of SAF under any scheme applicable to or adopted by that person for the reporting of environmental sustainability efforts undertaken by that person to stakeholders or investors of that person or regulators of the business of that person.

2 Carbon market platforms are digital marketplaces that facilitate the trading of carbon, SAF or other sustainability credits.

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends.

Their process, described in a Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

""HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,"" said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain—from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

""To meet the aviation industry's goals to decarbonize jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,"" said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel.

After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration.

Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang noted.

""Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,"" he said.

Zhang has developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, and he said SAF provides a valuable contribution to circularity.

Fuel Disclosure | Sustainable. Abundant. Feasible – why SAF is unlikely to be all three at once, is not anti-SAF and recognised the use of alternative jet fuels in the future decarbonisation of the industry. But it also downplays the runaway claims from some in aviation that SAF could be a short-term saviour for the industry.

2030 is cited as a near-term goal for increased uptake of SAF, but Carbon Tracker said the current plans for development and production will not allow for wide-scale decarbonsation.

“Even if all existing, under-development and announced projects ran at capacity, they would only be able to displace 5% of fossil jet fuel by 2030,” it explained.

While the growth in commitments and SAF deals is encouraging, there are key practical problems that will limit its growth.

Perhaps the most crucial of these leads from the most abundent production method for current SAF: crop and waste-based feedstock. While a September 2025 IATA report said 10,000Mt of feedstocks could used to make SAF, “only 12.3% of that would be available for use in aviation, after accounting for competing uses” according to Carbon Tracker.

“The overwhelming majority of alternative jet fuel today is derived from waste oils such as used cooking oil, which are a relatively more sustainable option than others. However, these feedstocks are in very short supply.”

Not only is the raw amount of available product to turn into SAF highly questionable, the infrastructure to actually do this is in its infancy. “Setting up an infrastructure to collect, transport, and pre-process feedstock is likely to take significant investment and time to scale up,” the report noted.

Because waste oil is a commodity fought over by many industries hoping to use it to lower their carbon emissions, “the industry will have to rely on other options, some of which are much more emission-intensive, and others can carry significant implications not yet assessed by the industry.”

Carbon Tracker’s analysts made the point that many of the so-called Sustainable Aviation Fuels actually emit almost as much CO2 as conventional kerosene.

Saidrasul Ashrafkhanov, Carbon Tracker analyst and report lead author, said: “On top of high costs, offtaker hesitation and financing constraints, most alternative jet fuels are also saddled with a handful of environmental downsides. These fuels may some day have a larger role in decarbonising aviation, but the burden of proof is on the industry to show that it can find a pathway that will deliver alternative jet fuel that’s at once sustainable, abundant, and feasible.”

Although the future of SAF and long-haul, carbon-intensive flight is questionable, the thinktank pointed to short-haul flights of 270 nautical miles (500 km) or less as an area with more potential for faster decarbonisation through alternative fuels.

“Battery-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft carrying 5-100 passengers are approaching entry into service, offering a direct path to zero-emission operations on regional legs. Hydrogen-electric aircraft could open up medium-haul markets from the mid-2030s. This creates a clearer near-term investment case and preserves scarce sustainable AJF for long-haul. Despite this potential, new-propulsion aircraft remain underfunded relative to AJF.”

While the SAF realities are difficult to overcome, and other fuels for short haul flights may be more useful in the short to mid-term, Carbon Tracker and the report authors suggested an urgent change is needed to the regulatory environment to push industry toward a coherent trajectory to decarbonisation.

Rich Collett-White, Carbon Tracker energy analyst and report co-author, said: “A bewildering array of policies designed to scale up alternative jet fuels is causing confusion, with definitions and eligibility criteria differing from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Consistent rules are needed to ensure fuels with high environmental integrity are prioritised, and unintended consequences avoided.”",https://www.airport-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2025/10/shutterstock_1340185619.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 14:03:13.730085

Think about it: commercial airliners have sputtered along on kerosene since Lindbergh’s day, but swapping out jet fuel for cryogenic hydrogen means overthrowing decades of engineering norms—tank shapes, insulation tricks, chillers that keep hydrogen at a frosty –253°C, and the fine-tuned flow control needed at cruising altitude. Falsetti’s no stranger to big challenges, bringing insights from EPFL, Nokia Bell Labs and Oxford’s Thermofluids Institute to the table. It’s a milestone that’s already causing a buzz in Europe’s aerospace circles—one that might rewrite the rulebook on zero-carbon flight.

Strategic Angle

Right now, aviation chalks up almost 3% of global CO2 emissions—and without a shake-up, that number’s headed north. Enter green hydrogen, which, when produced by renewable-powered electrolysis, burns clean (no CO2 in use). The snag? Keeping it chilled at –253°C under pressure is like trying to hold onto ice cubes in a blast furnace—boil-off rates creep above 2% per day, and safety protocols get hairy. Falsetti’s research aims to flip the script: advanced insulation, active cooling loops and smart control systems designed to slash boil-off to below 1%, cutting chuck-outs in half.

For airlines and lessors, the upside is huge: lighter, sleeker tanks, lower ground-handling costs and fuel budgets that don’t swing wildly. Knock 15% off tank weight and boost usable hydrogen by 20%, and you’re looking at tens of millions saved per aircraft over its service life—bridging the gap with classic jet fuel on the bottom line.

This project rides shotgun with big-ticket EU programmes—Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking and IPCEI Hy2Tech—which together funnel over €20 billion into industrial decarbonization and sustainable energy by 2030. Falsetti’s Vidi-funded work ties lab-grade science straight into real-world deployment, making it a cornerstone of Europe’s zero-emission technology push.

Technical Snapshot

The Vidi grant sets the stage for tackling three core challenges:

Boiling heat transfer: High-fidelity mapping of heat fluxes at cryogenic temperatures to model and minimize evaporative losses during take-off, cruise and landing cycles.

Phase-change dynamics: Adapting high-speed sensors and imaging from microelectronics evaporative cooling to peek inside two-phase hydrogen flow in pipes, valves and manifolds in real time.

Cryogenic storage architectures: Engineering next-gen composite insulation—think aerogel-infused multilayers paired with modular cooling loops—that integrates seamlessly with existing aircraft structures and refueling interfaces.

On top of that, the team leans into advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and digital twin platforms to simulate two-phase behavior virtually, tweaking designs before cutting any metal. TU Delft’s numbers suggest this digital-first approach chops nearly 30% off hardware development cycles and budget overruns. Their lab prototypes have already posted a 30% jump in thermal resistance thanks to novel sandwich composites. Coming up: a 200-liter demo tank built with Rolls-Royce and ESA, eyeing pilot-scale tests by mid-2026 to validate the tech under real-world conditions—and thanks to digital twinning, they can spin through dozens of design iterations overnight, slashing trial-and-error cycles.

Key Takeaways

Enhanced efficiency: Targeting a 20–30% cut in daily boil-off could deliver a 15–25% drop in total cost of ownership for hydrogen-powered fleets.

Infrastructure synergy: Partnerships with Amsterdam and Rotterdam airports to craft end-to-end storage-to-tank solutions, potentially trimming refueling station CAPEX by 20%.

Regulatory impact: Experimental data feeding into ICAO and EU safety standards will influence certifications, crew training protocols and airport operating procedures.

Cross-sector benefits: Innovations in composite insulation and two-phase diagnostics could spin off into LNG terminals, nuclear cooling systems and high-power electronics—supercharging industrial decarbonization.

Workforce development: Engaging over 20 PhD candidates and post-docs in training programs will build a skilled talent pipeline for the zero-emission technology arena.

Bonus point: the project’s sensor and materials breakthroughs could spawn new startups, further bolstering Europe’s role in sustainable energy and cryogenic tech sectors.

Parallel Moves

Meanwhile, across Europe, carriers like Lufthansa in Germany and Air France in France are kicking off hydrogen production and refueling pilots—though most efforts focus upstream on electrolysis and supply chains. That leaves a critical hole at the storage and delivery end. Falsetti’s work is poised to fill that gap, ensuring liquid hydrogen arrivals are chilled, contained and flight-ready for genuine zero-emission technology operations.

Plus, early-stage hydrogen corridor projects in Scandinavia and the Alpine region are laying the groundwork for transnational refueling routes—setting the stage for long-haul flights powered by green hydrogen.

Ecosystem & Collateral Impact

This research isn’t just aviation’s next big thing. The advances in insulation materials and diagnostic sensors could reshape cryogenic hydrogen handling for shipping, heavy industry and LNG terminals—supercharging broader sustainable energy agendas. Nestled in South Holland, TU Delft taps into a rich cluster of aerospace leaders, cryogenics experts, port operators and agile SMEs, creating a 360° innovation ecosystem that fast-tracks lab-to-hangar transitions.

On the policy front, the team’s findings will feed into upcoming EU funding calls, safety frameworks and vocational training programs. Expect early revisions to airport fire codes, fresh incentives for hydrogen corridors and a blueprint for public-private partnerships that regions worldwide may copy.

Regional test facilities and specialized cryogenics workshops mean prototypes can move from drawing boards to real-world testing in record time, underscoring Europe’s competitive edge in industrial decarbonization tech.

What’s Next

Looking ahead, the team aims to complete its 200-liter test tank by early 2026 and kick off integration trials on a hybrid propulsion demonstrator at TU Delft’s custom test bench—pushing the limits with repeated cycles and stress tests. By late 2027, a flight-ready tank prototype should be taxiing under a light aircraft developed by a European partner, setting the stage for full-scale commercial adoption by 2028. And just around the corner, they plan to launch a spin-off venture to commercialize advanced insulation modules and sensor suites, targeting both aviation and adjacent industries.

Investor Insights

If you’ve got your eye on the hydrogen value chain, thermal insulation and two-phase flow control are where the magic happens. Watch for patent filings starting in 2026—they could mark prime moments for strategic partnerships or licensing deals. Better boil-off numbers and fortified safety margins don’t just trim operational expenses—they also help lower insurance premiums for fueling stations and on-board systems, a crucial factor often overlooked in project finance models. Plus, expect venture capital interest to ramp up as the tech proves out in pilot trials.

Final Thought

(SAFCo) to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the Singapore air hub and support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy.
SAFCo will centrally procure SAF using the SAF fund to achieve the 1 percent SAF target in 2026 for flights departing Singapore.
SAF and SAF EAs will be sourced through a transparent competitive tender process from SAF suppliers that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA.
With predictable cashflows from the SAF levy, SAFCo will be able to go into longer-term, competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and affordable SAF supply.
SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand program for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF levy.","The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore announced Oct. 30 that it has set up the Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd. (SAFCo) to centrally procure sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the Singapore air hub and support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy.

SAFCo is set up as a nonprofit wholly owned by CAAS.

Han Kok Juan, director-general of CAAS, will chair SAFCo’s board.

Tan Seow Hui, a seasoned leader in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed as its founding CEO.

The setting up of SAFCo follows the passing of the CAAS bill in parliament Oct. 14, which allows for the implementation of SAF policies for air transport in Singapore and empowers CAAS to collect a levy on SAF, to set up a fund for SAF and to procure, manage and allocate SAF and SAF environmental attributes (EAs) or to establish and appoint a central-procurement entity to carry out these functions.

More details on the SAF levy amounts will be shared later.

Through SAFCo, CAAS said it seeks to build a transparent and integrated SAF demand market that brings together airlines, corporate buyers of SAF, fuel producers, carbon market platforms and stakeholders across the aviation fuel chain in Singapore to aggregate demand, stimulate investment and accelerate the use of SAF.

SAFCo will centrally procure SAF using the SAF fund to achieve the 1 percent SAF target in 2026 for flights departing Singapore.

The amount of SAF procured by SAFCo will increase accordingly when the SAF target is raised to 3 percent to 5 percent by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF.

SAF and SAF EAs will be sourced through a transparent competitive tender process from SAF suppliers that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA.

With predictable cashflows from the SAF levy, SAFCo will be able to go into longer-term, competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and affordable SAF supply.

Beyond the regulated demand from the SAF levy, SAFCo will also aggregate voluntary SAF demand from organizations seeking to purchase SAF to reduce their air travel or supply-chain carbon footprint credibly and cost effectively.

The demand from the SAF levy forms a scalable baseload, enabling SAFCo to negotiate attractive pricing for SAF and SAF EAs, and to anchor long-term supply agreements.

Businesses that participate in SAFCo’s voluntary SAF purchases can leverage this baseload to unlock economies of scale.

They can also gain access to competitively priced and verified SAF and SAF EAs through SAFCo and avoid the need to set up their own procurement systems.

As a new entity, SAFCo’s immediate priorities will be to establish robust governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy-collection systems and processes and build manpower and procurement capability, while engaging stakeholders on the implementation ahead of the first SAF procurement in 2026.

SAFCo will also build a scalable voluntary demand program for SAF and SAF EAs as a complement to the SAF levy.

SAFCo will reach out to businesses and airlines to encourage them to partner with SAFCo and use its central-procurement mechanism for voluntary SAF purchases.

Conversations are ongoing and CAAS said SAFCo will provide more details on the side of the Singapore Airshow in February.

SAFCo will also support the development of the SAF supply ecosystem in Singapore and the region.

With predictable and stable cashflows, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still-nascent SAF market.

This approach aims to encourage investment in SAF production capacity and the development of SAF-related carbon markets in Singapore and the region.

“Singapore is taking a pragmatic, balanced and action-oriented approach to advancing sustainability in the aviation sector,” CAAS Director-General Han said. “The setting up of SAFCo is another concrete step forward. Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF levy collected and activate the SAF ecosystem, which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

SAFCo CEO Tan added, “I am honored to lead SAFCo at this pivotal stage. My priority will be to put in place credible and scalable frameworks, partnerships and processes to ensure that SAFCo delivers on its mandate to aggregate demand, procure SAF efficiently and manage SAF EAs transparently. By working closely with airlines, businesses and suppliers, we aim to facilitate greater SAF adoption in the region and contribute to the decarbonization of aviation.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_8f35980592634d00b4e5e2842c85ff81~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_967,h_725,al_c,q_85/80995f_8f35980592634d00b4e5e2842c85ff81~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-10-30 15:00:14.921766

Now, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have discovered a novel way to address that problem—by converting food waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that meets industry standards without relying on fossil fuel blends. Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.",,N,,2025-10-30 10:56:11.152487

A further partnership between VietJet and Oxford Net Zero, led by Professor Myles Allen, supports the Net Zero Aviation Project — a £1.6 million research collaboration running until mid-2026.

The project, conducted with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), investigates geologically balanced fuels (GBFs) — a novel approach to offsetting aviation emissions by capturing and permanently storing equivalent CO₂ in geological formations. Emissions from aviation are projected to increase steadily in the coming years, and they are currently some of the hardest emissions to abate. The aim of the Net Zero Aviation Project is to look at a potential new way of tackling this challenge by looking at the feasibility, public perception and impact of GBFs, alongside equity and justice implications. It ultimately aims to develop policies and reporting standards which support gradually increasing the fraction of emissions captured and stored over time through cooperation between the aviation sector and their fuel suppliers.

Professor Myles Allen, Principal Investigator of Oxford Net Zero, said: ‘The Oxford Net Zero initiative is delighted to be working with VietJet and the International Air Travel Association, IATA, on strategies for neutralising the climate impact of aviation. We are specifically exploring the concept of “geologically balanced fuels” as potentially an affordable, scalable, and responsible complement to sustainable aviation fuel. Working with a low-cost carrier with a commitment to both sustainability and affordability that is based in South East Asia, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, brings together in microcosm all the challenges faced by the global aviation sector.’

The airline was among the first to make long-term commitments around sustainability and other environmental efforts in order to reduce waste, improve efficiency and embrace novel strategies to improve its performance. Sustainability considerations are included across all elements of the business and passenger journey.

In recent years KLM has redoubled its efforts, and is refining its long-term sustainability vision by including it as a core part of business and operating strategy.

The airline is also open to embracing more radical solutions. This includes playing leading roles in efforts to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel and eFuels development, investing to support supply-chain innovation and exploring other more radical ways to reduce emissions.

Few airlines have shown the commitment to the decarbonisation of air travel and have pushed for local, regional and global policies that will support this in the way that KLM has.

Latin American Sustainability Airline of the Year: Volaris

The Mexican LCC Volaris boasts one of the most efficient fleets and highest efficiency airline operations across Central and South America.

A previous winner of CAPA's Latin American Environmental Sustainability Airline of the Year, the airline continues to impress with its practical actions around sustainability - such as rolling out digital tools to improve the efficiency of its flights and minimise environmental impacts.

While maintaining its ultra-low cost operating model Volaris also stands out from LCC peers through its looking forward approach. The airline is one of only a handful of LCCs globally that are investing to support the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Volaris is also engaging in partnerships and investments to accelerate the development of SAF in Mexico.

North America Sustainability Airline of the Year: Air Transat

The Canadian leisure airline has made sustained efforts towards the decarbonisation of its operations in recent years.

The airline has largely phased out its older widebodies in favour of new generation, long-range narrowbodies, favouring the efficiency of its operations.

To further act on its carbon footprint, Air Transat is turning to new innovations in AI technology and machine learning to develop solutions that offer fuel savings both in the sky and on the ground.",,N,,2025-10-30 09:56:27.040854

What is the SAF RCM and why is the consultation significant?

Back in May 2025, the UK government confirmed its intention to introduce – alongside the demand-driver of the SAF Mandate on which more details are available in our article here – an RCM for SAF with the aim of providing investors with the confidence needed to invest time and capital in the development of SAF projects.

The RCM is proposed to take the form of a government-backed ‘revenue certainty contract’ and it is rumoured that the contract counterparty will be the government’s Low Carbon Contracts Company (the counterparty to electricity market Contracts for Difference (CFD)). The RCM contract will guarantee a fixed price (or strike price) for SAF and like the electricity market CFD, SAF producers would receive top up payments where the SAF price received is less than the strike price and would be obliged to make difference payments where they receive a market price above the strike price. It is still to be determined quite how the market price will be calculated.

The government was clear that the costs of the RCM should be borne by the sector through a new variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers that sits alongside existing obligations under the SAF and this consultation seeks views on both the levy’s design and administration.

The Design of the Aviation Fuel Supplier Levy

The consultation sets out several key intended design features of the Aviation Fuel Supplier Levy, namely:

Market share-based contributions: suppliers will be subject to pay proportional charges based on their individual contribution to the volume of fossil aviation fuel supplied in the UK.

Minimum thresholds: suppliers supplying volumes of fossil aviation fuel below 15.9TJ (equivalent to 468,000 litres annually) will be exempt. This is the only exemption proposed to the levy at present.

Forecasting: A rolling 12-month forecast of levy rates is proposed to aid business planning – although this may be subject to change following scheme maturity.

The consultation also seeks views on: (1) the length of the period over which contributions are assessed; (2) the frequency at which levies collected; and (3) the sequencing of the levy’s assessment, collection and billing periods.

Risks and Enforcement

Contingency planning

As the levy will fund the actual cost of the operation of the RCM, the government has decided that the levy will need to be calculated and collected based on forecasts of the scheme costs and then reconciled when actuals become available. This presents the risk that the forecast levy amounts imposed on a supplier are insufficient to cover their proportion of the total scheme costs. To mitigate this under-collection risk, the consultation proposes applying an additional contingency amount on the levy to compensate for uncertainty in the scheme cost forecasts and help to cover any unforeseen costs.

The consultation also includes proposals in relation to over-collection (i.e. when the counterparty levies a greater amount on a supplier than required to cover their proportion of the total scheme costs) and how these will be repaid.

Supplier default

To address the risk of a supplier defaulting on its levy payment obligations, the consultation suggests two mechanisms:

Credit cover: this is a requirement for suppliers to provide a “back-up” for their levy obligations. The consultation suggests that this could be done either through standby letters of credit, cash or a mixture of the two which are placed on either a monthly or quarterly period.

Mutualisation: this refers to the process of spreading the outstanding levy contributions amongst the remaining compliant suppliers where the credit cover is insufficient.

Enforcement Actions

The consultation outlines several potential enforcement tools to ensure compliance with obligations under the Aviation Fuel Supplier Levy based on those which have proved successful in other schemes, including:

Notices of non-compliance: the counterparty will, where necessary, issue formal notices where the supplier has failed to meet its obligations under the levy. This will include information on remedial actions and further enforcement which may be required;

Reporting of compliance and enforcement: publicly reporting on non-compliance to ensure there is transparency, accountability, proportionate enforcement and ensure there is a reputational deterrent;

Interest on late payments: to incentivise timely payments;

Financial penalties: a power for the Secretary of State to issue a supplier with a financial penalty (currently stated in the SAF Bill to be the lesser of either £100,000 or 10% of annual turnover of the supplier).

Next Steps

The consultation offers a crucial opportunity for key stakeholders such as project developers, fuel suppliers, airlines and airports to influence the levy’s design and implementation. The consultation period is open until 8 January 2026. The consultation document and details on how to respond can be found here.

The government’s consultation response is expected later in 2026. That response will inform the development of secondary legislation which will provide the detail of the RCM. The SAF Bill, which will provide the legislative framework for those regulations is going through parliamentary process (with its second reading in the House of Lords scheduled for the end of November 2025) and is expected to receive Royal Assent (and become law) before the end of 2026.

For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF.

Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient.
By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.","In an exclusive AgroSpectrum interview, Alexei Beltyukov, CEO and Co-founder of Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel), elucidates how the company’s proprietary Flexiforming process transcends the constraints of conventional waste-oil-based biofuels, converting alcohols and low-value refinery byproducts into truly drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). By delivering the elusive aromatic fraction required for jet engine performance — something HEFA and Fischer–Tropsch routes cannot independently supply — Unifuel simultaneously augments yield and slashes both energy and hydrogen inputs.

Beltyukov underscores that Flexiforming’s modularity and compatibility with existing refineries and ethanol facilities offer a capital-efficient scale-up pathway at a time when the SAF markets are beleaguered by feedstock scarcity and punishing production costs. Policy acceleration toward 100 per cent synthetic SAF approval, coupled with long-term airline offtake agreements, he argues, will unlock the confidence necessary for global deployment. Ultimately, Unifuel positions itself not as a solitary panacea but as a catalytic enabler of a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation future, where complementary pathways collaborate to maximise every molecule of renewable carbon.

I. Technology & Production

From Waste to Jet Fuel:

Can you explain the core technology behind Unifuel’s conversion of waste oils and fats into SAF, and what differentiates it from conventional biofuel pathways?

Unifuel doesn’t directly convert waste oils and fats into SAF. Rather, our Flexiforming technology complements existing processes that do. We convert alcohols like ethanol and methanol into high-quality SAF, and we upgrade the low-value byproducts—naphtha and LPG—from Hydroprocessed Esthers and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes that use waste oils and fats.

The key differentiator is our single-step, all-gas phase reaction using a proprietary catalyst. This design reduces energy consumption by 75 per cent and hydrogen requirements by 33 per cent compared to alternative ethanol-to-jet processes, positioning our technology at approximately half the cost. Additionally, we produce aromatic SAF components that HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch cannot, which are essential for jet engine performance and achieving true drop-in capability.

Performance and Sustainability:

How do Unifuel’s SAF products perform in terms of energy density, combustion efficiency, and lifecycle carbon intensity compared to fossil-based jet fuels?

Flexiforming produces SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel, containing the 8-25 per cent aromatics that today’s aircraft engines require. Our SAF has undergone comprehensive testing at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab—the world-leading authority on SAF research—and has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse for qualification. This acceptance demonstrates that our fuel meets strict quality and safety criteria and shows strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully.

In terms of lifecycle carbon intensity, depending on the specific chemical pathway, our energy-efficient process has a carbon intensity 10-31 per cent that of the incoming feedstock—a significant reduction beyond the inherent benefits of using renewable feedstocks.

II. Scaling Challenges

Feedstock Constraints:

Waste oils and fats are finite and geographically dispersed. What strategies is Unifuel pursuing to secure a consistent, scalable feedstock supply, and how do logistics impact production economics?

Rather than competing for limited HEFA feedstocks, our strategy is to make the best of what’s available and diversify. For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF. Apart from making the product a potentially fully synthetic fungible jet fuel (subject to ASTM approvals), this produces 20 per cent more SAF from the same amount of feedstock. Flexiforming works with any alcohol or ether, renewable naphthas, and LPG. This versatility allows plant operators to adapt to feedstock availability and pricing fluctuations.

For ethanol specifically, we see significant opportunity. The U.S. already produces billions of gallons of ethanol annually for gasoline blending. As electric vehicles replace gasoline-powered cars, this ethanol can be redirected to jet fuel production without impacting food production or requiring new agricultural investment. Flexiforming offers ethanol plant operators an economically viable ethanol-to-jet pathway, 50 per cent less expensive than existing ETJ options.

Refinery and Conversion Economics:

What are the key technical and economic bottlenecks in scaling SAF production from laboratory or pilot-scale to commercial refinery operations, and how is Unifuel addressing them ?

The primary bottlenecks are cost (SAF currently costs 2 to 4 times more than conventional jet fuel) and feedstock limitations. Our single-reactor design dramatically reduces capital and operational costs. Flexiforming is also designed for scalable deployment at various sizes, from small bolt-on units for Fischer-Tropsch plants to large refinery-scale installations. This flexibility allows producers to match their investment to their specific circumstances rather than requiring massive upfront capital. Critically, we integrate with existing infrastructure, minimizing deployment costs and accelerating time to market. Our successful 2024 five-month pilot campaign demonstrates we’ve moved beyond laboratory concepts closer to commercially proven, reproducible technology.

III. Policy & Market Dynamics

Regulatory Alignment:

How do government incentives, blending mandates, and carbon credit schemes influence SAF adoption, and where do you see regulatory gaps that need urgent attention to accelerate deployment ?

Similar to how EVs initially depended on government incentives before becoming mainstream, SAF needs policy support to offset the current cost premium and give producers confidence to invest.

The next step we are awaiting in the regulatory area is the adoption of a standard for 100 per cent drop-in, fully synthetic SAF. Currently, ASTM standards allow most SAF to be blended with conventional jet fuel up to 50 per cent . The industry anticipates approval for 100 per cent synthetic SAF by the end of 2026, but this requires addressing the aromatics requirement—something HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch alone cannot provide.

Technologies that can produce aromatic SAF components should receive accelerated regulatory review and support, as they’re essential for eliminating the need for continued blending with fossil fuels.

Global Market Readiness:

With airlines increasingly committing to SAF targets, what is your perspective on the readiness of global supply chains and airport infrastructure to handle large-scale SAF integration?

Infrastructure is largely in place to support greater use of SAF, since it is a “drop-in” replacement that works with today’s aircraft. Once the fully synthetic SAF standard is adopted, common-carrier pipelines and all other infrastructure will be accessible to SAF. The real challenge is scaling production to meet growing demand. SAF currently represents less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel consumption, and closing that gap will depend on both technologies that make existing production pathways more efficient and cost-effective, as well as the regulatory approach.

A lot of capacity and feedstock that can be used to make SAF are presently targeting renewable diesel. This is a partial result of how the tax incentives are set up, and also of the fact that when making SAF, the producers inevitably make significant quantities of naphtha – a byproduct that, in the absence of Flexiforming, has a relatively low value.

Flexiforming helps in exactly that way. By upgrading low-value byproducts such as naphtha and LPG into additional SAF, our technology enables producers to generate more fuel from the same feedstock. This increases total output while improving project economics, which in turn helps airlines and fuel suppliers meet their sustainability commitments more quickly and affordably.

IV. Strategic Outlook

Investment and Partnership Models:

What role do strategic airline partnerships, venture capital, and private equity play in enabling SAF scale-up, and what frameworks have you found most effective for attracting long-term investment?

Strategic partnerships are critical, especially between technology providers, fuel producers, and airlines. Airlines’ long-term offtake agreements provide the demand certainty investors look for, while venture and private equity partners can fund early deployment.

Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient. Our customers can integrate Flexiforming into their existing plants with relatively low CapEx, creating a more distributed, resilient SAF supply network. This model appeals to investors because it allows them to participate across multiple facilities and feedstocks, reducing risk while accelerating market penetration.

Beyond Waste Oils:

As SAF demand grows, how is Unifuel preparing for feedstock diversification — for example, algae, municipal waste, or other renewable sources — and what technical or economic hurdles remain in that transition ?

Feedstock diversification is at the heart of Flexiforming’s value proposition. We can already process any naphtha, alcohol or ether, so as new pathways to these feeds emerge—from algae, cellulosic sources, or other biomass—we can potentially integrate them.

For municipal and agricultural waste, we complement Fischer-Tropsch processing. By upgrading FT’s naphtha and LPG byproducts into aromatic SAF, we can increase plant revenue by 10-20 per cent, making waste-to-SAF projects more financially viable.

The main challenge is not chemistry, but logistics and preprocessing costs. That’s why our technology can be deployed at different scales, even near the source of biomass or waste conversion. By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.

Vision for Net-Zero Aviation:

Looking ahead 5–10 years, how do you see Unifuel contributing to a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation sector, and what are the key milestones the industry must hit to achieve that vision?

We envision three major use cases: bolt-ons to Fischer-Tropsch and HEFA plants processing waste feedstocks; partnerships with ethanol plants transitioning from selling ethanol for gasoline blending to SAF; and retrofitting existing oil refineries for SAF production.

The key industry milestones include ASTM approval for 100 per cent drop-in synthetic SAF by end of 2026; achieving economic parity or near-parity with conventional jet fuel through technology improvements and policy support; and successfully diversifying beyond limited HEFA feedstocks.

Our goal is for Flexiforming to become a mainstream enabling technology—recognizing that no single pathway will meet 100 per cent of demand, but that complementary technologies working together can maximize resource utilization and make sustainable aviation the norm rather than the exception.

The agreement makes United the first commercial airline to procure SAF for flights leaving George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Dulles International Airport in Washington DC.

The development represents a critical step in sourcing alternative fuels within the aviation sector.

Lauren Riley, Chief Sustainability Officer at United, emphasised the importance of taking action: ""In this moment, we'll be judged by our actions – not our words. And at United Airlines, progress is everything.

""Last week marked a milestone for advancing sustainable aviation fuel: for the first time ever, SAF is now flowing to three new airports – Newark, Dulles and Houston.""

According to the agreement, Neste began deliveries to Houston in July for a term ending in October 2025. Deliveries to Newark and Dulles started in September and are set to continue until the end of 2025.

Leveraging infrastructure for SAF delivery

The deployment of the SAF relies on existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste's SAF terminal facilities in Houston.

From there, neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is blended with conventional jet fuel to meet the required aviation specifications.

While aviation represents a smaller portion of global emissions compared to other industries, it is considered one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise.

This is due to the need for technological innovation across low-emission fuel production, aircraft and engine improvements and operational optimisation.

Policy incentives and market growth

Securing a stable and scalable supply of SAF remains a major challenge, with government support often playing a crucial role.

Lauren acknowledges the sector's dependence on policy incentives to aid its decarbonisation efforts.

""While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognise that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments,"" she explains.

The coordination required to achieve this supply milestone was substantial.

Lauren adds: ""This didn't happen easily or overnight. It took relentless coordination, innovation and a team that refused to settle for 'good enough.' But we did it – because meaningful change demands action.""

For procurement executives, the main concerns in the SAF market centre on availability and cost alongside geopolitical tensions and tariffs linked to growing protectionism.

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President of Commercial Renewable Products at Neste, stresses the necessity of supportive policies: ""It is crucial that more states enact proven incentive policy frameworks to accelerate the production of SAF and support the aviation industry towards its net-zero carbon emission goal by 2050.""

Production capacity and emissions reduction

This partnership builds on previous collaboration between United and Neste.

Neste has supplied SAF to United at Chicago O'Hare International Airport since August 2024 after Illinois enacted a SAF purchase credit. The fuel has also been used at San Francisco International Airport, where California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard supports the adoption of renewable fuels.

Neste's current global SAF production capability stands at 1.5 million tons, or approximately 515 million gallons, per year.

According to the International Air Transport Association (""IATA""), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions. In 2024, global SAF production totalled only ~330 million gallons - about 0.3% of total jet-fuel demand. Meeting 2050 decarbonization targets will require an estimated 27% compound annual growth rate in production capacity and the construction of 5,000 - 7,000 new facilities worldwide. This gap represents one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition, with analysts projecting the SAF market could exceed ~$25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050.

Governments are responding. Across major markets, policymakers are using mandates and incentive schemes to accelerate SAF adoption. Today, more than 2 billion people globally live in countries with SAF blending mandates or strong incentives, such as tax credits - by 2030, this number is expected to grow to more than 4 billion people.

""Global demand for SAF is shifting from ‘if' to ‘how fast,'"" said Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF. ""Mandates, incentives, and procurement are converging to drive volume.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge aims to expand domestic consumption of SAF to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.

In Europe,the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates that SAF make up 2% of all jet fuel by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050, creating one of the largest mandated clean-fuel markets globally.

The UK has coupled mandates starting from 2% in 2025 and increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 with revenue-certainty mechanisms that help cover the price premium between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Across Asia-Pacific, countries including Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and Singapore are developing frameworks that combine blending targets, tax incentives, and infrastructure funding to stimulate both production and demand.

""Global demand for SAF is shifting from 'if' to 'how fast,'"" said Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF. ""Mandates, incentives, and procurement are converging to drive volume.

XCF highlighted three dynamics that will shape the next phase of growth:

Diverse toolkits, common direction. Regions may use different policy levers - mandates, subsidies, tax credits, or procurement - but they all point toward accelerating adoption.

Technology mix evolution. HEFA remains the dominant pathway in the near-term, while policy frameworks are creating headroom for emerging pathways to scale toward 2050 targets.

System reliability. Airlines and fuel suppliers need dependable volumes, transparent carbon accounting, and logistics that work across borders. Producers with operational capacity and credible expansion plans will lead.

""As SAF adoption transitions from pilot programs to long-term supply, reliability and verifiability become the new currency of trust,"" Dange added. ""XCF is building the backbone of that transition by advancing the infrastructure and partnerships needed to make SAF the new standard across global aviation.""

Yet, despite their scale and impact, emissions from wildfires are often excluded from official inventories.","I run a Port authority that includes Portland International Airport (PDX). For airports worldwide, a top priority is scaling up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for all aircrafts. SAF has the potential to dramatically reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% per lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuels. As one of the busiest airports on the West Coast, PDX is committed to leading this transition in cooperation with the international airports in Seattle and Vancouver, BC, who we have a joint decarbonization agreement with. By implementing SAF, we can significantly decrease our airport operation’s carbon footprint and set an example for global aviation. This shift not only supports our local and global climate goals but also encourages airlines to adopt greener practices. The widespread adoption of SAF would be a game-changer, reducing the aviation industry's overall impact on climate change and fostering a more sustainable future for air travel.

What’s one sustainability effort you personally will try to adopt in the next year?

Portland, Oregon, has a world-renowned food scene—from our fresh seafood and fruit to our revered chefs and wine, I truly live in foodie heaven. Now, my family and I are committing to using our unrivaled options to land on a more climate-friendly diet. This means reducing the number of meat-centric meals I eat in a week, seeking out locally grown products to minimize transportation, and prioritizing organic and sustainable farming practices. Supporting local farmers not only reduces the environmental impact of transporting food over long distances, but it also strengthens our local economy. Adopting these practices allows us to make a meaningful contribution to the fight against climate change, one meal at a time.

What is a climate solution that isn't getting the attention or funding it deserves?

I live in the American West, and for my community the clear climate crisis that urgently needs attention is the rise of increasingly devastating wildfires and the dangerous smoke they produce. The deadly 2020 Labor Day Fires in Oregon ripped through more than a million acres, burning several towns to the ground. That same year in neighboring California, the state emitted more greenhouse gases in just one year than it had previously eliminated through 18 years of carbon-reduction efforts—effectively erasing nearly two decades of progress. Yet, despite their scale and impact, emissions from wildfires are often excluded from official inventories. Wildfire smoke is also emerging as the deadliest climate-related health threat in the U.S.

It is impossible to overstate the personal and economic toll these fires are taking across the West, and our leaders must meet the moment. That means seriously prioritizing wildfire mitigation, forest resilience, smoke mitigation, and emissions accounting. Investing in these wildfire reduction efforts is not optional—it is essential in our fight against climate change.

What gives you hope about the future of the planet?

Local innovations fueling creative climate solutions. This was the Port of Portland’s North Star as we united the talents of people from across the Pacific Northwest to build PDX’s new state-of-the-art terminal. Together, we are doubling the airport’s size, yet cutting our energy use in half by using the latest in local, sustainably sourced designs and upgrades. Bringing transformative projects like this to life shows the world that smart business and efficient infrastructure go hand-in-hand with supporting local economies and healthy environments.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Catalyst-Curtis-Robinhold.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1,N,,2025-10-30 09:56:55.950814

For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF.
As electric vehicles replace gasoline-powered cars, this ethanol can be redirected to jet fuel production without impacting food production or requiring new agricultural investment.
Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient.
By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.","In an exclusive AgroSpectrum interview, Alexei Beltyukov, CEO and Co-founder of Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel), elucidates how the company’s proprietary Flexiforming process transcends the constraints of conventional waste-oil-based biofuels, converting alcohols and low-value refinery byproducts into truly drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). By delivering the elusive aromatic fraction required for jet engine performance — something HEFA and Fischer–Tropsch routes cannot independently supply — Unifuel simultaneously augments yield and slashes both energy and hydrogen inputs.

Beltyukov underscores that Flexiforming’s modularity and compatibility with existing refineries and ethanol facilities offer a capital-efficient scale-up pathway at a time when the SAF markets are beleaguered by feedstock scarcity and punishing production costs. Policy acceleration toward 100 per cent synthetic SAF approval, coupled with long-term airline offtake agreements, he argues, will unlock the confidence necessary for global deployment. Ultimately, Unifuel positions itself not as a solitary panacea but as a catalytic enabler of a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation future, where complementary pathways collaborate to maximise every molecule of renewable carbon.

I. Technology & Production

From Waste to Jet Fuel:

Can you explain the core technology behind Unifuel’s conversion of waste oils and fats into SAF, and what differentiates it from conventional biofuel pathways?

Unifuel doesn’t directly convert waste oils and fats into SAF. Rather, our Flexiforming technology complements existing processes that do. We convert alcohols like ethanol and methanol into high-quality SAF, and we upgrade the low-value byproducts—naphtha and LPG—from Hydroprocessed Esthers and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes that use waste oils and fats.

The key differentiator is our single-step, all-gas phase reaction using a proprietary catalyst. This design reduces energy consumption by 75 per cent and hydrogen requirements by 33 per cent compared to alternative ethanol-to-jet processes, positioning our technology at approximately half the cost. Additionally, we produce aromatic SAF components that HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch cannot, which are essential for jet engine performance and achieving true drop-in capability.

Performance and Sustainability:

How do Unifuel’s SAF products perform in terms of energy density, combustion efficiency, and lifecycle carbon intensity compared to fossil-based jet fuels?

Flexiforming produces SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel, containing the 8-25 per cent aromatics that today’s aircraft engines require. Our SAF has undergone comprehensive testing at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab—the world-leading authority on SAF research—and has been accepted into the ASTM D4054 Clearinghouse for qualification. This acceptance demonstrates that our fuel meets strict quality and safety criteria and shows strong potential for completing the ASTM qualification process successfully.

In terms of lifecycle carbon intensity, depending on the specific chemical pathway, our energy-efficient process has a carbon intensity 10-31 per cent that of the incoming feedstock—a significant reduction beyond the inherent benefits of using renewable feedstocks.

II. Scaling Challenges

Feedstock Constraints:

Waste oils and fats are finite and geographically dispersed. What strategies is Unifuel pursuing to secure a consistent, scalable feedstock supply, and how do logistics impact production economics?

Rather than competing for limited HEFA feedstocks, our strategy is to make the best of what’s available and diversify. For example, for HEFA—indeed, a feed-limited pathway to SAF—Flexiforming can convert their low-value byproduct, naphtha, into the aromatic component of SAF. Apart from making the product a potentially fully synthetic fungible jet fuel (subject to ASTM approvals), this produces 20 per cent more SAF from the same amount of feedstock. Flexiforming works with any alcohol or ether, renewable naphthas, and LPG. This versatility allows plant operators to adapt to feedstock availability and pricing fluctuations.

For ethanol specifically, we see significant opportunity. The U.S. already produces billions of gallons of ethanol annually for gasoline blending. As electric vehicles replace gasoline-powered cars, this ethanol can be redirected to jet fuel production without impacting food production or requiring new agricultural investment. Flexiforming offers ethanol plant operators an economically viable ethanol-to-jet pathway, 50 per cent less expensive than existing ETJ options.

Refinery and Conversion Economics:

What are the key technical and economic bottlenecks in scaling SAF production from laboratory or pilot-scale to commercial refinery operations, and how is Unifuel addressing them ?

The primary bottlenecks are cost (SAF currently costs 2 to 4 times more than conventional jet fuel) and feedstock limitations. Our single-reactor design dramatically reduces capital and operational costs. Flexiforming is also designed for scalable deployment at various sizes, from small bolt-on units for Fischer-Tropsch plants to large refinery-scale installations. This flexibility allows producers to match their investment to their specific circumstances rather than requiring massive upfront capital. Critically, we integrate with existing infrastructure, minimizing deployment costs and accelerating time to market. Our successful 2024 five-month pilot campaign demonstrates we’ve moved beyond laboratory concepts closer to commercially proven, reproducible technology.

III. Policy & Market Dynamics

Regulatory Alignment:

How do government incentives, blending mandates, and carbon credit schemes influence SAF adoption, and where do you see regulatory gaps that need urgent attention to accelerate deployment ?

Similar to how EVs initially depended on government incentives before becoming mainstream, SAF needs policy support to offset the current cost premium and give producers confidence to invest.

The next step we are awaiting in the regulatory area is the adoption of a standard for 100 per cent drop-in, fully synthetic SAF. Currently, ASTM standards allow most SAF to be blended with conventional jet fuel up to 50 per cent . The industry anticipates approval for 100 per cent synthetic SAF by the end of 2026, but this requires addressing the aromatics requirement—something HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch alone cannot provide.

Technologies that can produce aromatic SAF components should receive accelerated regulatory review and support, as they’re essential for eliminating the need for continued blending with fossil fuels.

Global Market Readiness:

With airlines increasingly committing to SAF targets, what is your perspective on the readiness of global supply chains and airport infrastructure to handle large-scale SAF integration?

Infrastructure is largely in place to support greater use of SAF, since it is a “drop-in” replacement that works with today’s aircraft. Once the fully synthetic SAF standard is adopted, common-carrier pipelines and all other infrastructure will be accessible to SAF. The real challenge is scaling production to meet growing demand. SAF currently represents less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel consumption, and closing that gap will depend on both technologies that make existing production pathways more efficient and cost-effective, as well as the regulatory approach.

A lot of capacity and feedstock that can be used to make SAF are presently targeting renewable diesel. This is a partial result of how the tax incentives are set up, and also of the fact that when making SAF, the producers inevitably make significant quantities of naphtha – a byproduct that, in the absence of Flexiforming, has a relatively low value.

Flexiforming helps in exactly that way. By upgrading low-value byproducts such as naphtha and LPG into additional SAF, our technology enables producers to generate more fuel from the same feedstock. This increases total output while improving project economics, which in turn helps airlines and fuel suppliers meet their sustainability commitments more quickly and affordably.

IV. Strategic Outlook

Investment and Partnership Models:

What role do strategic airline partnerships, venture capital, and private equity play in enabling SAF scale-up, and what frameworks have you found most effective for attracting long-term investment?

Strategic partnerships are critical, especially between technology providers, fuel producers, and airlines. Airlines’ long-term offtake agreements provide the demand certainty investors look for, while venture and private equity partners can fund early deployment.

Unifuel’s model is based on technology licensing rather than direct fuel production, which makes scaling faster and more capital-efficient. Our customers can integrate Flexiforming into their existing plants with relatively low CapEx, creating a more distributed, resilient SAF supply network. This model appeals to investors because it allows them to participate across multiple facilities and feedstocks, reducing risk while accelerating market penetration.

Beyond Waste Oils:

As SAF demand grows, how is Unifuel preparing for feedstock diversification — for example, algae, municipal waste, or other renewable sources — and what technical or economic hurdles remain in that transition ?

Feedstock diversification is at the heart of Flexiforming’s value proposition. We can already process any naphtha, alcohol or ether, so as new pathways to these feeds emerge—from algae, cellulosic sources, or other biomass—we can potentially integrate them.

For municipal and agricultural waste, we complement Fischer-Tropsch processing. By upgrading FT’s naphtha and LPG byproducts into aromatic SAF, we can increase plant revenue by 10-20 per cent, making waste-to-SAF projects more financially viable.

The main challenge is not chemistry, but logistics and preprocessing costs. That’s why our technology can be deployed at different scales, even near the source of biomass or waste conversion. By enabling modular, regional SAF production, Flexiforming helps producers reduce transportation costs and make better use of local renewable resources.

Vision for Net-Zero Aviation:

Looking ahead 5–10 years, how do you see Unifuel contributing to a commercially viable, climate-positive aviation sector, and what are the key milestones the industry must hit to achieve that vision?

We envision three major use cases: bolt-ons to Fischer-Tropsch and HEFA plants processing waste feedstocks; partnerships with ethanol plants transitioning from selling ethanol for gasoline blending to SAF; and retrofitting existing oil refineries for SAF production.

The key industry milestones include ASTM approval for 100 per cent drop-in synthetic SAF by end of 2026; achieving economic parity or near-parity with conventional jet fuel through technology improvements and policy support; and successfully diversifying beyond limited HEFA feedstocks.

Our goal is for Flexiforming to become a mainstream enabling technology—recognizing that no single pathway will meet 100 per cent of demand, but that complementary technologies working together can maximize resource utilization and make sustainable aviation the norm rather than the exception.",https://agrospectrumindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Flexiforming_SAF_Wallpaper_Alternative.png,N,,2025-10-30 09:57:01.133363

The urgency of this innovation cannot be overstated, as increased air travel has escalated the demand for jet fuel, which is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. The study, published in the esteemed journal Nature Communications, elucidates their unique approach to addressing the aviation sector’s environmental challenges while ensuring that the resulting fuel meets rigorous industry standards without the need for fossil fuel blends.

At the heart of this research is a thermochemical conversion technique known as hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). This innovative process replicates the natural formation of crude oil, applying high heat and pressure to wet biomass, specifically food waste, to synthesize biocrude oil. The versatility of HTL allows it to utilize a broad spectrum of organic materials, making it a promising solution for converting various waste products into valuable energy sources. The successful transformation of food waste into usable fuel exemplifies a crucial step toward sustainability in transportation.

Food waste itself is an alarming global issue, with over 30% of edible food discarded each year across the supply chain—from agricultural production to household waste. This not only exacerbates food insecurity but also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, especially when waste decomposes in landfills and contaminates water sources. By harnessing this waste through HTL, the researchers not only provide a method for reducing environmental impact but also promote the concept of sustainability in the aviation industry.

The research team meticulously crafted a three-step process to refine biocrude into aviable transport fuel. Initially, impurities such as moisture, ash, and salts are eliminated from the crude oil. Following this purification stage, catalytic hydrotreating is employed to remove unwanted constituents like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The result is a refined hydrocarbon mix suitable for aviation fuel. This breakthrough not only reutilizes food waste but also addresses the pressing need for cleaner energy alternatives in the aviation sector.

Lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently earned her doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, emphasizes that the effectiveness of their approach is rooted in the selection of suitable catalysts. After experimenting with various options, the researchers designated cobalt molybdenum as the most effective catalyst for facilitating the necessary reactions to refine biocrude into jet fuel. This strategic selection sets this research apart, showcasing the importance of catalyst efficiency in future developments within this field.

Their rigorous testing revealed that the sustainable aviation fuel produced from food waste passed advanced pre-screening tests set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Impressively, this SAF sample adhered to all the specifications required for conventional jet fuel without the need for any additive or blending with fossil fuels. This not only validates their methodology but also positions their innovation as a legitimate contender for commercial aviation fuel.

The scalable nature of this technology bolsters its potential for widespread commercialization. Yuanhui Zhang, a co-author of the study and a professor in the same department, asserts that agriculture will play a critical role in providing the diverse renewable feedstocks necessary to meet aviation’s decarbonization goals. Their method can be utilized to produce various forms of sustainable fuels beyond just jet fuel, paving the way for a broader impact on the energy landscape.

In an era where sustainability is a primary concern, this research contributes meaningfully to the concept of the circular bioeconomy. Unlike conventional processes that adhere to a linear pattern of production and disposal, the approach employed by Zhang and Summers encapsulates the essence of circularity—taking waste materials and converting them into energy and usable products. This not only mitigates waste but also enhances resource efficiency in multiple industries, from aviation to plastics.

The implications of this research extend beyond immediate environmental concerns; they open doors for extensive commercial opportunities. As industry stakeholders grapple with climate change and the imperative to adopt greener practices, innovations like the conversion of food waste into aviation fuel could redefine how we perceive waste and energy production. The potential for growth in this sector is immense, especially as policymakers and the public become increasingly supportive of sustainable initiatives.

Moving forward, the expected impact of this study hinges on continued collaboration between academia and industry. The transition from laboratory successes to commercial viability involves addressing engineering and economic challenges that will arise during the scale-up of such processes. This transition is essential not only for the advancement of SAF but also for broader initiatives aimed at establishing a more sustainable energy economy.

In conclusion, the research conducted at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign stands as a beacon of hope for a future where aviation can coexist harmoniously with environmental sustainability. By harnessing food waste and turning it into a viable energy source, they have not only tackled an existing problem but have also positioned sustainable aviation fuel as a feasible option for the aviation industry’s future. As the world increasingly stands at the crossroads of climate action, innovations such as these are vital roadmaps showing the way forward.

The paper detailing this groundbreaking research, titled “From food waste to sustainable aviation fuel: cobalt molybdenum catalysis of pretreated hydrothermal liquefaction biocrude,” is published in Nature Communications, further legitimizing the methods and impacts discussed. With the backing of the U.S. Department of Energy and support from the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, this research highlights the integral role that funding and collaboration play in driving scientific advancements.

As we navigate through the challenges posed by climate change, the importance of converting waste into valuable resources cannot be understated. The work at the University of Illinois is a prime example of how innovation and sustainability can blend seamlessly, forging a path toward a cleaner, more sustainable future.

Their process, described in a new Nature Communications study, could help the aviation industry meet its ambitious goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The process in a nutshell is this: The researchers convert food waste into biocrude oil through a thermochemical conversion process called hydrothermal liquefaction, or HTL. Next, they remove impurities from the biocrude oil, and finally, they refine it with the use of hydrogen and catalysts to turn it into aviation fuel.

This approach can be applied to a variety of feedstocks and types of oil, potentially leading to a new direction for obtaining fuels.

“HTL basically mimics the natural formation of crude oil in the Earth. It uses high heat and pressure to convert wet biomass into a biocrude oil. The goal of this work is to upgrade that biocrude oil into transportation fuels that can go directly into existing energy infrastructure,” said lead author Sabrina Summers, who recently graduated with a doctoral degree from the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE), part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences and The Grainger College of Engineering at U. of I.

In this project, the researchers used waste from a nearby food processing facility. Globally, over 30% of food is wasted annually at all levels of the supply chain — from farm to transportation, processing, retail, food service, and households. Food decomposition in landfills and wastewater treatment plants further contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling waste helps promote sustainability.

But HTL can process feedstock from a wide range of biowaste, including food, sewage sludge, algal bloom, swine manure, and agricultural residue.

“To meet the aviation industry’s goals to decarbonate jet fuel, we need many different renewable sources, and agriculture is going to play a critical role in terms of providing the feedstocks,” said ABE professor and corresponding author Yuanhui Zhang.

To convert biocrude oil into jet fuel, the researchers first removed impurities such as moisture, ash, and salt. They then used a process called catalytic hydrotreating to eliminate unwanted elements like nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—leaving behind only the hydrocarbons needed for fuel. After testing dozens of options, they identified cobalt molybdenum as the most effective commercially available catalyst to drive the necessary chemical reactions and refine the oil into sustainable aviation fuel.

To optimize the hydrotreatment process, the researchers adjusted variables such as temperature, catalyst and hydrogen loads, and retention time to identify the best conditions for producing jet fuel. They then tested their sustainable aviation fuel against rigorous standards set by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the Federal Aviation Administration. Their SAF sample passed Tier Alpha and Beta prescreening tests and met all specifications for conventional jet fuel—without requiring any additives or blending with fossil fuels.

The technology has the potential to be scaled up for commercial production, Zhang noted.

“Our research helps solve the science and engineering problems, and then the industry can step in. The process can be applied to other types of oils for SAF. It can also replace other materials, such as petroleum-derived compounds for making plastics. This has huge potential for business opportunities and economic development,” he said.

Zhang has developed an index to measure circular bioeconomy, and he said SAF provides a valuable contribution to circularity.

“In a linear economy, we just produce something, use it, and throw it away. In this project, we take the waste and recover the energy and materials to make a usable product. This fills a missing link in the circular paradigm,” he concluded.",https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2025/10/29/690230eb16670_SabrinaSummers.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 09:57:19.198305

In this study, it was shown that cobalt molybdenum catalyst effectively upgraded food waste-derived HTL biocrude oil into drop-in SAF.
Despite the improved circularity through producing SAF from food waste, it is apparent that food waste alone will only be part of the solution to provide feedstocks for SAF.
Specifically, municipal solid waste and wet waste (including food waste) is just a fraction of the potential sustainable biomass supply for production of liquid transportation fuels.
Overall, increased recovery of food waste from other waste management practices would most greatly improve the circularity of this HTL-SAF pathway.","Rising energy demand and the negative impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have hastened efforts to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). To achieve the United States’s SAF Grand Challenge of meeting 100% domestic demand for aviation fuel and net-zero carbon emissions, a significant uptake in SAF is required. SAF can form a circular carbon loop that utilizes carbon emissions during production, transportation, and combustion, effectively reducing aviation’s carbon footprint1. Further, aviation represents 2–3% of global GHG emissions and 11% of U.S. GHG emissions2,3. However, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel3,4,5, largely due to the use of biogenic waste material, which allows uptake of feedstock to offset combustion carbon emissions from SAF3.

Currently, there are eight SAF production pathways and three co-processing pathways approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)6. Synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) is the most mature and least expensive pathway, but it is severely constrained by feedstock availability7. HEFA-SPK hydroprocesses lipid feedstocks, including FOGs, algae, vegetable oils like soybean oil, and seed oils like jatropha. Furthermore, synthesized paraffinic kerosene from hydroprocessed hydrocarbons, esters, and fatty acids (HC-HEFA-SPK) utilizes an additional feedstock, algae oil from Botryococcus braunii, to produce SAF. Fischer-Tropsch hydroprocessed synthesized paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK) converts woody biomass (e.g., municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, forest/wood residues, energy crops) into syngas through gasification, followed by production of hydrocarbons through FT, and hydroprocessing. The additional production of aromatics (FT-SPK/A) addresses the low aromatics content of FT-SPK fuel through the alkylation of light aromatics with FT-derived olefins. Synthesized isoparaffins from hydroprocessed fermented sugars (HFS-SIP) utilizes microbial conversion of sugars from cellulosic biomass (e.g., corn stover, non-woody biomass, pretreated FOGs), to produce farnesene, which can then be hydroprocessed into isoparaffins. Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) synthetic paraffinic kerosene produces isobutanol or ethanol via fermentation or gasification of cellulosic biomass, which then undergo dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation to form jet-range hydrocarbons. ATJ synthetic paraffinic kerosene with aromatics (ATJ-SKA) also addresses the low aromatic content of ATJ SAF, deriving aromatics from C2-C5 alcohols through additional dehydration and aromatization steps. Lastly, hydrothermal conversion of fatty acid esters and fatty acids (CHJ) treats waste and energy oils through catalytic hydrothermal liquefaction and hydroprocessing. The blend limit is 50% for all approved pathways, except for HFS-SIP and HC-HEFA SPK, which are limited to 10%. For co-processing, esters and fatty acids, FT hydrocarbons, and HEFA hydrocarbons are hydroprocessed with petroleum in a conventional refinery, limited to 5%, 5%, and 10% blends, respectively.

The utilization of waste biomass plays a significant role in the production of biofuels for the transportation sector and reduction of GHG emissions. Biofuels can be defined as first-generation (edible oil seeds), second-generation (non-edible oil seeds, waste materials), third-generation (algae), and fourth-generation (genetically engineered oil crops) according to their feedstock8. In particular, second-generation feedstocks avoid land use and enable the recovery of carbon and energy from waste streams, presenting a sustainable feedstock for fuel production. Approximately 11% of bio-based energy and chemicals in the U.S. are produced from waste biomass9. Potential biomass feedstocks from waste streams include waste lipids like FOGs (fat, oil, and grease), food waste, algal blooms, sewage sludge, and agricultural and forestry residues. While catalytic hydroprocessing of lipid feedstocks, such as waste cooking oils, is currently the most competitive pathway for renewable diesel and SAF, feedstock sustainability is limited by availability and cost10. One promising feedstock for SAF is food waste, an impactful biomass stream that represents reusable carbon sources for renewable energy applications. In the United States, food waste is the most common discarded material for landfill and incineration11. Over 30% of food is wasted or lost in the global supply chain each year; In 2021, it was reported that 13.2% was lost in the chain from farm to consumer, while an additional 17% was wasted at the consumer level, including households, food service, and retail12. Furthermore, disposal of food waste in landfills has further environmental impacts through GHG emissions during decomposition11. Food waste is an ideal feedstock for hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a thermochemical conversion method that reacts wet biomass under high heat and pressure to produce biocrude oil, along with aqueous, char, and gaseous byproducts. Compared to other thermochemical technologies, HTL has an economic advantage by using the inherent water content of feedstocks as a reaction medium, thereby avoiding the time-consuming and cost-prohibitive drying pretreatment step13. Moreso, it can convert a broad range of feedstock, including non-lipid components of biomass, such as proteins and carbohydrates14. While HTL biocrude is a promising substitution for liquid petroleum products such as transportation fuels, it possesses several undesirable physicochemical properties that make it unsuitable as a drop-in fuel, including high oxygen content; high viscosity and acidity; and low heating value13,15. Furthermore, biocrude oil derived from biogenic feedstocks contain alkali impurities and sulfur that can cause catalyst deactivation over time16. Nonetheless, HTL’s ability to convert a broad range of feedstocks gives it an advantage over other SAF conversion technologies, such as HEFA-SPK, which is sensitive to feedstock volatility, price, and availability7. For example, the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of HEFA-SPK in the United States ranged from $1.84–9.40/GGE, depending on feedstock source7. Comparatively, the MFSP of SAF from HTL has been reported from $2.77/GGE for sewage sludge feedstock17, $3.34/GGE for food waste18, and up to $5.42/GGE for cultivated algae19. Furthermore, 8-18% of costs were associated with the required upgrading of HTL biocrude oil, including hydrotreating and hydrocracking17,19. For feedstocks requiring deeper heteroatom removal, the addition of a hydrodenitrogenation unit only added $0.02/GGE19.

Valorization of biowaste feedstocks like food waste into renewable transportation fuels such as SAF promotes both feedstock and energy sustainability, as well as a zero-waste circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, this waste-to-energy paradigm contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 7, 12, and 13. In the 2023 SDG Report, it was found that although 28.2% of electricity came from renewable energy sources, growth in clean energy for the transportation sector has been much more limited, with only 4.0% from renewable sources12. The aviation industry, like most of the transportation sector, is difficult to electrify, so HTL represents a potential solution to pivot away from fossil fuels and achieve SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy. Furthermore, SAF from food waste directly serves SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production by providing a renewable alternative to alleviate fossil fuel consumption, as well as utilizing a feedstock that helps the goal to decrease food waste and loss 50% by 203012. Lastly, SAF production and consumption improves carbon circularity, therefore working toward SDG 13 Climate Action to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate global warming12.

HTL biocrude must be upgraded to remove inorganic components and improve its fuel properties. Depending on the feedstock, different challenges and upgrading routes exist. For example, HTL feedstocks with high protein content, such as algae, typically produce nitrogenous biocrude that may require deeper heteroatom removal with more severe or multi-stage hydrotreating20,21. Lignocellulosic oil contains a significant amount of aromatics desirable for SAF, but the complex composition of lignin compounds make them recalcitrant to hydrotreating, necessitating reaction engineering and catalyst development for efficient hydrodeoxygenation22. Furthermore, HTL of high-lipid feedstocks typically produces heavier biocrude compounds due to repolymerization reactions, requiring hydrocracking during upgrading23. Common technologies used for biocrude upgrading include distillation, esterification, emulsification, hydrotreating, hydrocracking, and steam reforming15,24,25. Catalytic hydrotreating can target removal of heteroatoms, as well as improve hydrogen content and fuel quality of the biocrude, while avoiding carbon loss from decarbonylation and decarboxylation reactions20. Previous studies have explored hydrotreating biocrude from various feedstocks including lignocellulose, agricultural waste, algae, sewage sludge, waste cooking oil, and food waste. Molybdenum-based catalysts are desirable for their low cost, comparable activity to noble-metal catalysts, and effectiveness toward deoxygenation (de-O). Cobalt molybdenum catalysts have been shown to be slightly more effective for denitrogenation (de-N) compared to nickel molybdenum. For example, 99% de-N was achieved for hydrotreated HTL biocrude using CoMo26, while NiMo achieved up to 80% using single-stage hydrotreating27, and 92.5% using two-stage hydrotreating21. Additionally, Cronin et al. found that CoMo led to increased removal of heterocyclic nitrogenates, such as pyridine and pyrimidine28. Catalysts with higher metal loads exhibit improved yield and de-O29, and while organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and 2-propanol can act as hydrogen donors, they may also cause competing reactions between hydrogenating the solvent and biocrude oil30.

Hydrotreating temperatures for HTL biocrude typically range from 350 to 400 °C and pressures of 4–10 MPa20,27,28. The use of lower temperatures (200-325 °C) has also been explored to improve biocrude stabilization for increased demetallization31,32 and de-N21. Depending on the reactor configuration (batch vs. continuous), the catalyst load and retention time (RT) may be defined individually or as a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV, h−1). In batch reactors, the equivalent WHSV can be defined as the ratio of biocrude to catalyst mass divided by the RT. For continuous hydrotreating, the 0.3–1.0 h−1 WHSV was used, with 0.5 h−1 the most common27,28,31,32. Meanwhile, batch reactors applied catalyst:oil mass ratios of 0.5 and RTs of 4 h, yielding an equivalent WHSV of 0.5 h−1, making them comparable to conditions in a continuous reactor20,21,32. Existing studies showed that temperature and pressure are significant factors for de-O and de-N, while also influencing fuel quality and product yields29,33. Although higher temperature increased oil recovery and is required for further de-N, it may also lead to polymerization, condensation, and cracking reactions due to instability of reactive oxygenates32,34. At higher hydrogen pressure, the extent of de-O increased, while coking and decarboxylation reactions were minimized and there was improved hydrogenation of heterocyclic nitrogenates20,27,30. However, at severe pressures, polymerization of small molecules may also occur, decreasing the final oil yield29. Meanwhile, low pressures may result in the diffusion of gases formed during hydrocracking reactions, causing biocrude oil to be increasingly converted into gas and lighter molecules29. The RT also influenced product yields and fuel quality, with longer times allowing for further de-O and hydrocracking reactions29,30. But at extended reaction times (>4 h), polymerization reactions occured and increased coke formation caused catalyst deactivation29,30.

Although previous works have also produced SAF candidates through the catalytic treatment of food waste-derived precursors, their resulting fuel viability was restricted by blending limits, nitrogen, and sulfur levels. For example, Cronin et al. hydrotreated biocrude from HTL of food waste using CoMo and NiMo, but 0.86–1.34 wt% nitrogen and 0.02–0.03 wt% sulfur remained28. Meanwhile, catalytic upgrading of volatile fatty acids (VFA) from the anaerobic digestion of food waste produced a neat SAF candidate, i.e., unblended, with 26–68 ppm nitrogen, slightly above the ASTM limit of 15 ppm16. Additionally, the VFA-SAF candidate was limited by its flash point and low temperature viscosity, requiring at least 70% blending with Jet A to meet ASTM specification limits in Tier α and β tests16. In this study, it was shown that cobalt molybdenum catalyst effectively upgraded food waste-derived HTL biocrude oil into drop-in SAF. Through parameter screening and optimization, a neat SAF candidate was produced that met preliminary ASTM qualifications for jet fuel properties, possessing low nitrogen and sulfur levels, thereby advancing circularity of the aviation sector.

Hydrotreating parameter screening

The products yields, elemental composition, and parameter screening results are displayed in Fig. 1. It was seen that oil yield generally decreased with combinations of higher parameter levels (Fig. 1A). This was mainly due to polymerization reactions occurring during extended RTs that increased char formation, as well as increased hydrocracking and gasification reactions at high pressure and temperature. Greater amounts of aqueous and char products were seen at the low and medium temperatures, indicating that at higher severity, less polymerization and recondensation occurs over gasification. Lack of aqueous product at higher temperatures suggested decarboxylation and decarbonylation pathways over hydrodeoxygenation, yielding gaseous products rather than water. In general, higher de-O resulted in increased higher heating values (HHV) (Fig. 1A, B). 76–100% de-O was achieved, with up to 2.21 wt% remaining oxygen in the oil. Hydrotreated oil with remaining oxygen were treated at lower temperature and RT, indicating the importance of these parameters for de-O. Desulfurization (de-S) was effective at higher severities, with up to 94% sulfur removal and 20 ppm remaining. De-N was least efficient, ranging from 7 to 23% with 0.55–0.66 wt% nitrogen remaining in the hydrotreated oil.

Improved fuel quality and heteroatom removal were obtained at the expense of carbon and energy recovery (Cr and Er), especially due to carbon losses from gasification at severe hydrotreating conditions. The most significant parameters affecting de-O, Er, and Cr were determined using Taguchi delta values, the difference between the highest and lowest mean of response (Fig. 1C). For de-O, the most significant parameters were catalyst-to-oil ratio (cat:oil) > temperature (T) > hydrogen load-to-biocrude oxygen ratio (H:O) > retention time (RT), while for Cr and Er they were T > cat:oil > RT > H:O. Though H:O was more important for oxygen removal than carbon and energy recovery, the highest average de-Os were obtained at 15:1 H:O ratios. Therefore, T, cat:oil, and RT were selected as the parameters to undergo optimization for SAF production while the H:O ratio was held constant.

Improved boiling point distribution and hydrocarbon composition was also observed across changes in hydrotreating temperature and catalyst ratio. Temperature was the most significant factor affecting the boiling point distribution of the hydrotreated biocrude oil (Fig. S1A). At lower temperatures, light fractions <250 °C increased compared to PT biocrude oil, but the amount of mid-range fractions from 250 to 350 °C decreased while the amount of heavier fuel fractions >350 °C increased. Therefore, at mild hydrotreating conditions, polymerization and coking reactions may decrease the yield of viable distillates in the transportation fuel range. Notably, at the highest temperatures, the hydrotreated biocrude oil contained >99% distillate fractions <250 °C, with H9 exhibiting extremely similar boiling point distribution to Jet-A. At the mildest conditions (H1), the amount of n-alkanes significantly increased from 19.91% in the PT biocrude oil to 84.72% after hydrotreating, indicating de-O and hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons and O-containing compounds such as fatty acids (Fig. S1B). With increased catalyst ratio (H2-3), alkenes were further hydrogenated, and small increases in aromatics and cycloalkanes were seen. At higher temperatures, isomerization and cracking reactions are favored, while n-alkanes can also undergo dehydrocyclization to form aromatics35,36. This caused the hydrocarbon distribution to further broaden and include more cycloalkanes, isoalkanes, and aromatics. At elevated temperature, higher oil yield and de-O also improved the Cr and Er of the hydrotreated HTL biocrude (Fig. S1C).

Hydrotreating parameter optimization and fuel properties

Average carbon number and hydrocarbon type are significant properties in predicting the properties of SAF37,38. Having an average carbon number closer to conventional jet fuel’s is desirable to stay within ASTM specification limits for SAF. Contour heat maps elucidated the effect of T, RT, and cat:oil on the average carbon number of hydrotreated biocrude oil (Fig. 2A–C and Table S5). It was seen that T had a greater effect than RT on average carbon number, with decreased carbon number correlated with increased hydrotreating T (Fig. 2A). The slight tilt of the contour lines toward the left also reflected decreased carbon number at longer RT, indicating breakdown of the carbon chains with limited repolymerization. Similar trends were seen for T and cat:oil, with decreased carbon number with increased T at all levels of cat:oil (Fig. 2B). Meanwhile, the change in carbon number across RT and cat:oil was less pronounced (Fig. 2C). A diagonal of slightly higher average carbon numbers was observed from high cat:oil and low RT to low cat:oil and high RT, showing that at mild combinations of cat:oil and RT, less cracking occurred. The diagonal pattern across the axis ranges was mainly attributed to the greater effect of T on average carbon number. For example, points on the contour line where average carbon number ~13, were those where different T (350 vs. 450 °C) were used at the same RT and cat:oil. Therefore, the change in T caused deviations in the average carbon number. Compared to T, RT, and cat:oil had less effect on carbon number. Overall, the average carbon number further decreased at combinations of higher T, RT, and cat:oil. Therefore, while a higher temperature was required to achieve an average carbon number closer to jet fuel, consideration should be taken in its combination with RT and cat:oil to avoid SAF products with carbon chains that are too light.

The modified Van Krevelen diagrams exhibit effective de-O and de-S during hydrotreating, but varying de-N (Fig. 2D–E). A majority of the SAF samples yielded complete oxygen and sulfur removal, with O/C and S/C molar ratios of 0. The H/C molar ratio of Jet-A and other conventional jet fuels depend on their specific composition. In this case, the obtained Jet-A sample was measured to have an H/C ratio of 1.93. Nearly all the hydrotreated HTL biocrude had H/C > 1.90 and some had H/C > 2.00, reflecting their comparable elemental composition to Jet-A, high HHV, and potential for improved combustion. A wide range of de-N was observed, indicating the importance of hydrotreating parameter tuning on nitrogen removal. Considering the cold-weld CHN method used, the variation may also be due to systematic (instrumental or measurement) errors. With a nitrogen detection limit of 0.1%, at least 87% de-N was achieved in a few cases. High de-N in a single hydrotreating step may be a result of the HTL biocrude pretreatment, where the removal of salt and ash prevents catalyst plugging and deactivation39. Furthermore, up to 40% oxygen, 55% sulfur, and 22% nitrogen could be removed during pretreatment, enabling additional stabilization of the biocrude prior to hydrotreating39. Notably, compared to a previous study that used CoMo and NiMo catalysts to hydrotreat HTL biocrude oil derived from food waste, improved de-O, de-S, and de-N was achieved in this work28. However, in comparison to reported hydrocarbon composition of approved SAFs from FT-, HEFA-, and ATJ-SPK, the H/C value from HTL still has room to improve16.

Comparing the hydrocarbon type, carbon number distribution, and boiling point distribution of HTL biocrude oil before and after hydrotreating, it was confirmed that hydrotreating at high temperature produced SAF samples with composition closest to Jet-A (Fig. 3). Hydrotreating successfully improved the hydrocarbon composition, indicated by an increase in the n-alkane content of all samples (Fig. 3A). Like the trend seen in the parameter screening tests, hydrotreating at combinations of higher temperature, RT, and catalyst load further improved the hydrocarbon type to contain increased amounts of aromatics, isoalkanes, and cycloalkanes. Notably, several of the SAF samples contained similar or higher amounts of isoalkanes and cycloalkanes compared to Jet-A, along with lower aromatic content. This could lead to improved cold flow properties and decreased contrails40. Notably, the Jet-A sample contained 35% aromatics and synthesized jet fuel must have 8-25% aromatics content. All samples hydrotreated at 450 °C (B2, B4, B6, B8) met the low level aromatics requirement of at least 8%, ranging from 9 to 13%. As seen in our SAF candidate, this value is also expected to increase after taking the jet cut from the whole hydrotreated biocrude due to the higher abundance of aromatics in the C8–C16 range. Recent work has also indicated that cycloalkanes can replace the volume swell properties of aromatics in jet fuel41.

HTL biocrude oil consistently became lighter after hydrotreating. This was reflected in the boiling point distribution, where hydrotreating increased the fraction of distillate ranges <250 °C (Fig. 3B). Like what was seen during the parameter screening, hydrotreating at the lowest parameter levels (e.g., B5) caused polymerization reactions that formed heavier compounds with boiling points above 350 °C. On the other hand, hydrotreating at higher temperatures and combinations of increased RT and cat:oil produced samples mainly composed of fractions with distillate ranges <250 °C. Specifically, all samples hydrotreated at the highest temperature level had a boiling point distribution most similar to Jet-A.

The carbon number range in Jet-A is typically C8–C16. This was confirmed in the commercial Jet-A sample tested, where 95% of its compounds were within the C8-C16 range and its average carbon number was 11.2 (Fig. 3C). Chemical compounds were also grouped into <C8, C17–C20, and >C20, to represent potential distillates in the ranges for gasoline, diesel, and heavy oils, respectively. All samples that had an average carbon number similar to or less than Jet-A (<11.5) were those produced at high temperature during hydrotreating (450 °C). However, since they still contained fractions outside the C8–C16 range, their average carbon number will likely change after distillation to obtain the SAF cut. Due to the importance of average carbon number on the chemical and handling properties of jet fuel, regression of the RSM data was used to predict the average carbon number and compare it to the experimental values (Fig. 3D). The predicted and experimental values were highly correlated, with an R2 of 0.97. A 95% confidence band and prediction band also demonstrated the ability of the model to predict new values within the experimental parameters.

SAF candidacy: Tier α tests for hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil

Based on the parameter screening and optimization, the HTL biocrude was hydrotreated to obtain a SAF candidate for Tier α prescreening of jet fuel properties that are critical for combustor operability limit. The SAF candidate achieved a carbon and energy recovery of 85.2 and 90.2%, respectively. Complete de-O and de-N was achieved, along with a final sulfur content of 10 ppm, meeting the 15 ppm maximum42. The physicochemical properties were further listed in Table S6. Compared to conventional jet fuel, the SAF candidate from this work contained higher amounts of light hydrocarbons, was within ASTM specification limits for critical bulk properties, and had a comparable distillation range predicted within specification limits (Fig. 4). The hydrocarbon compositions of both the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil and SAF cut were mainly n-alkanes, followed by cycloalkanes, aromatics, and isoalkanes (Fig. 4A, B). Compared to the average jet fuel carbon distribution, the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil contained high amounts of lighter (<C9) and heavier (>C13) hydrocarbons (Fig. 4A). The greater amount of heavy compounds in the whole hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil caused the average carbon number to be 12.7, slightly higher than jet fuel’s 11.4. However, after taking the SAF cut from C9 to C13, the average carbon number was more similar to jet fuel, decreasing to 10.7 (Fig. 4B). This SAF cut represented 31.5 wt% of the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil. Meanwhile, the light and heavy ends are also potential candidates for biobased gasoline and diesel.

It was observed that the surface tension (σ), density (ρ), kinematic viscosity (ν), lower heating value (LHV), flash point, derived cetane number, and freeze point were all within ASTM specification limits (Fig. 4C). Notably, the density and freeze point of the SAF candidate were near, but still, within ASTM specification limits, which was attributed to the high amount of heavy-end n-alkanes. At the same time, LHV was even higher than conventional jet fuel, likely due to the higher concentration of n-alkanes, which have high specific energy43. Although n-alkanes have high energy content and thermal stability, light n-alkanes (<nC7) can cause flash point violations and heavy n-alkanes (>nC14) can cause freeze point violations43. Since the SAF cut contained >50% n-alkanes, the fuel likely has a high smoke point, preventing soot formation and enabling cleaner combustion. However, there were few isoalkanes present in the hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil and SAF cut. Lightly branched isoalkanes are desirable for jet fuel because they improve cold flow properties, specific energy, thermal stability, and freeze point43,44,45. Isoalkanes improve the pour point and cloud point of jet fuel, which are especially important for the operability and performance of jet fuel at high altitude and low temperature46,47. Meanwhile, the high content of cycloalkanes and aromatics (~44%) also help to improve performance and handling properties of the SAF. For instance, monocycloalkanes improve the density, freeze point, and specific energy of the fuel, while polycycloalkanes increase energy density, specific energy, and thermal stability43. Aromatics are needed to promote seal swelling in jet engines, but they have high particulate emissions and cause significant sooting during burning. Lastly, the predicted ASTM D86 distillation curve of the SAF candidate was similar to the conventional jet range (Fig. 4D). Although the light and heavy ends fell slightly below the jet range, it was still within ASTM specification limits. The final boiling point for the SAF cut was set lower than the typical range for conventional jet fuel to address concerns about the freezing point. To further mitigate the freezing point issue, an additional isomerization step could be implemented to convert linear alkanes into lightly branched alkanes. This adjustment would allow the final boiling point to be increased to the conventional jet fuel range, resulting in a higher SAF yield. This food waste-derived HTL-SAF candidate was predicted to meet key ASTM specifications without blending. However, it is noted that some parameters, such as density and freeze point, are close to the specification limits. Therefore, blending may be required if any variations in feedstock composition cause deviations in the resulting fuel properties. The mass, carbon, and energy yields for this SAF candidate (Table S7) provided implications for scale-up and future areas of direction. After HTL biocrude pretreatment, hydrotreating, and distillation to obtain the SAF cut, the final mass yield from food waste was 6.94 wt%. For instance, improved mass transfer during hydrotreating could increase the oil yield and decrease losses to char and gaseous products. As mentioned before, increased alkane branching can also help improve the hydrotreated biocrude’s final boiling point, resulting in a higher SAF yield. Therefore, continuous hydrotreating, reaction tuning, and catalyst development present potential areas of work to improve viability of the HTL-SAF route.

Circularity index

Sustainability analysis using a circularity index (CI) demonstrated improved circularity in the U.S. aviation industry when implementing a HTL-SAF pathway. CI is a single value, between 0 and 1, that measures the circularity of concern in terms of consumable, renewable, and recoverable resources48. In this case, the energy and carbon CI was determined for the entire existing U.S. aviation industry’s jet fuel consumption and potential for SAF production from disposed food waste. Average consumption and production data for petroleum products, food waste, and the HTL process was collected for eight value chain categories: extraction, refining, distribution, consumption, disposal, recovery, remake, and reuse (Tables S8 and S9). In the existing U.S. aviation industry, jet fuel is mainly derived from petroleum products, with very little SAF consumption. In the first half of 2024, an average of 1,657,000 barrels of jet fuel were consumed per day49. Meanwhile, just 15.8 million gallons of SAF were consumed in 202250. In 2019, it was estimated that 66.2 million wet tons of food waste was managed in the U.S., with 39.6 million tons going to landfills51.

After implementing the use of HTL and hydrotreating for food waste recoverable from landfills, the CIs improved significantly. Energy CI increased from 1.35 to 32.51% and carbon CI increased from 0.13% to 17.12%. Despite the improved circularity through producing SAF from food waste, it is apparent that food waste alone will only be part of the solution to provide feedstocks for SAF. Specifically, municipal solid waste and wet waste (including food waste) is just a fraction of the potential sustainable biomass supply for production of liquid transportation fuels. Other emerging biomass feedstocks, such as algae, energy crops, forestry, agricultural, vegetable oil, and starch supplies, also have potential for SAF production52. Additionally, HTL biocrude from food waste can produce other bioproducts besides SAF (such as gasoline, diesel, and biobinders), so the potential CI of the overall system could be much higher53. Thereby, while food waste alone can help increase energy and carbon CI of the aviation industry by nearly 20%, utilization of other biomass feedstocks for SAF production can fill the gap to create a fully circular bioeconomy in the aviation industry and beyond.

The pathway from food waste to SAF via HTL and hydrotreating is complicated, involving many factors and variations. To consider the uncertainty in CI under changes in pathway conditions, including amount of disposed and recoverable food waste, carbon and energy contents of food waste and SAF, and mass yields during hydrotreating and distillation, a Monte Carlo analysis with 1,000 simulations was conducted. A larger range of uncertainty was depicted for energy circularity, ranging from 28.26% to 48.73% compared to 14.05–26.93% for carbon circularity (Fig. 5A). For both CIs, higher circularity was observed at increased food waste recovery, which was reflected in its high Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Fig. 5B). In the U.S., 59.84% of food waste is managed by landfills, with the other ~40% managed by combustion, donation, sewer/wastewater treatment, composting, biochemical processing, animal feed, anaerobic digestion, and land application51. Therefore, the production of SAF and value of CI for the aviation industry could continue to increase if food waste management beyond landfills was targeted for recovery in HTL and biorefinery processes. The carbon and energy content of the food waste also had a relatively high correlation to their respective CIs, indicating the importance of the feedstock’s biochemical composition. Overall, increased recovery of food waste from other waste management practices would most greatly improve the circularity of this HTL-SAF pathway.

HTL is a promising pathway to produce SAF. Although HTL can valorize food waste into biocrude oil, hydrotreating is still required to remove disadvantageous heteroatoms. It was determined that temperature, catalyst:oil ratio, and RT were the most impactful parameters on hydrotreating for de-O, carbon recovery, and energy recovery. These parameters were optimized to achieve high de-O and de-N, producing a SAF sample that met ASTM specification limits for several fuel properties without blending. Future work may explore parametric tuning and catalyst development to promote isomerization during hydrotreating for improved cold flow properties and higher SAF yield. Furthermore, this pathway also demonstrated improved energy and carbon circularity in the U.S. aviation sector, which could be further increased by changing food waste management practices for higher food waste recovery. In all, it was shown that HTL of food waste is a potential pathway to produce drop-in SAF for a decarbonized aviation industry.

HTL biocrude oil

Food waste from a local food processing plant in Champaign, IL was processed in a pilot-scale continuous plug flow HTL reactor at 20 wt% solids content, 300 °C and 12.4 MPa for a 20 min RT23. Prior to hydrotreating, multi-stage pretreating was performed to desalt the biocrude using a water wash at 100 °C for 60 min; dewater according to ASTM D2892 Annex X1; and deash through isolation of fraction <350 °C via distillation39. The physicochemical characterization of the food processing waste feedstock, initial (BC), and pretreated (PT) HTL biocrude oil are in Table S2.

Hydrotreating experiments

Commercial catalyst CoMo/Al2O3 (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used to hydrotreat HTL biocrude oil. First, experiments were completed in triplicate for a Taguchi design L9 orthogonal array (Table S3) to screen the significance of temperature, catalyst-to-oil ratio (cat:oil w/w), RT, and hydrogen load-to-biocrude oxygen ratio (H:O mol:mol). Then, experiments were completed in duplicate using a Box-Behnken design to optimize the parameter levels using response surface methodology (Table S4). Designated amounts of biocrude oil and catalyst were loaded into a 100 ml Series 4590 Micro Stirred Reactor (Parr Instrument Company, IL, USA). The reactor was purged to remove air, pressurized with hydrogen, then heated to desired reaction conditions with a stir rate of 350 rpm throughout the RT. After completion of the hydrotreating reaction, the reactor was quenched with water to cool. The oil and aqueous phases were collected in a pre-weighed container and separated by centrifugation. The catalyst and char products were collected separately, rinsed with DCM, and vacuum filtered. The gaseous phase was sampled in a gas bag (Sigma-Aldrich) for analysis. The reactor was rinsed with DCM to recover any residual oil, char, or catalyst. The DCM evaporated overnight at 60 °C and the final oil and char mass was recorded. The oil recovered from the solvent rinse was not analyzed. A commercial Jet-A sample was obtained from Willard Airport at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Savoy, IL, USA).

The mass yields, carbon recovery, and energy recovery were calculated according to Eqs. 1–3, respectively.

$${m}_{x}=\frac{{m}_{x}}{{m}_{b}}\times 100\%$$

(1)

$${C}_{r}=\frac{{C}_{o}}{{C}_{b}}\times {m}_{o}\times 100\%$$

(2)

$${E}_{r}=\frac{{{HHV}}_{o}}{{{HHV}}_{b}}\times {m}_{o}\times 100\%$$

(3)

where m = mass of product, x = product type (o = oil, w = water, g = gas, c = char, b = biocrude), C = carbon content (r = recovered), Er = energy recovery, and HHV = higher heating value. Oil and aqueous products were directly measured, while char was calculated by subtracting catalyst mass from the collected solids product, and gas was calculated by difference.

Heteroatom removal (de-X) was calculated based on the elemental composition of the HTL biocrude (Eq. 4):

$${de}-X=1-\frac{{X}_{{\mathrm{final}}}}{{X}_{{\mathrm{initial}}}}$$

(4)

where X = heteroatom element (ex. oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), or sulfur (S)), Xfinal = content in the upgraded biocrude, and Xinitial = content in the initial HTL biocrude.

Analytical methods

CE440 CHN analyzer (Exeter Analytical, Coventry, UK) was used to determine the elemental composition (carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen content). Triplicate measurements were taken from each sample, where tins were cold-weld shut prior to purging to minimize loss of volatiles. Due to the presence of air in the sample, nitrogen content was recalculated based on a blank. The detection limit was 0.10% for all elements. Oxygen was determined by difference. A PerkinElmer ICP-MS (Model NexION 350D) was used to measure sulfur content. Due to sample volume limitations, this was performed once per sample. Dulong’s formula54 (Eq. 5) was used to calculate the higher heating value (HHV).

$${HHV}\,\left({{\mathrm{MJ}}}/{\mathrm{kg}}\right)=0.3516\,{{C}}+1.16225\,{{H}}-0.1109\,{{O}}+0.0628\,{{N}}$$

(5)

The weight loss curves and boiling point distribution were determined with a Q50 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) (TA Instruments, DE, USA). 15 mg of sample was heated from 20 to 600 °C at 20 °C/min and nitrogen flow rate of 60 mL/min. The temperatures for boiling point ranges were selected based on literature55. It is important to note that thermal degradation may occur due to atmospheric conditions during TGA, making boiling points less accurate. The total acid number (TAN) was determined according to ASTM D974, in which oil sample dissolved in a solution of toluene, 2-propanol, and water was titrated with phenolphthalein indicator and 0.1 M KOH56. Chemical composition was determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using a Micromass 70-VSE (Waters Corporation, MA, USA). 2 μL sample injected split mode in a ZB-5MS column. 30–80 °C at 25 °C/min and 2 min hold, then increased to 220 °C at 8 °C/min, then to 280 °C at 25 °C/min. A 70 eV electron ionization voltage was used, scanning from 30 to 800 m/z. Peaks were analyzed using MassLynx Mass Spectrometry Software according to the NIST08 Mass Spectral Database57.

The jet fuel cut (150–230 °C) of hydrotreated HTL biocrude oil from this work was characterized using Tier α tests as a precursor to ASTM D4054 evaluation. Viability of the SAF candidate was prescreened by comparing its chemical composition, distillation, and fuel properties to conventional jet fuel and ASTM D7566 specifications. Specifically, a 2D-GC method developed by the Heyne group at Washington State University was used to determine the hydrocarbon type and distribution, a distillation curve was obtained from the 2D-GC data to show ASTM D86 results, and the 2D-GC results were used to predict jet fuel properties37,38,42.

The circularity index (CI, Eq. 6) of the system was calculated according to methods previously described48:

SAF is essentially lab-grown jet fuel, made from carbon already in the environment, rather than pumped up from oil wells.
It will account for just 0.7% of all jet fuel in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association.
In 2010, LanzaTech and the U.S. Department of Energy started collaborating on technology to transform ethanol into jet fuel.
“You’re not getting a ton of greenhouse gas savings relative to just using [traditional] jet fuel,” he says.","A first-of-its-kind refinery has been in the works for a decade and half. Set to be completed this year, the facility is design to produce climate-friendly jet fuel, a material in increasing demand in response to climate commitments and regulations around the world. The refinery—called the Freedom Pines Fuels—was designed to showcase new methods of producing the fuel, and was receiving government support to help clean up air travel.

Now, a year behind schedule due to a hurricane and equipment glitches, the project hit another roadblock this summer, when a major shift in U.S. energy policy under the new administration threw a wrench into the business model. It’s now a story of a company quickly adapting under pressure, and an illustration of the challenges—and continued opportunity—of clean energy in a more hostile political environment.

The goal of the company behind the project, Illinois-based LanzaJet, is to produce a close facsimile of the kerosene-based fuel that powers jets and many helicopters and propeller planes today—without using petroleum. Instead, the Freedom Pines Fuels plant in the forest hamlet of Soperton, Georgia, will use ethanol to make what’s known as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. LanzaJet was ready to start with ethanol made from Brazilian sugarcane, until a new U.S. law forced a quick shift to midwestern corn.

The fuels that make modern travel possible—kerosene, gasoline, and diesel—are typically refined from crude oil, rich in hydrocarbon molecules that release copious energy when burned. But burning them also inundates the atmosphere with heat-trapping carbon dioxide.

SAF is essentially lab-grown jet fuel, made from carbon already in the environment, rather than pumped up from oil wells. It’s a tweaked formulation—for instance, with less sulfur—designed to burn cleaner. Sugarcane and corn are two of many possible carbon sources, along with cornstalks, twigs, vegetable oil, factory exhaust, and even garbage. The CO2 released by making and burning SAF should, in theory, be offset by the carbon captured to make more SAF, forming a closed loop.

The Freedom Pines Fuels plant is a mini version of a typical refinery, slated to produce nine million gallons of SAF and a million of green diesel fuel in its first year. (A standard crude-oil refinery could churn a billion or more gallons of fuels.)

But the Georgia plant is meant to be big enough to show the technology can work at scale. “Most process technology companies . . . almost never build plants of this magnitude,” says Jimmy Samartzis, a climate-focused airline industry veteran who became CEO when LanzaJet was founded in 2020. “It’s expensive, it’s big. But we thought and felt—accurately, looking back on it today—it was the right move to make.” Before the 2024 election, the federal government was also promising generous financial support for Freedom Pines.

A Potential Market Boom

LanzaJet is backed by companies that are counting on, or stand to benefit from, the shift to carbon-neutral jet fuel, including All Nippon Airways, British Airways, Southwest Airlines, and plane maker Airbus.

The UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has committed the industry to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In addition, laws and regulations, such as in Singapore, the U.K., and the European Union, have started requiring airlines or suppliers to blend SAF into the jet fuel supply, beginning at around 1–2%, then ramping up in later years. More such requirements are in the works in India, Indonesia, and Japan. The European Union is by far the most ambitious. From a mere 2% SAF blend required today, quotas rise steeply about every five years, hitting 70% in 2050.

There’s further demand from companies, such as LanzaJet backer Microsoft, striving to meet aggressive greenhouse gas reduction goals. In addition to reducing its own footprint, Microsoft has announced plans to buy “SAF Certificates,” which subsidize the cost of the fuel to boost its usage. SAF has a long way to go in making a dent. It will account for just 0.7% of all jet fuel in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association.

“Obviously, if you look at the size of the overall aviation fuel space, in theory the [SAF] market is potentially huge for those that can offer a product at a competitive price,” says John MacDonagh, senior research analyst at capital markets research firm PitchBook.

LanzaJet has raised “approximately” $400 million, according to Samartzis, from these companies and other backers, including energy producers Shell and Suncor, the U.S. Department of Energy, airport operator Groupe ADP, and Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy fund.

Another backer is LanzaTech. Founded in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2005, it relocated its headquarters to Skokie, Illinois, in 2014. The company has engineered microbes to convert waste such as carbon monoxide and dioxide from factories into ethanol, as another route to carbon-neutral fuel and other chemicals. In 2010, LanzaTech and the U.S. Department of Energy started collaborating on technology to transform ethanol into jet fuel. In 2020, LanzaTech spun out LanzaJet as a new company to continue the work.

LanzaJet is dipping a toe into the SAF market with Freedom Pines, with plans to build more plants, such as a collaboration with British Airways to open a facility in the U.K. by 2028. LanzaJet has also announced partnerships in India, Japan, and Kazakhstan to build additional facilities. But as it continues to announce expansion overseas, things have gotten messy back at home.

SAF Meets MAGA

The U.S. has no SAF requirements for aviation companies. Instead, the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act introduced tax credits to subsidize fledgling SAF operations to scale up production and bring down prices. (Various estimates put SAF from two to five times as expensive as traditional jet fuel.) While the Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act didn’t scrap SAF incentives completely, as it did for many other clean technologies, it did complicate LanzaJet’s plans just as it was completing the Freedom Pines plant.

LanzaJet had obtained EPA approval to use traditional ethanol to make its fuel. The company was focused on Brazilian sugarcane, which Samartzis says would cut CO2 emissions by more than the 50% threshold to qualify for credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. The new Republican legislation cut maximum subsidies from $1.75 to $1 per gallon—and limited them to fuels made with resources from the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

So LanzaJet has shifted focus to ethanol made from U.S. corn, which is more carbon intensive, for a number of reasons, says Samartzis. Sugarcane tends to have higher yields per acre, with less fertilizer, according to LanzJet, and of course it provides sugar that can be fermented directly into ethanol. Corn provides starch that first has to be converted to sugar, which takes energy. Brazilian ethanol producers also make use of crop leftovers, burning them to provide energy for their operations. U.S. producers often use natural gas or even coal.

Given all that, using corn won’t cut overall greenhouse gas emissions anywhere near the 50% target, without longer-term changes such as more sustainable farming practices and capturing the carbon released in making the ethanol, he says.

Despite all these challenges, Samartzis says that Freedom Pines will start churning out fuel soon. “Yeah, I’ve faltered in the past, right?”, he says with a chuckle. “But my expectation is that it’s certainly this year . . . How soon? I don’t want to speculate on that at this point.”

Meanwhile, LanzaJet has to compete with an established technology, called HEFA, that is already making jet fuel from fats such as used cooking oil. “Most [SAF demand] right now can be met, or all of it initially can be met, with the HEFA fuels that are less costly to produce,” says Andy Navarrete, coauthor of a recent study on sustainable aviation fuel by the International Council on Clean Transportation.

A New Starting Point

However, HEFA can’t scale up for the boom in demand coming in the next decades, he says, without turning to environmentally destructive options like clearing land for palm oil plantations. Navarrete is also circumspect about corn ethanol. “You’re not getting a ton of greenhouse gas savings relative to just using [traditional] jet fuel,” he says.

“And then there’s this bigger question of food versus fuel. And how sustainable is it, in general, to be using farmland to produce a fuel?”

Samartzis cites USDA estimates of U.S. ethanol supplies exceeding domestic demand and frames SAF as a new market for American farmers. But beyond corn and sugarcane, there can be bigger climate benefits in making ethanol from the cellulose in agricultural leftovers—like corn stalks, leaves, husks, and cobs—that might otherwise release CO2 when they rot.

This approach was always part of LanzaJet’s strategy, and it had already submitted its plan to the EPA for approval. (The U.K. plant is meant to begin operations with this “cellulosic” ethanol when it opens in 2028.) But U.S. politics are creating another roadblock. “All of these things take time, and with the government shutdown on top of it, rest assured, those processes are not moving forward right now,” says Samartzis.

Navarrete is skeptical, noting that makers of green auto fuels also foresaw a progression to using cellulose from agricultural waste. “It relied on a completely different set of technologies . . . that never quite got figured out,” he says. “[Starting with] conventional ethanol wasn’t really a useful bridge forward.”

Technology has progressed since then, with new incentives to fill the growing SAF market. Samartzis remains optimistic about a transition for the longer term. “Maybe it’s a 10 or 20% improvement rather than a 50 or 60 or 70% improvement,” he says of initial CO2 reductions using corn ethanol. “We can start to capture the improvement and then continue to invest in the changes that are required to further improve that carbon [reduction] intensity.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/10/p-1-91427868-headline-green-jet-fuel-maker-lanzajet-reroutes-for-the-trump-era.jpg",N,,2025-10-30 06:00:57.187689

SAFCo will help Singapore meet its goal for sustainable fuel to account for 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030, CAAS said in a statement.

Director-general of CAAS Han Kok Juan, who will chair SAFCo, told journalists at a media conference that the company will bring together stakeholders such as airlines, fuel producers and carbon market platforms to “get them organised”, which could indirectly lower fuel costs.

“If we have an aggregated and a more efficient way of procuring sustainable aviation fuel, we are able to send a stronger demand signal to producers,” he said.

“That would hopefully stimulate investments and production, and therefore have a dampening effect on prices.”

Last year, CAAS estimated that sustainable aviation fuel costs around three to five times more than conventional jet fuel.

Former global head of marketing and sustainability at Shell Low Carbon Solutions, Ms Tan Seow Hui, has been appointed SAFCo’s chief executive officer.

Responding to a question about how SAFCo’s approach differs from current procurement practices, she said the company allows for purchasing at a greater scale.

“(SAFCo) will give us a certain scale in terms of the ability to anchor longer term and bigger contracts, give us the ability to negotiate for more competitive prices versus any individual airline or companies are able to do so,” she said.

PROCUREMENT AND FUNDING MODEL

Mr Han said procurement, targeted to begin in 2026, will be carried out through a “transparent, competitive tender process” involving suppliers that meet international sustainability standards.

SAFCo has begun engaging businesses and airlines interested in the procurement mechanism, with discussions ongoing.

In its first year, the company plans to hire about 10 staff members, with headcount to be “gauged and sized accordingly thereafter”. It is also in the process of looking for office premises. Initial startup costs will be fully funded by CAAS.

The establishment of SAFCo follows the recent passage of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, which empowers CAAS to collect a sustainable aviation fuel levy and appoint a central procurement entity.

TARGET NOT A MANDATE

Mr Han emphasised that the 1 per cent target is not a mandate, and that the actual proportion could be higher or lower depending on market prices.

He said SAFCo will adopt a “fixed cost envelope approach”, meaning it will spend a predetermined amount on sustainable aviation fuel regardless of prevailing prices.

“If tomorrow, the price of coffee increases, I will still spend S$2. What it means is that I don’t drink a full cup, I drink a bit less than a full cup.”

Similarly, while the target is 1 per cent, the actual proportion will depend on sustainable aviation fuel prices at the time of procurement.

“This is very different from a system where ‘I want to buy a cup of coffee regardless of what the price of coffee is’,” Mr Han said, adding that the approach is designed to manage volatility.

“The market is still very nascent, the price is volatile … we want to be able to cap our exposure for the entire aviation ecosystem.”","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--H8i01_Ql--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/10/30/llt_7947_2.jpg?itok=8MNBFRaX",N,,2025-10-30 05:00:51.858456

The non-profit company will be wholly owned by CAAS, with Tan Seow Hui – who previously worked on low-carbon solutions at Shell – as chief executive. CAAS director-general Han Kok Juan will be on its board.

The central procurement of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by SAFCo will give airlines operating to and from Singapore the ability to negotiate as an aggregate, instead of as individual companies, said CAAS. This will help the company secure a more stable quantity and price amid “relatively volatile” prices.

SAFCo will supply the fuel to Changi and Seletar airports and will “support the implementation of Singapore’s national SAF policy”, CAAS said on Thursday (Oct 30).

Such central procurement is novel in aviation, and CAAS said it has shared the concept with the International Civil Aviation Organization.

SAFCo’s initial costs will be fully funded by CAAS and its office premises are currently being identified.

CAAS pointed out that its “fixed cost envelope” approach means that only funds collected by the mandatory levy on sustainable aviation fuel will be used to procure the fuel. Therefore, the quantity of fuel purchased can vary depending on the price at the time of purchase.

The sustainable aviation fuel levy must be paid to CAAS for all outbound passenger and cargo flights per passenger based on distance. In 2024, CAAS gave some examples: A direct economy-class flight from Singapore would be S$3 to Bangkok, S$6 to Tokyo and S$16 to London. The fees will be higher for more premium seat classes.

CAAS will collect the levy from air transport users, including airlines, business and general aviation users, before disbursing the monies to SAFCo.

The company will then aggregate the mandatory and voluntary demand, based on a sustainable aviation fuel registry, through a “transparent” and “competitive” tender process involving both local and foreign suppliers. The fuel will then be delivered to customers at Changi and Seletar airports.

“With predictable cash flows from the SAF levy, SAFCo can sign longer and larger contracts with SAF suppliers, providing demand certainty in a still-nascent SAF market,” said CAAS.

With the aim to build an integrated demand market for such fuel, CAAS said SAFCo will be reaching out to airlines and businesses to encourage partnerships with the company. More details are expected at the Singapore Airshow in February 2026.

Han said: “Through SAFCo, we want to get the best value for the SAF levy collected and activate a SAF ecosystem which will help advance sustainable aviation and create new economic opportunities for Singapore and beyond.”

He said there was “very, very strong interest” from airlines and businesses around voluntary sustainable aviation fuel purchases, but declined to comment on individual names.

Singapore aims to have sustainable fuel comprise 1 per cent of all the fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026. The target will rise to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Sustainable aviation fuel is created from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, fat waste and non-food crops. This is unlike conventional aviation fuel, which is made from fossil fuels.

CAAS said SAFCo’s immediate focus will be on establishing robust governance and procurement frameworks, as well as setting up levy collection systems and process to build manpower and procurement capability.

This comes about two weeks after

Parliament passed a Bill

allowing Singapore to collect a fixed levy on all departing flights to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel by airlines.

The target is for such fuel to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, with the goal raised to 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030. Sustainable aviation fuel is mostly made from waste materials, such as used cooking oil.

Travellers flying out of Singapore will pay a sustainable aviation fuel levy from 2026, which SAFCo will use to buy the fuel needed to meet the target.

CAAS wholly owns SAFCo, with the authority’s director-general Han Kok Juan chairing SAFCo’s board.

Ms Tan Seow Hui, a veteran in the energy and aviation industries, has been appointed chief executive of SAFCo.

Early CAAS estimates suggested that economy-class passengers may incur a $3 levy for short-haul flights, $6 for medium-haul flights and $16 for long-haul flights. Short-haul flights include routes to places such as Bangkok, medium haul to destinations like Tokyo, and long haul to cities such as London.

More details about the levy, including the confirmed amounts, will be announced by end-2025, CAAS said.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been deemed the most practical way to decarbonise the aviation industry, as it can be blended with jet fuel and used on existing aircraft and refuelling infrastructure without costly modifications.

At a press conference on Oct 30, Mr Han and Ms Tan said SAFCo will centrally procure the fuel based on the levy collected. The money will be collected into a central pool, which SAFCo will use to buy the fuel.

Ms Tan said SAFCo’s immediate priorities are to establish strong governance and procurement frameworks, set up levy collection systems and processes and build its team and procurement capability.

It will have a team of 10 in its first year.

The company will also engage parties such as airlines and cargo operators ahead of the first procurement round in 2026, she said.

Beyond using the levy to buy the fuel, the company will also pool voluntary demand from organisations that seek to purchase sustainable jet fuel to reduce their corporate air travel or supply chain carbon footprint, Mr Han added.

Aggregating demand for the fuel and centralising procurement will help the company to secure longer-term contracts and allow it to negotiate more competitive prices, compared with individual buyers, Ms Tan noted.

The cost of sustainable aviation fuel is among the major barriers that have limited its widespread adoption. Green jet fuel costs about three to four times more than traditional jet fuel.

This manner of procurement will send a stronger demand signal to producers of sustainable jet fuel, Mr Han said. “That will, hopefully, stimulate sustainable aviation fuel investments and production, and… have a dampening effect on prices.”

He said the procurement of sustainable aviation fuel would be done through a transparent, competitive tender process that meets international sustainability standards.

Green jet fuel prices are relatively volatile because of supply and demand conditions, which is why Singapore has adopted a fixed levy approach, Mr Han said. A fixed levy amount will allow SAFCo to estimate how much sustainable aviation fuel it can afford to buy, given fluctuating prices.

This method will allow “certainty and stability, and we actually cap the cost of sustainable aviation fuel adoption for the entire aviation ecosystem”, Mr Han noted.

SAFCo will “help to encourage sustainable aviation fuel production through clear demand signals, while ensuring that costs remain contained, predictable and fairly shared,” he added.

“(This will) allow us to meet our environmental responsibilities, while safeguarding the competitiveness of our air hub.”

CAAS chief sustainability officer Daniel Ng had said earlier in October that if market conditions are not ideal, the

1 per cent target in 2026 may not be met

, which the authorities are prepared for.

“Our approach is one where we pay what we can afford. We are not planning to be sustainable at all cost because the sustainable aviation fuel market is still very small. The price fluctuations are quite dramatic sometimes,” he noted.

Under Singapore’s sustainable air hub blueprint, launched in February 2024, Singapore will work with the aviation industry to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20 per cent from 2019 levels in 2030 and achieve net-zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/504ab20a411f6b33148f76654cc43b2a9dccb82402c5be32d04ec08585288bb6,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:04.386891

The fund was established in 2020 as part of Microsoft's wider sustainability initiative to become a carbon-negative, water-positive and zero-waste company by 2030.

The US$1 billion CIF was created to accelerate the development and use of new climate technologies through both equity and debt capital.

In its five-year progress report, Microsoft stated its core belief that its business thrives when the world thrives.

When launching the fund, Microsoft had to support innovations that were not yet fully developed.

Melanie Nakagawa, Microsoft Chief Sustainability Officer, explained the necessity of this approach, saying: “Big goals need bold bets. When we launched Microsoft’s US$1bn Climate Innovation Fund in 2020, we knew the road to reaching our ambitious sustainability goals would need to be paved in part with new and innovative solutions. We needed to invest in technologies that weren't yet at commercial scale or in some cases didn’t yet exist.”

Catalytic capital and market growth

The initial hope was that these early-stage investments would generate wider interest and build momentum for scaling necessary climate solutions. According to Melanie, this is now becoming a reality.

“We’ve allocated more than US$800 million to date across 67 portfolio investors. On average, every dollar we’ve invested has attracted 15 more catalysing billions in follow-on funding. This kind of multiplier effect is helping move markets and scale innovation,” she says.

Melanie adds: “From carbon removal and recycling innovation to low-carbon building materials and sustainable aviation fuel, we’re helping turn bold ideas into tangible solutions.”

The report identifies five key conclusions that guide its ongoing strategy. These include pushing the frontiers of technology, bridging the gap to mainstream capital, delivering catalytic impact and partnering to amplify its efforts.

One example of the fund's impact is its investment in Twelve, a company using electrochemical technology to convert captured CO2 and water into synthetic fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

CIF’s investment supported the expansion of Twelve's facility in Moses Lake, Washington and resulted in a SAF offtake agreement for Microsoft.

This partnership with Alaska Airlines introduced a book-and-claim model for SAF procurement, enabling Microsoft to report lower emissions from its business travel without needing direct physical delivery of the fuel.

Following this initial support, Twelve secured an additional US$645 million in follow-on funding.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/6083205b43c0a133519ed8887b4ac715:c6d45ffc2ca0875e041aff32fc28a185/melanie-nakagawa-cso-at-microsoft-speaking-at-websummit-2023.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:09.014977

Even if all current, under-development, and announced projects operate at full capacity, AJF production would cover only about 5% of global jet fuel demand and less than half of the projected growth in total consumption.

The analysis highlights that high costs, limited sustainable feedstocks, and weak bankability will constrain AJF’s impact in the coming decade.

Seven Barriers to Scaling AJF

Carbon Tracker identifies seven structural hurdles limiting the scale-up of AJF. The first four apply to all types of alternative jet fuels, while the last three specifically affect truly sustainable options:

Costs and price premiums – AJF is more expensive than fossil jet fuel, reducing demand and slowing adoption.

Regulatory uncertainty – Fragmented rules across jurisdictions hinder market growth.

Lack of long-term offtake commitments – Limited long-term agreements reduce revenue visibility for producers.

Weak bankability – Technology, feedstock, and policy risks make financing new AJF projects difficult.

Feedstock availability – Sustainable wastes and residues are scarce and challenging to collect.

Feedstock sustainability – Lifecycle emissions, land-use impacts, and biodiversity concerns restrict eligible supply.

Opportunity costs – Scarce sustainable feedstocks might achieve greater emission reductions in other sectors where mitigation is faster or cheaper.

Saidrasul Ashrafkhanov, Carbon Tracker analyst and lead report author, said:

“Beyond high costs, hesitant offtakers, and financing barriers, many alternative jet fuels also carry environmental downsides. While AJF could play a larger role in decarbonising aviation in the future, the industry must demonstrate a pathway to fuels that are truly sustainable, abundant, and feasible.”

The Need for Policy Coherence

Despite numerous support schemes, investors and environmental outcomes are not seeing clear results. Rich Collett-White, Carbon Tracker energy analyst and co-author, explained:

“A confusing mix of policies aimed at scaling alternative jet fuels, with differing definitions and eligibility rules across regions, is creating uncertainty. Consistent regulations are essential to prioritise fuels with strong environmental integrity and avoid unintended consequences.”

Short-Haul Offers Faster Gains

Significant emission reductions may be achievable sooner on short-haul routes. Nearly half of all flights cover less than 270 nautical miles (500 km). Battery-electric and hybrid-electric aircraft carrying 5–100 passengers are nearing entry into service, offering a direct route to zero-emission operations on regional legs. Hydrogen-electric aircraft could extend medium-haul operations from the mid-2030s.

This presents a clearer near-term investment opportunity while preserving scarce sustainable AJF for long-haul flights. However, funding for new-propulsion aircraft remains low compared with AJF investments.

Right-Sizing AJF’s Role

AJF will remain important for long-haul decarbonisation, where batteries cannot match the range or payload of conventional aircraft, but its role is smaller than often assumed. Carbon Tracker recommends a pragmatic, portfolio-based approach:

Manage AJF expectations – Focus on pathways with strong sustainability credentials and predictable costs, avoiding options with poor lifecycle performance or food-security risks.

Support zero-emission short-haul – Invest in battery-electric, hydrogen-electric, and hybrid-electric aircraft for sub-500 km routes, where readiness is advancing fastest.

Design smarter policy and finance – Strengthen sustainability criteria, implement revenue-certainty mechanisms, and reward genuine emissions reductions.

Bottom Line

AJF is part of the solution but not the silver bullet. Treating it as the main avenue for emission reductions risks misallocating capital and consuming finite feedstocks without significantly reducing fossil jet fuel use this decade. A balanced strategy—accelerating zero-emission aircraft on short-haul routes, conserving sustainable AJF for long-haul, and aligning policy with climate goals—offers a faster, more cost-effective, and credible path to decarbonising aviation.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:15.625583

This follows the launch of Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), a government-owned non-profit company that will oversee the acquisition and distribution of SAF, as well as implementation of the country’s SAF policies.

To fund the procurement of SAF, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will also be implementing a SAF levy on all departing travellers from 2026. The levy, first announced in 2024, will also cover cargo flights, as well as business and general aviation passengers.

CAAS says details of the levy – including its quantum and roll-out date – will be announced later. It is expected the levy will be rolled out first before SAFCo begins procuring SAF.

The agency gave examples in 2024 on how much the levy could cost: an economy-class passenger flying to Bangkok could pay S$3 ($2.31), while those flying to London could pay S$16.

The funds collected will be managed by CAAS, then disbursed to SAFCo, which will source the SAF “through a transparent competitive tender process…that meet international sustainability standards like CORSIA”.

CAAS director general Han Kok Juan, who speaking at a briefing on 30 October, says the “centralised pool” of funds means there is “predictable cash flow”, which allows SAFCo to “go into longer-term competitive price agreements to secure a more stable and more affordable SAF supply”.

On top of the mandatory levy, SAFCo will also roll out a scalable voluntary demand programme” for SAF and SAF Environmental Attributes. These will involve businesses and airlines looking to voluntarily purchase SAF, and CAAS confirms it is already in talks with a few businesses on the voluntary programme.

CAAS’ Han says Singapore supports SAF adoption through a “pragmatic and balanced approach calibrated to our own circumstances”.

For instance, the procurement of SAF will be done with a fixed-cost envelopment model, where the SAF levy – and the central funds – will be a fixed rate regardless of the price of SAF.

Adds Han: “It helps to encourage self-production, to send clear demand signals while ensuring that costs remain contained, predictable and fairly shared.

Artificial intelligence (AI) Automation and digital aviation will also play a crucial role in modern airports and the future of aviation.","The aviation sector is a driving force in the current globalised society. Every day, airports see hundreds of flights, and the European airspace is busier than ever. According to aviation professionals and stakeholders, the industry must innovate quickly, not only in its sustainable practices but also in terms of digitising airport processes and streamlining the passenger experience.

Tourism growth

“The summer of 2025 saw an average of 35,000 flights per day across the European network, which is one per cent higher than the pre-pandemic levels of 2019,” highlighted Tânia Cardoso Simões, Director Aviation Transformation at EUROCONTROL, during the Global Tourism Forum (GTF) that took place in Brussels last 20-21 October.

Simões noted that, according to EUROCONTROL’’s latest report, the European airspace is expected to handle around 11 million flights by the end of 2025. The figure is projected to rise further in 2026, reaching approximately 11.4 million flights. By 2031, Eurocontrol anticipates around 12.4 million flights across the continent.

Moreover, according to Eurostat, overnight stays in EU tourist accommodation reached 1,279 million in the first half of 2025, marking a 2.3 per cent rise from the 1,249 million recorded during the same period in 2024. Foreign visitors accounted for almost half of the overnight stays, with Malta, Cyprus, and Croatia recording the highest overnight stays.

Airport infrastructure and hospitality

To handle the growing number of passengers and tourists and the pressure on aviation staff, the industry needs transformative changes. One way to do this, according to Paul Griffiths, CEO of Dubai Airports, is to “merge check-in, immigration, and security into one seamless process.” This would not only improve airport capacity, said Griffiths, but also improve passenger purchasing. “If you have gone through the check-in a few minutes, then you are going to be far more predisposed to spend money,” Griffiths noted with humour. Such a move would help airports achieve better financial sustainability.

Besides airport infrastructure, hospitality also has to improve in order to provide travellers with a better customer experience. Regardless of the technological advancements of the 21st century, human interaction and experience are what make a difference for regular flyers. “If people are trained properly, we can be a genuine hospitality experience,” remarked Griffiths. “We need to communicate with travellers on an individual basis and to make absolutely sure we are reassuring them.”

Sustainability Aviation Fuel

With thousands of daily flights, cutting emissions is one of aviation’s top priorities, making the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). SAF, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), is a fuel used in commercial aviation that reduces carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent. It can be produced from various sources such as waste oil and fats, green and municipal waste, and non-food crops.

Both Griffiths and Simões agree that this is something that should change in the current aviation operations. “We have to incentivise production. Our idea is by 2032 to have sustainable fuel to represent a significant share of aviation’s fuel,” Griffiths explained.

To support SAF development and deployment, in July 2025, the aviation industry, represented by DESTINATION 2050 partners, fuel suppliers, and cargo and express delivery operators released a call for accelerated policy that would help de-risk investment, bridge the cost gap between conventional and sustainable fuel, and create the regulatory and financial conditions needed to scale up the production and deployment of SAF.

Simões not only highlighted the importance of SAF but also added other important components of sustainable flights. She noted that hydrogen combustion and electric batteries can also be utilised for standardising more sustainable aviation operations. Hydrogen combustion in this context works like jet fuel – it is burned to generate thrust.

Hydrogen-powered airplane would emit only water vapour instead of carbon dioxide, but storing hydrogen requires cryogenic tanks capable of maintaining temperatures as low as –253 °C, since hydrogen must remain in a liquid state at such extremes. The tanks require significant space, which would mean the aircraft would have to be redesigned.

Despite these difficulties, Airbus has made publicly available its designs for an electric, hydrogen-powered airplane. Airbus initially indicated that the aircraft was scheduled for its first flight in 2035, but according to new data, this won’t happen until later in the decade.

In the future, airports also need to become greener and energy self-sufficient. Soon, Griffiths pointed out, “every single surface of Dubai Airports will be covered with solar panels.” In this way, airports would be able to produce the necessary energy they need to operate independently.

Artificial intelligence (AI)

Automation and digital aviation will also play a crucial role in modern airports and the future of aviation. Currently, in the United Arab Emirates, AI is used when an aircraft arrives at an airport gate, according to Frederico Fernandes, CEO of WIZE. Fernandes explained that the technology monitors the different teams working around the plane – refuelling, baggage, maintenance, security, and boarding. He also added that AI identifies what is happening and helps the operations centre manage everything in real time.

Moreover, AI has also been deployed for luggage monitoring, which decreased the number of mishandled luggage in 2024. Another use of the model was piloted in the UK, where London Heathrow Airport tested an AI air traffic system. This aims to support air traffic controllers, while they remain “at the heart of the operation.”

While AI could be used to optimise many processes in the industry, many are still worried about AI taking over human operations. “One of the most important questions I get is whether AI is going to be a pilot. And the answer is simple: absolutely not,” he highlighted.

He explained that rather than replacing pilots, AI can complement them. According to Fernandes, his company is the first in the world to offer students pilot training through an AI-based platform. But he explained that he is also aware that people cannot let a “delusional” AI make decisions.

What might the sky of tomorrow look like?

She envisions a “sky where aircraft fly silently, operating with clean energy, as well as airports that generate more power than they consume and flights that waste neither fuel nor time.”",https://traveltomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/global-tourism-forum_.jpg#159865,N,,2025-10-30 05:01:26.061660

Policy incentives remain crucial

The deployment relies on existing pipeline infrastructure from Neste's SAF terminal facilities in Houston, where neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is blended with conventional jet fuel to meet aviation specifications.

Aviation accounts for a relatively small share of global emissions but is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise, with technological innovation needed across production of low-emission fuels, improvements in aircraft and engines and operational optimisation.

Lauren has acknowledged that her sector is dependence on government support when it comes to decarbonisation.

""While United remains the leading SAF user in the U.S., using over 4,300 metric tons (13 million gallons) last year, we recognize that the growth of the SAF market requires support from both state and federal governments,"" she explains.

""This didn't happen easily or overnight. It took relentless coordination, innovation, and a team that refused to settle for 'good enough.' But we did it — because meaningful change demands action.""

The Growing Need for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Waste to Energy Solutions

The aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Sustainable aviation fuel represents a critical pathway toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from fossil fuels, SAF production utilizes renewable resources to create cleaner alternatives.

The concept of waste to energy has gained significant traction across industries. Agricultural operations, particularly dairy farms, generate enormous amounts of organic waste that traditionally poses disposal challenges. However, this waste contains valuable energy potential in the form of biogas.

Dairy farm biogas emerges from the natural decomposition of manure in waste lagoons. This biogas consists primarily of methane and carbon dioxide—components that can be captured and converted into useful energy products. The challenge has always been developing cost-effective technology to harness this potential.

Traditional SAF production methods often require extensive infrastructure investments and complex supply chains. These barriers have limited widespread adoption, particularly among smaller agricultural operations. The need for innovative technologies that can operate at the farm level has become increasingly apparent.

Renewable fuel production from agricultural waste represents a perfect example of Circular Economy principles. Instead of viewing manure as a waste product requiring disposal, this approach transforms it into a valuable commodity that supports both environmental goals and economic development.

Revolutionary Ouro Reactor Technology for Electric Reforming

Circularity Fuels’ Ouro reactor represents a technological breakthrough in biogas to jet fuel conversion. This compact, electric-powered system can convert raw biogas directly into synthesis gas without requiring combustion or expensive pre-treatment processes.

The Ouro reactor addresses key limitations of conventional reforming systems. Traditional methods require extensive purification of biogas before conversion, adding significant costs and complexity. The electric reforming system operates differently by processing unrefined biogas directly from farm waste lagoons.

This innovative approach eliminates the need for pipeline infrastructure. Farmers can produce synthesis gas on-site and transport it via existing trucking networks. This flexibility removes a major barrier that has prevented many agricultural operations from participating in renewable fuel production.

The Ouro reactor is the first system to electrically convert raw biogas from farm waste lagoons into jet fuel components without combustion, eliminating pre-treatment requirements. This technological advancement enables stable operation despite contaminants that would damage conventional reformers.

The economic impact is substantial. The technology achieves a 100x cost reduction compared to conventional synthesis gas production systems. This dramatic cost improvement makes waste to energy conversion financially viable for farms of various sizes.

Dr. Stephen Beaton, CEO and Founder of Circularity Fuels, explains the significance: “Farmers in the US and around the world are sitting on an untapped gold mine. We are enabling them to turn waste into a profitable product that airlines desperately need. For the first time, farmers will become producers of renewable fuels without waiting for pipeline infrastructure that will never come.”

The reactor’s design facilitates seamless conversion from dairy waste to synthesis gas production. Its plug-and-play functionality allows immediate deployment on farms with standard electrical connections, making adoption straightforward for agricultural operations.

The Complete Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis Process from Dairy Farm Biogas

The conversion of dairy farm biogas to jet fuel follows a carefully orchestrated process. It begins with capturing raw biogas from waste lagoons at dairy farms. Currently, less than 6% of available manure waste is captured, highlighting the enormous untapped potential in this market.

The electric reforming system plays a crucial role in this conversion chain. Unlike traditional reformers that require purified biogas, the Ouro reactor processes unrefined biogas directly. This raw biogas contains methane and carbon dioxide from decomposing manure, along with various contaminants that would normally require expensive removal.

Synthesis gas, also known as syngas, serves as the critical intermediate product. This mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen provides the foundation for producing liquid hydrocarbons. The quality and composition of synthesis gas directly impact the efficiency of subsequent fuel production steps.

Fischer-Tropsch synthesis represents the final conversion stage. This catalytic chemical reaction transforms synthesis gas into liquid hydrocarbons suitable for aviation fuel. The process has been used commercially for decades, providing a proven pathway from biogas to jet fuel.

The entire process from biogas to jet fuel embodies Circular Economy principles. Agricultural waste that previously created disposal challenges becomes a valuable feedstock for renewable fuel production. This transformation creates economic value while reducing environmental impact.

SAF production through this method offers several advantages over conventional approaches. The distributed nature of production reduces transportation costs and infrastructure requirements. Farmers gain new revenue streams while contributing to sustainable aviation fuel supply chains.

The scalability of this approach depends on biogas availability and processing capacity. With over 20,000 large livestock farms in the United States producing nearly 500 million tons of manure annually, the potential supply of raw materials is substantial.

Quality control throughout the conversion process ensures the final product meets aviation fuel specifications. The synthesis gas produced by the Ouro reactor maintains consistent composition, supporting reliable Fischer-Tropsch synthesis outcomes.

Economic and Environmental Benefits of On-Farm SAF Production

The economic advantages of on-farm sustainable aviation fuel production are compelling. The 100x cost reduction achieved by the Ouro reactor compared to conventional synthesis gas production methods dramatically improves project economics. This cost reduction stems from eliminating expensive pre-treatment requirements and simplifying the overall process.

Infrastructure cost savings represent another significant economic benefit. Traditional biogas projects often require extensive pipeline networks to transport gas from farms to processing facilities. The Ouro reactor eliminates this requirement by enabling on-site production and transportation via existing trucking networks.

Farmers gain new revenue streams from waste products that previously represented disposal costs. This transformation from cost center to profit center can significantly impact farm economics. The reliability of aviation fuel demand provides predictable income streams that support long-term planning.

Environmental benefits extend beyond carbon emission reductions. Converting manure waste into renewable fuel prevents methane emissions that would otherwise occur during natural decomposition. Methane is approximately 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, making this conversion particularly valuable.

The technology supports Circular Economy principles by creating closed-loop systems where waste becomes input for valuable products. This approach reduces dependency on fossil fuels while creating sustainable economic models for agricultural operations.

The environmental impact extends to soil and water quality improvements. Proper management of manure through biogas production reduces runoff risks and odor issues associated with traditional lagoon systems. This improvement enhances community relations and environmental stewardship.

Market potential remains largely untapped. With biogas currently captured from less than 6% of available manure waste, significant growth opportunities exist. The combination of environmental benefits and economic incentives creates favorable conditions for widespread adoption.

Sustainable farming practices benefit from this integrated approach. Farmers can demonstrate environmental leadership while improving their economic position. This alignment of environmental and economic goals supports long-term sustainability in agricultural operations.

The broader impact on renewable fuel markets could be substantial. Distributed production from thousands of farms could contribute significantly to sustainable aviation fuel supply, reducing dependency on centralized production facilities and fossil fuel sources.

The Future of Renewable Fuel Production and Industry Impact

Technologies like the Ouro reactor have the potential to reshape the renewable energy landscape fundamentally. By creating decentralized, on-farm fuel production ecosystems, this approach democratizes renewable fuel production and reduces dependency on large-scale industrial facilities.

The aviation industry faces increasing pressure to meet sustainability targets. Sustainable aviation fuel demand is projected to grow exponentially as airlines commit to net-zero emissions goals. Technologies that enable distributed production from agricultural waste could play a crucial role in meeting this demand.

The scalability of cow manure jet fuel production depends on technology adoption rates and infrastructure development. As more farms implement biogas to jet fuel systems, the cumulative impact on renewable fuel supply could be significant. This distributed approach offers resilience benefits compared to centralized production models.

Innovation in waste to energy technologies continues advancing. The success of the Ouro reactor demonstrates the potential for breakthrough technologies to overcome traditional barriers. This progress encourages investment in similar innovations that could expand renewable fuel production capabilities.

The Circular Economy benefits from technologies that create value from waste streams. As cow manure jet fuel production scales, it establishes new economic models where agricultural waste becomes a valuable commodity. This transformation supports sustainable development goals while creating economic opportunities.

Industry partnerships between technology developers, farmers, and airlines could accelerate adoption. These collaborations can provide the financing, technical support, and market access needed for widespread implementation. Strategic partnerships align stakeholder interests around shared sustainability goals.

Regulatory support for renewable fuel production continues evolving. Government incentives and mandates for sustainable aviation fuel create favorable market conditions for technologies like the Ouro reactor. Policy support can accelerate adoption and investment in on-farm fuel production systems.

The long-term vision includes networks of farms producing renewable fuel that supplies regional aviation hubs. This distributed production model could reduce transportation costs and improve supply chain resilience. Local production also supports rural economic development and energy independence.

Research and development efforts focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs further. Continued innovation in electric reforming systems and biogas processing could expand the range of feedstocks and improve economic viability. These advances support broader adoption across diverse agricultural operations.
