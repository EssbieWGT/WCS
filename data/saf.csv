Corporate travel remains essential for global business and connectivity, however aviation accounts for an estimated 2-3% of global CO2 emissions.
For the first time, the 2025 report also incorporates emissions from ATPI’s data centres, reflecting the company’s progress in expanding the scope of its reportable footprint.
To further prioritise internal sustainable initiatives, 48% of the electricity consumed in ATPI’s offices now comes from renewable sources - a 5% increase since the last report.
Louisa Toure, ATPI Group’s Sustainability Officer, said: “This year’s report demonstrates how we continue to evolve, empower and inspire through action.","Travel and events management company ATPI Group, has released its second annual review of its global activities, performance, and outcomes against key Environmental, Social and Governance reporting metrics.

The 2025 Sustainability Report covers off key reportable metrics from the 2024 calendar year, highlights strong progress in ATPI’s carbon reduction efforts.

The company achieved a 25% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, alongside an 11% reduction in total emissions per full-time employee (FTE), from 1.86 tonnes of Co2e in 2023 to 1.65 tonnes in 2024.

During this period, ATPI also introduced an internal carbon price to accelerate its decarbonisation strategy.

This initiative not only helps to drive carbon reduction but also allows ATPI to continually reinvest in decarbonisation and compensation activities. Additionally, the Group compensated 100% of its residual emissions through a diverse portfolio of internationally recognised, high-integrity carbon offset projects.

In 2024, this included investments in new initiatives such as the Biomass Everest Starch Facility in India and the Envira Amazonia REDD+ project in Brazil, alongside a wider range of projects supporting global climate action.

Corporate travel remains essential for global business and connectivity, however aviation accounts for an estimated 2-3% of global CO2 emissions.

Recognising this as a priority sector for decarbonisation, ATPI has invested in 75 tonnes of SAF since the start of this reporting period, representing 5% of ATPI’s business travel emissions from the previous year.

This has been achieved through the company’s partnership with NESTE, the world’s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel. For the first time, the 2025 report also incorporates emissions from ATPI’s data centres, reflecting the company’s progress in expanding the scope of its reportable footprint.

To further prioritise internal sustainable initiatives, 48% of the electricity consumed in ATPI’s offices now comes from renewable sources - a 5% increase since the last report.

ATPI has also accelerated the transition of its company car fleet to electric and hybrid models, with 38% of its vehicles updated, up from 29% in the previous year.

Louisa Toure, ATPI Group’s Sustainability Officer, said: “This year’s report demonstrates how we continue to evolve, empower and inspire through action.

“We’ve reduced our impact, strengthened our culture, and empowered clients to travel more responsibly.

“I’m proud of how our people are driving this momentum, but our ambition doesn’t stop here, we are determined to evolve further and lead the way in shaping the future of sustainable travel.”

ATPI’s social sustainability supports its employees while aligning with the company’s wider goals. To strengthen transparency and accountability, ATPI introduced a new global staff database to enhance reporting, provide greater insights into its workforce, and enable meaningful action.

The report highlights that staff numbers grew by 8%, with women representing 60% and men 40% across the Group’s workforce globally. While the travel industry has been traditionally female-dominated, ATPI is committed to embedding equality of opportunity throughout its culture and organisational structure.

The company also continues to outperform global benchmarks on pay equality. Against an estimated global gender pay gap of 20%, ATPI reports a gap of just 9.9% in favour of males.

Social sustainability also took centre stage in 2024 with the launch of ATPI Inspires, a business-wide initiative focused on volunteering, wellbeing and community engagement. Employees dedicated 1,276 hours to volunteering through the programme, bringing ATPI’s value of “Show your kindness” to life across its global network.

This people-first approach is also reflected in the Group’s Global People Survey, which found that 81% of employees feel they have access to the learning and development needed to do their jobs effectively, 89% believe they clearly understand how their work contributes to ATPI’s broader goals, and 77% have a good understanding of what ATPI’s sustainability programme is trying to achieve.

Ian Sinderson, ATPI Group’s Chief Executive Officer added: “2024 was a dynamic year for ATPI. We continued to grow across the regions, embracing both the challenges and opportunities that come with a rapidly evolving travel landscape.

“As climate-related events such as extreme weather and shifting environmental conditions increasingly impacting travel, ATPI is committed to leading by example and guiding our clients toward smarter, more sustainable choices.”

“Our values shape our behaviour and decision-making, and by staying true to them, we strengthen ATPI’s identity, foster a positive culture, and lay the groundwork for long-term success.”","http://www.travolution.com/dynamic-images/29000-29999/29593/29593_c=(0,71,1000,525)_w=1200_h=630.webp?v=20230522122229",N,,2025-09-05 20:56:10.416453

A recently implemented trade agreement between the U.S. and Japan includes good news for the American ag sector.

The United States-Japan Agreement includes a commitment from Japan to increase its purchases of American agricultural products.

“Specifically, the Government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75 percent increase of United States rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products, in amounts totaling $8 billion per year,” a Sept. 4 White House press release says.

In 2024, the U.S. exported almost $12 billion of agricultural goods to Japan, making it the fifth-largest destination for U.S. farm products.

This trade deal and its implications for U.S. ag has received support from multiple parties.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, for example, called the development a “huge win for America’s farmers & ranchers,” on her X account, adding she’ll be in Japan soon to build on this agreement.

The American Soybean Association (ASA) welcomes the stronger partnership with Japan.

U.S. farmers require market access, which this trade agreement provides, said Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA.

“Reliable agreements like this not only strengthen markets for U.S. soy and keep America’s farm families a priority, but also help our farmers remain competitive in the global marketplace,” he said in a Sept. 5 statement.

In addition, Japan agreed to a 15 percent tariff on car imports into the U.S., and to invest $550 billion in U.S. projects.

It could use its prestige not to give cover to fossil fuel interests, but to lead the charge toward a sustainable future.","For a quarter of a century, Princeton University partnered with one of the world’s biggest oil and gas giants, BP. The alliance poured money into the University’s Carbon Mitigation Initiative (CMI), one of its most prominent climate research programs. On the surface, the deal brought prestige and resources. In reality, critics argue that it delayed the urgent work of phasing out fossil fuels.

Now, the partnership is ending, as reported by The Daily Princetonian. When the current contract expires in 2025, BP will no longer fund CMI. Both sides insist it’s a mutual decision, but the move comes after years of growing criticism, student protests, and investigations that raised serious questions about how fossil fuel companies use academia to protect their business model.

A Deal That Shaped Climate Research

The report further explained: when Princeton struck its deal with BP back in 2000, it was framed as a groundbreaking collaboration. BP’s funding supported research into carbon capture, storage, alternative fuels, and other mitigation strategies.

CMI quickly became one of the University’s flagship institutes, producing influential studies like the Net Zero America report, which mapped possible pathways for the U.S. to achieve net zero by 2050.

Of the five modeled scenarios, four kept fossil fuels in play through mid-century, relying heavily on carbon capture to offset emissions. Critics later pointed out that this conclusion closely mirrored BP’s corporate strategy: continue pumping oil and gas while showcasing carbon capture as a lifeline.

At the time, renewable energy was less developed and more expensive than today. But as wind, solar, geothermal, and battery technologies advanced rapidly, the wisdom of pouring billions into carbon capture began to look like a stalling tactic.

Prestige for BP, Problems for Princeton

For BP, the partnership was a communications jackpot. Having Princeton’s name attached to its climate efforts gave the company a veneer of credibility, even as it expanded drilling and exploration. Internal communications later revealed how BP staff highlighted Princeton’s research to bolster its case for carbon capture and hydrogen in U.S. policy circles.

For Princeton, the financial support was significant, but the cost was reputational. As the climate crisis worsened, the University found itself increasingly criticized for giving BP legitimacy. By 2022, Princeton announced it would divest from fossil fuels, yet the BP relationship remained—an uncomfortable contradiction for a campus under growing activist pressure.

Net Zero: Whose Roadmap?

The partnership’s most contested legacy is the Net Zero America report. Funded by BP and Exxon, the study leaned heavily on carbon capture and fossil fuels. Just five months later, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued its own net-zero roadmap, independent of fossil fuel influence.

The IEA’s message was blunt: no new investments in fossil fuel projects could be made if the world hoped to stay within 1.5°C of warming. The sharp contrast between Princeton’s BP-backed report and the IEA’s independent findings laid bare the risks of corporate-funded science.

Investigations Pull Back the Curtain

The true extent of BP’s influence came into sharper focus in 2024. A congressional investigation concluded that BP leveraged its Princeton ties to promote policies that aligned with its long-term strategy rather than committing to large-scale renewable investments.

The investigation found that BP not only shaped the narrative around carbon capture but also used the partnership to influence how energy and emissions policies were discussed in Washington. For student groups like Sunrise Princeton and Divest Princeton, this confirmed what they had warned for years: the partnership was less about science and more about extending the fossil fuel era.

Is Fossil Fuel Money Too Toxic for Academia?

Princeton is hardly alone. We discovered that a 2023 report by Data for Progress and Fossil Free Research revealed that fossil fuel companies funneled more than $675 million into 27 U.S. universities between 2010 and 2020. The University of California, Berkeley topped the list with $154 million, followed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ($108 million) and George Mason University ($64 million).

The debate over whether universities should accept fossil fuel funding is complex. Supporters argue that oil and gas companies bring valuable expertise, particularly in areas like carbon storage, green hydrogen, or sustainable aviation fuel. They say tapping into that knowledge can accelerate decarbonization.

Critics counter that these partnerships are inherently compromised. Any research tied to fossil fuel dollars risks being skewed toward preserving oil and gas interests. The history of tobacco industry funding of medical research is often cited as a warning: money from industries whose business models depend on harmful practices should not dictate academic inquiry.

What’s clear is that fossil fuel money buys more than just lab equipment—it buys influence, legitimacy, and access to future policymakers. That’s a trade-off many now say is too high a price to pay.

From Princeton to Harvard: BP’s Quiet Academic Powerplay

BP’s influence extended beyond Princeton. Documents show the company paid between $2.1 million and $2.6 million to CMI between 2012 and 2017. It also funded programs at Harvard and Tufts, contributing hundreds of thousands annually to policy-focused research. Harvard’s Kennedy School and Tufts’s Fletcher School, both heavily tied to government policymaking, received funds earmarked for climate policy labs.

The report noted that these partnerships gave BP access not just to research, but also to future policymakers—a revolving door that helped the company shape long-term political outcomes.

Princeton’s Climate Work Seeks New Lifelines

The end of BP’s sponsorship comes as Princeton faces broader challenges in securing climate research funding. In mid-2024, the U.S. Department of Commerce cut $4 million earmarked for University climate programs, claiming they no longer aligned with federal priorities.

Professor Stephen Pacala, CMI’s director, acknowledged that the termination of BP’s support will reduce funding for some projects and end the annual BP-Princeton conference, but he emphasized that the work will continue with other backers. Professor Jonathan Levine, a lead investigator, echoed that sentiment, noting that the research pillars will remain intact but under new funding models.

Student Demands for Real Leadership

With BP now stepping back, Princeton students and climate activists see an opening for change. Divest Princeton has called on the University to:

Cut all ties with fossil fuel companies.

Offer pension plans free of fossil fuel exposure.

Introduce an undergraduate climate crisis course requirement.

Make campus operations a model of sustainability, from dining halls to reunions.

Acknowledge and address harms inflicted on frontline communities impacted by fossil fuels.

To them, Princeton has lagged on sustainability, and its long partnership with BP represents decades of lost opportunity. Instead of backing bold renewable solutions already proven at scale—solar, wind, geothermal, and battery storage—Princeton, they argue, gave BP the cover it needed to keep selling fossil fuels.

A Chance for Princeton to Reset

The end of Princeton’s BP partnership represents more than just the expiration of a contract. It’s a moment of reckoning for the University, and a chance to redefine its role in the global energy transition.

Princeton could choose to double down on independent, transparent climate research that focuses on accelerating renewable deployment, scaling storage, and building resilient, low-carbon systems. It could use its prestige not to give cover to fossil fuel interests, but to lead the charge toward a sustainable future.

Whether Princeton seizes this opportunity or clings to the legacy of a 25-year deal that many see as a costly mistake. Nonetheless, it will send a powerful signal about the role of higher education in solving the climate crisis.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2448299557.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 19:56:19.806333

On Sept. 4, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to enact a trade agreement with Japan, which will increase agricultural sales in the United States by $8 billion a year and secure a $550 billion investment in U.S. goods on behalf of Japan. In addition to the promised investment, the order announced a baseline 15% tariff on most Japanese imports to the U.S.

The White House stated it believes this agreement, “will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.” The agreement is a positive for agriculture, which has struggled in recent months with low commodity prices and tariff woes. The rice, corn and soybean industries are poised to receive the largest boost out of the deal.

“Specifically, the Government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products,” read an excerpt from the executive order.

According to the American Soybean Association, in 2024, the U.S. soybean industry exported 52% of its total production, but this agreement could allow expansion and stronger demand within Japan.

“This news comes at a critical time as U.S. soybean farmers begin harvest,” said ASA President Caleb Ragland. “We appreciate President Trump prioritizing agriculture in trade negotiations with key partners like Japan and urge the Administration to finalize additional trade deals in the weeks ahead. Reliable agreements like this not only strengthen markets for U.S. soy and keep America’s farm families a priority but also help our farmers remain competitive in the global marketplace.”

Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins will head to Japan in the next few weeks and communicate with buyers and to ensure that farm products can be sold and shipped as soon as possible. Rollins said in the long term, this deal was a big step forward for rural prosperity and sustainability for farmers and ranchers.

“We’ve talked a lot about China being one of our biggest buyers for some of these commodities, and certainly we need China, but we have to look to other areas of the world,” Rollins said in an RFDTV interview.

But beyond economics, fuel is now central to environmental strategy. Airlines are under increasing pressure from regulators, investors, and passengers to decarbonize their operations and lead the transition to net-zero emissions.

Key strategies include:

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. Airlines are entering long-term purchase agreements, supporting industry coalitions, and advocating for policy incentives to scale production and reduce costs.

Fleet Modernization: New aircraft models like the Airbus A321XLR and Boeing 787 Dreamliner offer significant fuel efficiency gains. Retrofitting existing fleets with aerodynamic enhancements and lightweight materials further reduces emissions.

Operational Efficiency: Airlines are optimizing flight paths, reducing taxi times, and implementing single-engine taxiing. These initiatives, coordinated with air traffic control and powered by real-time data, cut fuel consumption without compromising service.

Passenger Engagement: Sustainability-linked loyalty programs, transparent emissions reporting, and carbon offset options are helping airlines build brand trust and align with eco-conscious travelers.

Both airlines and airports are increasingly focused on climate adaptation. Rising sea levels, extreme temperatures, and severe storms are already disrupting operations. Future-proofing infrastructure is no longer optional—it’s essential.

Airports are conducting climate risk assessments and integrating resilience into capital planning through:

Elevated terminals and floodproofing in vulnerable areas.

Backup energy systems and microgrids for continuity during outages.

Heat-resilient materials and shade structures to protect assets.

Redundant communications and control systems for rapid response.

Airlines, meanwhile, are factoring climate risk into route planning, fleet deployment, and operational contingencies.

Sustainability is no longer a siloed initiative—it’s a shared responsibility across the aviation ecosystem. Airlines and airports must collaborate to align strategies, share data, and co-invest in technologies that reduce emissions and enhance resilience.

The leaders in this space will not only meet regulatory demands and stakeholder expectations—they will shape the future of aviation.

“We are still very much convinced that hydrogen has a really important part to play in aviation,” Reynolds told delegates. “We are still investing, we still see this as a really fundamental part of the future. We are still absolutely committed to SAF [sustainable aviation fuel].”

While hydrogen will be part of aviation’s future, it will have a “bigger and bigger part” beyond 2050, he adds.

“We want it to be ready by 2035, [but] we don’t think the hydrogen economy generally is going to reach the level we had hoped it would by 2035,” Reynolds points out. “We think it’s something like five to ten years behind where we had hoped. But we still see it coming, and we still want to be ready when the hydrogen economy is ready.”

According to the executive, Airbus is making “tremendous progress” and investing “triple-digit millions” every year in the technology. The company is also collaborating with airports and regulatory bodies globally, as well as building hubs in countries including the UK, Japan, Korea, the US, and Australia.

Over the past five years, Japan has bought on average just under $12.9 billion in annual farm goods from the U.S.
Those investments will be chosen by the U.S. government and are expected to ""generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.""
Rice sales to Japan average more than $300 million a year in value, and are currently up 16% in 2025 compared to last year.
Japan also agrees to accept U.S. automobiles without additional safety testing requirements and bill buy U.S.-made commercial aircraft and military equipment.","President Trump on Thursday signed an order to implement a trade agreement with Japan that is expected to increase U.S. agricultural sales by $8 billion a year.

Over the past five years, Japan has bought on average just under $12.9 billion in annual farm goods from the U.S.

In detailing the agreement, the White House cited, ""Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States.""

Those investments will be chosen by the U.S. government and are expected to ""generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.""

Spelling out agricultural trade, the order stated, ""Specifically, the government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements within the minimum access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products, in amounts totaling $8 billion per year.""

Rice sales to Japan average more than $300 million a year in value, and are currently up 16% in 2025 compared to last year.

USA Rice commented, ""We appreciate the President's efforts to expand markets for U.S. rice and we look forward to working with our partners in Japan to increase our market access in what is already a top 5 market for our exporters, and to participating in the remaining FY2025 rice tenders that predate these latest announcements.""

While noting the sales of sustainable aviation fuels, the U.S. last year only produced about 20 million gallons. Japan has a goal to use 10% SAF fuel in its commercial airlines by 2030.

The American Soybean Association said the agreement ""helps further secure a top ten market for our crop. In Marketing Year 2023/2024, Japan imported $1.31 billion of U.S. soy products, making the country U.S. soy's sixth largest trading partner by volume, according to USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service.""

""This news comes at a critical time as U.S. soybean farmers begin harvest,"" said ASA President and Kentucky farmer Caleb Ragland. ""We appreciate President Trump prioritizing agriculture in trade negotiations with key partners like Japan, and urge the administration to finalize additional trade deals in the weeks ahead. Reliable agreements like this not only strengthen markets for U.S. soy and keep America's farm families a priority, but also help our farmers remain competitive in the global marketplace.""

Under the deal, the U.S. will set a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports to the U.S., though there will be separate sector tariffs for automobiles and auto parts, aerospace products, generic pharmaceuticals, and some natural resources.

Japan also agrees to accept U.S. automobiles without additional safety testing requirements and bill buy U.S.-made commercial aircraft and military equipment.

SHELL has cancelled construction of its flagship biofuels plant in Rotterdam, shelving plans to produce 820,000 t/y of sustainable fuels from waste oils and animal fats – just three years after breaking ground.

First announced in 2021, the plant was intended to form part of Shell’s “powering progress” strategy of converting former refineries into new energy and chemicals facilities. Construction began in 2022 at Shell’s Energy and Chemicals Park in Rotterdam, on the site of the former Pernis refinery, but was paused in July 2024.

The company had planned to use cooking oil and waste animal fats as primary feedstocks for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel, while capturing production emissions through the Dutch Porthos carbon capture and storage project.

However, Shell now says the investment is “insufficiently competitive”. The move mirrors a similar decision from Shell in March 2023 to shelve a project to build a 550,000 t/y SAF plant in Singapore.

The decision to scrap the Rotterdam plant is the latest in a string of moves from fossil fuel producers rowing back on commitments to cleaner energy. In February, bp announced plans to slash its investment in renewables while ramping up oil and gas investment by 20%. This followed a similar move from Equinor. Shell itself came under fire in March 2024 after diluting its targets for emissions intensity reductions from 20% by 2030 to 15–20%.

Machteld de Haan, president of downstream, renewables and energy solutions at Shell, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders. We continue to believe that low carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system.”

Shell remains one of the largest biofuel producers in the world, making 10.37bn L of biofuels in 2024. Nonetheless, biofuels form a very small share of its global business, contributing less than 0.1% of its US$289bn revenue last year. Shell also spent US$2.94bn on compliance certificates under government schemes requiring a portion of fuel sales to be renewable – more than ten times the company’s revenue from biofuels.

The lower tariffs on Japanese autos are set to take effect seven days after publication of the order.
Last month, Toyota said it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion from Trump's tariffs on cars imported into the United States.
The United States in July agreed to lower tariffs on imports of Japanese automobiles but the timing remains unclear as Trump had yet to sign an executive order.
One automaker official told Reuters that as of Thursday, European car imports to the United States are still facing 27.5% tariffs.","WASHINGTON/TOKYO--U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order on Thursday to implement the lower tariffs on Japanese automobile imports and other products that were announced in July.

Formalizing the agreement between the U.S. and a key Asian ally comes after months of negotiations, reduces uncertainty for the massive Japanese auto sector and confirms an agreement for $550 billion of Japanese investment in U.S. projects.

The lower tariffs on Japanese autos are set to take effect seven days after publication of the order. Some of the tariff relief is retroactive to August 7.

Trump's order also means a reduced U.S. tariff rate on Japanese cars, from the current 27.5% to 15%, is set to take effect by the end of this month, Reuters reported earlier, citing a Japanese government source.

Trump's levies on global shipments have hit Japanese carmakers hard. Last month, Toyota said it expected a hit of nearly $10 billion from Trump's tariffs on cars imported into the United States.

""Finally,"" Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's top trade negotiator, posted to X, in a nod to the months-long trade talks that had frustrated lawmakers in Tokyo. Thursday marked his 10th trip to the U.S. for the negotiations.

Toyota praised Trump's efforts to reach a trade deal with Japan. ""While nearly 80% of the vehicles Toyota sells in the U.S. are made in North America, this framework provides much needed clarity,"" the company said in a statement.

Trump's order says Japan is ""working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements... and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel)"" and other U.S. products totaling $8 billion per year.

As part of the deal, Japan will buy 100 Boeing planes and hike defense spending with U.S. firms to $17 billion annually, from $14 billion, the White House said in July.

Japan said in July the share of U.S. rice imports may increase under its existing framework but that the agreement did ""not sacrifice"" Japanese agriculture.

Trump's order Thursday also reiterates the Japanese government has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States in projects that will be selected by the U.S. government.

Two-way trade between the two countries reached nearly $230 billion in 2024, with Japan running a trade surplus of nearly $70 billion.

The United States in July agreed to lower tariffs on imports of Japanese automobiles but the timing remains unclear as Trump had yet to sign an executive order.

Japan has said the trade deal ensures the U.S.'s fifth-largest trading partner will always receive the lowest tariff rate on chips and pharmaceuticals of all the pacts negotiated by Washington. It also includes no tariffs on commercial airplanes and parts.

The executive order is also expected to include provisions that the 15% levy agreed in July would not be stacked on Japanese imports that are subject to higher tariffs, while items previously subject to less than 15% tariffs would be adjusted to 15%, the source said.

The investment package, which will come in the form of equity, loans and guarantees from Japan's government-owned banks, was agreed as part of the July trade deal.

The European Union secured a 15% baseline tariff as part of a framework trade deal with the U.S. in July, averting looming new tariffs on chips and pharmaceuticals.

Last week, the European Commission proposed removing duties on imported U.S. industrial goods in return for reduced U.S. tariffs on European cars, a key part of the trade agreement the EU and the United States.

The trial, set to run for at least six months, marks the first industrial demonstration of Nuada’s technology in the EfW sector and represents an important step in both companies’ decarbonisation strategies.

Enfinium, one of the UK’s leading EfW operators, views the project as a milestone towards deploying carbon capture and storage (CCS) at scale across its six facilities.

“Waste producers must pay for their CO2,” Mike Mau | RSS.com

Simon Forshaw, VP Engineering & Construction at enfinium, stated: “Deploying waste to energy carbon capture at scale is critical to decarbonise the UK’s unrecyclable waste and generate the carbon removals needed to achieve net zero.

With EfW responsible for processing millions of metric tons of residual waste every year, integrating CCS has the potential to transform the sector into a source of large-scale carbon removals.

Pioneering Metal-Organic Framework Technology

At the heart of the pilot is Nuada’s use of metal-organic framework (MOF) materials, which separate CO2 from flue gases using a vacuum swing process. This approach promises higher efficiency and lower energy consumption compared to conventional capture systems, strengthening its potential for commercial deployment.

EfW is uniquely positioned to deliver negative emissions. Roughly half of the residual waste stream is biogenic, which has already absorbed CO2 during its lifecycle.

By capturing and storing this biogenic carbon, EfW facilities can achieve permanent removals rather than emissions, a capability increasingly recognised by policymakers and industry.

Relevant: enfinium Has Selected Isometric As Its Carbon Registry Partner On Project Parc Adfer

Dr Conor Hamill, co-CEO of Nuada, commented: “We believe that CCUS innovation like ours can help the EfW sector to efficiently unlock value from an existing waste stream CO2.”

The Climate Change Committee and The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies estimate that EfW could contribute between 5 and 8 million tonnes of CO2 removals annually by 2050.

Scaling technologies such as Nuada’s will therefore be central to meeting the UK’s net zero commitments while decarbonizing essential waste infrastructure.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/small4web-8591.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 08:56:14.099211

Air Côte d’Ivoire takes delivery of first A330neo aircraft

Air Côte d’Ivoire, the national flag carrier of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, has taken delivery of the first of its two Airbus A330-900 aircraft.

The A330neo is the first widebody aircraft to join Air Côte d’Ivoire’s fleet and is configured in a four-class layout, offering four seats in First, 44 in Business, 21 in Premium Economy and 173 in Economy. The airline is the leading carrier in West and Central Africa, serving 22 destinations across the continent. The A330-900 will play a central role in Air Côte d’Ivoire’s expansion into long-haul markets, beginning with Paris, followed by routes to the Middle East and North America.

Air Côte d’Ivoire’s first A330neo delivery flight from Toulouse to Abidjan carried five tonnes of humanitarian aid, including equipment and school supplies. This was the airline’s third goodwill flight, organised in partnership with the Airbus Foundation and supported by Aviation Sans Frontières, which provided the donations. The supplies were distributed to two local NGOs, LifeShine and La Bienfaisance, to directly support their health and education initiatives in Abidjan.

By the end of July 2025, the A330 Family had secured more than 1,920 firm orders from over 130 customers worldwide. Like all Airbus aircraft, the A330neo is already capable of operating with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for its entire aircraft range to be 100% SAF-capable by 2030.

The development of palm oil substitute

Through a double fermentation process, carbon gases are converted first into alcohol and then into a fat similar to palm oil. The process uses non-genetically modified oleaginous yeasts. Laboratory tests and validations in the cosmetics industry show that this substitute can be integrated into existing supply chains.

The Mibelle Group has confirmed that the new material replicates characteristics of palm oil used in cosmetics. At the same time, the technology opens up the possibility of producing sustainable aviation fuel(SAF) through the HEFA route, diversifying raw materials and reducing the risks associated with traditional vegetable oils.

The versatility of LanzaTech’ s platform allows for both the production of production of PBS through the ATJ pathway as well as through HEFA. This provides airlines and energy producers with a wider range of options to achieve climate neutrality goals. In addition, the integration of this innovation with the circular carbon economy offers a replicable approach for high-emission sectors.

The project is being scaled up at the Fraunhofer Center for Chemical and Biotechnological Processes in Leuna. The goal is to bring production to commercial levels and demonstrate that sustainable palm oil replacement can be viable on a large scale, both in cosmetics and fuels.

India-Singapore CSP: Trade, Defence, Digitalisation, Healthcare Among Key Focus Areas

India and Singapore have agreed on a forward-looking roadmap to deepen their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), covering eight key areas of cooperation, following the official visit of Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong to India from September 2–4, 2025.

At the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, PM Wong held wide-ranging discussions with the Indian leadership, attended a banquet hosted by PM Modi, called on President Droupadi Murmu, and paid floral tributes at Raj Ghat. The visit coincided with the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

The leaders reviewed bilateral ties and expressed satisfaction over recent high-level engagements, including PM Modi’s visit to Singapore in September 2024, the state visit of Singapore’s President Tharman Shanmugaratnam to India in January 2025, and the 3rd India-Singapore Ministerial Roundtable held in New Delhi in August 2025.

The Atlanta-based US legacy carrier and SkyTeam founding member teamed up with Shell to make this possible.

The move saw hundreds of thousands of gallons of US-made SAF delivered to Portland International, with this particular milestone marking the first commercial-scale uplift of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at the airport. Going forward, it will boost both Delta's sustainability credentials and PDX's ability to capitalize on SAF growth.

Portland's First Commercial-Scale SAF Uplift

As announced in a statement released yesterday by Delta Air Lines, the carrier has teamed up with Shell to take delivery of more than 400,000 gallons of SAF into the fuel system at Portland International Airport. Made in the US from waste-derived feedstock, the SAF was subjected to complex logistical procedures.

Indeed, Delta explains that, after the neat SAF was shipped by Shell to Portland's Zenith Terminal, it had to be ""blended with traditional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements, then delivered to PDX via barge, truck, and pipeline."" Having been blended, the SAF was then able to enter the airport's fuel system. Charlotte Lollar, who serves as Delta Air Lines' SAF Director, welcomed the milestone, explaining:

""Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel. By working with Shell and the Port of Portland to tap into existing infrastructure, we’re able to access SAF at more airports and continue to prove its viability and ultimately scale it in a way the industry needs.""

Delta Air Lines Is Hoping To Be Able To Grow The SAF Market In Portland

While Sustainable Aviation Fuel has widely been touted as an ideal shorter-term solution as airlines and airports around the world race to get their carbon emissions down to net-zero by 2050, one of its main shortcomings thus far has been its scalability. As such, deals such as this one between Delta Air Lines and Shell in Portland are playing an important role in ensuring that SAF is more widely available.

Indeed, the carrier explains that, as well as growing its own footprint as far as Sustainable Aviation Fuel is concerned, it will also enable Portland International Airport to ""capitalize on the continued growth of SAF across the US."" On a local level, Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger explains that the rollout of SAF will ""improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions.""

As previously noted, Delta's recent 400,000-gallon delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in partnership with Shell marked the first commercial-scale uplift at Portland International Airport. However, the carrier doesn't want this to be a one-off, and explains that it ""is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland.""

The Carrier Has Made Several Other Major Investments In SAF Over The Years

According to the International Air Transport Association ( IATA), SAF currently accounts for almost two-thirds of the overall strategy when it comes to getting the commercial aviation industry down to net-zero carbon emissions. With this in mind, key players like Delta have long been front and center with this initiative.

Indeed, as Simple Flying reported at the time, the carrier pledged to buy some 385 million gallons of SAF from DG Fuels back in September of 2022, with deliveries from this shipment expected to begin at the end of 2027. This partnership will see the airline supplied with 55 million gallons annually over a seven-year period.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/delta-air-lines-airbus-a220-100-shutterstock_2399749189.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-05 06:56:34.910167

LATHAM — Plug Power, Inc. posted second-quarter results that show both stronger sales and signs of financial discipline as the Latham-based hydrogen company pursues its turnaround strategy.

Despite a net loss of $227 million for the quarter, Plug’s leadership reaffirmed a goal of reaching gross margin breakeven by the fourth quarter of 2025. The company said that continued cost controls, higher service performance, and expanding electrolyzer sales are central to that milestone.

The company reported $174 million in revenue for the quarter ending June 30, a 21 percent increase over the same period last year. Growth was driven by rising demand across its product lines, including GenDrive fuel cells, GenFuel hydrogen infrastructure, and its GenEco electrolyzer platform. Electrolyzer sales alone tripled year-over-year, bringing in approximately $45 million as Plug expanded its global footprint.

Gross margins improved sharply to -31 percent compared to -92 percent in the second quarter of 2024, reflecting lower service costs, equipment improvements, and better hydrogen pricing. Much of the shift is tied to “Project Quantum Leap,” a company-wide cost restructuring that reduced workforce and facility expenses, cut professional services, and secured new supply agreements expected to lower hydrogen costs later this year.

Plug recorded about $80 million in non-cash charges related to the restructuring, up from $6 million the prior year. Even with those charges, the company reduced its net cash use for operations and investments by more than 40 percent year-over-year.

At quarter’s end, Plug reported $140 million in unrestricted cash on hand and access to more than $300 million in additional debt capacity. Management also pointed to the value of recently clarified federal tax credits for clean hydrogen production and fuel cells, which they expect to monetize under Sections 45V and 48E of the tax code.

Operationally, Plug continues to pursue scale. More than 230 megawatts of GenEco electrolyzers are being deployed across Europe, Australia, and North America, including a record-setting hydrogen production run at its Georgia facility this spring. Executives said the systems are increasingly becoming the “platform of choice” for industrial applications ranging from steel and cement to semiconductors.

The company also sees momentum in its material handling business, where an extension of the Investment Tax Credit through 2026 is expected to boost demand for GenDrive fuel cells. Additional growth is projected from Plug’s Energy Transition division, which leverages its liquefier and skid-packaging expertise to support renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel projects.

Plug employs more than 2,000 people globally and operates hydrogen plants in Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana with a combined daily production capacity of 40 tons.

Vegan® process is thus able to prevent co-production of Renewable Diesel if not desired and focus on maximizing SAF. But what makes this solution unique is that 100% SAF mode is obtained without the need of additional hydrocracking stage.

This is a major milestone for Axens Group, partners and customers, contributing to ease the energy transition through more flexible, more efficient and less Capex intensive solutions.

Regardless of its role in researching such current matters, the ALECSys program marks the end of the road for Hefty Bee.
Rolls-Royce told AeroTime that the company plans to continue using “a blend of flying test beds and ground test facilities in the future”.
It is not yet known which specific aircraft the engine maker plans to use as future flying test beds.","On July 9, 2025, one of the most peculiar jumbo jets to ever take to the sky was withdrawn from service after a distinguished career spanning 45 years. Although it first flew as an airliner, for the last two decades this aircraft’s mission has had nothing to do with carrying passengers or cargo.

Since 2005, the aircraft, officially called the “Spirit of Excellence”, a Boeing B747-200 with registration N787RR, was operated by none other than British engine maker Rolls-Royce, which used it as a Flying Test Bed or FTB.

A flying test bed is in essence a flying laboratory that allows engineers to test new engine types in all sorts of real operational environments.

The aircraft, nicknamed “Hefty Bee”, was specially configured to carry a supplementary engine mount so that new engine types can be tested in real flight conditions while preserving full propulsion redundancy. This means that one of the aircraft’s wings carries three engines instead of the usual two, for a total of five.

The aircraft cabin was fitted with instruments capable of collecting large amounts of data about the engine’s performance in flight.

From airliner to flying laboratory

At the time of its retirement, Hefty Bee was one of only 15 other active B747-200s left in the world.

Its first operator was Cathay Pacific, back in 1980. The aircraft was operated by the Hong Kong-based carrier until 1999, when it was acquired by ACMI and cargo operator Air Atlanta Icelandic and its subsidiary Air Atlanta Europe until its acquisition by Rolls-Royce in 2005.

Shortly after its acquisition by the engine maker, Hefty Bee underwent a thorough transformation at L-3 Communications (later rebranded as L3Harris) in Texas, United States, in order to be able to fulfill its new, specialized role.

Hefty Bee’s first, and perhaps most prominent mission, was to test the Trent 1000 engine, designed specifically to power the, what was then new and revolutionary, Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

However, the aircraft’s useful life did not end with the Trent 1000’s entry into service in 2011. By mid-2025, Hefty Bee’s service record included 250 flights and 800 flying hours, 10 and five times more, respectively, than the 25 flights and 150 flight hours that had originally been planned by Rolls-Royce. In fact, the British engine ended up doubling the aircraft’s use rate from two to four flights per week.

The need to keep working on the Trent 1000 program after some operators reported reliability issues and premature blade corrosion, ensured that Hefty Bee would continue to be engaged in the successive development and update of this engine type.

But Rolls-Royce’s unique B747 also took part in other notable engine research programs. More recently, the smaller Pearl 10 engine, developed by the British engine maker to power the Dassault Falcon 10X business jet, has also used Hefty Bee as a test bank. Rolls-Royce tested the specially modified B747 between May and October 2024.

Some of those test flights were performed using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). However, this was not a first for Hefty Bee. The aircraft had already completed a 100% SAF flight test in 2021 although on that occasion it was using a Trent 1000 instead of a Pearl 10 engine.

In a written response to AeroTime’s questions about the recent missions undertaken by Hefty Bee, Rolls-Royce highlighted the aircraft’s central role in the firm’s commitment towards sustainable aviation.

“It made history in 2021 by flying a Trent 1000 powered entirely by 100% sustainable aviation fuel. More recently it played a key role in the certification of the durability enhancement package to more than double time on wing for that engine, part of a wider £1bn investment,” the statement read. “Its final mission, completed in July 2025, supported our Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) engine demonstrator, marking a significant step towards delivering more efficient and sustainable engines.”

The statement referred to an ongoing research program, backed by the EU’s Clean Sky initiative and the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI), which aims to lower the environmental footprint of aircraft engines by making the fuel burning process more efficient by pre-mixing fuel and air.

Regardless of its role in researching such current matters, the ALECSys program marks the end of the road for Hefty Bee.

What next for Hefty Bee?

The aircraft has been donated to the Pima Air & Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona, right next to what has been its base for the last two decades. There it will join another jumbo jet N747GE, a Boeing 747-100 which was used by Rolls-Royce’s competitor GE Aerospace as a test bank between 1992 and 2017.

Rolls-Royce had long been preparing for Hefty Bee’s retirement. In 2019, the engine maker even acquired another jumbo jet, a much newer B747-400, registration N747RR, previously operated by Australian airline Qantas.

In a surprising move, though, Rolls-Royce cancelled a project to transform N747RR into another flying test bed in 2022 and sent the aircraft to be scrapped.

The engine maker, which has spent the last few years immersed in a major turnaround, has stated its willingness to use a mix of platforms and processes to test its new engines going forward.

Rolls-Royce told AeroTime that the company plans to continue using “a blend of flying test beds and ground test facilities in the future”.

It is not yet known which specific aircraft the engine maker plans to use as future flying test beds. However, it seems likely that its engine programs, such as the UltraFan technology which Rolls-Royce is developing for the Trent family, will see increased reliance on ground testing and simulators in the near future.",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/08/53616604336_dfc351c087_k.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 04:56:33.455732

All Airbus aircraft are certified to fly with a 50% SAF blend, and the company has delivered 78% of its aircraft using this blend in 2025.","Boeing has reasons to be concerned over the next decade for a number of reasons. Airbus' new narrowbody, the A220, won't be helping their concerns. It is a clean-sheet design set to outperform its rivals in a number of metrics.

In this article, discover how Airbus has designed the A220 to dominate its competition, along with the challenges it faces and how the aircraft will continue to develop in the future.

The Three Ways That The A220 Could Win

In launching its new narrowbody aircraft, Airbus has outlined three ways it believes it can win with the A220 in competition with Boeing's narrowbody planes. Firstly, this will be a clean-sheet aircraft. It is a notable departure from the 737 MAX and A320neo variants, all of which are built upon pre-existing aircraft. A clean-sheet design allows all new innovations in aerodynamics, materials, and avionics to be integrated into a single aircraft. The target in doing so is to build a low-noise and environmentally friendly aircraft that can outperform its rivals with minimal impact on those on the ground. This makes the jet ideal for urban operations, particularly at night.

Airbus intends this jet to have a capacity for 100-160 passengers, offering a level of comfort never before experienced on a narrowbody aircraft. Passengers can enjoy wider seats, panoramic windows, and overhead bins that beat any other aircraft in its class. Of course, Airbus can't control all of these factors. Some are within the control of the airlines. As always, comfort aboard the aircraft will still depend on the airline operating it. Meanwhile, such a commitment to a small jet aircraft indicates a belief that airlines will continue moving towards high frequency rather than high-capacity services.

Finally, the A220 is built for versatility and efficiency. These characteristics open up more opportunities for airlines, allowing them to increase their revenues. Moreover, Airbus says this jet will have 25% lower operating costs per seat compared to previous-generation planes. These factors combine to mean better profit margins.

A220 Overview

In 2018, Airbus launched a new family of five-abreast narrowbody jets, based on the Bombardier CSeries (launched 2012). The jet became known as the A220 after Airbus purchased a majority stake in the joint venture to manufacture the aircraft. It is Airbus' most advanced clean-sheet design narrowbody, utilizing PW1500G geared turbofans from Pratt & Whitney, fly-by-wire controls, carbon composite wings, and an aluminum-lithium fuselage. Airbus has committed to this jet to challenge the Boeing 737 MAX 7 and four-abreast Embraer E-jets. It complements the A319neo. It has allowed Airbus to gain a 55% market share in the small jet airliner category.

The table below outlines the key specifications of both variants of the A220: -100 and -300. It has been put together from data collected by Airbus:

The A220 has already gathered modest success. Delta Air Lines is the largest operator, with 45 -100s and 34 -300s, and a further 66 -300s on order. This is unsurprising, given that they are also the largest operator of the Airbus A330 and Boeing 717, 757, and 767. In total, airlines have ordered 941 A220s, with 435 delivered to date. Those in service, spread between 24 operators, have completed over 1.5 million flights and 2.7 million block hours.

A220 Variants

Airbus currently has two variants of the A220: -100 and -300. The -100 is currently Airbus' smallest jetliner. The unit price is $81 million, substantially higher than Embraer's E-190 E2 and E-195 E2, which are priced between $61 million and $69 million; however, airlines placing bulk orders will receive the jets for less than this. 72 A220-100s are currently in service, with Delta leading the pack.

Airbus' marketing of the -100 is angled towards its capabilities as a ""route opener"" and the ""lowest risk solution."" They hope airlines will utilize it to operate in short-haul and small markets. The greatly decreased operating cost per seat and low capacity could make previously impractical routes profitable. Yet, its range also allows for some medium-haul routes to be operated. For example, Airbus states that, from Paris, the jet can reach African, Asian, and Middle Eastern destinations, like Islamabad, Muscat, Addis Ababa, and Entebbe.

The larger variant is the A220-300. This jet was first delivered as the CS300 to airBaltic following its maiden flight in February 2015. It is a slightly more affordable aircraft ($91.5 million) than the A319neo ($101.5 million), making it a cheaper complementary alternative. There are currently 363 -300s in service, with JetBlue being the largest operator with 51 aircraft. Airbus hopes airlines will use this aircraft as a ""network builder"" due to its combination of lean efficiency and greater capacity. Its range and versatility allow for both regional and intercontinental routes. For example, for airlines using Dallas as a hub, it states the edge of its range to be Anchorage, Lima, Bridgetown, and Cayenne.

The A220 and Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Alongside its high-tech construction, the A220 is also part of Airbus' efforts to transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a goal of 100% SAF by 2030. It made headlines this month for flying from Mirabel in Canada to Paris using a 50% SAF mixture. All Airbus aircraft are certified to fly with a 50% SAF blend, and the company has delivered 78% of its aircraft using this blend in 2025. Meanwhile, 75% of its aircraft deliveries in 2024 used a SAF blend. The flight was carried out to deliver a new A220 to Air France. Airbus claims this is the first time that its Canadian site has issued sustainability credentials to a customer.

Blaise Brigaud, SVP Group Sustainability at Air France-KLM, said: ""Fleet renewal and the use of sustainable aviation fuel are the two main levers of the decarbonization of aviation. Combining the two is only logical, and Air France-KLM is proud to participate in this Airbus milestone with the delivery flight of one of our A220s.""

The next step is to collaborate with airlines to increase the frequency of SAF blends appearing on commercial flights, and Airbus is currently forming partnerships to make this possible. For example, it conducted an operational trial with Charleroi Airport (Brussels) and Wizz Air, involving 50 commercial flights using a SAF blend.

What Challenges Could The A220 Face?

With Boeing becoming an increasingly unreliable manufacturer in recent years, it appears that ensuring aircraft reliability is maintained and production targets are met are easy wins for Airbus and others. The A220 has been largely without major issues, with a handful of notable exceptions. In January 2025, Air Canada's AC609 (a -300) suffered a pressurization issue, forcing the aircraft to return to base. However, the cause was swiftly identified as the shearing off of an aft cargo vent flap idler bearing, and the aircraft returned to service after it was fixed.

More concerning was SWISS's 2019 grounding of its entire A220 fleet after issues involving the Pratt & Whitney engines in October 2019. SWISS told Simple Flying: ""Only following a faultless inspection will these aircraft be returned to regular flight duties. This will put substantial restrictions on SWISS’s flight operations, as numerous flights will have to be cancelled."" However, the airline successfully returned its entire A220 fleet to the skies less than a week later.

The A220's only 'accident' has also occurred with a SWISS aircraft. Flight 1885, from Henri Coanda International Airport to Zurich Airport, diverted to Graz Airport after engine issues caused smoke to fill the cabin and cockpit during cruise. All 79 people on board were successfully evacuated after landing, but 17 people had to be rushed to the hospital. One member of the cabin crew died a week later.

What Next For The A220

The main development expected from the A220 in coming years will be the A220-500, a stretched version of the aircraft set to enter service in the early 2030s. A number of airlines are already interested in a higher-capacity A220.

Some doubts still remain about whether this jet is guaranteed to come into existence. A longer A220 was also on the cards back when it was the Bombardier CSeries, but never came to pass. However, this jet has strong commercial reasoning, as it could function as a direct competitor to the 737-800 and 737 MAX 8.

Successfully rolling out this variant will require ongoing A220 production issues to be fixed. During a June 2025 Airbus Business Update, Florent Massou dit Labaquère, the Executive Vice President of Operations of Airbus Commercial Aircraft, referred to issues with plants constructing A220 pylons, systems, strut-to-wing hardware, aft fairings, wings, control surfaces, and the mid-fuselage sections.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a220-reveal-first-arrival-in-airbus-livery-13_ai-eve-a220-firstdelivery-cropped.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-04 21:56:34.018962

The carrier posted record Q2 2025 revenues of $14.4 billion, a 5% jump in international passenger unit revenue, with especially strong demand across the Atlantic. Its operating margin climbed to 8%, while earnings per share of $0.95 beat Wall Street expectations. AAL is also giving a strong net-zero push with significant investment in SAF.

Let’s deep dive into its revenue and its sustainability goals below.

American Airlines’ Passenger Growth Gives Earnings a Lift

The earnings release showed that premium cabins led the charge, with families, leisure travelers, and business flyers paying up for long-haul comfort. The airline also leaned into its AAdvantage loyalty program, which grew 7% in 2025. Upticks in co-branded credit card use and new perks like instant upgrades helped drive repeat bookings.

Together, these gains signaled more than just post-pandemic recovery—they showed targeted growth in high-margin categories.

Holiday Travel Tailwinds

Heading into the year-end holidays, American is adding capacity both at home and abroad. Routes to resilient leisure destinations are expanding, while premium travel remains a strong revenue engine. The airline is betting that higher engagement and a growing loyalty base will keep its planes full during the holiday surge.

Yet, investors are cautious. AAL shares trade at $13.39, nearly 28% below their 2025 peak of $18.66. AAL stock has been volatile, with 22 swings of more than 5% this year alone. Analysts maintain a neutral outlook, with a median 12-month price target of $13.55, suggesting limited upside unless cost pressures ease.

Q3 Forecast: Clear Skies or Turbulence Ahead?

Despite Q2 strength, management offered a more sober Q3 forecast. The company expects a loss per share between $0.10 and $0.60, missing analyst profit estimates. That guidance reflects the industry’s most stubborn challenges:

Fuel volatility – oil prices are holding around $86 per barrel.

Labor pressures – wage hikes, including a 10% pilot raise, are cutting into margins.

Tariff and macro risks – global trade uncertainties remain a drag.

Margins for Q3 are projected between -1% and +2%. At the same time, costs per available seat mile may climb another 2.5–4.5% year-on-year. Pilot shortages and weather disruptions have also played their part, denting operational efficiency.

Still, the company is leaning on its $12 billion liquidity buffer to manage volatility. With the industry facing similar headwinds, investors will watch closely to see how well the airline balances growth with cost control.

A Different Flight Path: American Airlines 2050 Net Zero Goals

While financials dominate headlines, American Airlines is also pushing ahead on climate commitments. Aviation remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, but the carrier has tied its long-term competitiveness to a net-zero emissions goal by 2050. Intermediate targets for 2030 and 2035 add pressure to deliver progress sooner.

Decarbonizing air travel requires public-private collaboration, innovation, and policy support. However, the company is investing heavily in efficiency, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and next-generation aircraft within its operations.

Capital Investments with Climate Benefits

In 2024, roughly 55% of American’s capital spending supported both profitability and decarbonization. That included billions invested in new aircraft, fuel-saving initiatives, and fleet modernization. Although deliveries slowed in 2024 due to supply chain delays, the company expects to take delivery of more efficient aircraft in 2025.

Next-generation aircraft is the key to the airline’s climate playbook.

It became the largest airline to sign a conditional purchase agreement for 100 ZeroAvia hydrogen-electric engines. They can power regional jets with zero emissions beyond water vapor.

The company aims to induct hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2032 or earlier.

Betting Big on Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is widely regarded as the most critical near-term lever for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF can cut life-cycle emissions by up to 85%. But supply remains limited, and high costs are slowing adoption.

It aims to replace 10% of its jet fuel use with SAF by 2030, which would avoid about 3.5 million metric tons of CO2. In 2024, the airline used 2.9 million gallons of SAF, a modest 9.7% increase from 2023 but still under 0.1% of total fuel use.

It has signed offtake deals to scale SAF. They include

Up to 10 million gallons from Valero by mid-2026.

Agreement with Infinium, an e-fuels producer, with deliveries expected as early as 2027.

The company also became a founding member of the SAF Coalition, which lobbies for federal incentives to make SAF cost-competitive.

American applies strict sourcing principles to its SAF purchases, requiring at least a 50% life-cycle emissions reduction, full feedstock impact assessments, and sustainability certifications.

Airspace Efficiency

Beyond fuel, American is working with policymakers to modernize airspace management. Better flight planning and optimized routing reduce emissions while boosting safety and on-time performance.

In 2024, the airline rolled out a flight planning optimization tool and equipped its A321 fleet with ADS-B In technology, allowing pilots to adjust routes in real-time for efficiency. These upgrades enhance both operational reliability and sustainability.

Carbon Markets as a Backstop

American Airlines also participates in voluntary carbon markets to neutralize residual emissions. The company is exploring offsets and removals as complementary tools to in-sector solutions.

Last year, it onboarded new digital tools to help corporate customers meet their own decarbonization goals, signaling growing demand for carbon-aligned travel options.

Momentum vs. Risk: Can AAL Keep Flying High?

For shareholders, AAL stock presents a mix of opportunity and risk. The airline is benefiting from record revenues, stronger loyalty engagement, and solid demand for premium travel. Yet, rising costs, $38 billion in debt, and the heavy price of climate transition investments are weighing on its outlook.

With a price-to-sales ratio of 0.16 compared to the industry average of 0.69, AAL appears undervalued. Still, challenges like wage pressures and fuel volatility temper bullish sentiment. Most analysts recommend patience, noting that future gains will hinge on execution and broader market conditions.

Looking ahead, American Airlines has shown it can soar when demand is strong, but turbulence is likely in 2025. The airline is balancing earnings volatility with billions committed to its net-zero pathway. Its ability to manage profitability while pushing forward on decarbonization will shape its role as both a leading U.S. carrier and a case study in how aviation adapts to market and climate pressures.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_738219229.jpg,N,,2025-09-05 00:56:13.847519

The order reduces U.S. tariffs on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, with the change set to take effect by the end of this month. The lower duties on autos will begin seven days after the order's publication, while some tariff relief is retroactive to August 7. Reuters earlier reported, citing a Japanese government source, that the cut had been expected as part of broader negotiations.

Trump lowers tariffs on Japanese imports: What we know

Trump's levies on global shipments, imposed in August, had weighed heavily on Japanese carmakers. Toyota said last month it expected a nearly $10 billion hit from the tariffs on vehicles shipped into the United States.

Toyota said in a statement Thursday, ""We appreciate President Trump's leadership in securing a trade deal with Japan. While nearly 80% of the vehicles Toyota sells in the U.S. are made in North America, this framework provides much needed clarity. We are encouraged by this development and hopeful for progress with Canada and Mexico to continue providing our U.S. customers with affordable vehicles that fit their needs.""

The order also notes Japan is ""working toward an expedited implementation of a 75% increase of United States rice procurements... and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel)"" and other U.S. products totaling $8 billion per year.

It further reiterates that the Japanese government has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States in projects selected by Washington. The Japanese government declined to comment.

The two countries had agreed in July to reduce tariffs on Japanese automobiles, though the timing had been uncertain until Trump signed the order. Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, traveled to Washington on Thursday to press for the executive order.

Japan has said the deal ensures that as the U.S.'s fifth-largest trading partner, it will always receive the lowest tariff rate on chips and pharmaceuticals negotiated by Washington. The agreement also removes tariffs on commercial airplanes and parts.

The order is also expected to include provisions clarifying that the 15% levy agreed in July will not be stacked on Japanese imports already subject to higher tariffs, while items with rates below 15% would be raised to the new level, the source said. The $550 billion investment package, which includes equity, loans and guarantees from Japanese state-owned banks, was agreed to as part of the July deal.

The European Union reached a similar agreement with Washington in July, securing a 15% baseline tariff as part of a framework trade deal and averting new tariffs on chips and pharmaceuticals. Last week, the European Commission proposed scrapping duties on imported U.S. industrial goods in exchange for reduced American tariffs on European cars.

What does the US Import from Japan?

The United States imports a wide range of goods from Japan, with automobiles and auto parts making up the largest share. Other key imports include machinery, electronics, medical instruments, and steel products. Japanese cars, in particular, dominate U.S. markets, making tariffs on them a focal point of recent trade negotiations.

What does the US Export to Japan?

U.S. exports to Japan are led by agricultural products such as corn, soybeans, beef, and rice, along with industrial goods like aircraft, machinery, and chemicals. Energy exports, including liquefied natural gas and bioethanol, have also grown in recent years. Trade deals often emphasize boosting Japan's purchases of American farm goods, reflecting the sector's importance in U.S. trade policy.

Drawing upon international best practices and tailoring them to India's socio-economic and environmental context, the report provides a roadmap for sustainable fuel adoption, it added.

The study was undertaken under the ICAO's Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels programme (ACT-SAF) initiative.

India is the world's third largest aviation market and the passenger traffic is expected to double to 500 million by 2030.

In the release, Naidu said SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonise the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional fuel.

""With over 750 million metric tonne of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonne of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter,"" he said.

The minister also said that SAF production will not only reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually but also boost farmers’ incomes by creating a strong value chain for agricultural residue and biomass.

Recently, Indian Oil Corporation became the first Indian company to get the ISCC CORSIA certification for production of SAF at its refinery in Panipat, Haryana.

CORSIA refers to Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) of the ICAO.

The minister also reaffirmed India's readiness to become self-sufficient in SAF production, targeting 1 per cent blending in ATF (Aviation Turbine Fuel) by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030 in line with the CORSIA mandate.

Meanwhile, COTECNA Inspection India Pvt Ltd has become the country's first SAF certification body.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story.","The federal spending law passed in early July, often called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, significantly reduces federal funding for efforts to create renewable or sustainable types of fuel that can power aircraft over long distances while decreasing the damage aviation does to the global climate.

Aviation contributed about 2.5% of global carbon emissions in 2023. It’s particularly hard to reduce emissions from planes because there are few alternatives for large, portable quantities of energy-dense fuel. Electric batteries with enough energy to power an international flight, for instance, would be much larger and heavier than airplane fuel tanks.

One potential solution, which I work on as an aerospace engineer, is a category of fuel called “sustainable aviation fuel.” Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is refined from petroleum, sustainable aviation fuels are produced from renewable and waste resources — such as used cooking oil, agricultural leftovers, algae, sewage and trash. But they are similar enough to conventional jet fuels that they work in existing aircraft tanks and engines without any major modifications.

Prior to Donald Trump’s second term as president, the U.S. government had set some bold targets: by 2030, producing 3 billion gallons of this type of fuel every year, and by 2050, producing enough to fuel every U.S. commercial jet flight. But there’s a long journey ahead.

A range of source materials

The earliest efforts to create sustainable aviation fuels relied on food crops – turning corn into ethanol or soybean oil into biodiesel. The raw materials were readily available, but growing them competed with food production.

The next generation of biofuels are using nonfood sources such as algae, or agricultural waste such as manure or stalks from harvested corn. These don’t compete with food supplies. If processed efficiently, they also have the potential to emit less carbon: Algae absorb carbon dioxide during their growth, and using agricultural waste avoids its decomposition, which would release greenhouse gases.

But these biofuels are harder to produce and more expensive, in part because the technologies are new, and in part because there are not yet logistics systems in place to collect, transport and process large quantities of source material.

Some researchers are working to create biofuels with the help of genetically modified bacteria that convert specific raw materials into biofuel. In one method, algae are grown to produce sugars or oils, which are then fed to engineered bacteria that turn them into usable fuels, such as ethanol, butanol or alkanes. In another effort, photosynthetic microbes such as cyanobacteria are modified to directly convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into fuel.

All these approaches – and others being explored as well – aim to create sustainable, carbon-neutral alternatives to fossil fuels. Exciting as it sounds, most of this technology is still locked away in labs, not available in airports.

Blends are being tested

At present, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration allows airlines to fuel their aircraft with blends of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, mixed with conventional jet fuel. The exact percentage depends on how the fuel was made, which relates to how chemically and physically similar it is to petroleum-based jet fuel, and therefore how well it will work in existing aircraft tanks, pipes and engines.

There are two major hurdles to wider adoption: cost and supply. Sustainable fuels are much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, with cost differences varying by process and raw material. For instance, the raw price of Jet-A, the most common petroleum-based aviation fuel, had a wholesale price averaging US$2.34 a gallon in 2024, but one type of sustainable fuel wholesaled at about $5.20 a gallon that year.

The federal budget enacted in July reduces government subsidies, effectively raising the cost of making these fuels.

In part because of cost, sustainable fuel is produced only in small quantities: In 2025, global production is expected to be about 2 million metric tons of the fuel, which is less than 1% of the worldwide demand for aviation fuel. There is international pressure to increase demand – starting in January 2025, all jet fuel supplied at airports in the European Union must include at least 2% sustainable fuel, with minimum percentages increasing over time.

Planes can use these fuels

Companies such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce have shown that the jet engines they manufacture can run perfectly on sustainable fuels.

However, sustainable aviation fuels can have slightly different density and energy content from standard jet fuel. That means the aircraft’s weight distribution and flight range could change.

And other parts of the aircraft also have to be compatible, such as those that store, pump and maintain the balance of the fuel. That includes valves, pipes and rubber seals. As a visiting professor at Boeing in the summer of 2024, I learned that it and other aircraft manufacturers are working closely with their suppliers to ensure sustainable aviation fuels can be safely and reliably integrated into every part of the aircraft.

Those finer details are why headlines you may have seen about flights that burn “100% sustainable aviation fuel” are not quite the full story. Usually, the fuel on those flights contains a small amount of conventional jet fuel or special additives. That’s because sustainable fuels lack some of the aromatic chemical compounds found in fossil-based fuels that are required to maintain proper seals throughout the aircraft’s fuel system.

Good promise, with work ahead

While many details remain, sustainable aviation fuels offer a promising way to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without reinventing or redesigning entire airplanes. These fuels can significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft in use today, helping reduce the severity of climate change.

The work will take research, and investment from governments, manufacturers and airlines around the world, whether or not the U.S. is involved. But one day, the fuel powering your flight could be much greener than it is now.

Important development in the aviation sector The aviation ministry is likely to soon come up with a sustainable aviation Fuel policy, the policy that aims to promote SF and the production of CSF in the country and for the same the aviation ministry along with ECO, the International Civil Aviation Organization, they have come up with a feasibility study. Now this study will provide the valuable insights and the research for the formation for for framing the policy on the essay for the sustainable aviation fuel. A policy. Moreover, this policy will also provide the much needed guidelines to the all marketing companies. We have always seen that the government has set an ambitious target of blending the SF with the with the petrol, with the aviation fuel and the ambitious target is to have a SPF blending of 1% by year 2020, seven 2% by 2028 and 3% by 2029. So for this government has has done the consultation with the stakeholders. In addition to this, the government. Also understand that the promotion of SF will help to reduce the carbon emission by around 20 to 25,000,000 tons annually and this also will help to give much needed push to farmers income and also to save significant amount of money when it comes to the import of aviation fuel in the country as well.

This operation not only expands the airline’s SAF footprint but also positions Portland strategically to benefit from the growth of this fuel in the United States.

Over 400,000 Gallons in First Delivery

The batch, totaling more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF, was domestically produced from waste materials. Shell supplied the pure SAF to the Zenith terminal in Portland, where it was blended with conventional jet fuel to meet regulatory standards. It was then transported to the airport via barge, truck, and pipeline. Earlier this month, the fuel entered the airport’s private fueling system.

Collaboration Paves the Way

“Every SAF delivery demonstrates the power of collaboration to open markets for this sustainable fuel,” said Charlotte Lollar, Director of SAF at Delta. “By working with Shell and the Port of Portland Authority, we can leverage existing infrastructure, access more airports, and prove that its use is both viable and scalable for the industry.”

Dan Pippenger, Aviation Director at the Port Authority, emphasized that this move will help improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions: “We hope that state and local policies will support the development of the necessary infrastructure and market to expand the use of SAF and unlock all the environmental and health benefits it offers.”

A Fuel with Potential, Yet Still Limited

SAF, produced from renewable sources, can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional fuel. It can also be distributed through existing infrastructure and used in current engines without modifications. However, production technology is still under development, which drives up costs and limits availability. In fact, current global production would not be enough to supply airlines for even a single week.

Policies and Incentives Make a Difference

Delta is collaborating with the Port of Portland Authority and other stakeholders to build a sustained SAF market in the region. The airline is also engaged at the federal and state levels in promoting incentives that boost production and reduce costs. In 2022, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, then Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, helped pass the first federal incentives for SAF, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. Both have become benchmarks for state policies, and the latter was extended by Congress until 2029.

Global Strategy Based in Portland

This inaugural delivery follows previous Delta SAF shipments at airports such as Minneapolis-St. Paul and Detroit, reinforcing its strategy to expand SAF across different airport systems.

The airline has a strong presence in Oregon, with its operation in Portland serving as a key hub, connecting passengers to nearly all of its hub airports and more than 300 destinations with just one stop.",https://aviacionaldia.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Combustible-de-aviacion.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 19:56:14.821889

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862) (section 232), section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby determine and order:

Section 1. Background. On July 22, 2025, I announced a framework agreement between the United States and Japan (Agreement), which lays the foundation for a new era of United States-Japan trade relations grounded in principles of reciprocity and our shared national interests. The Agreement establishes a tariff framework that levels the playing field for American producers and accounts for American national security needs. In my judgment, the Agreement is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025 (Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits), as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Aluminum Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9705 of March 8, 2018 (Adjusting Imports of Steel Into the United States), as amended; Proclamation 9888 of May 17, 2019 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended; and Proclamation 10962 of July 30, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Copper Into the United States). The Agreement will reduce the United States trade deficit, boost the economy of the United States, and address the consequences of the United States trade deficit, including by strengthening the manufacturing and defense industrial base of the United States.

Under the Agreement, the United States will apply a baseline 15 percent tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States, alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the United States. This new tariff framework, combined with expanded United States exports and investment-driven production, will help reduce the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall United States trade position.

Japan, meanwhile, will provide American manufacturing, aerospace, agriculture, food, energy, automobile, and industrial goods producers with breakthrough openings in market access across key sectors. Specifically, the Government of Japan is working toward an expedited implementation of a 75 percent increase of United States rice procurements within the Minimum Access rice scheme and purchases of United States agricultural goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol (including for sustainable aviation fuel), as well as other United States products, in amounts totaling $8 billion per year. The Government of Japan is also working to accept for sale in Japan United States-manufactured and United States-safety-certified passenger vehicles without additional testing. Separately, Japan will purchase United States-made commercial aircraft, as well as United States defense equipment.

Critically, unlike any other agreement in American history, the Government of Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion in the United States. These investments — which will be selected by the United States Government — will generate hundreds of thousands of United States jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations.

In my judgment, I determine that the following actions are consistent with the national interest of the United States and are necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended; Proclamation 9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and Proclamation 10962.

Sec. 2. General Tariffs. (a) The additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to products of Japan shall be determined by a product’s current ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent) rate of duty under column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (“Column 1 Duty Rate”). For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate in the HTSUS that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent. For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15 percent, the additional rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be zero percent. Treatment of specific or compound duty rates shall be identical to the treatment provided to products of the European Union as outlined in Executive Order 14326 of July 31, 2025 (Further Modifying the Reciprocal Tariff Rates). The duties described in this subsection shall apply in lieu of the additional ad valorem duties previously imposed on products of Japan under Executive Order 14257, as amended.

(b) Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the terms of Executive Order 14257, as amended, shall continue to apply to products of Japan.

(c) The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary), in consultation with the United States Trade Representative; the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP); and the Chair of the United States International Trade Commission (ITC), shall determine whether modifications to the HTSUS are necessary or appropriate to effectuate this order and may make such modifications through notice in the Federal Register.

(d) The tariffs set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall apply retroactively to products of Japan entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 7, 2025. Any refunds shall be processed pursuant to applicable laws and CBP’s standard procedures for such refunds.

(ii) Proclamation 9704, as amended;

(iii) Proclamation 9705, as amended; and

(iv) Proclamation 10962.

(b) Within 7 days of the date of publication of this order in the Federal Register, the Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the ITC and the Commissioner of CBP, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register modifying the HTSUS consistent with this section.

(c) The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules for determining what are “products of Japan” for purposes of this section.

Sec. 4. Automobiles and Automobile Parts. (a) As of the date of publication of the Federal Register notice described in subsection (b) of this section, in lieu of the additional section 232 ad valorem duties imposed on products of Japan in Proclamation 10908 of March 26, 2025 (Adjusting Imports of Automobiles and Automobile Parts Into the United States), as amended, the additional ad valorem rate of duty applicable to an automobile or automobile part that is a product of Japan and subject to duties under Proclamation 10908, as amended, shall be determined by the product’s Column 1 Duty Rate. For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is less than 15 percent, the sum of its Column 1 Duty Rate and the additional automobile or automobile part section 232 ad valorem rate of duty pursuant to this order shall be 15 percent. For a product of Japan with a Column 1 Duty Rate that is at least 15 percent, the additional automobile or automobile part section 232 ad valorem rate of duty imposed shall be zero percent.

(b) Within 7 days of the date of publication of this order in the Federal Register, the Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the ITC and the Commissioner of CBP, shall publish a notice in the Federal Register modifying the HTSUS consistent with this section.

(c) The Secretary may issue rules, regulations, guidance, and procedures to carry out the provisions of this section, including rules for determining whether automobiles and automobile parts are “products of Japan” for purposes of this section.

Sec. 5. Products Not Subject to Reciprocal Tariffs. (a) To implement the terms of the Agreement, the Secretary is authorized to modify the reciprocal tariff rate imposed under Executive Order 14257, as amended, to zero percent for products of Japan that are natural resources unavailable (or unavailable at sufficient scale to satisfy domestic demand) in the United States, generic pharmaceuticals, generic pharmaceutical ingredients, and generic pharmaceutical chemical precursors.

(b) In determining when and for which products to modify the reciprocal tariff rate to zero percent, the Secretary shall act in a manner consistent with the national interests of the United States; the purposes of this order; the need to deal with the national emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended; and the need to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security that I found pursuant to section 232. The Secretary shall also consider factors he deems appropriate, including the scope and nature of the commitments of the Government of Japan under the Agreement; the scope and nature of the commitments of the United States under the Agreement; the actions taken by the Government of Japan to implement its commitments under the Agreement; and the actions taken by the United States to implement its commitments under the Agreement.

Sec. 6. Monitoring and Modifications. (a) The Secretary shall monitor the progress of Japan’s implementation of its commitments under the Agreement and shall, from time to time, update me on the status of Japan’s implementation.

(b) Should Japan fail to implement its commitments under the Agreement, I may modify this order as necessary to deal with the emergency declared in Executive Order 14257, as amended, and to reduce or eliminate the threats to national security found in Proclamation 9704, as amended; Proclamation 9705, as amended; Proclamation 9888, as amended; and Proclamation 10962.

Sec. 7. Delegation. (a) Consistent with applicable law, the Secretary and the Secretary of Homeland Security are directed and authorized to take all necessary actions to implement and effectuate this order — including through temporary suspension or amendment of regulations or through notices in the Federal Register and by adopting rules, regulations, or guidance — and to employ all powers granted to the President, including those granted by IEEPA and section 232, as may be necessary to implement and effectuate this order.

America’s prolific exports of oil, gas, and coal both create jobs at home and expand our Nation’s global influence. With clear-eyed leadership in Washington, D.C., the Trump Administration is now also mobilizing America’s agricultural abundance in pursuit of American energy dominance.

The multi-generational boom in American agricultural production is an often-overlooked success story. In 1925, American farmers produced 27.4 bushels of corn per acre, totaling 2.3 billion bushels across the country. This year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicts that national production of corn will set two new records of 188.8 bushels per acre and 16.7 billion bushels in total. A new record will also be set for soybeans, for which USDA predicts an historic yield of 53.6 bushels per acre. The grit and innovation of American farmers have unlocked these historically unparalleled harvests.

Skift Aviation Forum is where the answers come into focus.","Aviation has always moved in cycles, swinging from record profits to steep downturns with each economic shock or oil spike. But the turbulence facing the industry now feels different.

Supply chains are stretched thin, traveler behavior is fragmenting, and regulators are reshaping cost structures in real time.

As 2026 approaches, these five forces, among others, are setting the rules for how airlines compete and innovate. These are the very dynamics fueling the conversations at the Skift Aviation Forum, where leaders gather to map aviation’s next chapter.

1. Supply Chain Strains and Tariff Risks

Modern aircraft are global puzzles, assembled from thousands of parts sourced everywhere from Wichita to Shenzhen. That puzzle is increasingly missing pieces. Supply chain disruptions, worsened by new tariffs between the U.S., EU, and China, are driving up costs and delaying deliveries.

Boeing and its vast supplier base feel the crunch first, with ripple effects on airlines waiting for new fleets. A few points of tariff increase can mean billions in unexpected costs, layoffs across suppliers, and years of stalled growth plans. If trade tensions drag into 2026, airlines will be stuck with slower fleet modernization just as demand shifts keep accelerating.

2. Changing Demand Patterns and Market Uncertainties

Forecasting demand has always been an airline specialty, but 2025 has made those models wobble. Premium cabins and international routes, especially transatlantic, remain strong. U.S. domestic and economy-class demand, however, has softened. Several U.S. carriers have already trimmed forecasts, pointing to shaky consumer confidence.

Meanwhile, European groups are still betting big on long-haul. The lesson is clear: agility matters more than scale. Airlines that can pivot products quickly and redeploy capacity will keep an edge while others get caught off balance.

Want to hear from the leaders navigating this turbulence? Join JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty and Breeze Airways founder David Neeleman at Skift Aviation Forum.

3. Geopolitical Tensions and Route Adaptation

Every route map is now a negotiation. Wars, airspace closures, and diplomatic standoffs force carriers to redraw flight paths constantly, often at high cost. Each closure adds fuel burn, cuts into capacity, and limits growth.

Take India’s long-haul ambitions: aircraft orders are only half the story. Expanded access agreements are equally crucial, and without them, planes will sit idle. In a volatile geopolitical climate, airlines need as much savvy in diplomacy as in operations.

Sustainability has shifted from a marketing claim to a financial reality. In Europe, mandated use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has already added more than $1 billion in costs. Production, however, remains scarce. Airlines face fines for failing to hit ambitious blending targets, forcing them to balance compliance against credibility.

For travelers, that pressure can mean higher fares. For airlines, the real challenge is showing progress on emissions beyond what regulators require. The industry is being pushed to prove climate impact while absorbing higher costs.

5. Digital Transformation and Industry Consolidation

Behind the booking engines, airlines are racing to modernize their digital backbone. New Distribution Capability (NDC) promises sharper retailing and better margins, while data-driven systems are reshaping customer service and operations. At the same time, financial strain is pushing carriers toward consolidation.

Mergers are on the horizon, with stronger players eyeing growth and weaker ones seeking survival. By 2026, fewer competitors could mean more efficiency but also higher fares and reduced choice in some markets. The winners will be airlines that combine digital agility with smart acquisitions.

Continue the Conversation at Skift Aviation Forum

These forces are not passing headwinds but tectonic shifts, setting the stage for aviation’s next decade. Airlines, airports, and suppliers that fail to adapt risk being left behind.

The question is how quickly the change unfolds. Skift Aviation Forum is where the answers come into focus. Seats are filling fast.

What Is SAF?

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, derived from renewable biological sources. These include:

Biomass

Waste lipids

Sugars converted into hydrocarbons

Agricultural residues

Plant and animal oils & fats

Bio-derived hydrocarbons

Fatty acid esters

These sources make SAF a powerful tool in reducing the carbon footprint of air travel.

Why SAF Matters

One of SAF’s most compelling advantages is its compatibility with existing aircraft. It can be blended with conventional jet fuel up to 50%, offering a substantial reduction in emissions without requiring modifications to aircraft engines or infrastructure.

Even more promising, aircraft engines have successfully run on 100% unblended SAF, proving that the skies of tomorrow could be entirely powered by sustainable fuel.

The Future Is Flying Green

As the aviation industry embraces innovation and responsibility, SAF stands out as a key enabler of change. The future of flight is being redefined, cleaner, greener, and more sustainable than ever before.

In the Netherlands specifically, Shell said it has invested €6.5 billion in recent years for energy transition projects.
Shell’s decision to walk away from the Rotterdam biofuels follows the operator’s ongoing shift to focusing on projects that deliver both lower emissions and better returns.","Shell PLC said it has officially pulled the plug on subsidiary Shell Nederland Raffinaderij BV’s proposed biofuels plant in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

After calling an interim suspension of works on the planned 820,000-tonnes/year (tpy) biofuels plant last year to reassess the project's competitiveness, Shell said on Sept. 3 it will not resume construction on the plant following conclusions of an in-depth commercial and technical evaluation showing the investment no longer makes financial sense.

“It became clear the project wouldn’t be competitive enough to meet our customers’ demand for affordable, low-carbon products,” said Machteld de Haan, who leads Shell’s Downstream, Renewables, and Energy Solutions business. “It was a tough call, but the right one.”

Approved for final investment decision in 2021 and started for construction in 2022 at Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam, the plant was to become one of Europe’s biggest for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel made from waste, with SAF initially projected to make up more than half of the site’s production.

Despite the project’s cancellation, Shell said it remains committed to biofuels and will continue trading and supplying low-carbon fuels, including SAF.

While the Rotterdam project is off the table, the operator said it is investing heavily in other low-carbon areas, with $8 billion between 2023-24 dedicated to reduced-carbon technologies, including hydrogen, carbon capture, and electrification.

In the Netherlands specifically, Shell said it has invested €6.5 billion in recent years for energy transition projects. These include:

The Porthos carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at the port of Rotterdam that in 2026 will begin capturing and transporting carbon dioxide (CO2) from local industrial companies for storage in empty gas fields under the North Sea, including about 2.5 million tpy collected for a period of 15 years from Shell, ExxonMobil Corp., Air Liquide SA, and Air Products and Chemicals Inc.

The Holland Hydrogen 1 electrolyzer, a 200-Mw plant under construction that will be powered by offshore wind from the North Sea to produce up to 80 tonnes/day of hydrogen upon completion later this decade.

Upgrades to subsidiary Nederland Chemie BV’s Moerdijk’s petrochemicals plant, which hosts a 500,000-tpy steam cracker for ethylene production.

Shell’s decision to walk away from the Rotterdam biofuels follows the operator’s ongoing shift to focusing on projects that deliver both lower emissions and better returns.

Launched in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the EU, the study presented key findings on SAF’s growth potential in India ahead of ICAO’s Innovation Fair in Montreal. The workshop sets a comprehensive roadmap for SAF adoption across India, from production to deployment.

At the summit, Minister Ram Mohan Naidu noted:

SAF offers a practical and immediate pathway to decarbonise aviation, with the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The Minister added that scaling SAF production could reduce India’s carbon emissions by 20 to 25 million tonnes annually. Now one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, SAF could be critical to scaling Indian aviation while maintaining net-zero emissions targets.

As a country with over 750 million metric tonnes of biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, India is well-positioned to become a global hub for SAF manufacture and export. Additionally, the country’s young aircraft fleet is already among the most energy-efficient in the world, providing a solid foundation for further sustainable development.

India’s government has set ambitious targets for SAF deployment: 1% of total fuel for international flights by 2027, and an increase to 5% by 2030. Production at the first certified SAF refinery, Indian Oil’s Panipat, is expected to begin by the end of 2025.

While SAF could potentially reduce the carbon emissions of the energy-intense aviation sector significantly, its long-term feasibility has been challenged. A 2024 report from the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) labelled sustainable fuels ‘a false solution’ that are impossible to scale effectively in line with net-zero emissions targets.

Meanwhile, Shell announced on 3 September 2025 announced that they were cancelling the construction of their flagship biomass fuel facility in the Netherlands. The oil and gas giant had already paused the project in 2024 due to technical difficulties, but will now shelve it entirely. Machteld de Haan, head of downstream, renewables and energy solutions at Shell, said:

As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products.

With India preparing to scale SAF investment, the world will be watching closely to determine whether SAF can deliver on its promise to reduce emissions.

Join us at Aerospace Tech Week 2026 for our Sustainable Aerospace summit, where industry leaders will discuss the future of SAF and operational sustainability.

The company stated that completing the site no longer offered the necessary competitive conditions, following an internal reassessment of costs and market outlook.

A trade-off between profitability and industrial commitment

The President of Shell’s “Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions” division, Machteld de Haan, said that investments must meet “the expectations of customers and shareholders,” highlighting a portfolio optimisation strategy. Construction had already been suspended in July 2024. The plant was expected to become one of the largest biofuels facilities in Europe, with an annual capacity of 820,000 tonnes.

SAF, an emerging but fragile market

Among the planned outputs was Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), produced from used oils, algae or wood residues. This fuel can be blended up to 50% with kerosene in existing aircraft. Despite growing interest from the aviation sector, industrial production of SAF remains limited and its high cost continues to hinder adoption. Its commercial viability has not yet reached balance against conventional fossil fuel supply chains.

Capital allocation strategy under pressure

Shell had already announced in December the termination of new offshore wind projects. These successive decisions form part of a reorientation towards hydrocarbons, perceived as more profitable in the short term. While aligned with shareholder interests, this strategy comes as the group had previously communicated on a gradual shift towards alternative energies.

Industrial choices raising contradictions

Delta Air Lines has announced the successful delivery of over 400,000 gallons of blended Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into the fuel system at Portland International Airport (PDX). This marks the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at the airport, achieved through a collaboration with Shell and the Port of Portland.

The SAF was produced in the United States using waste-derived feedstock. Shell supplied the neat SAF, which was then blended with conventional jet fuel at Zenith Terminal in Portland to meet regulatory standards. The blended fuel was transported to PDX via barge, truck, and pipeline, entering the airport's privately owned fuel supply system earlier this month.

This initiative is part of Delta's broader strategy to expand its SAF footprint and increase the availability of sustainable fuel options across various airports. The airline has previously facilitated SAF deliveries to other hubs, including Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport (MSP) and Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW).

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is an alternative jet fuel derived from renewable sources, capable of reducing lifecycle carbon emissions by more than 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. Despite its environmental benefits, SAF production technology is still developing, resulting in limited availability and higher costs. Current production levels are insufficient to meet global airline fuel demands for even a single week.

Delta is actively working with local and federal stakeholders to establish a sustainable market and delivery infrastructure for SAF at the Port of Portland. The airline is also advocating for government incentives to boost SAF production and improve its cost competitiveness. In 2022, federal incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, were introduced, with the latter extended through 2029.

The delivery at PDX reflects Delta's ongoing efforts to demonstrate the viability and scalability of SAF across different airport systems. The airline's operations in Oregon include providing nonstop service from PDX to nearly all of Delta's hub airports, supported by a workforce of approximately 4,500 employees in the Pacific Northwest.",https://www.travelindustrywire.com/theme/Nevistas2/images/icon.png,N,,2025-09-04 17:56:23.485423

This year, BP put an SAF project at its Kwinana oil refinery in Australia on hold.
Of course, it may well be better for the planet if airlines filled up with SAF.
Even so, with the likes of Shell cutting back on SAF, Reeves’s game-changer may take a while to land.
Raising dough Some toppings would even fox Domino’s Pizza.","Sawan reckoned that by 2035 — Reeves’s panglossian date for the opening of the new runway — only “a very, very small proportion” of flights would be using SAF.

And now? Well, as if to drive the message home, Shell has just scrapped construction of one of Europe’s biggest biofuel plants: a site in Rotterdam due to produce SAF and renewable diesel. Hence a key question: if Shell can’t make a go of SAF, who can?

Listen to Shell executive Machteld de Haan and this was a site-specific decision, for which it’s now taking a post-tax hit of around $785 million: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products”.

Still, it was only in 2023 that Shell also opted not to go ahead with a SAF project at Singapore’s Bukom Island, due to supply Asian airports. And it’s hardly alone. This year, BP put an SAF project at its Kwinana oil refinery in Australia on hold.

World Energy said in March that it was putting SAF production at its California refinery into “warm idle”.

Of course, it may well be better for the planet if airlines filled up with SAF. But, as Sawan noted in February, it’s more expensive: two to four times the price of kerosene. So, “unless there are mandates — obligations on either customers or airlines — it is difficult to see a penetration that is going to be massive … airlines will not simply erode their bottom lines for the sake of it”. Worse, he’d seen “backsliding on mandates in multiple countries”, hitting Shell’s investments.

Britain’s mandate started this year at 2 per cent of total UK jet fuel demand, rising linearly to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040. So, even by then, 78 per cent of all flights will still be fuelled by kerosene. Other countries have similar mandates but, as the airline lobby group IATA said in June, SAF production will reach only 2 million tonnes this year — enough for “just 0.7 per cent of aviation’s total fuel needs”. As its boss Willie Walsh pointed out, “even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill”.

There are other issues. Scaling up the industry will need new feedstocks, such as non-food crops, which compete with road biodiesel, or other oils, such as palm, which lead to deforestation. In May last year the Institute for Policy think tank cast doubt on whether SAF even combatted climate change in a report titled: “Greenwashing the skies.” That is open to debate. Even so, with the likes of Shell cutting back on SAF, Reeves’s game-changer may take a while to land.

Raising dough

Some toppings would even fox Domino’s Pizza. Take the one demanded by its 5 per cent investor Browning West: an outfit that does seem to be struggling to make up its mind.

• Domino’s Pizza urged to return £100m to shareholders

Atop the tomato goo and mozzarella, it wants a blowout share buyback: £100 million, up from the £20 million the company’s presently serving up. It also wants a message spelt out in ham and pineapple that, with the shares at a “ten-year low” and earnings declining for the past five quarters, the chairman Ian Bull and chief executive Andrew Rennie will delay their distracting hunt for a “second brand” — pausing “any contemplated acquisitions for six months”. Still, here’s Browning’s pepperoni twist: if the board is hell-bent on a “multi-brand strategy”, it should “take the company private by actively identifying a credible private equity partner”.

What sort of pizza is that? A “Ham & Pineapple” crossed with an “Absolute Banger”? As Browning’s managing partner Usman Nabi, a Domino’s non-exec between 2019 and 2023, points out in his letter to the board, since 2014 the company’s “PE multiple has collapsed from 20 times to 11 times”. Given that and the bombed-out shares, why would Domino’s put itself up for sale now? Any bid would be light on dough.

Sure, by going public, Browning may start a debate over the best use of Domino’s capital and perhaps get backing from other big investors: the likes of Capital Group, with 14.4 per cent, and Abrams Capital, with 9.6 per cent. And the board needs to serve up something tastier, even if it has grown UK market share in a tough pizza takeaway market to 53.7 per cent. Yet the shares rose by less than 1 per cent to 207¼p, implying that Browning’s recipe is no sure-fire winner with investors. In fact, for now, it looks a bit half-baked.

Legacy The renewable energy embrace however, is unlikely to signal a pivot for the conglomerate.
India’s renewable energy roll-out has picked up pace in recent years.
Year-on-year capacity additions are driven by investors such as KLP backing New Delhi’s renewable energy vision.","Four years ago, Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani allocated $10bn for a ‘New Energy’ business. It was a notable change of tide, given the Indian conglomerate’s large-scale petroleum refining operation that Ambani spearheaded back in the 1990s.

That same year, RIL began work on a new integrated renewable energy manufacturing hub named after the group’s founder: the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex.

At the 2025 AGM, Anant Ambani – the chairman’s son - gave shareholders a glimpse into its scale. A build area four times the size Tesla’s gigafactory, a steel order large enough to build 100 Eifel Towers and a stretch of cables enough to ‘reach the moon and back’.

The tale of an Indian petroleum behemoth embracing the appeal of renewable energy begs two questions – why Reliance and why now?

New energy, old spirits

The gigafactory’s location adds to its symbolism. It is based in Jamnagar – the home of RIL’s largest refining complex. “Jamnagar is the face of New Reliance and New India”, said Anant Ambani in his address to shareholders.

“Products from the giga factories would be deployed for delivering round-the-clock renewable power and producing green chemicals, including green ammonia, e-methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel”, Ambani explained.

Alongside the gigafactory, Reliance has also expanded into other opportunities.

“In Kutch, Gujarat, we are developing one of the world's largest single-site solar projects spanning 5,50,000 acres of arid land – three times the size of Singapore”, Ambani noted.

Ambani also mentioned other simultaneous forays into the energy transition opportunity - solar PV, battery storage, green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel are all part of the plan.

Legacy

The renewable energy embrace however, is unlikely to signal a pivot for the conglomerate. In what was his first ever address at a Reliance AGM, Anant Ambani was quick to point out that legacy businesses have been doing well too.

The exploration business, where nearly a third of India’s natural gas supply comes from, earned a before tax income of $2.5bn. Production from the KG-D6 gas well was up 4% and new drilling is expected in 2026. Reliance is therefore seemingly convinced that the investment case for renewables does not necessarily erode the appeal of its legacy.

Investor interest

Reliance now joins a group of investors who, despite India’s fossil fuel dependence, are optimistic over the long-term. That group includes Norway’s largest pension provider, KLP.

In December last year, the fund announced a NOK 1.1bn ($100m) investment in an Indian grid company, in partnership with Norfund. The two entities acquired a 49% stake in an Indian solar farm two years prior.

“KLP's interest in investing in renewable energy in India is primarily related to the sector's financial attractiveness and the KLP group's strategy for sustainable and responsible investment”, says Eric Nasby, an investment analyst at KLP.

“We have invested in solar and wind power projects in India, in addition to electricity transmission networks. We continue to see opportunities in hybrid parks that often can combine solar and wind power with battery storage, as well as transmission”, Nasby told Net Zero Investor.

KLP’s investment thesis takes into account India’s current energy mix. 50.5% of the country’s installed power capacity still comes from fossil fuels.

“As we all know, India is one of the world's fastest growing markets and still very dependent on coal-fired power generation”, notes Nasby.

“As a result of this, investments in India have significant climate benefits. India also has a large well-functioning market for these investments and as a result it has become an important part of our investment portfolio”, he adds.

India’s renewable energy roll-out has picked up pace in recent years. As of June 2025, renewable energy installed capacity stood at 226.9 GW. The roll-out has been largely led by solar which accounts for 47% of non-fossil fuel power capacity.

Year-on-year capacity additions are driven by investors such as KLP backing New Delhi’s renewable energy vision. With Reliance joining their ranks, confidence and competition is now on the rise.

With clear-eyed leadership in Washington, D.C., the Trump Administration is now also mobilizing America’s agricultural abundance in pursuit of American energy dominance.

The multi-generational boom in American agricultural production is an often-overlooked success story. In 1925, American farmers produced 27.4 bushels of corn per acre, totaling 2.3 billion bushels across the country. This year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicts that national production of corn will set two new records of 188.8 bushels per acre and 16.7 billion bushels in total. A new record will also be set for soybeans, for which USDA predicts an historic yield of 53.6 bushels per acre. The grit and innovation of American farmers have unlocked these historically unparalleled harvests.

The dramatic increase in crop yields has helped to fuel food security at home and the production of biofuels across the country. Ethanol is now produced in 21 states and the United States has been a net-exporter of the fuel since 2010. Other biofuels—such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel—are produced in 22 plants across 13 states.

On the global stage, our Nation’s surging agricultural productivity presents unique opportunities for American leadership. In sharp contrast with America’s copious production of fossil and biofuels, countless countries around the world remain blighted by a lack of energy resources. For example, some 65% of the population in India suffers from one form or another of energy poverty. The American agricultural abundance means that these challenges can be ameliorated by trade and new export opportunities. By exporting the fruits of American agricultural innovation, farmers in the heartland can help bolster global access to desperately needed energy.

To make this possible, America First leadership in the Federal government is now tackling an often-unbalanced global trading playing field that unfairly constrains American energy. In June, the Trump Administration struck an initial trade accord with the United Kingdom, within which British tariffs on American ethanol were effectively abolished in exchange for removing tariffs on British aircraft parts. The deal gives American farmers tariff-free access to a market worth around $700 million each year.

But much work remains to be done. As the United States Trade Representative highlighted earlier this year, India maintains a ban on American fuel ethanol imports. Thailand similarly has restricted American ethanol imports since 2005. And Brazil—the world’s second largest producer of ethanol—maintains an 18% tariff on American ethanol. Breaking down these barriers and striking reciprocal trade deals that provide bilateral market access will benefit both American farmers and consumers around the world.

Ongoing trade discussions with the European Union also provide an opportunity to further American energy exports. In July, the Trump Administration struck an initial trade deal that commits the European Union to purchasing $750 billion worth of American energy exports over three years. To meet this enormous opportunity, and for Europe to uphold its end of the bargain, greater American biofuel exports will likely be necessary. European rules that unfairly limit American biofuel exports—such as the exclusion of crop-based feedstocks from the EU’s sustainable aviation fuel scheme—should be a topic of discussion as negotiations continue.

As President Trump declared on the first day of his second term, “America is blessed with an abundance of energy and natural resources that have historically powered our Nation’s economic prosperity.” Unleashed by America First policies, exporting abundant American biofuels worldwide will also help to propel American energy dominance.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/696210_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-09-04 11:56:22.773986

Shell abandons Rotterdam biofuels plant plan: Update

Shell abandons Rotterdam biofuels plant plan: Update

Updates with SAF, HVO pricing and fundamentals, adds quote from Shell London, 3 September (Argus) — Shell has abandoned a plan to build an 820,000 t/yr biofuels facility in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, saying it could not be competitive. Shell temporarily halted construction at the facility in July 2024. The plant was planned to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) — also known as renewable diesel — from waste feedstocks. It would have been the third largest HVO and SAF refinery in Europe, behind Preem and Neste's plants in the Sweden and the Netherlands, respectively. ""Following an in-depth commercial and technical evaluation to reassess the project's competitiveness, Shell will no longer proceed with the project,"" it said today. It already took an up to $1bn write down on the Rotterdam project. Shell has been streamlining its renewables production portfolio, and said most of its renewables activities were loss-making in the second quarter of 2025. Prices for SAF in 2025 had generally held below recent years and Argus Consulting expects a structural surplus of SAF supply globally until mandates rise in the 2030s. More plants are scheduled to come online globally, but the EU plans to keep mandates steady at 2pc until the end of this decade, and fresh SAF mandates from other countries are not expected to soak up the surplus. Spot prices in northwest Europe for HEFA-SPK — currently the primary commercial pathway for physical SAF — averaged around $1,939/t fob during January-September so far, compared with roughly $2,316/t during the same period last year. The HVO Class II fob ARA price averaged around $1,954/t and $1,626/t during the same periods. HVO and SAF can be made from used cooking oil via hydrotreatment, but HVO requires fewer processing steps, making it usually the cheaper grade. But recently, HVO had fetched higher prices, supported by firm demand. An increase in spot demand for HVO has been supported by changes to renewable fuel ticket carryover rules. Tickets are tradeable credits primarily generated by the sale of biofuel-blended fuels and are used to help obligated parties meet mandates for the use of renewable energy in transport. The Netherlands cut its allowance from 25pc to 10pc for 2025 compliance, and Germany froze its carry-over, reducing flexibility for obligated blenders and prompting more near-term buying. Protectionist trade tariffs have also been reshaping HVO trade. The EU imposed anti-dumping duties on Chinese biodiesel and HVO in February in addition to anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties in place for HVO and biodiesel of US and Canadian origin. US-origin HVO flows to the UK were unaffected, but London began an anti-dumping investigation into US HVO in March, which could raise demand for European product instead.

By integrating global best practices with India’s unique socio-economic and environmental context, the report outlines a strategic roadmap to establish a robust domestic SAF market.

A two-day workshop accompanying the launch brought together stakeholders from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), industry participants, and multiple government departments, demonstrating a unified whole-of-government approach towards sustainable aviation development.

Government Commitment and Strategic Targets

Union Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu highlighted SAF’s crucial role in decarbonising India’s aviation sector. The Minister stated, “SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonise the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO2 emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional fuel”.

He reiterated India’s ambitious blending targets – aiming for 1percent SAF blending by 2027, 2 percent by 2028, and 5 percent by 2030 – in line with the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) mandate.

The Minister pointed to India’s abundant biomass resources, including over 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, to meet its domestic SAF demand and even emerge as an exporter.

Milestones and Economic Benefits

Naidu commended critical progress made so far, such as the designation of COTECNA Inspection India as the country’s first SAF certification body and the certification of Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery as India’s first SAF producer.

He underscored that SAF production will contribute significantly to reducing India’s crude oil imports and cutting emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually.

88 Airports Transitioned to Green Energy Usage

Secretary of Civil Aviation Samir Kumar Sinha highlighted that India operates one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient aircraft fleets globally and that 88 airports have transitioned entirely to green energy usage, setting exemplary standards.

Director General of Civil Aviation Faiz Ahmed noted that India is currently the world’s third-largest aviation market, with passenger traffic expected to double to 500 million by 2030. He lauded the SAF Feasibility Study as a critical tool that will provide strategic insights necessary to shape India’s national SAF policy framework, ensuring aviation growth aligns with sustainability goals.

In 2024, Shell Nederland Raffinaderij temporarily halted the construction of the facility due to current market conditions impacting project delivery and competitiveness.

Shell had taken a final investment decision on the Rotterdam biofuels plant in September 2021. The plant was designed to produce 820,000 tonnes a year of SAF and renewable diesel.

Shell downstream, renewables and energy solutions president Machteld de Haan said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders”

“We continue to believe that low carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system. Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including SAF.”

The company also confirmed that the Netherlands continues to be a crucial location for its diverse energy operations, which include upstream oil and gas production and a network of retail sites.

Shell said that it has invested €6.5bn in various energy transition projects within the country. These include CO2 storage initiatives like the Porthos CCS project and the development of renewable hydrogen at Holland Hydrogen 1.

The company had earmarked an expenditure of $8bn on lower carbon alternatives between 2023 and 2024. These investments covered areas such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and low-carbon fuels.

In 2024, Shell emerged as a major player in the sustainable aviation fuel market, particularly in North America and Europe where it is said to have contributed nearly 20% of total sales.

The Avelia platform, developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express GBT, is another key initiative by Shell to bolster the supply and demand for SAF. By March 2025, more than 57 corporations and airlines had engaged in transactions via Avelia, resulting in over 33 million gallons of SAF being integrated into existing fuel networks.

In addition to these initiatives, Shell’s joint venture in Brazil with Raizen focuses on delivering low-carbon bioethanol. In 2022, Shell expanded its capabilities by acquiring EcoOils, a waste recycling company that produces advanced biofuels feedstock in Malaysia and Indonesia.

EcoOils utilises advanced recycling technology to process waste into valuable feedstocks like Spent Bleaching Earth Oil (SBEO) and Refined Palm Oil Mill Effluent (R-POME).",https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Shell.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 13:56:40.918815

The technology, now progressing towards ASTM certification, converts mixed waste plastics into a direct drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that can be seamlessly blended with conventional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft and fuel infrastructure.
“Our mission is simple: tackle two global challenges at once – plastic pollution and aviation emissions,” said Dr Odjo.
The SAFe-P2SAF technology builds on Clean Planet Technologies’ flagship SAFe Hydroprocessing system, already proven at commercial scale for upgrading pyrolysis oils into low-carbon fuels.
“Today marks the start of an exciting few months for Clean Planet Technologies,” added Dr Odjo.","Dr Andrew Odjo, CEO of Clean Planet Technologies (CPTech), and CTO of Clean Planet Energy, part of the Clean Planet Group, today unveiled the UK’s first Plastics-to-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (P2SAF) technology during a keynote speech at the prestigious SAF Global Summit 2025 in London.

Addressing more than 500 policymakers, energy leaders, airlines, and investors, Dr Andrew Odjo, introduced the company’s proprietary SAFe-P2SAF system – a breakthrough process designed to transform hard-to-recycle waste plastics into ultra-clean, low-carbon jet fuel that could meet the stringent aviation standards.

The technology, now progressing towards ASTM certification, converts mixed waste plastics into a direct drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that can be seamlessly blended with conventional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft and fuel infrastructure. With a potential 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil jet fuels and the ability to divert thousands of tonnes of plastic from landfill and incineration, SAFe-P2SAF represents a major step towards decarbonising one of the most challenging sectors in the race to Net Zero 2050 and building the bridge towards clean air.

“Our mission is simple: tackle two global challenges at once – plastic pollution and aviation emissions,” said Dr Odjo. “With SAFe-P2SAF, we’re turning a waste problem into a climate solution, supporting the UK’s ambitions for SAF production and helping diversify feedstock beyond traditional pathways like HEFA, which face growing supply pressures.”

CPTech’s innovation comes at a pivotal time for the industry. With REFUEL EU Aviation’s 2% SAF blend target launching in 2025, the UK’s pioneering SAF mandate, and increasing investor interest in circular feedstocks, the race is on to scale production and secure supply chains for sustainable aviation fuels.

The SAFe-P2SAF technology builds on Clean Planet Technologies’ flagship SAFe Hydroprocessing system, already proven at commercial scale for upgrading pyrolysis oils into low-carbon fuels. By adapting this platform to process plastic-derived feedstocks into ultra-clean SAF, CPTech aims to place the UK at the forefront of feedstock diversity and innovation for sustainable aviation.

The company’s upcoming roadmap includes progressing ASTM certification, developing its first pilot-scale P2SAF facility in the UK later in 2025, and expanding partnerships with key industry stakeholders to accelerate deployment attractive to investors.

“Today marks the start of an exciting few months for Clean Planet Technologies,” added Dr Odjo. “With a new facility announcement coming at the end of this year, our focus remains on scaling solutions that deliver real environmental impact while supporting the UK’s leadership in sustainable aviation.”

This significant achievement, marking a new chapter in the airline’s sustainability efforts, signals Delta’s ongoing commitment to reducing aviation’s carbon footprint and embracing cleaner fuel alternatives.

A Historic Delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The successful delivery at Portland International Airport saw more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF made from waste-derived feedstock. Shell was responsible for supplying the neat SAF, which was then blended with traditional jet fuel at Zenith Terminal in Portland to meet regulatory standards. The blended fuel was delivered to PDX via barge, truck, and pipeline. This milestone follows Delta’s broader strategy to enhance SAF availability at key U.S. airports and support the growth of sustainable aviation practices in the industry.

The first delivery into the Portland International Airport fuel system is not just about fueling airplanes but also represents a crucial step in unlocking the potential of SAF to significantly reduce lifecycle carbon emissions in aviation. SAF has the ability to reduce emissions by over 80% when compared to traditional jet fuel, making it a vital tool in the fight against climate change.

The Role of Industry Collaboration in Expanding SAF Availability

According to Charlotte Lollar, Delta’s SAF Director, this achievement demonstrates the power of industry collaboration. By working with Shell and the Port of Portland, Delta is able to utilize existing infrastructure to scale SAF access at more airports, proving the fuel’s viability and laying the foundation for future expansion. Delta’s ongoing efforts to integrate SAF into its operations are part of a larger strategy to improve sustainability across the aviation sector.

This collaboration is a prime example of how airlines, fuel suppliers, and airport authorities can work together to drive change in the industry. The Port of Portland’s Chief Aviation Officer, Dan Pippenger, highlighted that this initiative is crucial for improving local air quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, benefiting both the airport’s operations and the surrounding community. With this move, PDX is positioning itself as a leader in the development and adoption of sustainable aviation practices.

Expanding Delta’s Commitment to Sustainability

While the delivery of SAF to Portland is a landmark event for Delta Air Lines, the airline is not stopping there. Delta has previously secured SAF deliveries to other major hubs such as Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) and Detroit (DTW), underscoring its commitment to expanding SAF usage across its network. This move is part of a larger industry-wide push for greener aviation and reflects the airline’s broader sustainability goals.

Delta’s expansion of SAF initiatives is directly aligned with efforts to advocate for government incentives to support SAF production and availability. At the federal level, U.S. Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon has championed significant policy advancements, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. These tax credits are expected to increase SAF production and lower its costs, making it more accessible for airlines. Delta’s active participation in pushing for these incentives ensures that SAF will play a central role in the airline’s future growth and environmental strategy.

Enhancing Local Operations in Oregon

Delta’s commitment to the Oregon region extends beyond sustainability. The airline continues to operate a robust service network at Portland International Airport (PDX), offering direct flights to nearly all of Delta’s hub airports across the United States. With this SAF delivery, the airline not only strengthens its environmental commitment but also enhances its operational footprint in Oregon, providing residents with access to over 300 one-stop destinations.

Delta’s workforce in the Pacific Northwest comprises nearly 4,500 employees, and the airline remains committed to its community engagement efforts. The introduction of SAF to Portland reflects both an environmental and operational commitment, ensuring that Delta’s actions align with the region’s broader sustainability goals.

The Challenges of Scaling SAF

Despite the promise of SAF, scaling its production to meet the aviation industry’s needs remains a challenge. SAF technology is still in its early stages, and the current production capacity is insufficient to fuel the world’s airlines for even a single week. Delta’s collaboration with Shell, the Port of Portland, and other stakeholders aims to build the necessary infrastructure and expand SAF production. These efforts are essential for overcoming the barriers that currently limit SAF’s widespread use.

The costs of SAF remain high, primarily due to the nascent stage of its production, which makes it a relatively expensive alternative to traditional jet fuel. However, as production scales and the technology improves, SAF is expected to become more cost-competitive and widely accessible.

Looking Toward the Future of Aviation

The delivery of SAF at Portland International Airport marks a significant step in Delta’s broader commitment to environmental sustainability. By leveraging existing infrastructure, collaborating with key industry players, and advocating for supportive policy frameworks, Delta is setting the stage for the future of sustainable aviation. The successful integration of SAF into Delta’s operations demonstrates that aviation can move towards more sustainable and eco-friendly fuel alternatives, aligning with global environmental goals.

As Delta continues to expand its SAF footprint and work towards making it a mainstream aviation fuel, the industry’s push for greener alternatives will become increasingly important. The airline’s ongoing efforts serve as an example of how the aviation industry can play an active role in mitigating climate change while maintaining operational excellence.

Conclusion: A Step Toward a Greener Aviation Future

Sanchez recommended Auckland embed sustainability into all its economic initiatives, rather than treating them as separate issues.

“The economy and environment are intrinsically linked. Doing this research made me realise just how much the two overlap,” she says.

Samuel Desai and Sarah Oyegoke have just finished internships at Vector.

Desai looked at global electricity markets to find models that might help Vector encourage customers to use more electricity during non-peak times.

Oyegoke’s research aimed to help Vector prepare for the introduction of time of use power pricing, following a government move to require power retailers to offer time of use pricing by June 2026.

She surveyed more than 2850 people, discovering that about 24 percent of energy use is currently shifted to more affordable, off-peak times.

“I recommend time of use plans, because they can be beneficial for customers,” Oyegoke says.

As an intern at Auckland FC, Reilly McKnight focused on making training sessions and match days more sustainable.

Transport made up a huge part of the club’s greenhouse gas emissions, so he suggested supporting sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsetting.

McKnight helped bring public transport into the cost of match tickets, allowing the club to significantly reduce the number of fans travelling to matches in private vehicles.

As many as 82 percent of fans used private vehicles when there were no trains, but 43 percent used trains when they were offered within the ticket price, he says.

Installing water coolers has helped reduce the use of plastic water bottles, while reusable metal cups could replace single-use plastic for fans buying drinks in the future, McKnight says.

Solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations are also being introduced at some Auckland stadiums to increase sustainability.

The paid internships in Auckland were spearheaded by Stanford Dean Arun Majumdar and prominent US-based New Zealanders Tim Brown, a former professional footballer and co-founder of sustainable footwear company Allbirds, and Anthony Mosse, investment director for New Zealand Trade and Enterprise in North America.

Beggs hopes this year’s internship programme is the first of many to come.

He highlighted the possibility of creating a multinational company with Central American and Caribbean countries dedicated to producing biofuel derived from the algae.
“This would help us address a common problem and benefit all of us if we enter the international aviation market,” Samaniego said.
The program is being rolled out in phases before becoming mandatory for all international flights in 2027.","The federal government could invest in a project to transform the sargassum that washes up on the beaches of the Mexican Caribbean into jet biofuel. The initiative would involve the creation of a multinational company in collaboration with Central American and Caribbean countries.

During the Siemens Energy Forum held in Mexico City, José Samaniego, Deputy Minister of Sustainable Development and Circular Economy, SEMARNAT, announced that authorities are evaluating a plan to use sargassum as a feedstock for aviation biofuel. He highlighted the possibility of creating a multinational company with Central American and Caribbean countries dedicated to producing biofuel derived from the algae. “This would help us address a common problem and benefit all of us if we enter the international aviation market,” Samaniego said.

The rapid growth of sargassum along the Caribbean beaches has created significant social and political pressure. Alicia Bárcena, Minister, SEMARNAT, emphasized that sargassum blooms across the Caribbean exceed 5Mt, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts between regional and national authorities to address the problem effectively. Leticia Durand, Researcher, UNAM’s Regional Center for Multidisciplinary Research, reported that the cost of removing sargassum can exceed US$1 million per kilometer of beach per year, making long-term solutions critical.

If the proposed project moves forward, it would give sargassum a productive use while potentially lowering costs for airlines. Currently, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is approximately 3.5 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, posing a significant financial challenge for widespread adoption.

Recently, the state-owned company Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA) announced an investment of MX$300 million (US$16 million) to expand a mixing plant in Cancun. This facility produces biofuel from used cooking oil and is considered a first step toward integrating other raw materials, such as sargassum, into production.

Samaniego also noted that such a project would help airlines comply with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) mandate to decarbonize flights starting in 2027, established under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

CORSIA is a global plan designed to stabilize the growth of CO₂ emissions from international aviation by requiring airlines to purchase carbon credits for each ton emitted above 85% of 2019 levels. According to ICAO, buying credits is intended to be a last-resort measure, after airlines have implemented other emissions-reduction strategies. These strategies include making aircraft and engines more efficient and lighter, optimizing take-off and landing procedures, and adopting electric engines for short-haul flights.

The program is being rolled out in phases before becoming mandatory for all international flights in 2027. During the pilot phase (2021–2023) and the first phase (2024–2026), offsetting applies only to flights between countries that volunteer to participate. However, as of this year, 129 countries, including Mexico, are part of the scheme.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-09/refueling-the-aircraft-2025-02-16-11-53-02-utc.jpg?h=f4859225&itok=mOUCGBHN,N,,2025-09-04 06:57:44.105418

Assessing India’s Readiness for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The feasibility study, carried out under ICAO’s ACT-SAF Programme, examines the potential for producing and utilising drop-in SAF within India. Key areas of assessment include domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, necessary infrastructure, and policy readiness.

By integrating global best practices with India’s unique socio-economic and environmental context, the report outlines a strategic roadmap to establish a robust domestic SAF market.

A two-day workshop accompanying the launch brought together stakeholders from ICAO, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), industry participants, and multiple government departments, demonstrating a unified whole-of-government approach towards sustainable aviation development.

Government Commitment and Strategic Targets

Union Civil Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu highlighted SAF’s crucial role in decarbonising India’s aviation sector. The Minister stated, “SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonise the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO2 emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional fuel”.

He reiterated India’s ambitious blending targets - aiming for 1percent SAF blending by 2027, 2 percent by 2028, and 5 percent by 2030 - in line with the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) mandate.

The Minister pointed to India’s abundant biomass resources, including over 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, to meet its domestic SAF demand and even emerge as an exporter.

Milestones and Economic Benefits

Naidu commended critical progress made so far, such as the designation of COTECNA Inspection India as the country’s first SAF certification body and the certification of Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery as India’s first SAF producer.

He underscored that SAF production will contribute significantly to reducing India’s crude oil imports and cutting emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually.

88 Airports Transitioned to Green Energy Usage

Secretary of Civil Aviation Samir Kumar Sinha highlighted that India operates one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient aircraft fleets globally and that 88 airports have transitioned entirely to green energy usage, setting exemplary standards.

Director General of Civil Aviation Faiz Ahmed noted that India is currently the world’s third-largest aviation market, with passenger traffic expected to double to 500 million by 2030. He lauded the SAF Feasibility Study as a critical tool that will provide strategic insights necessary to shape India’s national SAF policy framework, ensuring aviation growth aligns with sustainability goals.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/09/03/sustainable-aviation-fuel-a-practical-solution-to-decarbonise-the-aviation-sector-goi-2025-09-03-16-21-52.jpg,N,,2025-09-04 00:56:09.815126

The young mango, plumeria, ʻulu, puakenikeni and dozens of other plant varieties are part of a large initiative to revegetate properties in Lahaina, Kula and other neighborhoods that were devasted by the 2023 wildfires.

This week, 20 Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines volunteers potted 80 more trees that are now lining the lawn outside the airport’s TSA checkpoint. Hawaiian Airlines also announced a new $30,000 donation to Treecovery Hawai‘i, adding to its previous $50,000 foundation grant to the Maui nonprofit behind the tree-growing effort on the Valley Isle. Once matured, trees will be transported and gifted to families and businesses impacted by fires that destroyed over 20,000 trees in Lahaina and 300 acres in Kula.

Kahului Airport is among the latest of 28 grow hubs Treecovery has sprouted from Hāna to Kapalua, half of which were created in partnership with resorts. Treecovery also has an operation in Kapalua that serves as a grow hub, educational space for kamaʻāina, and a site to host corporate groups that want to help pot trees, and a farm within the 25-acre Hua Momona Farms and Foundation to support residents facing food insecurity. Additionally, the group works with the Lahaina Restoration Foundation and Moku‘ula and Mokuhinia to provide native Hawaiian trees at all the historic locations in Lahaina.

To raise funds, Treecovery accepts donations and has partnered with artists, including Dale Zarella, who is carving burned logs, and ukulele-maker Steve Grimes, with half of sales proceeds benefiting the nonprofit.

The need for trees is growing as communities rebuild. As of last week, 55 new homes have been completed, with 486 building permits issued and hundreds more being processed by the county, according to Maui Recovery. Treecovery recommends planting trees once projects are finished, and Murasako said trees have been delivered to 20 homes so far. Residents are encouraged to apply to receive trees. They can also request native Hawaiian trees managed by the University of Hawaiʻi Maui College School of Agriculture.

In July 2024, Shell announced it was pausing on-site construction “to address project delivery and ensure future competitiveness given current market conditions.”

Following an in-depth commercial and technical evaluation to reassess the project’s competitiveness, Shell on Sept.3 announced it will no longer proceed with the project.

“As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products,” said Machteld de Haan, downstream, renewables and energy solutions president at Shell. “This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritize our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders”

“We continue to believe that low carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system,” De Haan added. “Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world's largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).”

Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with Shell and Portland International Airport (PDX), has taken delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into the PDX fuel system, marking the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at PDX. This achievement not only expands Delta’s SAF footprint but positions PDX – owned and operated by the Port of Portland – to capitalize on the continued growth of SAF across the U.S.

The batch of more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF was made in the U.S. from waste-derived feedstock. Shell supplied the neat SAF shipment to Zenith Terminal in Portland where it was blended with traditional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements, then delivered to PDX via barge, truck and pipeline. Earlier this month, the blended SAF entered the airport’s privately owned fuel supply system.

“Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel,” said Charlotte Lollar, Delta’s SAF director. “By working with Shell and the Port of Portland to tap into existing infrastructure, we’re able to access SAF at more airports and continue to prove its viability and ultimately scale it in a way the industry needs.”

“We're excited about this step toward bringing Sustainable Aviation Fuel to PDX. It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities,” said Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger. “We're looking forward to working with our partners to make sure state and local policies support development of the infrastructure and market needed to bring SAF here on a larger scale – and unlock all of the health and environmental benefits it offers.”

Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland. Delta is also working at the federal level and across key states to advocate for continued and new government incentives that will increase production, improve cost-competitiveness and make SAF more accessible at scale. In 2022, Oregon U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, then Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, championed enactment of the first federal SAF incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and creating the current fuel-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. 40B and 45Z provided the initial policy frameworks for state level incentives emerging across the country and 45Z was extended by the U.S. Congress this year through 2029.

California is the only state in the nation that does not currently allow the sale of E15.
“Many other states have already seen the benefits of E15—healthier air, better engine performance, and cost savings at the pump.
While California’s recently finalized 2025-2026 state budget includes funding for CARB to complete the E15 approval process, AB30 allows the fuel to be sold while CARB’s work progresses.","Lower-cost E15 is now just one step away from becoming a legal fuel in California, as the state Senate voted 39–0 today to pass Assembly Bill 30. The bill, which would legalize E15 immediately upon the governor’s signature, now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for final approval. California is the only state in the nation that does not currently allow the sale of E15.

“With today’s passage of AB30, California is taking a big step toward lower gas prices and a cleaner, more sustainable future for families across the state,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association. “Many other states have already seen the benefits of E15—healthier air, better engine performance, and cost savings at the pump. Now, California drivers are on the cusp of experiencing those same advantages, and we urge Gov. Newsom to sign the bill into law as quickly as possible. E15 will provide relief at the pump for Californians who continue to face the highest gas prices in the country.”

Cooper continued, “We applaud the California legislature for swiftly passing this critical bill, and we especially thank the bipartisan California Problem Solvers Caucus for bringing awareness and attention to this issue. AB30’s sponsors, Assemblymembers David Alvarez and Heath Flora, also deserve special recognition for their leadership in opening the California marketplace to more affordable, cleaner fuel options.”

“California’s regulatory agencies have reviewed the E15 gasoline blend for nearly eight years and have yet to issue any rulings,” said Assemblymember Alvarez. “This unnecessary holdup has prevented California’s drivers from accessing a cleaner, more affordable fuel option that’s already approved across the country. AB 30 sends a clear message: Californians cannot afford to wait while bureaucracy stalls progress. This bill delivers economic benefits to Californians struggling with high fuel prices, and I am especially grateful to the Problem Solvers Caucus for their partnership on this commonsense solution.”

Recent studies show E15 could save California drivers $2.7 billion annually, or $200 per household, and significantly cut the emissions of tailpipe pollutants that create smog and contribute to illness and disease.

Gov. Newsom has expressed his support for legalizing E15, saying last year that “there is massive potential for this [E15] to be a win-win for Californians: lowering gas prices by up to twenty cents per gallon while keeping our air clean.”

RFA has been leading the effort to secure E15 approval in California for the past seven years, Cooper noted, beginning with the 2018 initiation of a “multimedia evaluation” of E15 in collaboration with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and other ethanol industry stakeholders. While California’s recently finalized 2025-2026 state budget includes funding for CARB to complete the E15 approval process, AB30 allows the fuel to be sold while CARB’s work progresses.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/1438/1000/Calif+roads.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 18:56:58.736621

“Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel,” said Charlotte Lollar, Delta’s SAF director.
Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland.
Delta maintains a strong and growing presence in Oregon, underscored by the airline’s strategic operations at Portland International Airport (PDX).
From PDX, Delta offers Oregonians nonstop service to nearly all of Delta’s hub airports, providing customers with more than 300 one-stop destinations.","Delta Air Lines, in collaboration with Shell and Portland International Airport (PDX), has taken delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into the PDX fuel system, marking the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at PDX. This achievement not only expands Delta’s SAF footprint but positions PDX – owned and operated by the Port of Portland – to capitalize on the continued growth of SAF across the U.S.

The batch of more than 400,000 gallons of blended SAF was made in the U.S. from waste-derived feedstock. Shell supplied the neat SAF shipment to Zenith Terminal in Portland where it was blended with traditional jet fuel to meet regulatory requirements, then delivered to PDX via barge, truck and pipeline. Earlier this month, the blended SAF entered the airport’s privately owned fuel supply system.

“Every SAF delivery is a powerful example of how industry collaboration can unlock markets for sustainable aviation fuel,” said Charlotte Lollar, Delta’s SAF director. “By working with Shell and the Port of Portland to tap into existing infrastructure, we’re able to access SAF at more airports and continue to prove its viability and ultimately scale it in a way the industry needs.”

“We're excited about this step toward bringing Sustainable Aviation Fuel to PDX. It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities,” said Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger. “We're looking forward to working with our partners to make sure state and local policies support development of the infrastructure and market needed to bring SAF here on a larger scale – and unlock all of the health and environmental benefits it offers.”

SAF is an alternative jet fuel made from renewable sources that can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by more than 80%, when compared to conventional jet fuel' + drupalSettings.data.extlink.extLabel + '. Existing jet fuel infrastructure can be leveraged to deliver SAF to airports today, and it is safe to use in current aircraft engines. However, the technology to produce it remains nascent, so it is expensive and not widely available. In fact, there is not enough SAF in production today to fuel the world's airlines for a single week. This is why the work to scale SAF and bring it to new markets, like Portland, is so important.

Locally, Delta is working with the Port of Portland and other key stakeholders to enable a sustained market and delivery structure for SAF at the Port of Portland. Delta is also working at the federal level and across key states to advocate for continued and new government incentives that will increase production, improve cost-competitiveness and make SAF more accessible at scale. In 2022, Oregon U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, then Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, championed enactment of the first federal SAF incentives, including the 40B SAF Blenders Tax Credit and creating the current fuel-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. 40B and 45Z provided the initial policy frameworks for state level incentives emerging across the country and 45Z was extended by the U.S. Congress this year through 2029.

This delivery represents the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at PDX, building on Delta’s broader SAF strategy, which includes previous deliveries to hubs like Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) and Detroit (DTW). This milestone also reflects the airline’s ongoing efforts to expand SAF availability and prove its repeatability and scalability across diverse airport systems.

Undertaken under the ICAO ACT-SAF Program, the feasibility study assesses the potential for producing and utilizing drop-in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in India. It evaluates domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, infrastructure and policy readiness and the enabling conditions needed to establish a robust domestic SAF market.

Drawing upon international best practices and tailoring them to India’s socio-economic and environmental context, the report provides a roadmap for sustainable fuel adoption.

The study is being deliberated at a two-day workshop at Udaan Bhawan, New Delhi, with participation from ICAO, EASA, DGCA, industry partners, and multiple government departments, reflecting a whole-of-government approach towards SAF.

Welcoming stakeholders to this landmark event, the Minister underscored SAF’s critical role in advancing India’s sustainable aviation growth. He reaffirmed India’s readiness to become self-sufficient in SAF production, targeting 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in line with the CORSIA mandate.

The Minister stated, “SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonize the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional fuel”.

He further highlighted that with over 750 million metric tons of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tons of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter.

Shri Ram Mohan Naidu pointed to important milestones already achieved, including the designation of COTECNA Inspection India Pvt. Ltd. as the country’s first SAF certification body and the certification of Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery as India’s first SAF producer.

The Minister emphasized that SAF production will not only reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tons annually, but also boost farmers’ incomes by creating a strong value chain for agricultural residue and biomass.

“Under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India is on track to become the world’s largest domestic aviation market. With a collaborative approach, we are committed to positioning India as a leader in green aviation”, Minister Shri Ram Mohan Naidu added.

The Secretary underlined that global warming is a collective challenge and mitigating its impact is a shared responsibility. He reiterated India’s commitment to the UNFCCC framework and emphasized that India already operates one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient aircraft fleets in the world. He also noted that 88 airports have already transitioned to 100% green energy usage, setting benchmarks for global best practices.

For Moeve, this initiative represents a strategic step forward in developing a differentiated route to e-SAF, distinct from the Fischer-Tropsch pathway.
This pathway offers synergies such as economy of scale and a flexible approach to scaling low-carbon aviation fuels, a crucial need given that aviation contributes approximately 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions globally.
The Global Impact Coalition provides the collaborative platform and vision needed to drive these breakthrough innovations at scale.” Charlie Tan, CEO of the Global Impact Coalition, said: “This spin-off exemplifies the power of cross-industry collaboration to advance low-carbon chemicals and sustainable aviation fuel.
Simultaneously, as the global green methanol market is set to triple by 2030, this initiative is positioned to benefit from emerging sustainable methanol markets worldwide.","Moeve has joined forces with other member companies of the Global Impact Coalition (GIC) to advance a new methanol-based pathway to electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) and low-carbon chemicals in Europe. Starting with a feasibility study, the companies have formalized a dedicated spin-off structure to accelerate the development of this innovative route based on Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) technology — a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based production routes.

For Moeve, this initiative represents a strategic step forward in developing a differentiated route to e-SAF, distinct from the Fischer-Tropsch pathway. The process enables to convert e-methanol into e-SAF through the production of sustainable olefins. This pathway offers synergies such as economy of scale and a flexible approach to scaling low-carbon aviation fuels, a crucial need given that aviation contributes approximately 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions globally. Advancing such alternatives is essential to decarbonizing one of the hardest-to-abate sectors.

At the same time, sustainable olefins serve as essential intermediates for a broad range of low-carbon chemical applications, including polymers and materials used in packaging, mobility, consumer goods, and industrial sectors.

“This initiative marks a strategic step forward in Moeve’s ambition to lead the development of new low-carbon value chains,” said Carlos Barrasa, Executive Vice President of Commercial and Clean Energies at Moeve. “By advancing sustainable methanol-based pathways, we are enabling the future production of e-SAF while also supporting the transformation of the chemical industry through cleaner feedstocks. The Global Impact Coalition provides the collaborative platform and vision needed to drive these breakthrough innovations at scale.”

Charlie Tan, CEO of the Global Impact Coalition, said: “This spin-off exemplifies the power of cross-industry collaboration to advance low-carbon chemicals and sustainable aviation fuel. We are uniting leading companies like Moeve around a shared vision for sustainable methanol-based feedstock, setting a precedent for how industrial transformation can be achieved at scale.”

Now operating as a spin-off from the Global Impact Coalition, the project continues its feasibility study, which is set to run through late 2026. This phase will assess the technical and economic potential of building a first-of-its-kind sustainable olefins production facility in Europe, leveraging MTO as a next-generation process for low-carbon industrial transformation.

With Europe’s chemical sector facing structural challenges — including high energy costs and increasing regulatory pressure — the development of innovative, low-carbon industrial assets offers a timely opportunity to modernize production and regain industrial competitiveness. Simultaneously, as the global green methanol market is set to triple by 2030, this initiative is positioned to benefit from emerging sustainable methanol markets worldwide.

Faced with weak market conditions, the company last year suspended construction of the renewables biofuel factory in Rotterdam that was intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and diesel from waste.

“As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive,” Machteld de Haan, Shell’s downstream, renewables and energy solutions president, said in a statement.

The project was first announced in 2021 as part of plans to help Europe meet internationally binding emissions reduction targets.

Shell and rival UK energy giant BP have been walking back various climate objectives and focusing more on oil and gas to raise their profits, which has drawn criticism from environmental activists.

More than half of the facility’s capacity was intended to produce SAF — a biofuel made from plant and animal materials like cooking oil and fat which produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel.

Under plans to tackle climate change, the EU requires airlines to gradually increase the amount of SAF they use to power planes.

Airlines, however, complain that SAF is not widely available and too expensive.

Transforming how we produce essential building blocks like olefins is key to reducing emissions in the chemical sector and related value chains, such as aviation.”

— Charlie Tan, CEO of the Global Impact Coalition

GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, September 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Global Impact Coalition (GIC), a CEO-led coalition committed to advancing a circular, net-zero future for the chemical value chain, announces the launch of a dedicated spin-off structure to advance its Sustainable Olefins project. Starting with a feasibility study, this marks the first step toward exploring a new methanol-based route to electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) and low-carbon chemicals in Europe.

A group of GIC member companies have joined forces to evaluate the technical and economic potential of using methanol-to-olefins (MTO) technology as a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based production processes. The group will assess the viability of converting sustainable methanol into olefins, the essential building blocks of fuels and advanced materials. The newly formed spin-off structure is designed to facilitate deeper collaboration, explore investment, and prepare the groundwork for potential project development.

“Transforming how we produce essential building blocks like olefins is key to reducing emissions in the chemical sector and related value chains, such as aviation” said Charlie Tan, CEO of the Global Impact Coalition. “The announcement today signals the growing momentum toward transforming the global chemical sector at a time when new technologies are urgently needed to meet climate and business goals.”

By converting sustainable methanol into sustainable olefins, the MTO approach offers a scalable, electrifiable alternative to conventional steam cracking. Sustainable olefins are essential to manufacturing low-carbon polymers and materials used in packaging, mobility, consumer goods, and industrial applications. Utilizing e-methanol, the MTO process enables the production of e-SAF, offering a flexible, scalable pathway to decarbonizing one of the hardest-to-abate sectors: aviation.

As demand for low-emission feedstocks rises and regulatory drivers—such as recycled content requirements, sustainable material mandates, and SAF targets—increase, the market for sustainable olefins is poised for rapid growth. With the global green methanol market expected to triple by 2030, this spin-off is well positioned to benefit from the rise of sustainable methanol.

Shell won't restart construction of a Rotterdam biofuels facility, as the global market for the fuel faces a yearslong slump.

The British energy giant said Wednesday that it conducted a commercial and technical evaluation and deemed the project no longer competitive.

""It became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers' need for affordable, low-carbon products,"" Machteld de Haan, president of Shell's downstream, renewables and energy division, said.

Shell took a $780 million impairment when it temporarily paused on-site construction work at the energy and chemicals park--expected to become one of the largest in Europe--in July 2024. It started the project in 2022 and green-lit it a year prior.

Before construction was halted, the Rotterdam biofuels facility was expected to produce 820,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel from waste.

The move comes after Shell rival BP halted two biofuel projects and scaled back plans on others last year, amid rising competition from new imports, particularly from China. Sweden and Finland's decisions to reduce the minimum threshold for renewable-fuel concentration in fuel or heating oil also contributed to the glut of biofuels.

Shell said it invested 6.5 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in energy-transition projects in the Netherlands over the past few years, including a renewable-hydrogen plant and a carbon-dioxide storage project.

Naidu was speaking at the release of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Feasibility study for India, which assesses the potential for producing and utilizing drop-in SAF. He welcomed the stakeholders, and underscored SAF’s critical role in advancing India’s sustainable aviation growth.

“SAF is a practical and immediate solution to decarbonize the aviation sector, with the potential to cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional fuel,” an official release quoted the minister as saying.

The study was prepared by the Ministry of Civil Aviation in association with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and with support from the European Union.

Meanwhile, the study is being deliberated at a two-day workshop at Udaan Bhawan, New Delhi, with participation from ICAO, EASA, DGCA, industry partners, and multiple government departments, reflecting a whole-of-government approach towards SAF.

Naidu reaffirmed India’s readiness to become self-sufficient in SAF production, targeting 1 percent blending by 2027, 2 percent by 2028 and 5 percent by 2030 in line with the CORSIA mandate.

The study evaluates domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, infrastructure and policy readiness and the enabling conditions needed to establish a robust domestic SAF market.

Drawing upon international best practices and tailoring them to India’s socio-economic and environmental context, the report provides a roadmap for sustainable fuel adoption.

The minister further highlighted that with over 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter.

Naidu pointed to important milestones already achieved, including the designation of COTECNA Inspection India Pvt. Ltd. as the country’s first SAF certification body and the certification of Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery as India’s first SAF producer.

The minister, as per the release, emphasized that SAF production will not only reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually, but also boost farmers’ incomes by creating a strong value chain for agricultural residue and biomass.

Overcoming production barriers The most significant obstacles to large-scale SAF production stem from both supply constraints and economic factors.
Financing SAF To lower SAF costs, the aviation industry must develop a full value chain approach — from feedstock sourcing through production to offtake agreements.
This model attracts infrastructure-style investors who can provide capital at lower costs, essential to scaling the industry.
Government subsidies and support also play a pivotal role, not only through mandates but also via fuel production incentives and funding for technology development.","As the aviation industry races toward ambitious net-zero emissions goals by 2050, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) stands at the forefront of decarbonising air travel. Yet, despite its promise, SAF currently accounts for less than 1 percent of global jet fuel demand, with steep cost premiums and production challenges limiting widespread adoption.

Overcoming production barriers

The most significant obstacles to large-scale SAF production stem from both supply constraints and economic factors. “SAF currently makes up less than 1 percent of global jet fuel demand,” Roland Berger, the global management consultancy firm, explained, underscoring how early the market still is. The cost disparity remains stark, with SAF priced four to five times higher than conventional jet fuel, deterring broad uptake.

The predominant SAF pathway today, Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), is relatively cost-effective but faces scalability limits due to finite sustainable feedstocks. “HEFA is the most cost effective today, but faces scalability challenges because of limited availability of sustainable feedstocks,” the company continued. Emerging technologies like Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and other advanced pathways show promise for greater scalability but are burdened with high production and technology costs, slowing commercialisation.

The inconsistent global policy environment compounds these challenges. While regions such as Europe have strong mandates like ReFuelEU driving SAF uptake, others, notably the U.S., lack federal mandates, creating a fragmented market landscape.

Airlines have a critical role in breaking through these barriers. “Partnering with suppliers and exploring appropriate contracting frameworks is essential,” the source explained. Airlines can adjust contract structures to longer timeframes — 10 years or more — which helps de-risk long-term capital projects for producers. Fixed-price contracts, rather than pricing tied to fluctuating Jet-A fuel costs plus premiums, provide revenue certainty, encouraging more investment.

Strategic co-investment also plays a vital role. “By investing into production, airlines can secure offtake volumes and reduce capital costs,” the consultancy outlined. Additionally, airlines can facilitate collaboration among infrastructure and debt investors, alongside regulators, to accelerate technology readiness and bring down costs for advanced SAF pathways.

Financing SAF

To lower SAF costs, the aviation industry must develop a full value chain approach — from feedstock sourcing through production to offtake agreements. “The key to lowering SAF costs is to build and invest across the full supply chain and pair this with long-term fixed price contracts,” the organisation laid out . This model attracts infrastructure-style investors who can provide capital at lower costs, essential to scaling the industry.

Increasing certainty across the supply chain reduces overall production costs. “Ideally, these arrangements should be shareable to clearly showcase the strength of the demand signal.”

Investment returns vary by project stage. Airlines can invest in early-stage projects, targeting levered internal rates of return (IRRs) similar to other growth equity investments. Projects nearing final investment decisions, where construction and offtake are more secure, typically target lower returns similar to other infrastructure investments to reflect the lower risk. Fully operating assets with contracted offtake represent the lowest risk and thus lower IRR thresholds. Airlines can also invest in complementary infrastructure, such as blending and delivery systems, with variable returns.

Such involvement is not without risk, but it also offers airlines an opportunity to influence production scalability directly. “Increasing stability and certainty to offtake chains helps bring down costs,” the firm stated, highlighting the importance of equity stakes and long-term contracts.

Global strategies

With SAF pricing and policy support varying widely by geography, airlines must leverage their networks and procurement mechanisms like book-and-claim systems to optimise costs. “In Europe, ReFuelEU mandates blending, which leads to higher SAF prices, whereas US incentives reduce local production costs, resulting in lower price premiums,” Roland Berger expressed.

European airlines face geographic constraints under regional mandates, limiting book-and-claim use to some extent. Yet, book-and-claim systems are effective for exceeding mandatory blending targets through voluntary commitments, enabling airlines to leverage corporate willingness to pay for emissions abatement. Airlines can also source SAF from regions with cost advantages and apply those credits toward compliance with global frameworks like CORSIA.

Innovative procurement strategies are proving vital in securing supply and lowering risk. Early in the SAF market, consortia such as SAFUG helped airlines commit volumes and align sustainability standards. “Initiatives like SABA have pushed market education and voluntary SAF adoption by connecting corporate customers with SAF certificate providers,” the organisation said. These platforms have promoted book-and-claim systems that decouple environmental attributes from physical fuel delivery, helping close the cost gap for voluntary demand.

Contract structures also matter. Traditional short-term deals with floating prices are giving way to longer-term fixed-price contracts with risk-sharing mechanisms linked to incentives like those in the U.S. “Some contracts include price collars with floors and ceilings, easing project financing risks,” they noted. Equity deals represent the highest form of risk sharing, attracting more generalist investors and de-risking the sector.

Together, these innovations strengthen supply chains and offer airlines tools to manage price volatility. Hedging strategies, including contracts pegged to power prices for PtL or ethanol futures for alcohol-to-jet pathways, are gaining traction and expected to evolve as the market matures.

Scaling SAF

The path to scaling SAF sustainably without eroding airline profitability involves several integrated steps. Reducing production costs through technological innovation and economies of scale is fundamental. “This includes lowering electrolyser costs, expanding renewables, and improving bio-feedstock availability,” the firm said. Government subsidies and support also play a pivotal role, not only through mandates but also via fuel production incentives and funding for technology development.

Airlines, in turn, must secure scalable production by backing advanced technologies and accessing low-cost capital. They need to send strong demand signals with long-term contracts and equity stakes, monetise SAF through differentiated customer offerings, and leverage global policy frameworks to approach cost parity with conventional fuels. Risk management through structured contracts and financial tools is essential.

This multifaceted strategy ensures SAF moves from a niche sustainability solution toward becoming a mainstream, financially viable fuel — a vital step if aviation is to meet its net-zero commitments by mid-century.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Page-12-shutterstock_2438041735-copy-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 12:56:57.539682

“Market dynamics and expected construction costs ultimately make this project insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ demand for affordable biofuels,” said Machteld de Haan, President of Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions at Shell. “We want to focus our investments on projects that deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders.”

Despite the cancellation, Shell reaffirmed its commitment to low-carbon fuels, noting their importance in the energy transition. “We remain convinced that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, are fundamental to the future energy system. Shell is already one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” De Haan added.

The company said it aims to position itself as a leading partner for energy transition investments. Between 2023 and 2024, the company invested around $8 billion globally in low-carbon projects, including solar, wind, carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen, and biofuels.

In 2024 alone, Shell traded over 10 billion liters of low-carbon fuels, selling ten times more than it produced, and became one of the world’s largest suppliers of SAF.

The aviation industry is in the midst of an important transformation. With rising global awareness around climate change, airlines are seeking ways to balance growth in air travel with the urgent need to reduce emissions. Hawaiian Airlines has now taken a meaningful step by introducing sustainable aviation fuel on selected flights between Osaka and Honolulu.

This initiative is not only about meeting regulatory expectations but also about reshaping the way passengers view long-haul international travel. By embedding sustainability into their daily operations, airlines are signaling a future where flying responsibly becomes the new norm.

Hawaiian Airlines Introduces SAF on Osaka to Honolulu Flights

On August 29, 2025, Hawaiian Airlines announced the integration of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into its daily flights connecting Osaka-Kansai International Airport and Honolulu. The arrangement has been made possible through a partnership between its parent company, Alaska Air Group, and Cosmo Oil Marketing, a subsidiary of Cosmo Energy Holdings.

The first deliveries have already begun at Kansai International Airport, fueling Hawaiian’s Airbus A330 aircraft. For the airline, this marks a milestone moment, as it is the first time SAF has been included in its fuel operations. According to the airline, SAF can reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared with conventional jet fuel.

Why Japan Matters in This Move

Japan has long been a critical international market for Hawaiian Airlines. The daily service between Honolulu and Osaka supports not only tourism but also cultural and business exchanges between Japan and Hawai‘i.

In comments accompanying the announcement, Alanna James, Sustainability Innovation Director at Hawaiian Airlines, expressed appreciation for Cosmo Oil’s commitment to developing locally sourced SAF. This local connection is vital, as it demonstrates how sustainability efforts can be woven into regional supply chains, reducing dependency on imported fuels and creating new economic opportunities.

Building a Sustainable Supply Chain in Japan

The SAF being supplied under this agreement has its origins in a Japanese government-backed program. In 2021, Cosmo Oil Marketing received support from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) to create a supply chain model for SAF production. The chosen feedstock is used cooking oil, collected from households and businesses across Japan.

What makes this initiative remarkable is the circular economy element. By transforming everyday waste into aviation fuel, the program not only addresses carbon emissions but also promotes responsible resource use. It sends a strong message that sustainability is not just about new technologies but also about rethinking how existing materials are managed and repurposed.

Certified for a Cleaner Future

The SAF supplied to Hawaiian Airlines will carry ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU certifications, confirming compliance with international sustainability and carbon reduction standards. These certifications ensure transparency and accountability, making it clear that the fuel is not just greener in name but also in practice.

Cosmo Energy Group’s facility will become the first in Japan to mass-produce SAF, creating a blueprint for other countries to follow. Partnerships like these highlight the importance of both innovation and collaboration in meeting global climate goals.

Voices from the Collaboration

The partnership has been welcomed with optimism by both Hawaiian Airlines and Cosmo Oil Marketing.

Naoki Takayama, President of Cosmo Oil Marketing, noted that SAF is a key decarbonization tool for aviation. He emphasized the company’s commitment to helping build a decarbonized society, with this agreement serving as a starting point for broader adoption of SAF in Japan and beyond.

Hawaiian Airlines echoed this sentiment, reiterating its ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. This long-term commitment is supported by a multi-pronged strategy that includes SAF adoption, technological innovation, and modernizing its aircraft fleet.

The Broader Picture of Sustainable Aviation

This development is part of a larger movement in aviation. Airlines across the world are testing, investing, and scaling SAF as one of the most viable solutions to decarbonize flight operations. Unlike experimental fuels, SAF can already be used in existing aircraft with minimal modification, making it a practical option for rapid deployment.

By selecting a key route such as Osaka to Honolulu for its first SAF operations, Hawaiian Airlines is showing that sustainability can align with commercial viability. This route carries a mix of leisure travelers, business passengers, and cultural exchange visitors, many of whom are increasingly conscious about the environmental footprint of their journeys.

Toward a Net-Zero Ambition

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines, both with histories spanning more than 90 years, are using this initiative as an opportunity to reinforce their values. Their joint statement highlighted a shared mission of connecting communities while safeguarding the environment.

The commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 places both carriers ahead of many industry peers. It sets an example for how airlines can simultaneously focus on growth and responsibility, balancing commercial goals with environmental stewardship.

A Glimpse Into the Passenger Experience

While the technical aspects of SAF adoption are critical, there is also a human dimension. Travelers booking Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka to Honolulu flights can now feel assured that their journey is contributing to a greener planet. Although the shift may seem subtle today, it builds momentum for a future where environmentally responsible choices are seamlessly built into the travel experience.

The airline’s Airbus A330 aircraft on this route can carry 278 passengers. Every flight powered partly by SAF represents not just reduced emissions but also a step toward normalizing sustainability in aviation.

Conclusion

The introduction of sustainable aviation fuel on Hawaiian Airlines’ Osaka to Honolulu flights is more than a technical upgrade. It is a statement of intent, a sign of collaboration across industries and nations, and a step toward reshaping air travel into a force for positive environmental change.

As the aviation industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its impact, stories like this provide hope. They show that progress is possible when airlines, governments, and energy providers work together to unlock solutions. The journey toward net-zero aviation is far from complete, but initiatives such as this highlight the path forward.

India is currently the world’s third-largest aviation market, with passenger traffic set to double to 500 million by 2030. Naidu shared that India aims to become self-reliant in SAF production, having the target set for 1% blending by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 in line with the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) mandate. CORSIA is a market-based mechanism to achieve carbon-neutrality in aviation developed by ICAO.

“India is on track to become the world’s largest domestic aviation market. With a collaborative approach, we are committed to positioning India as a leader in green aviation,” Naidu added.

The feasibility study examines India’s potential for producing SAF, by assessing the availability of domestic feedstock, and feasible production pathways. The study also seeks to evaluate preparedness of infrastructure and policy.

The study was prepared by Ministry of Civil Aviation and International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO.) The study was commissioned by European Union as part of the ICAO’s Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (ACT-SAF) programme.

Under this series, the EU is conducting a total of 16 studies, of which India is a part of. The other countries where the study was conducted included Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote D’Ivoire, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, and Ethiopia.

The India feasibility study started in November last year, and according to the ministry, the prepared report will be discussed at a two-day workshop at Udaan Bhawan, New Delhi, with participation key stakeholders including representatives from ICAO, EASA, DGCA, industry partners, and multiple government departments.

Naidu shared that the COTECNA Inspection India Pvt. Ltd. has been designated as India’s first SAF certification body. Additionally, Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat Refinery has been certified as the country’s first SAF producer.","https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india/2025-05-15/islgv8wx/Kinjarapu-Ram-Mohan-Naidu.jpeg?rect=0,46,1975,1037&w=1200&ar=40:21&auto=format,compress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100",N,,2025-09-03 08:56:47.560955

He said there had been “a backsliding on mandates in multiple countries, which has of course impacted some of the investments we have made”.","Machteld de Haan, Shell’s president for downstream, renewables and energy solutions, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low-carbon products.”

Shell is one of the world’s biggest oil and gas groups, with annual profits of almost $24 billion last year.

Under the former chief executive Ben van Beurden it set a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and set out plans for an array of green energy projects, including its 2021 decision to build the 820,000-tonnes-a-year biofuels plant in Rotterdam, which was originally scheduled to start production last year.

It said at the time that SAF could make up more than half of the plant’s output, with the rest being renewable diesel, made from used cooking oil, waste animal fat and other industrial and agricultural residual products. It also planned to use sustainable vegetable oils, given a shortage of suitable waste feedstocks.

Wael Sawan, who succeeded Van Beurden at the start of 2023, has rowed back on many of Shell’s green commitments that were struggling to make desired returns, such as ditching plans to build lots of wind farms.

He also sold its household energy supply business in Britain as part of a shift away from electricity to focus on “green molecules” such as low-carbon hydrogen and renewable biofuels.

De Haan said: “We continue to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system. Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel.”

Shell said that last year it “traded over 10 billion litres of low carbon fuels and sold ten times more than we produced”, becoming “one of the world’s leading suppliers of SAF” with almost a fifth of total sales in North America and Europe.

However, Sawan had already sounded the alarm over the economics of SAF. He said earlier this year that the take-up of SAF in the aviation industry was less than 0.1 per cent and its growth would depend on government action.

“The reality is that SAF is more expensive and therefore unless there are mandates — obligations on either customers or airlines — it is difficult to see a penetration that is going to be massive,” he said, warning that “airlines will not simply erode their bottom lines for the sake of it”.

He said there had been “a backsliding on mandates in multiple countries, which has of course impacted some of the investments we have made”.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fd0bbe87e-5543-43f7-b24f-f424fd9c558c.jpg?crop=4000%2C2250%2C0%2C209&resize=1200,N,,2025-09-03 08:56:54.085240

Shell is taking action to be the investment case and partner of choice through the energy transition. Between 2023 and 2024, Shell has invested U.S.$8 billion in lower carbon options, including power, carbon capture and storage (CCS), hydrogen and low-carbon fuels. In 2024, Shell traded over 10 billion litres of low carbon fuels and sold 10 times more than we produced. In the same year, Shell became one of the world’s leading suppliers of SAF.

The Netherlands remains a key location for Shell, where our businesses span the breadth of its energy system - from upstream production of oil and gas through to our network of retail sites. In recent years, Shell has invested €6.5 billion across a wide range of energy transition projects in the Netherlands. This includes enabling CO2 storage through the Porthos CCS project, developing renewable hydrogen at Holland Hydrogen 1, and installing new furnaces and the electrification of key manufacturing processes at Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk.

Shell’s net carbon intensity

Also, in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “net carbon intensity” (NCI), which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “net carbon intensity” or NCI is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.

Shell’s net-zero emissions target

Shell’s operating plan and outlook are forecasted for a three-year period and ten-year period, respectively, and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next three and ten years. Accordingly, the outlook reflects our Scope 1, Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However, Shell’s operating plan and outlook cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target, as this target is outside our planning period. Such future operating plans and outlooks could include changes to our portfolio, efficiency improvements and the use of carbon capture and storage and carbon credits. In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell’s operating plans and outlooks to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.

Forward-Looking non-GAAP measures

This announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as adjusted earnings and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.

Ram Mohan Naidu has announced, reports The Hindu businessline.

SAF, which is made from renewable sources or waste, is seen as a key step toward greener aviation.

Naidu said India has a natural advantage in this sector. “Our location gives us the chance to become an exporter, and we also have plenty of raw material available,” he noted.

Currently, India has more than 750 million metric tonnes of biomass and around 230 million metric tonnes of surplus farm residue.

“India has the potential to be a global leader in SAF production,” the Minister said, adding that the country could produce more than its domestic demand and emerge as a major exporter.

He also pointed out that the SAF industry could create 1.1 to 1.4 million jobs across the value chain, reduce India’s crude oil import bill by $5–7 million every year, and raise farmers’ income by 10–15 per cent through the use of crop residue.

Naidu said India’s skilled workforce and strong manufacturing base would make SAF more affordable compared to other regions. But he admitted that pricing remains a challenge.

“Right now, SAF is costlier than normal jet fuel. To make it cheaper, we need to increase production,” he explained.

Industry estimates show that SAF costs two to six times more than conventional jet fuel. Still, Naidu highlighted strong demand within India, driven by the fast-growing aviation sector. The country’s refining capacity also allows it to export half of its aviation turbine fuel production.

SAF is expected to play a key role in meeting India’s future fuel needs. Aviation turbine fuel demand is likely to rise to 15–16 million tonnes by 2030, and nearly double by 2040.

“SAF is an essential part of our strategy to make aviation sustainable. It offers a practical solution to cut emissions right now,” Naidu said.

The upcoming SAF policy will also draw from a feasibility study carried out by the Centre along with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).

SAF is an important part of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). India has not joined its voluntary phase (2021–2026), but Indian carriers will need to comply with offset requirements from 2027.

The government plans to start with a one per cent SAF blend in jet fuel in 2027, increase it to two per cent in 2028, and reach five per cent by 2030.

Indian Oil Corporation recently received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery—an important step toward large-scale production, certification, and distribution.

However, industry experts say the lack of supporting infrastructure and ecosystem makes SAF production costly. Large investments are needed to set up facilities, but financing remains limited, especially in the early stages.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-09-03 08:57:16.724993

The move to scrap the project in Rotterdam marks another setback for its biofuel designs, after the company cancelled a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project on Singapore’s Bukom Island in March 2023.

It comes amid a wider shift away from renewable energy projects in the oil and gas sector as fossil fuel companies pursue higher profits.

In March last year Shell watered down a key emissions target, setting out a plan to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the energy it sells by 15-20% by the end of the decade compared with its previous goal of 20%.

Shell began construction of the plant in Rotterdam in the Netherlands in 2021, initially expecting to start producing up to 820,000 tonnes of biofuels, with plans to bring it online in April 2024. This was later pushed back to 2025.

Biomass, agricultural residue and used cooking oil are among the key feedstocks that can be tapped for production of SAF, which can be used as a drop-in fuel for aircraft.

The civil aviation ministry in partnership with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and with support from the European Union have prepared an SAF feasibility study for India.

The study assesses the potential for producing and utilising drop-in SAF in India. It evaluates domestic feedstock availability, viable production pathways, infrastructure and policy readiness and the enabling conditions needed to establish a robust domestic SAF market, the ministry said in a release on Wednesday.

Drawing upon international best practices and tailoring them to India's socio-economic and environmental context, the report provides a roadmap for sustainable fuel adoption, it added.

The study was undertaken under the ICAO's Capacity-building and Training for Sustainable Aviation Fuels programme (ACT-SAF) initiative.

""With over 750 million metric tonne of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonne of surplus agricultural residue, India has the capacity not only to meet its own SAF demand but also to emerge as a global leader and exporter,"" he said.

The minister also said that SAF production will not only reduce crude imports and cut emissions by 20-25 million tonnes annually but also boost farmers' incomes by creating a strong value chain for agricultural residue and biomass.

Recently, Indian Oil Corporation became the first Indian company to get the ISCC CORSIA certification for production of SAF at its refinery in Panipat, Haryana.

CORSIA refers to Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) of the ICAO.

Ashley Kelty, a leading analyst at Panmure Liberum, said it was “another nail in the ideological coffin for SAF and biofuels”.
Britain alone consumes about 11m tonnes of aviation fuel a year and emissions soared to 37m tonnes in 2024 – more than double the 16m tonnes seen in 1990.
That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.
Despite the decision, Shell said it remained committed to a low-carbon future.","Shell has abandoned plans to build a biofuels factory in the Netherlands, dealing a blow to Europe’s hopes of decarbonising the aviation industry.

The oil giant has scrapped the project after pausing work on the site last July, with a review concluding that the plant was too expensive and “insufficiently competitive”.

Under its proposals, the plant in Rotterdam was designed to be one of Europe’s biggest converters of waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel.

The decision to axe construction will pose a significant challenge for Europe as it seeks to reduce the environmental impact of flying.

It also marks the latest step in Shell’s shift away from net zero, as the company scales back green investment to focus more on oil and gas.

Ashley Kelty, a leading analyst at Panmure Liberum, said it was “another nail in the ideological coffin for SAF and biofuels”.

He said: “It means that SAF is going to be more expensive, limited in supply and therefore difficult for airlines to justify using.”

The take-up of green jet fuel – which is produced from waste materials such as used cooking oil – has struggled in recent years amid faltering production, which has kept prices high.

Machteld de Haan, Shell’s downstream, renewables and energy solutions president, said: “As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive to meet our customers’ need for affordable, low carbon products.

“This was a difficult decision, but the right one, as we prioritise our capital towards those projects that deliver both the needs of our customers and value for our shareholders.”

It marks a considerable turnaround for Shell, which only announced the biofuels project in 2021.

At the time, the company said it was transforming 14 oil refineries into five low-carbon energy sites to meet growing demand from the transport sector.

This formed part of a target to “reduce the production of traditional fuels by 55pc by 2030 and provide more low-carbon fuels such as biofuels for road transport and aviation, and hydrogen”.

However, these targets have been dashed as part of a pivot away from renewables, posing a problem for Europe’s airlines.

Aviation is the most climate‑intensive form of transport and its growth means its emissions have been growing faster than any other mode of transport.

Britain alone consumes about 11m tonnes of aviation fuel a year and emissions soared to 37m tonnes in 2024 – more than double the 16m tonnes seen in 1990.

That is set to grow even faster in the next two decades.

The UK Government has attempted to reverse this by ordering airlines to use 10pc of SAF by 2030.

However this requirement, also in effect across Europe, requires a network of refineries which are not yet materialising.

Shell’s decision to abandon the Rotterdam project is just the latest of several such schemes to fail.

In 2022, Boris Johnson – the prime minister at the time – announced a new policy known as “jet zero” to enforce a minimum threshold of green fuel use.

He also pledged the construction of a minimum of five new SAF plants, which have not been built.

It means the only company making SAF in the UK is the Phillips 66 refinery on Humberside in North Lincolnshire – and its output is just 20,000 tonnes a year.

That’s about 0.2pc of the 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel Britain consumes annually.

Despite the decision, Shell said it remained committed to a low-carbon future.

Ms de Haan said: “We continue to believe that low-carbon molecules, including biofuels, will underpin the future energy system. Shell is at the forefront of this industry and its development as one of the world’s largest traders and suppliers of biofuels, including SAF.”

Thailand’s energy giant Bangchak is broadening its renewable energy footprint. Its bio-based subsidiary BBGI (Bio-Based Green Innovation) announced a THB 2 billion (USD 61.6 million) investment in developing bio-LNG. The company is also partnering with government agencies to explore the production of algae-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Turning wastewater into renewable with lower-carbon bio-LNG

Amid global decarbonization efforts, Bangchak sees growing demand for biofuels. BBGI plans to use wastewater generated from its ethanol and methyl ester production processes, converting it into biogas through anaerobic fermentation before refining it into bio-LNG. Compared with fossil-based LNG, bio-LNG has a smaller carbon footprint.

According to BBGI CEO and President Daechapon Lersuwanaroj, the company will source wastewater and solid residues from ethanol plants in Kanchanaburi and Khon Kaen. “This marks a significant step towards advancing the use of renewable energy from wastewater,” he said.

BBGI’s partners include Singapore’s Keppel Corporation and waste-to-energy firm CleanEdge Resources. The company initially planned to supply bio-LNG as marine fuel for Keppel’s fleet, but due to the long lead time and engine technology upgrades required for fuel switching, BBGI is pivoting toward power generation instead—using bio-LNG to produce renewable electricity.

Daechapon added that data center operators, given their energy-intensive operations, have also expressed interest in bio-LNG. BBGI’s bio-LNG facility is slated to begin operations in 2027, with a planned output of 100 tons per day.

Expanding biofuels to meet shipping and aviation needs

While BBGI’s new plant will not supply marine fuel, Thailand’s government has been pushing major players to scale up biofuel solutions. Both Bangchak and state-owned PTT are actively developing Bio-VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil) to support the shipping sector in meeting IMO decarbonization targets.

In addition, BBGI signed an MoU with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) on Sept. 2 to jointly study algae-based SAF. Testing will be conducted at Bangchak’s Phra Khanong refinery in Bangkok.

Faced with weak market conditions, the company last year suspended construction of the renewables biofuel factory in Rotterdam that was intended to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and diesel from waste.

""As we evaluated market dynamics and the cost of completion, it became clear that the project would be insufficiently competitive,"" Machteld de Haan, Shell's downstream, renewables and energy solutions president, said in a statement.

The project was first announced in 2021 as part of plans to help Europe meet internationally binding emissions reduction targets.

Shell and rival UK energy giant BP have been walking back various climate objectives and focusing more on oil and gas to raise their profits, which has drawn criticism from environmental activists.

More than half of the facility's capacity was intended to produce SAF -- a biofuel made from plant and animal materials like cooking oil and fat which produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel.

Under plans to tackle climate change, the EU requires airlines to gradually increase the amount of SAF they use to power planes.

Airlines, however, complain that SAF is not widely available and too expensive.

The meeting, chaired by civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu, was attended by aviation secretary Samir Kumar Sinha, ICAO representatives, DGCA officials, oil companies and representatives from Boeing and Airbus.

Policy framework and blending targets

Officials told Hindustan Times that the workshop will help shape a policy framework and implementation steps to ensure India meets its SAF blending targets. These include 1 per cent of total fuel for international flights by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030.

Indian Oil’s Panipat refinery has already been certified as the country’s first SAF producer, with production expected to begin by the end of the year.

“The workshop is expected to finalise policy and implementation steps, ensuring India meets its SAF blending targets while reducing crude oil imports by an estimated $5–7 billion annually and boosting farmer incomes through the use of crop residue,” an official said.

Growth and supply potential

India’s aviation sector carried 240 million passengers in 2024, with numbers projected to double by 2030. Fuel consumption is expected to reach 16 million tonnes by 2030 and 31 million tonnes by 2040.

Officials said SAF could play a central role in balancing aviation growth with emissions reduction, with potential lifecycle emission cuts of up to 80 per cent.

Advt

“India is well positioned to become a global leader in SAF, because of its large agricultural base, availability of surplus biomass and strong refining capacity. Estimates suggest India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2040, more than domestic demand, opening export opportunities and creating up to 1.4 million green jobs,” another official said.

Wider decarbonisation efforts

At present, 88 airports in India run entirely on green energy. Bengaluru airport holds the highest level of global carbon accreditation, while Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad airports are carbon neutral.

Advt

Alongside SAF, India is also pursuing green hydrogen initiatives. Cochin airport has set up what it says is the world’s first airport-based hydrogen production facility, and companies including NTPC and Indian Oil Corporation are working on large-scale SAF and hydrogen projects.

SAFFA’s goal is to accelerate the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by investing in projects that are technologically mature and commercially viable. Our client specialises in financial advisory and capital raising services within the financial sector.

Piper Alderman acted for our client in relation to the establishment of a private equity fund for SAF. Each investor in the fund entered into an off-take agreement from the project refinery for the supply of aviation fuel. An off-take agreement is an arrangement between a producer and a buyer to purchase or sell portions of the producer’s upcoming goods.

One of Australia’s major airline carriers, represented by Minter Ellison, was the lead negotiator for the terms of the off-take. The investment by this carrier and the other airlines, and the negotiations of the various off-take arrangements, raised a number of complex competition law issues. This is primarily because it is illegal for businesses to make contracts, arrangements or understandings that substantially lessen competition. There is potential for Limited Partnership Agreements and Off-take Allocation Agreements, such as those used in the SAFFA, to be scrutinised under competition laws to ensure they don’t unfairly restrict competition or harm consumers.

Piper Alderman reviewed and provided competition law advice in relation to the Limited Partnership Agreement and the Off-take Allocation Agreement. Given that the investors in the fund were airline competitors, we had to ensure that the arrangements set out in the agreements did not breach the cartel conduct provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act. The agreements therefore needed to be drafted within the exceptions to the cartel conduct provisions.

The SAFFA fund made its first investment in April 2024 in US-based technology company Crysalis Biosciences, which aims to renew chemical manufacturing infrastructure with innovative fuel and chemical production technologies. The investment was only made after the parties were comfortable that all competition law risks had been successfully addressed.",https://piperalderman.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/corporate-banner.jpg,N,,2025-09-03 07:56:11.443500

Aviation fuel consumption is expected to reach 16 million tonnes by 2030 and 31 million tonnes by 2040. During such a situation, SAF is seen as central to decarbonizing this growth, with the potential to cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80%.

Currently 88 airports in India run entirely on green energy, Bengaluru airport holds the highest global carbon accreditation, and Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad airports are carbon neutral.

Alongside SAF, India is also investing in green hydrogen where Cochin airport has set up the world’s first airport-based hydrogen production facility, while NTPC and IOC are developing large-scale SAF and hydrogen projects.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/09/02/1600x900/This-comes-ahead-of-the-42nd-session-of-the-Intern_1756840789510.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 21:57:15.519791
