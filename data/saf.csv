The facility, named NovaSAF 1, will be located in Durazno in Uruguay. It is expected to produce more than 350,000 gallons of SAF annually. The project is underpinned by long-term feedstock and site agreements with Estancias del Lago, a major Uruguayan dairy and agri-energy operator.

Kent will lead the FEED phase and support permitting and equipment sourcing. Final investment decision is targeted for Q4 2025, with commercial operations planned to begin in early 2027.

The project will use Syzygy’s NovaSAF platform, which integrates biogas and power-to-liquids technologies to convert agricultural waste and renewable electricity into liquid fuel. According to the company, this approach avoids the need for pipelines, gas separation, or water-intensive processes and enables a more-than 80% reduction in carbon intensity compared with conventional Jet-A fuel.

“This is more than just a SAF plant. It’s a new model for biogas economics,” said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. “We’re unlocking a global asset class of underutilised biogas sites and turning them into high-value clean fuel hubs without subsidy dependence.”

The platform is designed to be modular and exportable, with the potential for replication in biogas-rich regions. Syzygy claims it offers over 50% higher SAF yields than conventional thermal reforming pathways, and that the process may qualify as a Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin under EU regulations.

Jose Pedro Sanchez, COO at Estancias del Lago, added that the project combines agricultural waste with Uruguay’s near-fully renewable electricity grid to support local value creation and SAF production.

The company also stated that NovaSAF 1 is intended to meet EU, US and CORSIA SAF regulatory requirements.

Uncertainty beyond design stage

While the announcement of a FEED phase is a milestone for SAF projects, it does not guarantee that construction will proceed. Several factors can delay or halt progress between FEED and the final investment.

A major challenge is securing long-term offtake agreements. Airlines, the main consumers of SAF, often hesitate to commit to long-term fuel purchases due to the higher costs of SAF compared with conventional jet fuel.

Technical and regulatory uncertainties also feed into project delays. For instance, last year Shell paused construction of its planned 820,000 tonnes per year biofuel plant in Rotterdam having taken a final investment decision in 2021.

Earlier this year, Finnish biofuels company UPM said that it would halt the development of its planned second biomass-to-fuels refinery at the Port of Rotterdam. The 500,000 tonnes per year refinery was earmarked to be one of Europe’s biggest biorefineries.

Having first announced plans for the facility in 2021, the company announced it would delay final investment until 2023. This was subsequently pushed back to 2026, after the company was expecting to complete its testing and evaluation of the project.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), achieving net-zero carbon emissions in aviation by 2050 will require SAF to account for approximately 65% of the sector’s total fuel consumption.

This translates to an estimated 449 billion litres of SAF annually by mid-century. Given that global SAF production is projected to reach only two million tonnes in 2025 – representing just 0.7% of total aviation fuel use – the industry faces a huge challenge in scaling up production to meet future demand – and many more projects will have to start to produce.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2325764425.jpg",N,,2025-06-05 07:57:08.431952

At the heart of the push is Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, a biofuel derived from sources like corn grain, municipal solid waste, wet waste, and agricultural residues. Though not yet widely used, SAF is gaining traction thanks to its lower emissions and growing interest from regional policymakers.

The aviation industry has yet to fully embrace the alternative fuel, largely due to the high cost of production and limited infrastructure for storage costs. But with international interest rising and U.S. climate policies shifting, local leaders remain hopeful that a wider transition is on the horizon.

In the first three quarters of 2024, U.S. production of SAF reached 30 million gallons — a sharp increase of just five million in 2021, according to recent data collected by the U.S. Department of Energy.

“I’m very optimistic about its ability to survive because it goes straight to the farmers, and it is really about American-made products,” said Ed Hubbard, general counsel and vice president of governmental affairs for the Renewable Fuels Association. “If you can fall within the framework of ‘American energy, greatness and dominance,’ I think that those are the aspects that survive throughout the process.”

Hubbard warned that if the Trump administration withdraws incentives for SAF, it would contradict its own America First Investment Policy — a doctrine designed to pressure companies into manufacturing domestically instead of overseas.

On Tuesday, Hubbard joined a panel discussion in Washington, D.C., focused on raising awareness about SAF. The event highlighted the formation of a working group, a directory of aviation-related associations, and plans for a traveling presentation aimed at engaging government and aviation leaders.

The panel was hosted by the Greater Washington Region Clean Cities Coalition (GWRCCC), which works to promote affordable, local transportation fuels, energy-efficient mobility systems, and other fuel-saving practices.

The federal government developed a strategy to encourage the commercial-scale production of SAF through a plan called the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge.

Under President Joe Biden’s administration, the initiative set primary goals to reduce costs, bolster energy security, and significantly increase the production and use of SAF. Key targets include achieving a 50% reduction in life cycle emissions compared to traditional fuels and meeting production milestones of three billion gallons annually by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 — enough to meet all domestic demand.

Given the significant impact of jet travel on the environment, advocates hope SAF can help mitigate the pollution it causes. In 2022, aviation accounted for 2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and that share is expected to grow. The agency noted that aviation has experienced faster growth in recent decades than rail, road, and shipping.

“They pollute the environment, and the closer you live to those environments, the more negative it is on public health,” said Antoine Thompson, CEO and executive director for GWRCCC.

Data provided by GWRCCC at Tuesday’s meeting showed a combined 622 private and public airports between Maryland and Virginia.

Virginia began considering sustainability strategies at its airports earlier than other states. The commonwealth has a total of 406 public and private airports, 400 of which are privately owned.

In July 2016, the Virginia Department of Aviation (VDOA) commissioned the Virginia Airports Sustainability Management Plan — a voluntary guide for Virginia’s public airports to define their own sustainability priorities and needs.

Rusty Harrington, chief planner with VDOA, was one of the contributors to the plan.

“We have so many people that are working in parallel, and (the meeting) has been an opportunity for us to see what everyone else is working on and find some mutual common ground opportunities,” Harrington said.

Beyond SAF, Harrington noted that researchers also exploring advancements in engine technology, as well as the use of using electrification and hydrogen resources.

As for Virginia’s role in environmental stewardship, Harrington said the commonwealth is taking it very seriously.

“We want to protect the resources that we have, and we want to lessen our impacts in almost every activity we do — from design, construction, operation, maintenance of our airports — with the goal of securing and balancing the economic, the environmental and the social impacts of any of our actions,” Harrington said. “We like to think we’re doing a very good job of that because it’s inherent in whatever we do in airport development.”

About Airbus Airbus is more than just an aircraft manufacturer.
“We don’t want every country to have a different definition about what is sustainable aviation,” he warns.","Few industries capture the imagination like aviation. The freedom to fly has revolutionised economies, connected cultures and made the world smaller.

But as the climate crisis intensifies, aviation's environmental impact is under the microscope. With around 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions attributed to air travel – and demand for flights projected to soar – decarbonising aviation is one of the 21st century’s great sustainability challenges.

At the heart of this revolution is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a technology offering hope, complexity and innovation in equal measure.

Airbus, as one of the world’s leading aerospace manufacturers, is at the forefront of this transition.

“Climate risk is a humanitarian risk, but it's also a business and a financial risk,” says Julie Kitcher, Chief Sustainability Officer at Airbus.

“At Airbus we remain committed to sustainability. No, we don't have all the answers and yes, it's hard, but we do have a collective goal to reach net zero for the industry.”

Despite the challenges, Airbus remains committed to its mission – to pioneer sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world.

“We are in the fourth revolution of aviation,” says Guillaume Faury, CEO of Airbus.

“The first one was more than a century ago with the beginning of flight in 1905. It used to be a very dangerous game – the average lifetime of a plane and the pilot was very short.

“The second revolution was to make aviation a safe mode of transport. It took a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of failures.

“The third transformation was to make it available for everyone, to make it affordable so that it became a viable method of transport.

“We are now in the fourth revolution of aviation – making it sustainable.”

“What is really exciting and what makes me passionate is that we have a purpose statement that says we pioneer sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world,” says Julien Manhes, Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Carbon Dioxide Removal at Airbus.

“We are the lucky ones who can pioneer every day.”

A brief history of aviation and aviation fuel

Since the Wright brothers’ first powered flight in 1903, aviation has been synonymous with progress.

For decades, kerosene-based jet fuel – derived from fossil sources – has been the industry standard, prized for its energy density and reliability. But extracting and burning fossil fuels releases carbon that has been locked underground for millennia, adding to atmospheric CO₂ and driving global warming.

The aviation sector’s reliance on fossil fuels has made it a hard-to-abate industry. Unlike cars or trains, where electrification is advancing rapidly, the energy requirements of flight make battery-powered planes viable only for short journeys.

For long-haul flights, liquid fuels remain essential – for now.

“Electricity generated by wind turbines dates back to the 19th century,” Julie explains.

“But wind power only really took off in the 1970s in the face of an energy crisis, and last year 30% of the electricity generated in the UK was generated by wind.

“That shows that we don't have to look too far in the face of crisis to see how transformation can come through innovation and technology. We need to start and we need to continue.

“This decade has shown us that every year brings a new crisis. We are living in a world of uncertainty and at Airbus, our conviction remains.

“We are pioneering sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world.”

What is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is a broad term for non-fossil-derived fuels that can be blended with, or replace, conventional jet fuel. Most SAF today is produced from biomass, such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues or even municipal waste.

“In order to make SAF, it all starts with a CO₂ absorption,” explains Julien. “The biomass, when it grows, absorbs CO₂. Then you process that biomass into your biofuel. And when you burn the fuel, the CO₂ is released again. So you’re working effectively in a closed loop where you’re using CO₂ that is already in the atmosphere.”

This is fundamentally different from fossil fuels, which Julien says “pull carbon from the soil and release it back into the atmosphere, where it stays for centuries”.

SAF, when produced and sourced responsibly, can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The development of SAF

SAF’s journey from concept to commercialisation has been long and complex.

“What we did together with the industry is to make sure that we could make this synthetic fuel flyable,” says Julien.

“We spent quite a lot of time making sure that the different recipes of SAF could be used on our platforms – not only commercial aircraft, but also military aircraft and helicopters.”

Today, technical standards exist to ensure that SAF blends meet the stringent safety and performance requirements of aviation.

“Now there are technical standards that SAF producers can refer to, to ensure that what they produce, when it’s mixed with kerosene, is fulfilling the technical standards required to fly safely,” Julien explains.

Airbus is more than just an aircraft manufacturer. With a global workforce and a history of innovation, it has taken a proactive role in the SAF ecosystem.

“We have a lot of partnerships with a lot of different producers simply because we want to support the emergence of SAF at scale,” says Julien. These partnerships span established energy giants like TotalEnergies and Neste, as well as agile startups pioneering new feedstocks and production methods.

Airbus’s approach is holistic, supporting the supply and demand sides of the SAF equation.

“We provide financing so that SAF producers can start their production facility,” Julien explains. “For those smaller producers, it’s really hard to find cheap financing to make their project work.”

The challenges of decarbonising aviation

Technical barriers

While SAF is “drop-in” – meaning it can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure – there are still technical hurdles. Not all feedstocks are created equal and scaling up production to meet global demand is a massive challenge.

Economic realities

The biggest challenge, however, is economic. “There is one single major issue, and I say major, but it’s the money,” says Julien. “The problem with those fuels is that they’re very expensive to manufacture and therefore the price at which they’re being sold is two to three times the price of conventional fuel.”

Policy and regulation

Policy frameworks are crucial. “A policy will enable a new industry to emerge,” Julien believes. But definitions of what constitutes “sustainable” can vary. For example, the EU restricts certain feedstocks, such as crop-based biofuels, while the US is more permissive. “We don’t want every country to have a different definition about what is sustainable aviation,” he warns.

Supply and demand

The classic ‘chicken and egg’ dilemma looms large – airlines want to buy SAF, but producers need assurance of demand before investing in new facilities. “You can activate demand by saying, okay, I force the fuel distributors to incorporate a certain percentage, a certain level of blend in the overall fuel mix.”

Innovations in SAF and aviation decarbonisation

Airbus is investing in a wide range of SAF innovations.

“We partner on all fronts with all types of producers and we really think that we can bring, with a lot of humility, a little contribution to all those partners,” says Julien.

This includes supporting startups working on novel feedstocks such as waste, sewage and even alcohol-to-jet technologies.

Beyond SAF, Airbus is exploring hydrogen-powered flight and advanced aircraft designs. But for the foreseeable future, SAF is considered by many as the most viable way to decarbonise long-haul aviation.

The role of collaboration

The scale of the challenge demands collaboration.

“We are seeking partnerships and collaboration across the entire value chain,” Julien says.

“We are also sponsoring some studies, for example, of different crops that could be used as a feedstock for SAF. We are discovering a new world like pioneers do – a world of collaboration and a wealth of failure, because sometimes we realise that what we are doing doesn’t work. That’s very much the beauty of innovating and allowing ourselves to fail from time to time.”

The role of the consumer

While airlines and manufacturers are central to the SAF transition, passengers and corporate customers also have a part to play.

“When you buy your ticket, have a look as to whether the airline is proposing to you having a little bit of SAF in your ticket,” suggests Julien. “You’re no longer buying only the experience of travelling from A to B. You are buying this experience plus a reduced carbon footprint.”

Corporate customers, in particular, are leading the way by purchasing SAF credits to offset their business travel emissions.

“When I fly on business travel with Air France, we buy from Air France 100% CO₂ reduction out of SAF. We buy SAF from Air France, or the CO₂ reduction attributes of the SAF that Air France procures. In return we get certificates that we can claim for.”

Book and claim mechanisms: Making SAF more accessible

One of Airbus’s proudest recent achievements is the development of a ‘book and claim’ mechanism for smaller customers. This system allows customers to claim the environmental benefits of SAF, even if the physical fuel is not used on their specific flight.

“The book and claim mechanism is correlating the attributes of SAF or the environmental attributes of SAF from the physical product. It is a great enabler for SAF to take off,” Julien says. “For us, this demonstrator is really the opportunity to show that it’s robust whilst at the same time helping our customers to decarbonise.”

Policy, innovation and hope

Looking to the future, Julien is cautiously optimistic.

“My wish for the UK and Europe is to continue implementing their regulation while developing more support mechanisms for the local airlines. The threat that we see is that if the regulations in Europe and the UK are not fairly designed, it may have a negative impact on their competitiveness.”

He also hopes to see major economies like India and China embrace SAF, which will send a positive signal towards the rest of the industry.

And, crucially, he wants to see evidence of voluntary demand.

“There is demand from passengers and a little bit of willingness to pay a little bit more to fly with a lower carbon footprint,” he says.

“To me, that would give me a lot of hope for our success going forward and for our ability to achieve net zero in 2050.”

Revolutionising aviation

The transition to SAF is a revolution for the air transport industry – one that will require technical ingenuity, policy innovation and global collaboration.

“The energy challenge of human mankind in that transition is huge,” Julien reflects. “We don’t want to look at it only from the perspective of aviation. It is much bigger than us, much bigger.”

Yet, as Airbus and its partners demonstrate, the journey is well under way. The pioneers of sustainable flight are not only changing how we fly, but also how we think about our place in a rapidly warming world.

“ERA ONE offers a real solution to one of our era’s greatest challenges: emissions from sectors that cannot be easily electrified, such as aviation and shipping,” said Tim Böltken, co-founder and CEO of INERATEC, at the plant’s inauguration. “We are not only replacing fossil molecules with green ones—we are also demonstrating that climate-neutral e-Fuels are technologically viable and commercially ready.”

Attended by key figures from government, industry and academia, the opening ceremony highlighted the project’s broad impact. Kaweh Mansoori, Hesse’s Minister of Economic Affairs, praised the project as a landmark step toward European energy independence and a testament to the region’s appeal for innovative enterprises.

INERATEC’s modular plant design enables scalable production. The company plans to significantly increase its output by 2030 through additional projects, aligning with regulations like the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, which mandates minimum shares of sustainable aviation fuels.

The ERA ONE facility is strategically integrated within the Frankfurt-Höchst industrial park. Its two main inputs—CO2 and hydrogen—are sourced locally: the CO2 is derived from a biogas plant that recycles organic waste, while the hydrogen is a byproduct of chlorine manufacturing. The synthetic crude oil produced can also be used to manufacture sustainable base chemicals, aiding the chemical industry’s decarbonization.

The project is backed by strong financial support, including a €70 million package comprising €40 million in venture debt from the European Investment Bank and a €30 million grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment also contributed funding under its Environmental Innovation Programme.

Alcohol-to-jet stuck on runway as US policy shifts

Alcohol-to-jet stuck on runway as US policy shifts

New York, 4 June (Argus) — Proposed changes to a US clean fuel tax credit may be a boon for farmers, but a future where ethanol is a major ingredient in jet fuel remains far off. The massive Republican budget bill currently advancing through Congress would extend the ""45Z"" credit, which offers larger subsidies to fuels as they produce fewer emissions. The proposal too would bar regulators from weighing indirect land use impacts , effectively upping subsidies for crop-based fuels like ethanol, in a win for agribusiness. Farm groups have hoped that such changes could open the growing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market to ethanol producers, otherwise at risk from an increasingly efficient and electric US vehicle fleet. Airlines too are eager for more diverse SAF sources since the main pathway nowadays, processing vegetable oils and animal fats, draws from more limited feedstocks. United Airlines government affairs director Tom Michels said at an OurEnergyPolicy forum earlier this year that the company hopes ethanol-based fuel ""could fulfill around a quarter of our future SAF needs."" But incentives in law and under the proposal, which passed the House last month, would do little to boost ""alcohol-to-jet"" output. While ethanol typically trades at a discount to gasoline, SAF is substantially more expensive than petroleum, making government support essential for uptake. The Republican caucus has a range of views, with clean energy advocates wary of phasing out subsidies, farm-state representatives intent on boosting biofuels, and conservatives committed to curbing government spending. Republicans plan to use a process called reconciliation that allows them to pass the bill without Democratic support. How policymakers implement 45Z will be crucial for a wave of alcohol-to-jet startups eyeing production this decade. That includes Gevo, whose plans for an integrated 60mn USG/yr plant in South Dakota are complicated by another company's struggles starting an interstate carbon pipeline. Meanwhile, people familiar with the matter say that LanzaJet's 10mn USG/yr alcohol-to-jet pilot project in Georgia — which opened last year but is not yet fully operational — is not currently producing any SAF. ""The suite of policies we would need to make ethanol-to-jet pencil out just does not exist right now,"" said Brian Jennings, chief executive of the American Coalition for Ethanol. RINs wear thin Ethanol-based SAF would likely still produce too many emissions to claim any 45Z subsidy even if the proposed emissions tracking changes took effect — since the pathway requires more energy-intensive processing to make fuel suitable for jet engines. Carbon capture could make up the difference, though few facilities have that capability. The lack of subsidy would compound barriers from the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners to blend biofuels or buy credits from those who do. Under the program, blending corn ethanol earns a Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit, but there is no certified pathway yet to offer RINs for corn-based SAF blending. Even if there were, advanced biofuel credits have traded recently at only a slight premium, reducing the incentive for ethanol producers to eye new markets. Argus last assessed current year D4 biomass-based diesel credits at 92.25¢/RIN and D6 conventional credits at 86.50¢/RIN, and they traded at parity much of last year. Meanwhile, the typical US dry mill ethanol producer would likely qualify for some 45Z subsidy if the Republican bill passed, adding to RIN benefits. Those plants would have to forgo both incentives to sell to SAF makers. It is unclear how producers of a more-expensive and less-subsidized SAF could compete on price. Gevo chief executive Patrick Gruber said that his company's integrated model — producing ethanol and SAF at the same sites — is less risky than buying ethanol from elsewhere. But there are other policy headwinds. A new South Dakota law to restrict eminent domain could derail Summit Carbon's planned multistate carbon pipeline, which dozens of biorefineries, including one Gevo facility, want to join. Gevo has purchased a North Dakota biorefinery that can already capture carbon on site, a potentially lucrative workaround to pipeline delays, and is eyeing SAF production there too. There is a RIN pathway for SAF from Brazilian sugarcane ethanol — a model that LanzaJet has pursued — but credit pricing makes economics challenging there too, adding to freight and tariff costs . Even then, the bill to change 45Z would restrict eligibility to North American feedstocks, upending LanzaJet's plans for Brazilian ethanol without making US alternatives more economical. ""45Z as currently drafted creates a disincentive for US ethanol to be used in SAF,"" said LanzaJet vice president of government and regulatory affairs Angela Foster-Rice. ""We are hopeful to get this issue addressed in the Senate bill."" Despite policy uncertainty, airlines have committed to procuring far more SAF and might be willing to pay a premium. But they are more likely to pay up for fuel they can at least use for SAF mandates in the EU and UK, which do not credit fuels from first-generation crops. US federal and state programs subsidize lower-carbon jet fuels but do not mandate usage. The floor is yours The Republican bill is still just a proposal, leaving the possibility for changes. The Senate reconvened this week with a goal of passing the bill before 4 July, and members have signaled they might take a different approach to clean energy subsidies than the House. Some biofuel lobbyists support shifting rules to benefit SAF — potentially by providing a higher ""floor"" credit for refiners that barely qualify or allowing alcohol-to-jet producers to claim the same benefit as upstream ethanol refiners. Under current rules, fuels may earn just cents per gallon. But such changes could rile trucking groups frustrated with 45Z already offering heftier subsidies to SAF and deficit hawks worried about the bill's mounting costs.

France-based Global Bioenergies on June 3 announced the company has launched an official search for buyers in the form of a “pre-pack sale” as part of a conciliation procedure. Purchase offers are due July 9.

The company, which has been operating for more than a decade, developed a process produce biobased isobutene, a molecule with applications in the energy, materials and cosmetics industries. Global Bioenergies in mid-2024 announced it had adopted its process to convert biobased materials into e-SAF, a form of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced from carbon dioxide and hydrogen, using acetic acid as a resource.

In October 2024, Global Bioenergies announced plans to focus its business exclusively on e-SAF production. The decision was made after a proposed plant dedicated to the cosmetics market failed to find adequate investors.

The company earlier this year supplied a batch of SAF to Safran, the world’s second-largest aircraft equipment manufacturer, for evaluation. Safron assessed the specific properties of the fuel during the fuel injection phase prior to combustion in the engine. ONERA, the French aerospace center, has also carried out tests on a laboratory burner to quantify the particles emitted during combustion of SAF. According to Global Bioeneries, that testing demonstrated a 40-99% reduction in soot emissions when compared with Jet-A-1 fuel, depending on the conditions tested in the laboratory.

In its June 3 announcement, Global Bioenergies said it has been unable to find strategic investors to finance the continuation of its business. The planned pre-pack sale enables potential buyers to position themselves for the acquisition of all or part of the company’s business or assets. Completion of the sale plan, once decreed by the Commercial Court, will be followed by the liquidation of the company, involving the un-collectability of all or part of its liabilities, notably bank debts, and will results in the desilting of its securities.

“As a reminder, we were unable to finance our first plant project and switched in the autumn of 2024 to an R&D collaboration project with a major international industrialist, aiming to combine its technology with ours to produce particularly competitive sustainable aviation fuels,” said Marc Delcourt, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Global Bioenergies. “In this context, we had to finance our share of this project until profitability was reached.

“We contacted numerous potential investors, mainly large industrial companies who would play an operational role in the project in addition to their investment,” Delcourt continued. “Despite several promising discussions and significant expressions of interest, we regret to say that none of these players is interested in acquiring a minority or majority stake in the Company in its current configuration and in the current geopolitical climate, which is adverse to investment in solutions to fight global warming and promote the energy transition. As a result, we are now looking for a buyer for the business.”

The Commercial Court of Evry will evaluate the offers and select the buyer. A sales transaction is currently expected to close in September or October 2025.

So far in the current fiscal year, which began on July 1, 2024, RFIP has awarded over $11 million in grants, funding 388 E15 projects and 39 biodiesel projects. These public dollars have spurred millions more in private investment, accelerating the expansion of higher blends of renewable fuels across the state.

“It is clear the Governor’s E15 Access Standard is working and on pace for implementation on January 1 next year,” said Shaw. “We’re also pleased to see that as we predicted a huge number of retail locations in Iowa have been able to offer E15 with a very small investment, most of which is covered by the RFIP grants.”

In total, since the program's founding, more than $59 million in state grants have been awarded through RFIP, helping fund ethanol and biodiesel infrastructure. These investments have enabled hundreds of Iowa fueling stations to offer cleaner-burning, homegrown fuels like E15, E85, and biodiesel blends to consumers.

The Iowa Legislature recently approved an additional $10 million in funding for the program for the upcoming fiscal year. “We thank Governor Reynolds and state legislative leaders for stepping up,” Shaw added. “With a nudge from the Governor’s Biofuels Bill and support from the RFIP grant program, in less than three years E15 has gone from hard to find to readily available to the vast majority of Iowans. In short, the E15 Access Standard has been a remarkable success for motorists, Iowa’s economy, our environment, and for Iowa’s farmers.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/epm/posts/web/2014/04/GasPumps_13975131953062.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 20:56:39.178630

A draft version of the policy, which will be effective for a period of five years from the date of promulgation, is now up for comments and suggestions. ""The policy aims to position UP as a leading hub for SAF manufacturing in India, enhance energy security, support decarbonisation of the aviation sector, and generate green employment opportunities through innovation, investment, and public-private partnership,"" said a senior officer in the state govt. The officer informed that Invest UP will be the nodal agency for sanction and disbursement of fiscal incentives to SAF units that come up under the policy. As per the draft, in addition to the primary goals, the policy also aims to support research, innovation, and technology partnerships in SAF feedstock processing and fuel conversion. It seeks to create rural and urban green employment opportunities through feedstock supply chains and processing facilities, contribute to national climate goals and India's SAF blending targets, while enhancing energy security, among others. To achieve the goals, the state govt would roll out several fiscal and non-fiscal benefits to willing investors. For this, the draft policy first describes large and mega SAF units based on minimum capital investment. While those with a minimum investment of Rs 50 crore and up to Rs 199 crore will be called large, those with an investment of Rs 200 crore or more would be called mega. The incentive framework also spells out eligibility criteria to elaborate on the fiscal benefits the state govt would extend. The list includes a front-end land subsidy of 50% to units that come up in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad and 75% in the rest of western UP and central UP districts. For districts in the eastern UP and Bundelkhand region, the incentive would be 80%. The list also includes stamp duty exemptions, waiver for land use conversion, exemption from developmental charges, capital subsidy, state GST reimbursement, interest subsidy, skill development subsidy, and reimbursement of patent registration fees, among others. The non-fiscal benefits include the development of aggregated feedstock procurement platforms to ensure a steady and quality supply of biomass, used cooking oil, and municipal waste. It will facilitate linkages with farmers, waste management bodies, and industries for feedstock supply contracts, and the development of dedicated SAF storage, blending, and distribution infrastructure at airports and fuel depots at strategic locations having high biowaste production in proximity to aviation zones. The state govt will promote feedstock certification and sustainability standards to ensure compliance and market acceptance, among others. Companies like Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum, and Hindustan Petroleum are actively exploring partnerships and pilot projects to commercialise SAF technologies. Moreover, global players like Boeing and Airbus have entered collaborations with Indian institutions to develop indigenous SAF solutions.

Climate Costs Could Mean Higher Air Fares Reuters reported that IATA said some of that cost will likely be passed on to travelers through higher fares.
The airlines cannot absorb increased costs,"" Walsh previously said.
It said that in 2025, it is projected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.
“We reject claims from the aviation sector suggesting a lack of sustainable aviation fuel supply,” the group previously told Skift.","The airline industry is sticking to its target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, despite growing concerns over the slow ramp-up of green aviation fuels.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents more than 350 airlines globally, reaffirmed its climate goal at the close of its two-day annual summit in New Delhi on Tuesday.

“There had been no talk of any delay to the target,” IATA director Willie Walsh said in a press conference, according to Reuters. He added that the goal remains both realistic and necessary.

The target had come under scrutiny amid fears it might be delayed due to the lack of available low-emissions fuel.

“There is great concern that we're not making sufficient progress, not as airlines, but as the value chain that needs to support the airlines transitioning to net zero,” Walsh said.

“We still have time to get there, but we do need to see more action from all of the partners in the value chain.”

Fuel Producers Not Playing Their Part

Walsh called out oil majors and fuel producers for scaling back their investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the sector’s preferred alternative to fossil-based jet fuel.

The sector says SAF can reduce emissions by around 60%, but it currently accounts for less than 1% of global jet fuel use.

“We have made clear from the very beginning that the airline industry will not be able to achieve net zero in 2050 unless everybody in the wider value chain supports the industry in doing that,” Walsh said. “I think it is a wakeup call.”

While industry profits have rebounded since the pandemic, IATA warned that the cost of meeting net zero could reach as much as $4.7 trillion.

Climate Costs Could Mean Higher Air Fares

Reuters reported that IATA said some of that cost will likely be passed on to travelers through higher fares. Walsh and IATA have previously spoken about the risk of higher fares.

""Going forward as we see increases in carbon costs, there has to be an impact on ticket prices as the industry transitions to net zero. The airlines cannot absorb increased costs,"" Walsh previously said.

In a new report, IATA estimated that the average cost of SAF in 2024 was 3.1 times that of conventional jet fuel. It said that in 2025, it is projected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.

Lufthansa has already introduced an environmental surcharge on all tickets from most European countries. The amount of the surcharge varies between $1 and $78, depending on the flight route.

""This is due to steadily rising additional costs due to regulatory environmental requirements,"" the airline said in a statement. ""These include the statutory blending quota of initially 2% for SAF for departures from European Union.""

IATA is expected to release further guidance on SAF deployment and financing later this year.

Fuels Europe, which represents companies like BP and Shell, have rejected the aviation industry’s claims.

“We reject claims from the aviation sector suggesting a lack of sustainable aviation fuel supply,” the group previously told Skift. “Our members are on track to meet their current mandate and exceed 2030 targets. Despite policy and investment challenges, European fuel producers have rapidly scaled SAF output and lowered costs.”

The project, located in Durazno, Uruguay, is being developed in partnership with Kent, a firm known for its experience in SAF project execution, reports Biomass Magazine.

NovaSAF 1 is expected to produce more than 350,000 gallons of ASTM-certified SAF each year, using biogas and clean electricity in a breakthrough production process that aims to cut costs and carbon emissions. Syzygy says the plant will serve as a blueprint for scalable and low-cost SAF production worldwide.

The facility is backed by long-term agreements with Estancias del Lago (EDL), one of Uruguay’s largest dairy and agri-energy operations, securing both the site and biogas feedstock for the project. Permitting and equipment sourcing are underway in parallel with engineering design.

The plant will run on Syzygy’s proprietary NovaSAF platform, which merges biogas use with Power-to-Liquids (PtL) technology. By using waste as a feedstock and avoiding the need for gas pipelines or intensive water use, the process is designed to be both resource-efficient and environmentally responsible.

Syzygy says NovaSAF could meet EU Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) criteria, positioning it as a potential solution to global regulatory demands. Unlike more established SAF production methods—such as HEFA, ATJ, or traditional PtL—NovaSAF aims to deliver sustainable jet fuel at a cost that matches conventional Jet-A fuel once fully commercialized.

Until recently, sustainable aviation fuel was only available in limited quantities, but new supplies may soon change that.
Also called “neat” SAF, 100 percent bio-based sustainable aviation fuel is not certified for use on its own.
More sustainable aviation fuel is on the way Bio-based sustainable aviation fuel ventures also continue to attract investors and public funding.
Meanwhile, the Montana Renewables branch of Calumet is now producing sustainable aviation fuel at its facility in Great Falls, Montana.","Sustainable air travel is an elusive goal. Zero-emission electric aircraft have begun to emerge, but only at a small scale and for short distances. Bio-based sustainable aviation fuel offers the potential for more rapid scale-up because it can be blended with conventional jet fuel for use in existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure. Until recently, sustainable aviation fuel was only available in limited quantities, but new supplies may soon change that.

The slow pace of sustainable aviation fuel uptake

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) stakeholders have experimented with many different kinds of bio-based sources since the early 2000s, including algae, food waste, and agricultural and forest waste, along with cultivated energy crops including oilseeds and grasses as well as corn and soy.

But progress is moving at a snail’s pace. United Airlines, for example, became the first major airline to test sustainable aviation fuel back in 2009 and since then has explored various bio-based sources including algae. The company says it has invested in the “future production” of more than 5 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, but achieving that scale is a long-term goal.

In the meantime, United advises that “production remains very limited,” and very expensive as well, and the airline is not alone. Sustainable aviation fuel accounted for less than 0.15 percent of the total fuel used among 77 leading airlines last year, according to a survey from the European organization Transport & Environment.

Corn, soy oil, and other cultivated crops accounted for more than 30 percent of the sustainable aviation fuel used among the airlines T&E surveyed, indicating that agriculture-related carbon emissions could offset much of the gains from using bio-based resources. In addition, 100 percent bio-based fuel is not a complete solution. Also called “neat” SAF, 100 percent bio-based sustainable aviation fuel is not certified for use on its own. Instead, it is blended with conventional jet fuel, making it all the more important to keep agricultural supply chain emissions down to a minimum.

The electrofuels solution

Electrofuels are an alternative solution that is gaining ground. Sometimes called solar fuels or e-fuels, electrofuels are synthetic hydrocarbon fuels produced by deploying electricity — ideally from solar power or other renewable resources — to separate green hydrogen gas from water. The hydrogen is then combined with captured carbon to create new fuels that are chemically identical to fossil-sourced fuels, meaning they can be used on their own on a drop-in basis instead of blending with conventional jet fuels.

Although cost is an obstacle, some analysts project the price of green hydrogen will dip to a competitive level by 2030.

United is among the aviation stakeholders signaling that the electrofuels pathway is a promising one. Last month, the company's United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight Fund invested in the U.S. electrofuels startup Twelve. The startup describes its green hydrogen process as a form of artificial photosynthesis, deploying renewable energy to produce sustainable aviation fuel from carbon dioxide and water, yielding a potential cut of 90 percent in lifecycle carbon emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

With additional funding in hand, Twelve plans to begin producing fuel at a plant in Moses Lake, Washington, later this year and aims for an output of 50,000 gallons annually. The company also entered a 14-year contract with a five-airline group in Europe, to be named later, for a total of 260 million gallons of fuel.

More sustainable aviation fuel is on the way

Bio-based sustainable aviation fuel ventures also continue to attract investors and public funding.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently noted a sharp increase in production of what it classifies as ""Other Biofuels,"" which practically doubled from December 2024 to February 2025. “Other Biofuels” include renewable heating oil and emerging biofuels, but the EIA notes that sustainable aviation fuel is beginning to dominate the category, making it a useful indication of activity in this sector. “With [sustainable aviation fuel] production capacity now around 30,000 [barrels per day] and growing in 2025, SAF will likely drive significant growth ... and make up most of U.S. Other Biofuels production,” EIA reported.

Among the recent projects the agency highlighted is a 15,000 barrel-per-day facility in Texas under the umbrella of Diamond Green Diesel, a joint venture of Valero Energy and the firm Darling Ingredients, which focuses on producing biofuels from animal fats, used cooking oil and food waste among other sources.

Another newly operational project comes from New Rise Renewables, which converted a former biodiesel operation in Nevada to produce sustainable aviation fuel. The company, a branch of the firm XCF Global, began producing fuel at the facility in February at a rate of 3,000 barrels per day. XCF says a third-party buyer has already contracted for more than 3 million gallons.

Meanwhile, the Montana Renewables branch of Calumet is now producing sustainable aviation fuel at its facility in Great Falls, Montana. “Montana Renewables expects to reach 120- to 150-million-gallon SAF capacity sooner than previously reported for a fraction of the cost,” Calumet reported in May, citing its experience over the past two years as the main factor enabling the facility to expand while cutting costs. The company says it's on track to reach a capacity of up to 300 million gallons per year by 2028.

The expansion of Montana Renewables is particularly noteworthy because it is one of few renewable energy projects supported by the Donald Trump administration. To help finance the expansion, Montana Renewables applied for and received a loan guarantee of $1.44 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy. The transaction was closed during the final days of the Joe Biden administration. On Feb. 18, almost a month after President Trump took office, Calumet announced that the first drawdown of $782 million was authorized by the Energy Department.",https://back.3blcdn.com/sites/default/files/styles/ratio_3_2/public/triplepundit/wide/getty-images-Q0gNKKSP4aE-unsplash.jpg?h=f4bc3890,N,,2025-06-04 14:56:29.504482

While the goal to double SAF production is commendable, cost remains the industry’s biggest concern.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced a major target: doubling global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to 2 million tonnes (2.5 billion liters) by 2025. That would mark real progress for a sector under increasing scrutiny for its carbon emissions. Yet even with that increase, SAF would still make up just 0.7% of total aviation fuel use—a sliver of what’s needed to decarbonize the skies.

The aviation sector accounts for nearly 2% of global CO₂ emissions, and SAF is currently seen as the most viable near-term solution to cut that number. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is derived from renewable feedstocks like waste oils and organic waste, and can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%.

Still, airlines are far from breaking their dependency on fossil fuel. Today, 99% of aviation fuel remains petroleum-based, and without major policy interventions, that may not change fast enough.

Why Scaling SAF Remains So Hard—and Expensive

IATA further explains that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) costs about five times more than regular jet fuel. This high price comes from the complex process of making SAF, which uses advanced technology and hard-to-find raw materials. On top of that, airlines face extra costs to meet government rules in places like the EU and the UK. For example, European airlines may have to spend an extra $1.7 billion just to follow SAF requirements.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said,

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

For smaller airlines, these costs are especially punishing. That’s why IATA and industry leaders are calling for stronger government support—tax credits, subsidies, and policy reforms that can level the playing field with fossil fuels.

Without such support, there’s a risk that SAF production could stagnate right when it needs to ramp up.

Walsh further says,

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”

Government Support: The Missing Link?

Progress is visible in some regions. The Biden administration has launched green aviation programs in the U.S., though many in the sector say the funding and guarantees still fall short. Meanwhile, Norway and Sweden are setting the pace with robust incentives that make SAF more accessible and affordable.

These countries show that smart policy can align environmental and economic goals. Their models could be copied elsewhere, especially in emerging markets where aviation growth is exploding.

IATA urges governments to focus on three key priorities:

Fixing the policy imbalance: Redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies could boost SAF economics dramatically.

Building integrated energy strategies: A long-term plan must ensure SAF gets a fair slice of the renewable energy supply and infrastructure.

Supporting CORSIA: IATA wants more Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). So far, only Guyana has made its carbon credits available to airlines under the scheme.

Building the SAF Market: IATA’s Initiatives

To help scale up the SAF market, IATA is supporting two key programs:

SAF Registry (via CADO): A global system to track SAF usage and emissions reductions. It ensures compliance with standards like CORSIA and the EU ETS.

SAF Matchmaker: A platform that connects airlines seeking SAF with producers who have it, helping both sides find better deals and drive volume.

Together, these tools aim to bring more transparency and efficiency to a market that’s still in its infancy.

The Global SAF Market in 2030: A Long Climb Ahead

Key trends shaping the SAF market:

High prices continue to slow adoption

Investor interest is rising, especially in new tech like waste-to-fuel systems that could cut costs

Policy action will determine how fast production scales

With the right mix of investment and regulation, SAF could become cost-competitive with fossil fuel sooner than many expect.

India: A Growing Aviation Power Makes a SAF Play

India is stepping into the spotlight with bold SAF goals. As the world’s third-largest oil consumer and third-largest aviation market, India has launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to accelerate the adoption of alternative fuels, including SAF.

The country aims for a 2% SAF blend in international flights by 2028. To reach this goal, India plans to offer guaranteed pricing, capital support, and technical standards.

IATA is partnering with ISMA (Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association) and Praj Industries to guide India on feedstock sustainability and lifecycle assessments—critical steps toward building a globally recognized SAF ecosystem.

Can the Aviation Industry Afford to Go Green?

While the goal to double SAF production is commendable, cost remains the industry’s biggest concern. Airlines operate on razor-thin margins and can’t absorb high fuel costs without passing them on to passengers.

What’s needed is a system-wide alignment:

Governments must provide financial support through subsidies and grants

Airlines must commit to long-term SAF purchase agreements

Investors must back scalable, cost-cutting tech

Consumers must favor low-carbon travel options

The stakes are high, but so is the potential. SAF offers the most immediate path to decarbonize long-haul aviation, where electric or hydrogen options won’t be viable anytime soon.

Doubling SAF output to 2 million tonnes by 2025 is a strong step. But to meet net-zero goals by 2050, the world needs to go far beyond. That means bold policies, faster tech innovation, and deeper collaboration between governments, airlines, and energy producers.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/flux_IATA-Aims-to-Double-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-by-2025-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 13:56:30.324615

While the hoped-for future trade between Europe and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) remained in focus, a shift in emphasis appeared. While national goals look increasingly dubious, progress is occurring in specific industry sectors guided by international agreements. Meanwhile, MENA countries confront the imperative to develop domestic markets for their clean hydrogen.

Looking for good news

Industry observers strained to find good news during a discussion called ‘Low carbon and green hydrogen: navigating challenges to open opportunities.’

High cost, lack of demand and regulatory uncertainty were named as the main factors holding projects back.

Even the world’s premier project – NEOM Green Hydrogen in Saudi Arabia – is in danger of delays. TotalEnergies will buy 70,000 tons per year in a long-term contract, about one-third of planned production, but there are no other buyers yet according to a report by Bloomberg News last week.

In Europe, with EU mandates and pipelines for hydrogen under development, there is ongoing criticism of the regulatory regime being shaped by the EU, which many participants believe is too onerous. Europe’s incentive schemes and contract for difference programs are producing just a small part of the green fuels required to meet EU goals.

And the outlook for hydrogen in the US remains precarious, where incentives may be revoked to offset tax cuts.

Chicken and egg

There’s a basic ‘chicken and egg’ problem afflicting the nascent industry, in which there’s no market without demand, and no demand without a market.

“We’re trying to create a market out of essentially nothing, we’re at very early stages,” said Frederik Beelitz, Head of Advisory for Central Europe, Aurora Energy Research.

“Bridging the gap between the levelized cost of hydrogen and the willingness to pay is currently the big challenge, mainly on the demand side,” he said.

“Potential offtakers for green or low-carbon hydrogen are just not willing to pay the relatively high cost that it now incurs.”

Producers want long-term off-take agreements, but off-takers such as industrial companies and utilities want shorter agreements in anticipation of the cost of hydrogen falling as production ramps up and technology improves.

""No one can commit to a 10-year price, no one can carry that risk,” said Jan Haizmann, CEO, Zero Emissions Traders Alliance.

“But we’ve seen how quickly renewables scaled and hydrogen might follow the same path if the conditions are right.""

In Europe, the chicken and egg problem is being met with push and pull policies. On the supply side, pull factors taking the levelized cost of hydrogen down include support mechanisms for capital cost and financing. On the demand side, push factors act to raise the capacity or willingness or buyers to pay. Auction devices such as Germany’s H2Global, now going into its second auction round, provide critical price information while subsidizing the difference between suppliers’ long-term prices and buyers’ preference for short-term contracts. However, it’s unclear whether these programs will build meaningful scale.

Sector specific

At last week’s conference and other recent events, there’s been less use of the term ‘hydrogen industry’ and more emphasis on industry sectors. Hydrogen and its derivatives are now seen as high value fuels for very specific applications.

In Europe, the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) sets clear targets for the maritime and aviation sectors, in the form of the percentage of ‘renewable fuels of non-biological origin’ (RFNBO) that fuels must contain.

This should create demand for derivatives and synthetic or e-fuels produced with hydrogen. Such fuels include ammonia and e-methanol in the maritime sector and e-kerosene in the aviation sector.

In aviation, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) has entered Phase 1. Airlines can purchase carbon credits in the voluntary market, which must meet the high CORSIA standards, or they can purchase sustainable aviation fuel. The amount of emissions covered will expand greatly when Phase 2 starts in 2027 with the inclusion of Brazil, India, Russia and China in the scheme.

In global shipping, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has issued draft rules mandating greenhouse gas emissions reductions for ships (5,000 gross tonnage or greater) and imposing penalties for non-compliance.

These rules will effectively impose the first ever global carbon price for international shipping and create demand for green and low-carbon hydrogen derivatives and biofuels. They should compel shipowners and the fuel producers and bunkering companies supplying them to substitute renewable and low-carbon fuels, including expensive-to-produce e-methanol, in place of fossil-derived fuels.

Demand for low-carbon hydrogen should also arise in the power sector, with more electrification of transport and industry and increasing demand for electricity produced from renewable energy systems.

As the price of renewable power continues to decline, it will make hydrogen more competitive because much of its cost is based on electricity prices. Where seasonal power demand variations occur, it can play a critical role in seasonal storage.

In fact, hydrogen production and storage could help utilities to hedge against low power prices in Europe, where renewable energy has exposed them to very low and even negative prices.

Carrots and sticks for domestic markets

For MENA countries, the prospects for large-scale green hydrogen exports look increasingly unlikely in the near future. Yet countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already invested a lot and risk stranded assets. The question is critical for Saudi Arabia, where the biggest electrolyser production in the world will launch at NEOM next year, and this hydrogen will need to find 100% offtake for 600 tonnes per day produced.

“To have it all go out on ships is very ambitious,” said Jan Haizmann. “They will have to think about what to do with the remainder, as export opportunities may not be realized.”

The countries are already large consumers of hydrogen in their refining and chemicals industries. They have green hydrogen targets in place and plan to develop domestic demand for green and blue (with carbon capture) hydrogen.

""Countries in the region need to build their own internal markets with clear rules and binding targets that drive demand,"" said Haizmann. And he emphasized that they will likely need incentives to create demand.

They will need ‘carrots and sticks’, including binding targets that compel companies to procure certain volumes of low carbon fuels for their operations or face penalties, because a purely voluntary system that mostly relies on export scenarios is unlikely to work.

As an example, he pointed to the incentives that, over time, supported the rise of renewable energy systems in many regions.

“With every new technology, there is a need to incentivize it to get to high volumes, and when high volumes are achieved, then prices come down,” he said.

“The production opportunities for hydrogen in MENA are fantastic, almost unrivalled, because of the sunshine here,” he said. “But it doesn’t remove the need to do something to realize the opportunities.”

The development of the list in 2022 formed part of an anti-ESG movement in Republican states, which has gained further momentum since the election of President Trump, with Texas consistently at the forefront. Texas is the largest net energy supplier in the U.S., providing nearly a quarter of the country’s domestically produced energy, and accounting for over 40% of the nation’s crude oil proved reserves and production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Under Texas law, the Comptroller is required to maintain and update a “list of financial companies that boy energy companies,” with the law giving companies given 90 days to “cease boycotting energy companies in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by state governmental entities.”

BlackRock was one of the investment companies first included on the list when it was launched by the Comptroller’s office in 2022. While Hegar welcomed changes made by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list and noted that “it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift,” each of the other investment companies included on the initial 2022 list remain on the updated list, expect for Credit Suisse, which has been acquired by UBS – which is also on the updated list.

In a statement announcing the removal of BlackRock from the list, Hegar said:

“This is a meaningful victory and validates the leadership Texas has shown on this issue, which has seen a monumental shift in the way companies, governments and individual Americans view the energy sector.”

The Comptroller’s office listed a series of moves by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list, including the investment manager’s decision to exit the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative and to reduce its participation in Climate Action 100+, as well as reducing the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas. Hegar added that BlackRock “shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future.”

15 companies remain on the Comptroller’s list, including AMP, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Danske Bank, HSBC, Impax Asset Management, Jupiter Fund Management, NatWest, Nordea Bank, Rathbones, Schroders, Societe Generale, Svenska Handelsbanken, Swedbank and UBS, in addition to hundreds of individual funds.

The stewardship report, published on 4 June, detailed LGPS Central’s manager engagement, with the pension pool marking engagement disclosure through a rating process. If the level of engagement disclosure was unsatisfactory, or where the link between an engagement and subsequent investment decision-making was unclear, fund managers were marked down through a rating review.

According to the report, in quarter two of 2024, LGPS Central took the decision to downgrade one of its fixed income managers from “yellow” to “amber”. The report cited that the downgrade reflected long-term concerns that the manager, despite being able to discuss ESG risks associated with its holdings, was not integrating these factors into its decision-making process.

“This was evidenced by the presence of several investments with high exposure to ESG risk coupled with limited efforts to mitigate that risk through stewardship,” the report said.

According to a company statement released on June 4, the facility in Durazno, Uruguay, is expected to produce over 350,000 gallons of ASTM-certified SAF annually and serve as a replicable model for scalable and cost-efficient clean fuel.

The facility will operate using Syzygy's proprietary NovaSAF platform, which combines renewable biogas and carbon dioxide with clean electricity to produce drop-in aviation fuel.

The plant's feedstock, derived from cow manure and captured CO2, will be supplied through long-term agreements with Estancias del Lago, one of Uruguay's largest dairy and agri-energy operations.

With Uruguay's nearly 100% renewable power grid, NovaSAF 1 aims to deliver ultra-low carbon intensity fuel with over 80% emissions reduction compared to conventional Jet-A.

""This is more than just a SAF plant, it's a new model for biogas economics,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""We're turning waste into value by converting underutilized biogas sources into high-value clean fuel hubs without relying on pipelines, gas separation, or subsidies. NovaSAF™ is one of the few pathways that can offer Jet-A parity pricing while meaningfully decarbonizing aviation.""

Syzygy's electrified approach - distinct from conventional SAF pathways like HEFA or ATJ - allows the direct use of raw biogas without costly pre-processing.

The design is modular and scalable, making it ideal for replication in other biogas-rich regions such as dairy farms, landfills and wastewater treatment plants.

According to the company, the NovaSAF 1 facility will have more than 50% higher SAF yield than traditional biogas reforming methods by utilizing both methane and CO2 as feedstocks.

""We're proud to support Syzygy in delivering the world's first profitable biogas-to-SAF plant,"" said Tom Bullard, EVP Operations, The Americas at Kent, the engineering partner leading FEED. ""This project highlights our capability to deliver groundbreaking clean energy infrastructure at scale.""

The facility is expected to reach the final investment decision by the fourth quarter and begin commercial operations by Q1 2027. SAF produced at the site will comply with international aviation sustainability standards, including those set by EU RFNBO, US federal programs and CORSIA.

Biogas-based SAF

Syzygy's NovaSAF project builds on the company's recent breakthrough: the world's largest all-electric GHG e-Reforming™ demonstration unit, which successfully completed over 3,000 hours of trials in Houston, Texas and Ulsan, South Korea.

The unit uses Syzygy's Rigel Reactor to reform raw biogas into syngas without combustion, setting a new benchmark for efficiency in SAF production.

Traditional SAF pathways require either costly renewable natural gas upgrades or high market prices supported by subsidies to remain viable.

Syzygy's process bypasses these hurdles by processing biogas directly from anaerobic digesters or landfills with minimal preparation, eliminating the need for CO2 separation or pipeline infrastructure.

""This demonstration plant achieves our first major step in expanding SAF production and transforming energy,"" said Best. ""We'll continue refining the system in Houston while advancing new commercial projects globally.""

Olivia Palamountain reports

As the aviation industry scrambles for solutions to its environmental challenge, European and Asian carriers are embracing aircraft modifications inspired by shark skin.

Vueling has become the first European airline to partner with Australian technology company MicroTau to explore its ""shark skin"" Riblet Modification Package, while All Nippon Airways (ANA) has expanded its use of similar AeroSHARK technology to passenger aircraft. This makes it the first airline worldwide to operate the system on both cargo and passenger Boeing 777s.

The technology mimics the microscopic texture of shark skin, which appears smooth but is actually covered in tiny grooves called riblets that help reduce drag as the animal moves through water.

Applied as a film to aircraft exteriors, these riblets can improve fuel efficiency by up to 4% according to MicroTau, whilst ANA has verified approximately 1% savings with the AeroSHARK system developed by Lufthansa Technik and BASF.

""The possibility of implementing MicroTau's cutting-edge technology across our aircraft once it is certified will mark an important milestone in Vueling's journey toward sustainable aviation,"" says Franc Sanmartí, director of sustainability at Vueling.

ANA, which began operating a Boeing 777 Freighter with the technology in September 2024, has now launched commercial operations of its first passenger aircraft equipped with AeroSHARK. The airline plans to expand the technology across other aircraft of the same type.

The riblet modifications require no structural changes to aircraft and can be retrofitted to existing fleets. Lufthansa Technik currently holds certifications for AeroSHARK modifications on various Boeing 777 types, with approximately 28 long-haul aircraft already operating with the technology worldwide.

by Rajesh Kumar Singh, Shivansh Tiwary and Tim Hepher (Reuters) Airlines face challenges with affordable greener fuel supplies; IATA estimates $4.7 trillion cost for net zero by 2050

Global airlines wrapped up a two-day summit on Tuesday (June 3, 2025) sticking to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, but voicing fresh worries about the availability of greener fuels and new planes.

The International Air Transport Association, which represents about 350 airlines, said hitting the target would cost carriers $4.7 trillion, or $174 billion a year - at least some of which is likely to be passed on as higher fares.

...

On Tuesday, (IATA Director General Willie) Walsh said there had been no talk of any delay in the target at this week's annual meeting in New Delhi.

The industry's sustainability efforts are largely centred around plant-based sustainable aviation fuels. But with current supplies covering just a fraction of airlines' fuel needs, carriers urged governments and energy firms to do more.

""The oil companies are obviously not producing (enough) SAF,"" said IATA's Chief Economist Marie Owens Thomsen.

The energy industry insists enough SAF is available in Europe for the time being after a spate of investments, with some executives and analysts saying markets are oversupplied.

""Contrary to what some are saying we believe we have an oversupply situation currently in the SAF market,"" Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Renewable Products Commercial, at SAF producer Neste (NESTE.HE), opens new tab told Reuters.

Nyberg said he believed the issue was more to do with price, as the cost of ingredients for SAF means it is currently around three times more expensive than fossil jet fuel.

But Walsh said many airlines around the world were unable to procure SAF without importing it over large distances, which would defeat the aim of reducing emissions.

Abstract

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will play a critical role in decarbonizing the aviation industry. Among SAF production pathways, alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) stands out for its scalability, supported by abundant feedstock availability and a well-established bioethanol industry. However, significant reductions in SAF carbon intensity (CI) require the use of future feedstocks (e.g., cellulosic) whose adoption is hindered by high capital costs for feedstock processing and ethanol upgrading. Here, we evaluate the financial viability and carbon intensity implications of integrating cellulosic SAF production with petroleum-derived jet fuel production through co-processing and the ATJ pathway. Three levels of integration are evaluated: (i) standalone as a benchmark, (ii) co-located, and (iii) repurposing. Results show the CI of miscanthus-derived SAF demonstrates an 83.8% [76.2 to 100%] reduction relative to jet fuel. Meanwhile, co-processing, when sharing outside battery limit (OSBL) units and process units, brings down the capital cost for SAF production by 46.3% and results in a lower minimum fuel selling price (MSP) of 6.46 USD·gal-1 [5.80 to 7.62 USD·gal-1] including the opportunity cost from intervention to the petroleum refinery. Global sensitivity analyses reveal MSP is negatively correlated with the co-processing ratio. Overall, this work provides insights into the potential of SAF co-processing in advancing the transition to low-carbon aviation future.

Plans for the now shelved biorefinery were first revealed by UPM at the start of 2021.
UPM’s alternative strategies for biofuels production Dialer said that the company was currently evaluating options to debottleneck and increase output at its 44 million-gallon-per-year Lappeenranta biofuels plant – the company’s sole biofuel – producing facility, located next to the UPM Kaukas pulp and paper mill.
Broader challenges for biofuels investments in Europe UPM is one of several biofuels producers that have either paused or cancelled plans to develop new facilities in Europe, while many plants have also closed in the past couple of years.
In July, the company cited project delivery challenges and its need to ensure future competitiveness amid current market conditions as the reasons for its decision.","The announcement comes amid wider reports of general market uncertainty in the European biodiesel space, as producers struggle to operate profitably against a backdrop of consistently high feedstock prices.

“The complexity of a multi-feedstock greenfield investment leading to comparatively high capital (CAPEX) and operating (OPEX) costs, combined with a market that demands competitive production economics, would compromise the long-term business case and expected returns,” a UPM spokesperson told Fastmarkets on Tuesday.

Background and delays in UPM’s biofuels refinery plan

As previously reported by Fastmarkets, the proposed 500,000-tonne-per-year biofuels refinery, which would use advanced feedstocks, was earmarked to be one of Europe’s biggest biorefineries, with the capability to produce advanced biofuels as well as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Despite the announcement, UPM remains “committed to the biofuels business and believe[s] that biofuels markets will provide lucrative business options for UPM,” Harald Dialer, executive vice president of the company’s Biorefining and Technology arm, said.

But the executive added that any future investment “will have to perform against long-term profitability and pay-back expectations” and confirmed that UPM does not currently have any firm plans for “growth investments”.

Plans for the now shelved biorefinery were first revealed by UPM at the start of 2021. But, in 2022, the company indicated that the final investment decision for the facility would likely be delayed until the following year. This was then subsequently pushed back to 2026, after the company was expecting to complete its testing and evaluation of the project.

UPM’s alternative strategies for biofuels production

Dialer said that the company was currently evaluating options to debottleneck and increase output at its 44 million-gallon-per-year Lappeenranta biofuels plant – the company’s sole biofuel – producing facility, located next to the UPM Kaukas pulp and paper mill.

“We don’t foresee one major investment, but a series of gradual optimization steps over time,” Dialer said, adding that UPM is confident that it can increase production capacity onsite.

Broader challenges for biofuels investments in Europe

UPM is one of several biofuels producers that have either paused or cancelled plans to develop new facilities in Europe, while many plants have also closed in the past couple of years.

Next, Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, is blaming governments and fuel producers for aviation’s slow process in reaching its climate goals, writes Climate Reporter Darin Graham.

Walsh said the European Union, in particular, has failed to provide the support needed to increase the production of sustainable aviation fuel. Walsh added that companies such as BP and Shell have cut back or delayed their investments in green fuel. The European Union’s current policy requires airlines to use at least 2% sustainable aviation fuel in their fuel mix by 2030.

Fuels Europe said producers have rapidly scaled SAF output and lowered costs.

Finally, Starwood Hotels founder Barry Sternlicht says established hotel chains are facing growing pressure from independent brands, reports Senior Hospitality Editor Sean O’Neill.

Sternlicht, who sold Starwood to Marriott for 13 billion dollars in 2015, said newer brands are much easier to launch via social media. Sternlicht added that successful hotel brands must differentiate themselves and that hospitality remains fundamentally about service quality.

Sternlicht has officially rebranded his latest hotel management company as Starwood Hotels, reviving the name of the company he founded in 1991.

The partnership is key to unlocking new markets, creating green jobs, and driving a just, science-led energy transition, he said.

With the immense potential of India's sugar industry to produce the world's lowest carbon intensity SAF through the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway, India is well-positioned to emerge as a regional hub for SAF production.

Overall estimates indicate a production potential of 19-24 million tonnes annually, underscoring the need for swift, on-ground implementation through stakeholder-driven partnerships like this, industry body said.

With India targeting a 1 per cent SAF blending mandate by 2027, increasing up to 5 per cent by 2030 under CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), this partnership underscores a shared commitment to sustainability and the reduction of aviation emissions -- an area widely acknowledged as among the most challenging to decarbonise, it said.

""However, the absence of an officially accepted carbon intensity value for the Indian sugarcane-to-SAF conversion process via alcohol to jet pathway presents a significant barrier -- limiting the eligibility of Indian biomass feedstock under CORSIA,"" it noted.

The three parties have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to drive the certification and adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the country.

The collaboration supports India’s SAF blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027 and 2 per cent by 2028, and will conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of SAF produced from Indian sugarcane feedstock using the Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) pathway. This assessment will help establish the carbon intensity (CI) of indigenous SAF—an essential metric for comparing its environmental performance to traditional jet fuels.

As part of the initiative, the partners will also propose a certification methodology tailored to Indian conditions, aligned with international standards such as ISCC CORSIA and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) CORSIA framework.

Dr Pramod Chaudhari, Founder Chairman of Praj Industries, said the collaboration aims to place India at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel development. “This partnership combines science and global best practices to create high-quality SAF solutions for India,” he noted.

Both frameworks play critical roles in addressing aviation’s carbon emissions but operate at different levels: the EU-ETS targets emissions within the European Union, while CORSIA aims to manage global emissions from international aviation. There remains much uncertainty surrounding the compatibility of these two carbon pricing mechanisms.

Our report analyzes the potential synergies and challenges of these two mechanisms for decarbonizing aviation, considering their effectiveness in reducing emissions, their geographical scope, and their impact on the industry. By exploring their alignment and potential conflicts, this report provides insight into how these systems can work together to achieve meaningful decarbonization in the aviation sector.

Post-pandemic, carbon emissions in aviation have rebounded, nearing pre-crisis levels. Despite efforts to prevent a further decline, emissions from international flights continue to grow. However, there exist effective tools that can curb both short- and long-term carbon impacts in the sector.

EU ETS: Pricing carbon to drive sustainable aviation

The EU-ETS is a market-based mechanism that places a price on carbon emissions. Aviation was incorporated into the EU-ETS in 2012, meaning airlines operating within the EU are required to buy allowances for their carbon emissions. The system works by capping the total number of emissions and allowing airlines to buy and sell allowances, thus incentivizing them to reduce emissions cost-effectively. Over time, the cap is reduced, driving down emissions and decarbonizing aviation.

CORSIA: Offsetting carbon on a global scale

Carbon offset programs are an effective way to impact aviation now, not later. CORSIA, adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), is a global framework aimed at limiting the growth of carbon emissions from international aviation to 2019 levels. It requires airlines to offset their emissions by purchasing carbon credits from verified projects that reduce or remove carbon from the atmosphere. CORSIA started with a pilot phase in 2021 and is expected to ramp up over time.

Our Capgemini Invent report examines the efficiency and compatibility of these two carbon-pricing mechanisms. We believe they offer the sector substantial gains while decarbonizing aviation. But it is important to understand the different levels at which the two schemes operate, which disparities exist, and where the two overlap.

Numerous smaller organizations would also be affected by the elimination of the clean energy tax credits.
“Schools, churches, nonprofits, municipalities, libraries, and others will lose access to affordable, reliable clean energy options,” says Angermeier.
In addition to the Democratic caucus, several Republican senators have raised issues with the OBBBA, which include the full-scale elimination of clean energy tax credits.
“Local voices can still make a difference and ask their senators to stand up for these critical investments in clean energy.” Virginia Sens.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that narrowly passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 includes provisions that could jeopardize billions of dollars in Virginia green energy projects.

Charlottesville-headquartered Southern Environmental Law Center reports federal agencies have put more than $5 billion into 350 clean energy projects in the commonwealth since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. The private sector has also made significant investments in clean energy efforts, with $2.3 billion supporting 99,614 jobs in Virginia.

That investment was bolstered, at least in part, by clean energy tax credits that are now on the chopping block in the sweeping plan that has moved to the U.S. Senate. Notable credits terminated or phased out by the House version of the bill include the advanced manufacturing production credit, clean fuel production credit, and clean electricity production and investment credits.

Each credit significantly cuts costs for investors in clean energy, with the advanced manufacturing production credit applicable to components used for solar energy, wind energy, inverters, electrode active materials, specific battery components, and some critical minerals. The clean fuel production credit, which went into effect at the beginning of 2025, incentivizes the domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel and other fuels as determined by emissions factors.

“The effective repeal of these clean energy tax credits will hamstring clean energy progress, innovation, and job growth that we’re seeing in the South,” said SELC Senior Legislative Associate Bonnie Angermeier at a May 20 media briefing. “Energy developers, municipalities, and communities have been depending on these credits to move their projects forward, and the effective repeal of the credits will create business uncertainty and halt that clean energy progress.”

If passed as-is, the bill could have long-term impacts on Virginia’s economy and drive up costs for consumers, according to Angermeier.

“From a business standpoint, the bill creates severe uncertainty in clean energy markets, increases costs for utility-scale solar and wind projects, and makes projects unworkable,” she says, adding that the bill “will halt forward-looking progress in Virginia in its tracks. If this bill becomes law, Charlottesville-area residents will likely see increases to their utility bills, and job losses in their communities when projects are shuttered.”

The nonprofit is tracking potential impacts to projects across the commonwealth, including the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project from Dominion Energy, Charlottesville’s primary energy provider.

Upon its anticipated completion in 2026, the project is slated to be “the largest commercial offshore wind project and able to power over 600,000 homes.” However, funding for expansions and related projects has come into question.

Numerous smaller organizations would also be affected by the elimination of the clean energy tax credits. “Schools, churches, nonprofits, municipalities, libraries, and others will lose access to affordable, reliable clean energy options,” says Angermeier. “For instance, the historic Wesley Union [African Methodist Episcopal] Zion Church plans to continue using the tax credits to add energy storage, but this will be made extremely difficult, if not impossible, by this bill.”

The Charlottesville First United Methodist Church filed for a refund through the same program earlier this spring, according to the Virginia Independent. Solar panels were installed on top of the church in August 2024.

While the current version of the legislation is expected to be dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate, it is unclear if language slashing clean energy investments and tax credits will make it into the final version of the bill. In addition to the Democratic caucus, several Republican senators have raised issues with the OBBBA, which include the full-scale elimination of clean energy tax credits.

To pass the Senate, the legislation will need support from at least 50 of 53 Republican senators if all Democratically aligned members vote against the bill.

In an April 9 letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican Sens. Lisa Murkow­ski, John Curtis, Thom Tillis, and Jerry Moran all expressed support for energy tax credits. In addition to the four Republican senators in favor of keeping the tax credits, others have voiced concern about changes to Medicaid, food stamps, and the debt ceiling.

“Even though the bill passed the House, it’s not too late for Virginians to weigh in. As this moves to the Senate, they should be very concerned about how this bill will affect energy bills and hurt the local economy and jobs,” says Angermeier. “Local voices can still make a difference and ask their senators to stand up for these critical investments in clean energy.”

Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner publicly criticized Republican efforts to rollback clean energy investments from the Inflation Reduction Act in a May 20 statement, voicing concern about the long-term effect on Virginia’s economy. “Rolling back these investments would not only endanger these jobs but also hinder our progress toward a more sustainable and affordable energy future,” said Kaine and Warner. “We must protect the investments that are creating jobs and lowering costs for Virginians. The Republican plan puts our economic future at risk.”

The Senate debate over the legislation was ongoing at press time.

After more than three years of thorough evaluation of over 20 technologies, BioD has selected the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology developed by LanzaJet, a global leader in scalable ethanol-to-SAF conversion solutions.

The feasibility study will assess the technical, economic, and operational requirements to successfully and sustainably implement this technology in the country.

“This is not just theory — it’s about building the future starting today. Our commitment is to produce SAF in Colombia using agroforestry residues and energy crops eligible under CORSIA, creating a positive impact on both the local economy and the environment,” said Carolina Betancourt, head of the bioenergy business unit and project leader at BioD.

This ambitious study positions the project as a regional benchmark in Latin America to produce sustainable aviation fuels, and it marks a decisive step toward integrating SAF into Colombia’s energy matrix by 2029.

Additionally, the project aligns with Colombia’s national SAF roadmap, reinforcing the country’s strategic role in developing a productive and sustainable industry that connects rural areas with industrial transformation and social inclusion.

“This feasibility study is an important milestone for Colombia and for the growth of SAF across Latin America. We’re proud to bring our leading ATJ technology to this partnership with BioD and to support Colombia’s efforts to build a more sustainable energy future,” said Jimmy Samartzis, chief executive officer of LanzaJet.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions.
Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said: “While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs.
CORSIA was launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016 to address carbon emissions from international flights.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels. Although SAF usage needs to vastly increase, the growing cost to airlines is proving to be an obstacle, according to the IATA.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said:

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

Both the EU and UK’s SAF-focused mandates went live on 1 January. In Europe, this resulted in the cost of SAFs doubling, due to the associated compliance fees implemented by SAF producers and suppliers.

For the expected one million tonnes of SAF purchases required to meet European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion, with compliance costs estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices, according to the IATA.

Walsh continued:

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”

The IATA has urged governments to create more effective policies that support clean energy production – like SAFs – while decreasing support for fossil fuels, while also ensuring the success of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by making Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines.

CORSIA was launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016 to address carbon emissions from international flights.

To support the global development of SAF, the IATA previously launched a SAF registry, which is managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO). It introduced a more transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in line with existing regulations, such as the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS).

In addition, the IATA’s SAF Matchmaker aims to facilitate SAF procurement by aligning airline SAF requests with suppliers.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg,N,,2025-06-04 05:56:15.885686

With net profits forecast to hit $36 billion – up from $32.4 billion in 2024, though slightly below the $36.6 billion projected in December – the aviation sector is proving its resilience as global uncertainty, trade tensions, and supply chain setbacks continue to test the industry.

This expected 3.7 percent net margin remains modest by broader business standards but marks a steady climb for a sector still navigating post-pandemic recovery. Lower jet fuel prices – down 13 percent from last year – are a key driver, along with record-high passenger volumes and an all-time-high average load factor of 84 percent.

However, profitability remains precariously thin: IATA estimates just $7.20 profit per passenger segment, underscoring the sector’s vulnerability to new taxes, regulations, or shocks.

“Despite macroeconomic turbulence, 2025 will see airlines carry more people and more cargo than in 2024,” said IATA Director General Willie Walsh. “This demonstrates the resilience that airlines have worked hard to fortify.”

Passenger revenues are expected to reach $693 billion, bolstered by robust demand and growing ancillary income. Airfares, meanwhile, are projected to fall by 4 percent – partly due to lower fuel prices and heightened competition – bringing the average return fare to $374, or 40 percent below 2014 levels.

Recent polling backs this demand outlook: 93 percent of travelers say they expect to fly as much or more in the year ahead, and 89 percent agree that “air travel makes their lives better”. Even amid global tensions, 68 percent of business travelers anticipate more travel to meet customers face-to-face.

Yet challenges remain, according to IATA.

Air cargo revenues are expected to fall by nearly 5 percent as global GDP growth slows and protectionist trade policies dampen demand.

Fleet renewal is also under strain: supply chain disruptions and engine issues have driven aircraft groundings to record highs, with delivery timelines now stretching over a decade.

Beyond financials, sustainability continues to define long-term priorities. Airlines are committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – seen as critical to that goal – remains limited. SAF output is set to double in 2025 but will still account for just 0.7 percent of fuel needs. And costs are surging: SAF is expected to be over four times more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

“The behavior of fuel suppliers in fulfilling SAF mandates is an outrage,” Walsh said, urging producers to stop “profiteering” and ramp up supply.

Despite the hurdles, confidence in aviation remains high. IATA’s data shows 84 percent of travelers care about the success of the industry, while 81 percent believe it is serious about tackling climate change.

With total traveler numbers projected to reach a record high of 4.99 billion in 2025 – a 4 percent increase from 2024, though slightly below earlier forecasts of 5.22 billion – the scale of global travel demand remains formidable.

With nearly 5 billion travelers expected to take flight in 2025, IATA’s message is clear: air travel is not just back – it’s holding course through turbulence, with passengers onboard for the journey ahead.

Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) production is soaring

SAF is an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from non-petroleum feedstocks, including used cooking oil, agricultural wastes, solid municipal wastes and captured CO2. There are four main SAF pathways: Alcohol to Jet (AtJ), Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Gasification Fischer-Tropsch (GFT), and Power to Liquids (PtL).

Across these pathways, Technip Energies is paving the way for commercial-scale production. Leveraging our engineering expertise, in-house technology, and global project delivery know-how, we’re working with leading industry players such as LanzaJet, Neste, TotalEnergies, and Arcadia eFuels to accelerate commercial-scale production of SAF across all pathways to meet world demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

By 2030, this strategy aims to result in a sales mix of energy products with the view to final use whose lifecycle carbon intensity of energy products sold would be reduced by 25%, which means:

for an equivalent quantity of energy, the carbon content

of energy products would be reduced by 25% over the lifecycle (“less emissions for same energy”), or

for an equivalent quantity of emissions over the lifecycle (Scope 1+2+3), the Company would supply 33% more energy to its customers (“more energy for same emissions”).

We will grow in electricity production and sales, which will account for over 50% of the total reduction in carbon intensity by 2030. Indeed, we aim to reach 100 TWh/year of net electricity production by 2030.

The reduction in carbon intensity will also be facilitated by the growth of gas sales, especially liquefied natural gas (LNG) – a transition fuel – so it will accounts for 50% of our energy mix by 2030.

Moreover, we plan to bolster our range of products derived from biomass (biofuels, biogas, hydrogen and e-fuels), especially for sectors that are hard to electrify, such as air and sea transport, and heavy industry.

To support this effort, we plan to allocate between $4 and $5 billion annually to low-carbon energies by 2030, including $4 billion in the Integrated Power sector.

We offer our clients increasingly decarbonized products

Expanding our electricity business, especially from renewable sources, through an integrated strategy from production to customers

We are building a portfolio of competitive, renewable (solar, onshore and offshore wind) and flexible (flexible gas-fired power plants, storage) assets in order to supply our customers with low-carbon electricity 24/7, in particular by signing renewable corporate power purchase agreements (CPPA).

In 2024, the Company signed a renewable power purchase agreement with Saint-Gobain, under which TotalEnergies will supply renewable electricity to Saint-Gobain’s French facilities. It will take effect from January 2026 for a total volume of 875 GWh over a period of five years.

Natural gas, a transition fuel

Gas is a necessary transition fuel for building a reliable, lower carbon power system, complementing renewable energies that are intermittent by nature. A flexible resource that can be mobilized quickly, power generation from gas-fired plants offers a secure backup for grids powered by intermittent renewable sources (such as solar and wind), which takes over when weather conditions are unfavorable or demand surges.

Natural gas also provides a reliable alternative to many uses of coal, such as power generation or heat production for industry or retail customers, while emitting half as much CO2. That is why it occupies a central position in the Net Zero roadmaps of many coal consumer countries. To support these initiatives, TotalEnergies aims to increase the proportion of gas in its sales mix by 2030.

TotalEnergies continues its strategy to grow LNG considerably

Helping to decarbonize the transport sector and develop a low-carbon mobility offer

The transportation industry is currently 90% powered by petroleum products and represents one of the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. That is why decarbonizing mobility is a major component of the energy transition.

TotalEnergies is developing a network of high-power electric charging stations along motorways, major roads and in urban hubs in Europe. In addition to this network adapted to road roaming, TotalEnergies supports its B2B customers in their transition to electric mobility by offering services for the deployment and supervision of charging stations at the workplace as well as at employees’ homes.",https://totalenergies.com/sites/g/files/nytnzq121/files/styles/crop_landscape_ratio_9_5/public/images/2024-01/78177_0.jpg?h=289957f5&itok=rRb340iX,N,,2025-06-04 01:56:15.550876

(Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by David Gregorio)","MONTREAL (Rtrs) -Airlines need to reach long-term agreements to buy bigger quantities of sustainable aviation fuel if they want to boost global volumes of the lower-emission fuel required for industry climate targets, a Bayer executive said on Tuesday.

Airline members of the International Air Transport Association are sticking to a target of net zero emissions by 2050 despite warnings that carriers will struggle to meet such sustainability goals due to low production of SAF, which is more expensive than conventional jet fuel. IATA, which wrapped up a summit in India on Tuesday, expects the amount of sustainable aviation fuel produced to double in 2025 to reach 2 million tonnes, representing 0.7% of airlines’ fuel consumption.

While airlines have called for greater action by energy companies and other partners to boost SAF volumes, Matthias Berninger, a Bayer executive vice president and sustainability head, said in Montreal there needs to be more long-term purchases of the fuel, similar to some commitments in the renewable energy sector.

Bayer’s Monsanto unit sells seeds and pesticides to farmers who produce crops for biomass-based feedstocks used to develop biofuels.

“If they (airlines) commit to buy a certain amount over a certain period of time, we can guarantee that farmers will grow it and processors will process it,” Berninger told Reuters on the sidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s aviation climate week. “And the question whether or not that supply meets the market (demand) depends on long-term purchasing contracts of the airline industry sending a very clear demand signal comparable to what we have in the renewable space.”

SAF can be produced from plants, used cooking oil or wastes, among other products.

It’s hard to deny the appeal of hydrogen’s clean burning properties and high energy density by weight. But the real question isn’t whether this fuel can power aviation. It’s why the vision of widespread, hydrogen-powered flight keeps slipping further into the future.

For instance, while British-American aircraft developer ZeroAvia recently announced plans to open a hydrogen powertrain manufacturing facility in Scotland, Airbus rowed back on promises to develop hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by the mid-2030s, citing slower-than-expected technological development. Despite the promise of hydrogen, widespread adoption in aviation may be decades away, with technological, safety, and cost challenges all complicating the picture.

Hydrogen holds several advantages over existing fuels. It’s an excellent fuel source, with the highest energy content of any fuel by mass, and it burns cleanly with water vapor its primary byproduct. These attributes, theoretically, make hydrogen the perfect clean fuel for aviation.

Despite the advantages of hydrogen’s high energy content by mass, it’s extremely low energy content by volume creates significant storage challenges. To be viable for aircraft, hydrogen must be liquefied either through supercooling, similar to LNG; or using liquid ammonia, which is 70% hydrogen. It can also be stored in a metal hydrate, but this increases its weight, which makes it counterproductive for aviation.

Cost remains one of the biggest obstacles to hydrogen adoption in aviation. Most hydrogen today is a byproduct of oil refining. Wind, solar, and hydropower are unlikely to produce power at the scale needed for low-cost hydrogen, except in limited instances with favorable geography and weather. Because it can be derived from water, large-scale nuclear-powered processing of water into hydrogen or ammonia could bring costs down dramatically. Unfortunately, the West lags behind in creating the right nuclear infrastructure, making large-scale hydrogen production more likely in countries like China, where expansion is rapid, or the UAE, where nuclear already supplies a quarter of the country’s electricity. Even when low-cost hydrogen becomes available, it could be challenging to meet the demand as air, land, and sea-based transportation compete for limited supply.

In aviation, the demands of safety will always dictate the pace of innovation. Hydrogen ignites easily – sometimes too easily, as the 1937 Hindenburg disaster proved. Aviation safety standards mean that any hydrogen-powered airliner must undergo an extensive process, and timelines for new engine and aircraft technologies to become pervasive take decades. History shows that this industry evolves incrementally: the Boeing 77X and its engines are derived from existing designs, and although work began in 2012, the model isn’t expected to enter airline fleets before 2026. A hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft will require far more testing and certification.

Once the storage, cost, and safety challenges are resolved, hydrogen-powered aircraft will be a real possibility. Then, the industry will encounter the biggest obstacle of all: infrastructure. To make hydrogen aviation viable, it won’t be enough to build a few hubs with fueling capacity. No airline will buy a plane that can only operate between a few city pairs. This mirrors the development of the automobile. Though cars were invented in the 1890s, it took half a century for the automobile to fully displace horses because drivers needed a gas station every 20 miles on every major road. Without robust, global infrastructure, hydrogen-powered aviation cannot achieve sufficient scale to be commercially viable.

Like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen will someday be an important component in reducing the carbon footprint of commercial and business aviation. However, many of the current goals and regulatory mandates are overly optimistic given the scale of challenges the aviation industry needs to overcome. For example, governments are pushing to advance multiple SAF pathways simultaneously to meet ambitious targets, but each option adds infrastructure complexity. Given new technology in aviation can take decades to become pervasive, a more effective approach could enable innovation via incentives or investments in enabling technologies and infrastructure over broad mandates. This could allow hydrogen-fueled aviation the time it needs to mature and roll out with enough infrastructure in place to ensure viable flight operations.

While the promise of flying on a hydrogen-powered aircraft may still be decades away, steady progress grounded in realistic expectations will be the approach that brings the vision to life.

The Port Authority has worked to facilitate the development of sustainable and clean energy advancements across the aviation landscape.
The Port Authority also completed a full decarbonization retrofit of Newark Liberty’s historic Building One, serving as a blueprint for similar work at other legacy facilities across the agency.","The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and aerospace company BETA Technologies today announced the nation’s first all-electric aircraft to land at one of the agency’s three major airports in the New York-New Jersey region with the arrival of BETA’s ALIA conventional take-off and landing (CTOL) aircraft at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). The all-electric aircraft’s historic first flight to JFK flew 45 minutes with a pilot and four people, including Matt Koscal, president of Republic Airways, and Rob Wiesenthal, CEO of Blade Air Mobility.

The milestone flight follows six years of rigorous testing and development by BETA and reflects the Port Authority’s continued commitment to safety and innovation by advancing next-generation transportation solutions. The demo flight is the result of a request for innovation (RFI) issued by the agency in 2023 seeking proposals from companies to demonstrate their next-generation aircraft at a Port Authority airport. As part of its agency-wide push to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the Port Authority is committed to working with public and private partners to test clean-energy innovations that have the potential to improve mobility, reduce environmental impacts, lower costs and expand access across the region.

“The Port Authority has long positioned itself as a testbed for the transportation technologies of tomorrow, and this historic flight is the latest example of how we’re working to bring innovation into real-world infrastructure,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “We’re excited about the potential for innovations like all-electric aircraft to ease regional travel while reducing emissions and noise pollution. We’re proud to embrace innovation and help lay the groundwork for a more efficient and environmentally friendly future of flight.”

“This milestone flight is directly aligned with the Port Authority’s aggressive agenda to build a more sustainable future and to support the development and rollout of new technology,” said Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton. “We’ve pledged to reach net-zero emissions across all agency operations by 2050, and advancing clean, electric-powered aircraft is a key part of that strategy. As one of the country’s largest transportation agencies, we have an opportunity and a responsibility to explore technologies that reduce emissions and to continue to create innovative air travel capabilities.”

“BETA Technologies’ historic flight into New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport is a powerful demonstration of how Empire State Development’s strategic public investments — including a multi-million dollar grant to expand BETA’s facility at Plattsburgh International Airport — are propelling private sector innovation, environmental sustainability, and giving flight to paradigm-shifting industries and technology,” said Hope Knight, CEO, president and commissioner of Empire State Development. “Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, New York state has never been more globally competitive; from aerospace to agribusiness, our positive, productive partnerships with industry innovators like BETA are creating high-quality jobs and economic opportunity in the sectors that will anchor the future economy.”

“NYCEDC is propelling New York City’s transition to advanced air mobility, laying the groundwork for quieter, cleaner and safer skies by upgrading and electrifying city-owned assets to accommodate electric aviation,” said Andrew Kimball, president & CEO of New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC). “Today’s milestone flight showcases the technological readiness, regional connectivity, and collaborative efforts between multiple levels of government and pioneering companies to thoughtfully integrate sustainable aviation into our transportation system — driving job creation and economic opportunities across the five boroughs and beyond, all while providing New Yorkers with quiet skies and clean air they deserve.”

“Flying our electric aircraft into one of the world’s busiest airports, with passengers, proves advanced air mobility is not some future concept, it’s here,” said Kyle Clark, founder and CEO of BETA Technologies. “Today’s flight is about more than technology; it’s about innovation and connecting communities in safer, quieter, and more efficient ways. After years of rigorous safety testing in all types of environments, we’re proud to stand here with the Port Authority and the city of New York to demonstrate exactly how this aircraft can serve cities by easing congestion, reducing emissions, and increasing accessibility.”

“At Republic, we’re always exploring innovative technologies that can help us better connect people and communities — and BETA’s eCTOL represents a meaningful step forward in that effort,” said Matt Koscal, president of Republic Airways. “With its all-electric design, impressive performance characteristics and a thoughtful approach to passenger comfort, this aircraft reflects real progress in sustainable regional mobility. We’re looking forward to continuing our engagement with BETA as we evaluate how their platform might complement our training programs and our overall commitment to advanced air mobility.”

“This electric aircraft flight from Long Island to New York City highlights that quiet and emission-free flight is quickly becoming a reality benefiting Blade's fliers, local residents, and other key stakeholders,” said Rob Wiesenthal, founder and CEO of Blade Air Mobility. “I can think of no better way to demonstrate our company's commitment to quiet, electric aircraft commercialization than my participation on this flight as a passenger myself.”

The BETA Technologies aircraft is one of a new generation of aircraft that the industry refers to as advanced air mobility (AAM), often electric and capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing. AAM technology is designed to move people and goods more efficiently within and between urban areas. With its lower cost of operation when compared to traditional aircraft, AAM technology has the potential to reduce noise pollution, ease congestion, improve air quality and connect communities.

The Port Authority issued a request for innovation in December 2023, soliciting proposals from companies looking to demonstrate their next-generation aircraft at a Port Authority airport with a goal of better understanding the aircraft’s technological capabilities, regulatory requirements, infrastructure requirements and potential applications. The Port Authority is committed to the continued and safe exploration of AAM’s feasibility and utility as the technology develops.

BETA’s ALIA aircraft was named after initial customer United Therapeutics’ CEO Martine Rothblatt’s daughter, who fought lung disease. It was initially developed to carry out organ transport missions. BETA has been undergoing extensive safety testing and demonstrations of its ALIA CTOL aircraft in real-world environments over the past several years. To date, it is the first and only AAM aircraft to obtain a market survey certificate from the FAA, which allows the company to conduct demonstration flights under stringent safety standards ahead of full FAA certification. The aircraft has logged thousands of miles across the country, integrating into the national airspace in some of the busiest commercial airports, with each step of its development guided by federal regulations designed to ensure passenger safety and airspace security.

Earlier this year, BETA conducted a coast-to-coast journey, flying its ALIA CTOL production model more than 8,000 nautical miles from Plattsburgh, N.Y., to Los Angeles and back. The company has recently launched a similar flight campaign throughout Europe, with plans to begin delivering aircraft to customers later this year. BETA also conducted a demonstration flight with BETA customer Blade Air Mobility in 2023 out of Westchester County Airport (HPN).

In addition to its ALIA CTOL, BETA is producing and certifying an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, ALIA VTOL. This family of aircraft is designed for utility and efficiency, with the ability to transport a pilot and up to five passengers or 1,250 pounds of cargo. The company has also developed a suite of charging solutions to enable the emerging AAM industry. This includes the charge cube, a fast charger compatible with most air taxi manufacturers and ground support vehicles. BETA produces aircraft and chargers in its nearly 200,000-square-foot production facility in South Burlington, Vt., with multiple aircraft produced and ready for delivery to customers. BETA tests flights out of Plattsburgh, N.Y.

The Port Authority has worked to facilitate the development of sustainable and clean energy advancements across the aviation landscape. This includes entering into a strategic partnership with NASA to explore the next generation of flight in urban environments, expanding electric vehicle charging stations, developing New York state’s largest rooftop solar array at JFK’s New Terminal One, building the nation’s largest airport solar rooftop at Newark Liberty International Airport’s Terminal A parking garage, installing a solar array on JFK’s long-term parking Lot 9, and integrating a solar rooftop at LaGuardia Airport. The agency is also committed to electrifying its light-duty vehicle fleet by 2028 and nearly all of its airport ground service equipment by 2035.

LanzaJet, a leading next-generation fuels technology company and producer of sustainable fuels, and ATOBA Energy, a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) aggregator committed to solving the financial challenges between producers and offtakers, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate on accelerating SAF deployment and creating new commercial models for the market.

The two companies will partner to enable greater access to SAF through new pricing and offtake structures that balance the needs of both SAF producers and buyers. The agreement outlines a shared intent to evaluate commercial models that support SAF procurement in ways that reflect the value of the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel pathway pioneered by LanzaJet.

“Scaling SAF requires flexible, forward-thinking commercial models that work for both producers and consumers,” said Jimmy Samartzis, CEO of LanzaJet. “This collaboration with ATOBA Energy is about building the kind of aligned ecosystem we need to drive innovation, catalyze investment, and accelerate SAF deployment globally. It’s another step forward in ensuring that the value of next-generation technologies like ours can be realized at scale because the future growth and sustainability of aviation depends on it.”

ATOBA uniquely facilitates the development of SAF production through its upstream and downstream SAF offtake portfolio management. By offtaking from diversified producers that use production technologies like HEFA, Alcohol to Jet, Gas-Fischer Tropsch, or Power to Liquids, ATOBA mitigates technological and pricing risks associated with the various SAF production pathways and facilitates the closing of long-term offtake agreements among airlines, jet-fuel distributors, SAF producers, and financial institutions, which are essential for scaling the industry. For LanzaJet's ATJ technology, such models help preserve the integrity of its value proposition and support more sustainable growth pathways.

Rep. Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd), who sponsored House Bills 4424 and 4425, told members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that his legislation is aimed at bringing Michigan into the sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.
With Minnesota, Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska, Washington, Iowa and California all passing tax credits for sustainable aviation fuels, Michigan is in danger of being left out of the economic benefits, Gonzales said.
Although the packages won support from organizations like Clean Fuels Michigan and Corn Growers of Michigan with bipartisan support in both chambers, they were not without opposition.
Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) spoke out against offering government incentives, arguing that these types of incentives take away from the market.","Members of the Michigan House and Senate on Tuesday took up a set of mirrored proposals to establish incentives to produce more “sustainable aviation fuel” which blend traditional jet fuel with propellants sourced from biomass like corn, soybeans, cover crops, forestry residue and hydrogen.

Rep. Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd), who sponsored House Bills 4424 and 4425, told members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that his legislation is aimed at bringing Michigan into the sustainable aviation fuel supply chain.

If passed, Neyer said the bills would grant farmers access to another revenue stream and encourage the expansion of ethanol production facilities and the construction of fuel blending facilities.

Sen. Joe Bellino (R-Monroe), who sponsored the Senate’s package alongside Sen. Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), explained to members of the Natural Resources and Agriculture Committee that the bills would simply allow aviation companies who choose to use the fuels to claim a tax credit.

“It’s not a mandate. It’s an open thing that if Delta [Airlines] wants to do it, Delta can get a tax break on how much fuel they buy and how much they decrease their CO2,” Bellino said.

The proposals offer a $1.50 rebate on the purchase of fuel blends that cut carbon dioxide emissions by 50% compared to regular jet fuel, with an additional two cents per gallon for every additional 1% in emissions reduced, with the rebate capping out at $2 a gallon. After 2030, any fuel used to claim the credit must use in-state sources for the organic materials used to produce the fuel.

“Either our airline industry can either buy this product from out of state and have it blended out of state, or we can provide the opportunity here with this tax incentive there to allow our our farmers and our producers here in the state to participate in this market and get a leg up on the industry,” Neyer said.

Additionally, with the Federal Aviation Administration working to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, these fuels are plug and play with existing fuel systems, Neyer said.

If approved, the program carries a 10-year expiration date, with Neyer telling the committee he hoped the credit would no longer be needed by that time.

While testifying on the bill to the House committee, Sarah Gonzales, the director of state and local government affairs for Delta Airlines, assured members that the fuels are already in use, with California utilizing sustainable aviation fuels for a number of years and Delta flights out of Detroit utilizing the fuels for the first time this year.

However, there is not enough of the fuel to meet demand for even a week, Gonzales said, noting that the current cost is two to 10 times that of traditional fuels.

With Minnesota, Indiana, Illinois, Nebraska, Washington, Iowa and California all passing tax credits for sustainable aviation fuels, Michigan is in danger of being left out of the economic benefits, Gonzales said.

Although the packages won support from organizations like Clean Fuels Michigan and Corn Growers of Michigan with bipartisan support in both chambers, they were not without opposition.

Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers) spoke out against offering government incentives, arguing that these types of incentives take away from the market.

“What you’re coming in here today is asking for not simply a promotion of this product, but it is still a peanut-level incentive of taking away from the free market and compelling taxpayers to fund and create a new atmosphere within the economy, further distorting the market,” Carra said.

In response, John Delmotte, president of the Michigan Corn Growers Association, asked Carra to view it as an investment rather than a handout.

During the Senate hearing, Nichole Keway Biber, the mid-Michigan campaign organizer for Clean Water Action, offered her opposition, arguing the incentives set aside $9 million in state funds that could be used to jump start lower-emission transportation solutions while supporting a status quo approach to energy.

While the emissions that come out of the pipe might be cleaner, the residual impacts on the environment from large-scale farming operations may outweigh those benefits, Keway Biber said.

“This is no time for false climate solutions that divert investments and focus away from achieving realer sustainability of healthy communities and waterways,” Keway Biber said.

MONTREAL (Rtrs) -Airlines need to reach long-term agreements to buy bigger quantities of sustainable aviation fuel if they want to boost global volumes of the lower-emission fuel required for industry climate targets, a Bayer executive said on Tuesday.

Airline members of the International Air Transport Association are sticking to a target of net zero emissions by 2050 despite warnings that carriers will struggle to meet such sustainability goals due to low production of SAF, which is more expensive than conventional jet fuel. IATA, which wrapped up a summit in India on Tuesday, expects the amount of sustainable aviation fuel produced to double in 2025 to reach 2 million tonnes, representing 0.7% of airlines' fuel consumption.

While airlines have called for greater action by energy companies and other partners to boost SAF volumes, Matthias Berninger, a Bayer executive vice president and sustainability head, said in Montreal there needs to be more long-term purchases of the fuel, similar to some commitments in the renewable energy sector.

Bayer's Monsanto unit sells seeds and pesticides to farmers who produce crops for biomass-based feedstocks used to develop biofuels.

“If they (airlines) commit to buy a certain amount over a certain period of time, we can guarantee that farmers will grow it and processors will process it,” Berninger told Reuters on the sidelines of the International Civil Aviation Organization's aviation climate week. ""And the question whether or not that supply meets the market (demand) depends on long-term purchasing contracts of the airline industry sending a very clear demand signal comparable to what we have in the renewable space.”

SAF can be produced from plants, used cooking oil or wastes, among other products.

The Department for Transport has laid out legislation to enable the largest overhaul of British airspace since the 1950s.

With air traffic expected to nearly double in the next 20 years, the new UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will be tasked with redesigning routes to cut congestion in the skies and deliver cleaner, more efficient flying.

Run by NATS (En Route) plc, UKADS will be fully operational by the end of 2025 and will start with a complete redesign of London’s heavily congested airspace.

Ministers say modernising flightpaths could allow planes to climb faster, descend more smoothly and avoid the fuel-burning delays caused by circling above airports.

One project in the south west has already shown what’s possible—cutting 12,000 tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to powering seven global flights.

Nationwide, emissions savings could be even greater, while reducing noise for residents living under flight routes.

Karen Dee, Chief Executive of AirportsUK, the trade association for UK airports, said:

The UK’s airspace is a critical piece of our national infrastructure and these proposals will help modernise it, bringing forward new technologies and routing methods that will make it more efficient, cleaner, and provide passengers with a better experience.

Modernising the ‘skyways’ unlocks more airspace capacity, paving the way for airport expansion and supporting thousands of jobs in tourism, aviation and emerging technologies.

The government says new designs will eventually enable routes for drones and flying taxis, fuelling British innovation and tech jobs.

Expansion at Heathrow alone could add 100,000 jobs and help secure its place as a global hub. Transport officials will work with the Civil Aviation Authority to oversee the rollout and maintain independent oversight.

HOUSTON, June 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Syzygy Plasmonics, the global leader in electrified biogas-to-SAF technology, today announced the initiation of Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) with Kent for NovaSAF 1, the world’s first electrified biogas-to-SAF facility. The site will serve as a model for scalable, low-cost sustainable aviation fuel production. This company milestone advances Syzygy’s mission to seize the significant global opportunity to profitably convert biogas into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using clean electricity.

“This is more than just a SAF plant. It’s a new model for biogas economics,” Trevor Best, CEO, Syzygy Plasmonics.

Located in Durazno, Uruguay, NovaSAF 1 will produce over 350,000 gallons of ASTM Certified SAF annually, marking a breakthrough in cost-effective, scalable clean fuel. The project is backed by long-term feedstock and site agreements with Estancias del Lago (EDL), one of Uruguay’s largest dairy and agri-energy operations. Permitting and equipment sourcing is ongoing alongside front-end engineering work led by Kent, a world leader in SAF project development and execution.

Powered by Syzygy’s proprietary NovaSAF™ platform, the facility combines the benefits of biogas and Power-to-Liquids (PtL) technologies, leveraging waste as feedstock, eliminating the need for pipelines or costly separation while achieving ultra-low water use and carbon intensity. Syzygy’s electrified pathway can potentially qualify as a RFNBO to meet EU regulations. Unique to NovaSAF™ is the ability to provide these social and carbon benefits at a production cost that is unmatched by traditional SAF alternatives like HEFA, ATJ, or PtL. The result is a clean fuel solution that is not only scalable and sustainable, but also economically viable by delivering Jet-A parity fuel when fully commercialized.

“This is more than just a SAF plant. It’s a new model for biogas economics,” said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. “We’re unlocking a global asset class of underutilized biogas sites and turning them into high-value clean fuel hubs without pipelines, costly gas separation, or subsidy dependence. We believe NovaSAF™ represents one of the few viable pathways to producing SAF at Jet Parity and successfully decarbonizing air travel.”

Speaking at an aviation meeting in India on Monday, Walsh said governments, particularly the European Union, have failed to provide the support needed to scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“From the outset we made it clear that it would be challenging and that the airlines could not do this on their own,” he said. “Despite their enthusiasm, governments did not create a supportive policy framework to meet their 2030 interim target. The companies we need to be major SAF players like BP and Shell have cut back or delayed their investment.”

According to IATA, when airlines use SAF in the EU, they have to pay compliance fees which cover the cost of blending the fuel and checking it meets the policy’s requirements.

“It is an outrage that suppliers are charging airlines compliance fees that value SAF at double its market premium over conventional jet fuel. That’s a billion-dollar windfall for fuel suppliers. This is the EU's great green scam.”

Pressure Mounts Ahead of 2030 Aviation Climate Target

In 2021, IATA member airlines, which represent most of the global aviation sector, committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But with demand for flying rebounding sharply post-pandemic, progress has been slow.

Governments gave airlines an interim target of reducing emissions by 5% by 2030. However, after a drop in emissions during Covid-19, airline emissions are expected to return to, or even exceed 2019 levels this year, according to Carbon Action Tracker.

Walsh directed his sharpest criticism at the European Union’s current policy, which requires airlines to use at least 2% SAF in their fuel mix by 2030.

“The EU mandate of 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply has succeeded in raising costs but has done nothing to improve production,” Walsh said.

Fuel Producers Push Back

Fuels Europe, which represents companies like BP and Shell, have rejected the aviation industry’s claims.

“We reject claims from the aviation sector suggesting a lack of sustainable aviation fuel supply,” the group said in a statement. “Our members are on track to meet their current mandate and exceed 2030 targets. Despite policy and investment challenges, European fuel producers have rapidly scaled SAF output and lowered costs.”

An EU spokesperson told Skift it is helping with the transition to SAF through a range of initiatives such as its Refuel EU program and that the current targets are ""realistic and feasible.""

""The implementation of ReFuelEU Aviation has already begun to stimulate production capacity within the EU, with SAF supply starting to outpace mandated minimum shares. This is a positive and necessary signal,"" the spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said the EU is watching the price of SAF closely and recognizes that there continues to be ""significant barriers to commercial deployment, primarily due to insufficient investment."" They said there will be a dialogue on SAF later this year, with the goal of improving financing and de-risking investment.

Honeywell has made a key announcement wherein it has entered into a strategic collaboration with NTPC Green Energy to explore the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in India. Honeywell says that this marks a significant step toward greener air travel and cleaner energy.

SAF, a low-emission alternative to traditional jet fuel, is derived from non-petroleum sources and plays a vital role in reducing carbon emissions from the aviation sector.

As part of the agreement, the two companies will evaluate the use of Honeywell’s proprietary eFining technology to convert captured carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from NTPC’s power plants, along with green hydrogen, into SAF. This process has the potential to create a renewable fuel source using existing industrial by-products and cutting-edge clean energy.

“SAF production forms the sizeable part of the ambitious Green Hydrogen Hub of NTPC Green in Pudimadaka, Andhra Pradesh. We believe that the mandate in the aviation sector for blending SAF in jet fuel will drive many early mover projects in green hydrogen,” said DMR Panda, Executive Director (Green Hydrogen), NTPC Ltd.

“We are excited to work with NTPC Green on this initiative to advance India’s transition towards cleaner aviation fuels and goal of working toward carbon neutrality,” said Ranjit Kulkarni, Vice President and General Manager, Energy and Sustainability Solutions, Honeywell India. “Our collaboration with NTPC Green will leverage Honeywell’s expertise in SAF solutions to efficiently treat emissions from thermal energy, foster green hydrogen adoption, diversify feedstocks for SAF production and help India’s aviation sector meet its long-term environmental goals.”

NTPC Green Energy sees this initiative as a key opportunity to expand its portfolio of green fuels. By blending SAF with conventional jet fuel, the company aims to support various sustainability-driven projects across its operations.

As per Honeywell, the new partnership supports India’s broader environmental goals, including its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and strengthening energy independence. By leveraging advanced technologies and renewable inputs, the collaboration is expected to help position India as a future hub for sustainable fuel innovation.

This move is also in line with India’s climate commitments made during the COP26 summit in November 2021, where the country pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.

NTPC claims to be on the forefront of green hydrogen development in the country with some state of the art facilities being established by the company. Last November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for NTPC Green Hydrogen Hub at Pudimadaka, near Visakhapatnam. It is also setting up green hydrogen production plant using Plasma Oxy Gasification of MSW/Agri-Waste technology.

So Delta is obviously trying to serve its customers as best we can. And through that, you’re seeing growth in international destinations and premium seats.”

The airline has hundreds of planes on order and while new aircraft are more efficient, more flights will mean more emissions.

Despite rising emissions, DeLuca pointed to signs of progress. She said Delta increased its capacity by 5% last year compared to 2019, but used less jet fuel, a first for the airline. It saved 45 million gallons of jet fuel and roughly $110 million.

“That means we’re growing, but doing so more efficiently,” she said.

Delta credits that efficiency to flight improvements such as more efficient routes as well as newer aircraft, which the International Air Transport Association says can be up to 20% more fuel efficient than older models.

DeLuca also said part of the emissions increase comes down to better data. As Delta improves tracking of indirect emissions, such as those from suppliers, its total footprint appears larger.

“Our scope three emissions look like they’re going up, but it’s just because we’re now working with our supply chain to give us the most accurate emissions that we can get,” she said.

The Race for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

DeLuca made it clear that operational tweaks and better planes won’t be enough.

“Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is the biggest lever,” she said. “It’s the only thing that gets us to net zero. We’re in a race against time.”

Delta is building a SAF blending hub in Minnesota and working with corporate clients to create demand. The airline hopes this can serve as a model for broader state-level action.

There have been concerns that SAF production will never be able to grow to the level required by the entire aviation sector, as it tries to decarbonize, due to issues around feedstocks.

The fuel uses things like used cooking oil, of which there is limited supply, and plants, which are feared might result in crop displacement - taking vital land away for things like food for humans, for SAF.

“There's a limit to how much used cooking oil exists. The next generation of SAF is using biomass type products, such as corn waste, potentially woody biomass from fallen trees,” DeLuca said. “All those have a limit.”

DeLuca called on the sector to continue investing in new technologies such as carbon capture, capturing gasses out of the atmosphere using renewable energy and turning it back into fuel. “These are unlimited feedstocks. And that cost profile of that product, if you have unlimited feedstocks, is actually lower than conventional jet fuel today. But that is a long way off. This is going to take all of us. Airlines alone can’t solve climate change.”

State’s federally funded hydrogen hub releases aviation whitepaper co-led by CLEE.

Few industries face as complex a challenge in decarbonizing as aviation. While great for decarbonizing on-road transportation, batteries are generally too heavy to power long-distance flights. Low-carbon biofuels blended into fossil jet fuel represent only a partial solution, due to lack of feedstocks and blend limits. Zero-emission hydrogen could represent a solution, either as an ingredient for synthetic jet fuel that can drop in as a replacement for fossil jet fuel or to power fuel cells on redesigned zero-emission aircraft.

To explore the potential for hydrogen to help decarbonize the aviation sector, the state’s federally funded hydrogen hub ARCHES (Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, representing a California-based public-private partnership to develop and deploy renewable, clean hydrogen projects) just released a white paper detailing the opportunities, challenges, and policy needs. Berkeley Law’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment (CLEE) co-chaired the ARCHES Aviation Working Group that produced the report, along with San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and RMI.

Key Recommendations

While hydrogen’s promise is substantial, barriers remain. High production costs, limited infrastructure, and fragmented safety and technical standards have slowed adoption. The whitepaper offers a targeted set of recommendations for state leaders, including:

Develop Standards and Policy Frameworks: California state agencies, in collaboration with federal and international partners, could create robust policies and safety standards for hydrogen production, storage, and distribution at airports. This includes infrastructure to support both ground support equipment and hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Expand Incentives Through the California Air Resources Board and Energy Commission: The Board and Energy Commission could incentivize the use of low-carbon hydrogen as a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel or for direct consumption in hydrogen aircraft. These incentives could mirror existing programs like the Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

Integrate Aviation into Clean Transportation Programs: Including hydrogen aviation projects in state-level clean transportation initiatives—such as the CEC’s Clean Transportation Program—would accelerate hydrogen propulsion timelines and de-risk private investment.

Enable Airport Leadership: Airport authorities can lead by empowering staff to engage with hydrogen producers based on proximity, price, and emissions profile, and by developing plans for future hydrogen fueling needs in coordination with operators.

Foster Regional Hydrogen Clusters: Developing hydrogen “clusters” at airports like Long Beach would create hubs of hydrogen activity, supporting ground equipment, transit systems, and eventually hydrogen aircraft. These clusters could leverage economies of scale to lower costs and build a more resilient supply chain.

With planning and leadership, hydrogen could become a cornerstone of a clean, resilient aviation system in California. While hydrogen won’t be able to solve aviation’s climate challenges overnight, the runway to decarbonization is now open, if policymakers, industry, and airport leaders work to accelerate the takeoff.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cover-page-of-the-report.png,N,,2025-06-03 12:57:00.827406

Amy Klobuchar wants to help Midwest corn farmers tap into new lucrative tax credits aimed at making airplane fuel more climate friendly. But some environmentalists worry her proposal could make climate change worse.

The tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), created by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is available for any fuel manufacturer that can show their product is at least 50% less carbon intensive than today’s petroleum-based jet fuel. The credit has mobilized universities and major companies like Cargill to explore a bevy of alternative fuels, including hydrogen gas, ethanol and even recycled cooking oil.

...

In April, Klobuchar, a Democrat, and U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kans.) introduced a bill that would extend the SAF credit for another 10 years, while also prohibiting biofuels and other fuel feedstock imported from overseas from qualifying for the subsidy.

...

“Domestically produced biofuel strengthens our energy independence, supports our farmers and boosts rural economies,” Klobuchar said in a press release, announcing the proposal.

...

Klobuchar declined an interview request from the Minnesota Star Tribune, but said in a statement that her “bipartisan bill with Senator Marshall protects the sustainable aviation fuel credit from being exploited by foreign feedstocks from deforested rainforests — while giving farmers the certainty they need to produce lower-carbon fuel.”

...

Brian Werner, the executive director of the Minnesota Bio-Fuels Association, said ethanol producers generally support Klobuchar’s legislation.

“Sustainable aviation fuel in Minnesota will not develop without some sort of economic incentive in the near term,” he said. “So her support for making sure that this tax credit is extended … is critically important in a political environment where House Republicans are looking for savings and cuts for every single green energy tax credit that was included in the inflation Reduction Act.”

As a result, airlines are now competing for limited fuel supplies while simultaneously coping with higher operational costs.
Financial Strain Tied to Green Progress While the SAF production increase has been welcomed, it was acknowledged that it comes with a hefty financial cost.
Projections indicate that this growth could add about $4.4 billion to the global aviation fuel bill by 2025.
At present, sustainable aviation fuel, which is primarily derived from waste oils and biomass, is regarded as the most promising short- to mid-term solution for reducing emissions in air travel.","At the recent IATA Annual General Meeting in New Delhi, India, a significant development was revealed regarding the future of cleaner aviation. It was stated that by 2025, the global production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is expected to reach 2 million tonnes, effectively doubling current output. However, despite this notable increase, the figures suggest that SAF will still make up only 0.7% of all aviation fuel consumed globally—a number that starkly highlights how far the industry still needs to go to meet its 2050 net-zero emissions target.

Industry Leaders Urge Immediate Policy Action

During the discussions, aviation leaders made it clear that while the production boost was a step in the right direction, it remains far from adequate. They strongly encouraged governments and energy providers to introduce more robust policies, offer subsidies, and make infrastructure investments aimed at rapidly increasing SAF availability.

A central concern raised was the lack of consistent incentives, which has caused a sluggish buildup of SAF capacity. As a result, airlines are now competing for limited fuel supplies while simultaneously coping with higher operational costs. The challenge has been intensified by delivery setbacks from aircraft manufacturers, delaying the rollout of more fuel-efficient airplanes, and hindering immediate efforts to reduce carbon emissions through modernized fleets.

Financial Strain Tied to Green Progress

While the SAF production increase has been welcomed, it was acknowledged that it comes with a hefty financial cost. Projections indicate that this growth could add about $4.4 billion to the global aviation fuel bill by 2025. Many in the industry view this as a necessary cost of progress, but warn that unless SAF becomes more affordable and easier to access, the pace of aviation decarbonization could falter.

At present, sustainable aviation fuel, which is primarily derived from waste oils and biomass, is regarded as the most promising short- to mid-term solution for reducing emissions in air travel. Its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing aircraft engines makes it particularly valuable. But its limited availability and high production costs have kept it from playing a larger role.

SAF at the Heart of Aviation’s Green Strategy

Since the 2021 pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, airlines have placed substantial emphasis on SAF as a cornerstone of their climate strategy. Its existing infrastructure compatibility means it doesn’t require major changes in aircraft technology or airport refueling systems. However, this reliance on SAF is becoming increasingly risky in the absence of accelerated production and widespread policy support.

Several key points were highlighted during the event to frame the current situation:

SAF output is expected to hit 2 million tonnes by 2025

This will represent just 0.7% of the airline industry’s total fuel use

The global aviation fuel bill is likely to increase by $4.4 billion as SAF scales

Urgent calls continue for policy reform and investment support

The Broader Impact on Air Travel and Global Travelers

The implications of this slow progress extend far beyond industry boardrooms. For global travelers, this limited SAF adoption could bring higher ticket prices, especially on long-haul flights, where SAF usage is more likely to be prioritized due to international regulations or green branding.

As fuel prices rise and airlines work to offset their environmental impact, passengers may start to feel the financial burden. This could lead to changes in travel patterns, such as opting for shorter routes, choosing lower-emission carriers, or reducing flight frequency altogether.

More importantly, the current state of SAF availability reveals a deeper challenge: how the aviation sector must walk a tightrope between environmental responsibility and economic sustainability. Without swift and scalable solutions, experts caution that the climate goals set for 2050 may become unattainable, potentially eroding public trust and forcing airlines to pursue alternative decarbonization methods that may be even more complex or costly.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aviation-.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 09:56:13.764819

There’s much that we can do with AI to build these cyber layers.” Soaring ambition Innovation in the aviation industry is not necessarily easy.","No one can accuse International Airlines Group (IAG) of being complacent. The company, which owns flag carriers British Airways and Spain’s Iberia, is one of Europe’s most profitable airline groups, earning €2.7bn after tax in 2024, ahead of rivals Ryanair and Lufthansa. To ensure it can stay ahead, however, earlier this year it ramped up its corporate venturing activities, setting up a new CVC unit with a €200m ($227m) fund to be invested over the next five years.

“It is easier to launch this kind of vehicle when your [parent] company is one of the most profitable airlines,” Nacho Tovar, head of the recently formed IAGi Ventures, told GCV.

IAG has been taking minority stakes in startups for years, but without a fixed fund size or cadence to the investment. Now it is committed to €40m a year for the next five years, and Tovar, who worked for a tech VC firm before joining Iberia in 2017, is bolstering the team with members who have venture capital experience so that the unit adds a Silicon Valley mindset to its expertise on the aviation industry.

“If you compete with not just corporate VC, but [also] the big players around VC, you need to understand valuations, deals, convertible loans, this kind of language,” he says.

AI and automation

Since the pandemic, costs for the airline industry have been creeping up, according to data analysed by the International Air Transport Association, a trade association. This puts a premium on improved efficiency, which two of the fund’s focus areas, AI and automation, might be able to deliver.

Tovar says that the fund will target AI startups at the application layer with “a vertical proposition around aviation”. These could, for example, be used to improve processes on the ramp – the area where an aircraft is loaded, boarded and refueled. A successful example of this from the company’s former accelerator programme, Hangar 51, is Assaia, a startup that uses AI to analyse a live video feed of the procedures preparing a docked plane for its next flight against the schedule. It has been run for British Airways planes at Heathrow since 2019 in an effort to improve turnaround times.

Automation is closely related to AI. Currently, Tovar says, the airline industry lags behind other sectors in implementing it.

“It is still far away from other industries like retail [and] logistics,” he says. “If you go to a fulfilment centre, there’s a lot more automation over there.”

It could also improve procedures on the ramp, for example with robotic automation of the fueling process. But Tovar also says it could make a difference across airports, with their “orchestra” of moving parts. Loading cargo, connecting bags to the correct flights, speeding up the boarding process and helping passengers make their connecting flights could all be made easier with AI or automation.

Making sustainable aviation fuel

While automation might help to shave down costs and improve reliability, the fund also has its sights on a more existential threat to the sector.

The aviation industry is currently thought to contribute to 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, and 4% of global warming to date when non-CO2 sources are accounted for. The industry plans to rely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to help it reduce carbon emissions enough to make reaching net zero by 2050 manageable.

Tovar says the ultimate goal is to reach third-generation SAF, generated from captured CO2 mixed with green hydrogen. The venture fund will invest in technologies that improve the synthesising techniques.

“We need to speed up the technology,” he says. “The technology to have third-generation SAF available at the right price is [what] we are working towards.”

While the CVC unit focuses on investing in SAF initiatives, IAG is lobbying the UK government to make the transition to SAF less painful for airlines, and to encourage investment in new SAF plants.

The government recently mandated airlines to use SAF for 10% of all their fuel by 2030. IAG says it used just under 2% in 2024. With SAF, as with AI and automation, the group has used a startup partnership to experiment with what works. In 2021, British Airways invested in LanzaJet, which has built the world’s first commercial-scale plant converting bioethanol to fuel, an example of second-generation SAF.

Looking further afield

IAG will continue to run the accelerator programmes it has for startups that are not yet ready for it to invest in. The Hangar 51 accelerator has been rebranded as IAGi Accelerator, and will contain two tracks. A 12-week programme will focus on technology that it can start to deploy among the business units to meet specific business needs, while a 24-week programme will support earlier-stage startups developing promising new technologies.

Beyond AI, automation and SAF, Tovar says the IAGi Ventures fund will also invest in connectivity and IoT, as well as quantum, cloud and cybersecurity.

“We need to be on top of everything that is happening in cybersecurity,” he says. “Even more [so] with new systems like quantum and AI. There’s much that we can do with AI to build these cyber layers.”

Soaring ambition

Innovation in the aviation industry is not necessarily easy. The priority of airlines and airports is always safety, which can make implementation of new technologies slow.

Increasing pressure on airlines’ bottom lines can also make them less willing to fund corporate venturing initiatives, as seen recently when struggling US airline JetBlue spun out its CVC unit, JetBlue Ventures, so that it could focus on returning the core business to profitability.

But Tovar is optimistic that IAG’s new fund can rise to the challenges. He sees aviation as an area that has so far not sufficiently exploited tech innovation.

“There are not so many airlines with the right approach or the right ambition around investing in technology,” he says.

“I strongly believe we could be the best VC of our kind in the world.”",https://globalventuring.com//content/uploads/2025/06/Interview-template.png,N,,2025-06-03 10:56:10.713260

Japan’s SAF Roadmap and Industry Position

Japan has set ambitious carbon neutrality goals, aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The aviation sector, although a relatively small contributor to total emissions, plays a symbolic and strategic role in this pursuit. Japanese aviation stakeholders — including airlines, fuel producers, and government agencies — are actively investing in sustainable aviation fuel as part of their broader climate strategy.

Major Japanese carriers are increasingly incorporating SAF into their operations, with plans to scale usage over the next decade. Government-backed initiatives and partnerships with global fuel technology firms are helping accelerate the development of domestic production capabilities. Japan is also exploring the potential of alternative feedstocks, including municipal waste, algae, and biomass, which align with its resource efficiency and circular economy principles.

By 2032, Japan aims to establish a reliable SAF supply chain to support both domestic flights and international routes originating in Japan, positioning itself not only as a consumer but also as a regional SAF hub in Asia.

Over 50 airlines worldwide, covering roughly 40% of global passenger traffic, have pledged to SAF goals.
I look forward to discussing the next chapter of this journey at the ICAO Aviation Climate Week in the coming days.","The ICAO Aviation Climate Week, which is taking place in Montréal over the coming days, is an opportunity to reflect on the overall progress made on civil aviation’s path towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Just a few years ago, the idea of reaching this goal may have seemed like a long shot. Today, the entire aviation sector continues to be committed to this goal – a message all aviation sector participants reaffirmed this morning in Montreal. It remains ambitious and certainly not without its challenges, but it is no longer a distant dream: it is a work in progress. With this clear 2050 goal in sight, there has been a move towards championing more policy support in many countries, and greater investment in the decarbonisation of the sector.

Just to highlight a few examples of how far we have come over the last five years:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production reached about one million tonnes in 2024, while this is roughly 0.3% of total jet fuel use, it is double the output of just a year prior. In 2025, output is expected to more than double again to 2.1 million tonnes, signalling an accelerating trajectory for SAF supply. As of this year, there are 11 approved pathways for SAF production, and a further 11 currently being assessed, which help diversify supply and create a menu of SAF options around the world, particularly in developing nations.

Over 50 airlines worldwide, covering roughly 40% of global passenger traffic, have pledged to SAF goals. We see similar developments on the airport side, almost 100 airports globally have had ongoing SAF deliveries since 2024. Business aviation is playing their part as well, having pledged to the net-zero 2050 target in tandem with commercial airlines, actively adopting efficiency measures.

Manufacturers produce the world’s most fuel-efficient aircraft and engines, and work on electric and hydrogen propulsion technologies.

Airports are taking measures to increase efficiency of ground handling, infrastructure and transportation, while air navigation service providers work towards creating more efficient flight paths.

These industry actions are supported by governments across the globe: Around 45 countries, are now developing or implementing policies to speed up the uptake of the approximately 23 million tonnes of SAF needed by 2030. None of this progress has happened in isolation. ICAO has in many ways facilitated not just a joint commitment but is supporting its realisation.

The path to net zero carbon is driven by multilateralism. The agreement by ICAO Member States on a long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 was a shining example of what we can accomplish if we all agree on a common denominator. ICAO’s role in coordinating this progress cannot be overstated: By bringing together more than 190 nations, ICAO provides the forum for States to coordinate action, align policies, and implement frameworks that serve as solutions for climate action on a global scale.

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) – the first-ever global market-based measure for any sector – is one example of how ICAO has helped to turn ambition into action. Airlines will need to purchase $20-30 billion in approved offsets for 1.2-2 billion tonnes of CO2. This represents around 70% of the growth in international air transport emissions during the lifetime of the scheme. This is the result of extensive negotiations by developed and developing countries, the ICAO system, industry and civil society, and represents a measure that will be effective without having a disproportionately negative impact on developing nations and their capacity for growth. A total of 130 states have now volunteered for the first stage (a new addition from Dominca which joined today), making it likely to be one of the most successful UN-level carbon management projects.

The progress of recent years has been truly encouraging. We have moved from aspiration to action and built a strong foundation for the next phase of aviation’s net zero journey, but we must acknowledge and actively address the challenges on the way. The hardest work of scaling up from those first millions of tonnes of SAF to the hundreds of millions needed, and deploying new technologies at global scale, still lies ahead. Achieving our objective will require nothing less than a concerted push from all of us in the coming decades.

This is a call to action for every stakeholder in aviation’s ecosystem. Governments have shown leadership through ICAO; now we urge them to continue translating that leadership into concrete national policies and international collaboration. Meanwhile, industry partners such as airlines, airports, manufacturers, fuel producers, and air navigation service providers continue to invest, innovate, and share their knowledge. Institutions and energy companies, too, are critical players; the latter of which have recently scaled back their initial commitments on SAF production. It is up to governments to introduce measures that will hold oil companies truly accountable and ensure their crucial support in the scale-up of SAF. It will take unified ambition from all corners to overcome the hurdles of this energy transition, whether it’s improving the economic viability of SAF, commercialising hydrogen and electric propulsion systems, or upgrading infrastructure across the world.

The next three to five years will be a vital time for the decarbonisation of our sector. We need to demonstrate a continued commitment, to ensure that the early gains we’ve seen can be solidified into long-term transformation. Air traffic will continue to increase every year to serve a global population that sees great benefits in connectivity, and with it the need to decouple carbon emissions from growth becomes even more important. As impacts are felt by citizens with more frequent flooding and wildfires, climate change will increasingly be a part of public consciousness, with greater demands for political, consumer and corporate action. Most importantly, multilateralism on a global scale will continue to be crucial to future success, removing barriers and allowing the industry to innovate at scale. I look forward to discussing the next chapter of this journey at the ICAO Aviation Climate Week in the coming days.",https://atag.org/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-06-03 10:56:22.659437

Why in News?

The Uttar Pradesh government has unveiled plans for the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Manufacturing Policy-2025, aimed at converting agricultural waste into jet fuel.

A high-level roundtable conference was organized by Invest UP in Lucknow to discuss the policy framework.

Key Points

About the SAF: It is produced from renewable sources such as agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and forestry residues.

It has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Indigenous feedstock like sugarcane molasses and Make in India technology are being used to produce SAF.

About the Policy: The policy targets the production of sustainable aviation fuel from agricultural residues like sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, and wheat straw.

It aims to establish industrial units within Uttar Pradesh for bio-jet fuel manufacturing.

This initiative will directly benefit around 2.5 crore farmers by creating new markets for their crop waste.

Significance of the Policy:

First of Its Kind in India: Marks a pioneering step towards integrating agricultural waste-based biofuels into India’s aviation fuel mix.

Climate Change Mitigation: Supports India’s commitment under the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon intensity and promote renewable energy.

Agricultural Waste Management: It can reduce stubble burning, a major cause of air pollution and smog in northern India, improving public health and ecological balance.

Rural Economy Upliftment: Creates new markets and value chains for agricultural residues, generating additional income sources for farmers.

Industrial Growth: Promotes establishment of SAF manufacturing units, leveraging UP’s strategic logistics and agro-industrial base.

Related Challenges:

Technological Viability: Developing reliable and scalable processes to convert varied agricultural wastes into aviation fuel efficiently remains a major hurdle.

Price Competitiveness: Producing SAF at a cost close to conventional jet fuel is necessary to encourage adoption without heavy subsidies.

Infrastructure Development: Effective collection, transport, and storage of dispersed crop residues need robust logistics to maintain a steady supply.

Policy Integration: Aligning state and central policies on biofuels and aviation is essential to streamline approvals and incentives.

Way Forward:

Incorporate Stakeholder Feedback: Engaging farmers, industry, and experts will help tailor the policy to real-world challenges.

Facilitate Research & Development: Investment in R&D can improve technology efficiency and reduce production costs.

Create Incentives: Financial benefits for SAF producers and users will promote market growth.

Strengthen Farmer Outreach: Educating farmers and ensuring fair prices will secure reliable feedstock supply.

Promote Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between government and private sector can drive large-scale, sustainable SAF production.",https://www.drishtiias.com/drishti/img/drishti-dual-logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-03 08:57:10.518478

This question was the focus of the tests carried out in spring 2023. They took place on the ground at the Payerne airbase using a Cessna 560 XL Citation Excel, a twin-engine business jet that can carry nine passengers.

Significantly lower soot emissions

A working group of environmental experts from the Zurich University of Applied Sciences, the Paul Scherrer Institute, the Swiss Air Force and the FOCA analysed and evaluated the data. A clear picture emerged: Fossil CO2 emissions are reduced in line with the proportion of SAF in the tanks.

The decline in soot emissions is significant: Depending on the engine configuration, these are up to 35% lower. The reduction is particularly marked when the aircraft is idling - for example, when it is on the ground with the engine running. The reason for this is that SAF generally does not contain any soot-forming aromatic hydrocarbons and therefore burns more cleanly than pure fossil kerosene. It is also sulphur-free. Even with a low admixture, not only are fewer soot particles produced, but also fewer gaseous aromatic and sulphurous substances, which brings an overall reduction in particulate matter pollution and an improvement in air quality.

SAF: Better for the climate and air quality on the ground

Sustainable aviation fuels are a promising approach to reducing fossil CO2 emissions in aviation. Compared with fossil fuels, SAF makes it possible to avoid up to 80% of CO2 emissions without modifying today's engines, including all emissions relating to production and transport. Using SAF is a win-win situation, as it also has a positive effect on the air quality at and around an airport. While similar results were already available for large engines, the tests in Payerne on a business jet engine show that SAF can also be used to reduce pollutant emissions from small engines.

The results of the tests have been published in a scientific journal.

SAF test conditions

The fuel mixture used in the tests contained 35% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This met the technical requirements of conventional kerosene. It did not require any technical modifications to the aircraft or the refuelling system. This is important because theseSAF mixtures can be used directly in existing aircraft. The SAF was produced from organic waste such as used cooking oil and animal fats from slaughterhouse waste. In order to be able to compare the SAF mixture directly with conventional kerosene, the right and left wing tanks were filled with different fuels. It was possible to switch between the fuels while the engine was running.",https://news.admin.ch/favicon-16x16.png,N,,2025-06-03 08:57:18.743029

Most alternative aviation fuels – also referred to as ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel or SAF – is ""heading toward Europe,"" where fuel blending mandates across the EU and UK began on 1 January, 2025.

In addition, the cost of alternative fuels to airlines ""has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging,"" according to IATA, which estimated that compliance fees will add $1.7 billion on top of market prices – ""an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.""

IATA also estimated that the average cost of alternative aviation fuel in 2024 was 3.1 times that of jet fuel. In 2025, the global average cost for alternatives is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.

Walsh added that ""this highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation.""

IATA urged redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel to ""eliminate the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil”. The association also advocated for an approach to energy policy that includes alternative aviation fuels.

In a separate update on Tuesday (3 June), IATA announced a partnership with Amadeus to integrate its CO2 Connect emissions calculator into the latter's travel management platform.

IATA’s CO2 Connect is one of many methodologies designed to measure emissions from flights. It provides operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, rather than the modelled averages used by some other calculation methodologies.

Challenges with Mandates and European Cost Increases

IATA identified that most SAF production is currently directed towards Europe, largely due to EU and UK mandates that became effective on January 1, 2025.

The association reports that the cost of SAF to airlines in Europe has doubled due to compliance fees levied by producers or suppliers.

For the expected one million tonnes of SAF anticipated to meet European mandates in 2025, the market cost is estimated at $1.2 billion, with an additional $1.7 billion in compliance fees.

IATA notes that this additional amount could have abated an extra 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. The organisation asserts that Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF “five times more costly than conventional jet fuel“.

Walsh criticised this approach, stating, “This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonisation“.

He added, “Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonisation policies. Europe needs to realise that its approach is not working and find another way“.

IATA’s Initiatives and Urgent Government Action Call

To foster the development of a global SAF market, IATA has launched two initiatives:

A SAF registry, managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organization (CADO), designed to provide a transparent and standardised system for tracking SAF purchases, usage, and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations like CORSIA and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

The SAF Matchmaker, intended to facilitate SAF procurement by connecting airline SAF requests with supply offers.

Sustainable fuel

SkyNRG was co-founded 15 years ago by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Spring Associates and circular solutions company EME, to make sustainable aviation fuel from vegetable and waste oils.

The company and Swedish power company Skellefteå Kraft entered a partnership last year to develop eSAF, synthetic aviation fuel made from renewable electricity and carbon dioxide from decomposing biomass.

SkyNRG’s Maarten van Dijk said the new capital “demonstrates that the SAF market is ready for facilities dedicated solely to the production of SAF.” Such fuels can cut aviation emissions, which account for just over 2% of carbon emissions globally, by up to 80%.

Led by scientists from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, academics from Manchester Met are working with a group of universities, research centres and aerospace companies to understand how different aviation fuels change the emissions and therefore the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

In a UK-first experiment held at RAF Brize Norton, two aircraft flew in formation – with one trailing the other to sample its emissions – to compare the pollutants produced by sustainable aviation fuel and traditional jet fuel.

Previous in-flight emissions work in the UK has involved following several miles behind other aircraft whereas the aircraft involved in GRIM-SAF were able to get within 60 metres of each other.

Both aircraft also landed at RAF Brize Norton to make detailed ground-based measurements with the goal of linking this to the in-flight work.

Dr Simon Christie, Research Fellow at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: “The chase experiment marks a significant milestone in our research as we now have a real-life scenario through which to analyse the environmental impacts of sustainable aviation fuel against traditional jet fuel.

“We look forward to continuing to work with our partners to shape global measures to mitigate aviation’s climate change effects.”

These non-CO2 effects include the emission of soot and other substances, such as lubrication oil vented from aircraft engines, that can cause contrails to form.

Contrails are long, thin clouds made of ice crystals, which form when water vapour condenses on the tiny particles emitted by aircraft engines. Contrails sometimes spread out over large areas and can affect the Earth’s climate in the same way as naturally-formed cirrus clouds.

Emissions from aircraft aren’t just limited to the skies; ultrafine particles have been detected many kilometres downwind of airports at ground level, especially major airports that see heavy air traffic.

Dr Paul Williams, from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of Manchester, said: “Although this type of experiment, with one aircraft following another in formation, is very useful for scientists to get an understanding of the emissions produced by burning different types of fuels, it is environmentally costly.

The slow ramp-up in supply, combined with policy missteps – particularly in Europe – is raising concerns that flawed regulation may be undermining aviation’s decarbonization efforts.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7 percent of aviation’s total fuel needs,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

According to IATA, Europe’s SAF mandates, introduced in January 2025, were intended to boost the market. Instead, they have significantly inflated costs. Airlines purchasing the expected one million tonnes of SAF to meet compliance will face a $1.2 billion fuel bill at current market rates – plus an estimated $1.7 billion in compliance fees imposed by producers and suppliers. IATA argues this cost premium could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

“This highlights the problem with implementing mandates before sufficient market conditions exist,” Walsh said. “Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”

In response, IATA is advancing two market-enabling initiatives:

– A SAF registry developed under the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) to transparently track SAF transactions and emissions reductions under global schemes like CORSIA and the EU ETS.

– A new SAF Matchmaker platform to link airline demand with producer supply.

To scale SAF globally, IATA is urging governments to adopt more effective policy frameworks. These include redirecting a portion of fossil fuel subsidies toward renewables, integrating SAF into broader energy strategies, and ensuring the effectiveness of CORSIA by making eligible carbon credits available.

IATA noted that India, the world’s third-largest aviation market, is positioning itself as a leader in this transition. Through the Global Biofuels Alliance, it has targeted a 2 percent SAF blend for international flights by 2028, supported by favorable pricing mechanisms and capital incentives. IATA is working with local stakeholders to support best practices for feedstock sustainability and life-cycle assessments.

“India’s integrated approach to biofuels shows how smart policy can align economic growth with environmental progress,” Walsh noted.

This initiative marks a significant milestone in aviation’s journey toward greater operational efficiency and long-term carbon reduction goals, aligning with the global aviation sector’s 2050 net-zero carbon emissions roadmap.

The adoption of FuelIS by two prominent airlines highlights the increasing industry focus on managing fuel consumption not only as a key cost component but also as a central pillar of environmental responsibility.

The Importance of Fuel Efficiency in Aviation

Fuel costs remain a dominant expenditure in airline operations, accounting for approximately 25-30% of total operating expenses, depending on market fluctuations. With increasing carbon pricing mechanisms and the decarbonization commitments under the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), managing fuel efficiency is now a strategic imperative for global carriers.

According to IATA’s Net Zero by 2050 roadmap, technological innovation and operational efficiency improvements—including better fuel management—are projected to deliver 10% of total emissions reductions by mid-century.

Nick Careen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Operations, Safety and Security, emphasized this in the announcement:

“Fuel management is key for airlines. On top of its cost impact, it is intrinsically linked to carbon emissions. Understanding how an airline performs compared to peers using FuelIS can reveal efficiencies that both reduce costs and improve sustainability.”

What Is IATA FuelIS?

IATA FuelIS (Fuel Intelligence Solution) is an advanced analytics platform that helps airlines benchmark and analyze fuel consumption across aircraft types, regions, markets, and operational conditions. The system is powered by real-world data from the IATA Global Aviation Data Management (GADM) platform and integrates seamlessly with IATA’s existing Fuel Efficiency Gap Analysis (FEGA) framework.

FuelIS draws upon the Flight Data eXchange (FDX) program, which aggregates operational fuel data from more than 220 global airlines, covering over 8 million flights annually. This collective, anonymized dataset enables airlines to compare their performance against industry averages and generate actionable insights.

The platform provides granular analysis that includes metrics like fuel burn per block hour, sector length comparisons, and engine performance tracking—critical data for both immediate operational improvements and long-term strategic planning.

How GOL and TAP Are Leveraging FuelIS

For TAP Air Portugal, FuelIS is now a critical tool in measuring the impacts of fleet modernization and the gradual integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into operations.

TAP CEO Luís Rodrigues stated:

“Fuel is a major cost driver for TAP Air Portugal. Managing consumption is a priority both financially and environmentally. Every kilogram saved matters. FuelIS gives us the insight needed to measure and refine our decarbonization strategy.”

Similarly, GOL Linhas Aéreas views its adoption of FuelIS as an operational and competitive advantage. The airline’s COO, Albert Pérez, said:

“Fuel is a significant cost factor, and managing it effectively gives us a strong edge. FuelIS equips us with industry-level benchmarking and decision-making tools to fine-tune our performance and reduce costs. It’s another step in our long-term commitment to operational excellence and sustainability.”

Economic and Environmental Impact

Since launching its fuel efficiency programs in 2005, IATA has helped its member airlines identify annual fuel savings of 4.76 million tonnes, equating to $3.8 billion in avoided costs. This demonstrates the dual benefit of efficiency: economic resilience and climate impact mitigation.

FuelIS contributes directly to national and international efforts for carbon accountability in aviation. As governments increasingly enforce emissions tracking and reporting, tools like FuelIS help airlines comply with evolving regulations such as:

EU ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme)

CORSIA under ICAO

National sustainability mandates like Brazil’s ProBioCombustível and Portugal’s National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP)

These regulatory frameworks, accessible via official sources like icao.int, easa.europa.eu, and europa.eu/climate-action, reinforce the need for robust data management and emissions transparency.

Data Accuracy and Benchmarking

One of the most powerful features of FuelIS is its data credibility, built on IATA’s trusted data governance. The FDX platform ensures anonymized, validated operational data, enabling apples-to-apples comparison among different airlines and aircraft types. FuelIS also helps airlines set measurable KPIs and track improvements over time.

This is especially vital for airlines investing in new aircraft, SAF testing programs, or hybrid-electric propulsion. Comparing outcomes across similar fleet profiles can validate or recalibrate investment strategies in real time.

Industry-Wide Adoption and Future Outlook

As airlines like GOL and TAP set the precedent, broader industry adoption of FuelIS is anticipated. With more airlines striving to meet Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) goals and aligning with national decarbonization strategies—such as Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Portugal’s Green Deal commitments—data tools will be indispensable.

Moreover, as the global SAF market scales, having detailed fuel performance insights can help airlines integrate SAF cost-effectively while maximizing emissions reductions.

IATA’s focus on digital transformation and real-time analytics aligns with aviation’s move toward smart operations, endorsed in government-backed aviation modernization strategies like FAA’s NextGen and EU’s Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR).

Conclusion

The decision by GOL and TAP Air Portugal to implement IATA FuelIS represents a strategic shift toward data-driven efficiency and long-term climate accountability in aviation. With rising fuel costs, stricter emissions regulations, and ambitious decarbonization timelines, the ability to precisely measure and optimize fuel use is no longer optional—it is essential.

As the industry faces the twin pressures of economic viability and environmental responsibility, tools like FuelIS offer a scalable, evidence-based path forward.

That benchmark equates to about 2 million tonnes of fuel, or about 0.7% of the airlines’ fuel consumption. This increase will add about $4.4 billion globally to aviation’s total fuel bill.

Our Analysis: Despite the Increase, Airlines May Struggle to Meet Sustainability Goals

Back in 2021, the global aviation sector agreed on a shared goal to meet net-zero emissions by 2050, the result of a gradual switch over to SAF. And although it’s encouraging to see the increase in production of SAF this year, IATA reiterated that several challenges stand in the way of airlines reaching the net-zero goal.

Since SAF (made from waste oil and biomass) is still in limited supply – and extremely expensive to produce – the trade group is cautioning that progress is still too slow, and that challenge is further compounded by the industry’s delay in delivering more fuel-efficient jets. Much more urgent work must be done of the goal is to be met.

What They Are Saying: Progress Is Too Slow

""The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,"" said Willie Walsh, director for IATA, in a statement. “The behavior of fuel suppliers in fulfilling the SAF mandates is an outrage. The cost of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 is estimated to be an enormous $4.7 trillion. Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers.”

Fast Facts: The State of the Aviation Industry in 2025

- The first half of 2025 has been marked by global market uncertainties, yet airlines are projected to perform better than in 2024 in terms of net profits.

- Overall performance will be slightly below earlier forecasts.

- A key positive factor is a 13% drop in jet fuel prices compared to 2024, and 1% below prior estimates.

- Airlines are expected to carry more passengers and cargo this year than in 2024.

- Demand projections have been affected by trade tensions and reduced consumer confidence.

Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers.

- Net profit margins are expected to rise from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.7% in 2025.

- This margin is still about half the average across all industries.

- IATA director general Willie Walsh says the results highlight the resilience airlines have built despite challenging conditions.

- According to IATA, “the average cost of SAF in 2024 was 3.1 times that of jet fuel, for a total additional cost of $1.6 billion. In 2025, the global average cost for SAF is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel. This extra cost is largely the result of SAF 'compliance fees’ being levied by European fuel suppliers to hedge their potential costs as a result of European SAF mandates to include 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply.”",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TAW/uploadedImages/Professional_Development/Opinion/IATASAF_HERO.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-06-03 06:56:33.053603

Expenses are to reach $913 billion, lower than the $940 billion prediction.","NEW DELHI—The International Air Transport Association (IATA) issued a clear warning about the negative consequences of trade barriers and tariffs.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh said at the association’s annual general assembly in New Delhi June 2 that “like all forms of connectivity, flying makes the world more prosperous. That stands in contrast to isolationism, trade barriers and the fragmentation of the multi-lateral rules-based system. These destroy wealth and lower living standards. For the times we live in, this is an important message.”

IATA expects the global airline industry to make a $36 billion net profit in 2025. That is $3.6 billion more than it achieved in 2024, but slightly lower than the $36.6 billion IATA had predicted for this year last December. Nonetheless, the industry will record a 3.7% net margin, up from 3.4% last year, mainly because of the lower fuel costs that airlines continue to benefit from.

Revenues are to come in at $979 billion, lower than the $1 trillion that IATA had predicted at the end of 2024. Expenses are to reach $913 billion, lower than the $940 billion prediction.

In absolute numbers, North America is leading the industry with $12 billion in profits, followed by Europe ($11.3 billion), the Middle East ($6.2 billion) and Asia-Pacific ($4.9 billion). The best margin was achieved in the Middle East (8.7%) followed by Europe (4.3%) and North America (4%).

Airlines are going to be impacted by a slowing global economy as many players are taking a wait-and-see attitude as trade conflicts are playing out, experts warned.

“There is a lot of holding your breath—so the global economy starts to slow down,” Andrew Staples, principal at advisory service GeoPol Asia, told the IATA meeting. “Student tourism, tourism, business travel—there is a lot of risk around this.”

The uncertainty and quick changes of U.S. trade policy “create a paralysis,"" said Henry Wilkinson, chief intelligence officer at Dragonfly.

Separately, IATA urged the industry to accelerate sustainability efforts as the rollout of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as well as air traffic control and fleet modernization, have been falling behind.

“By the time we meet next year, we must be able to show more progress,” Walsh said. “And by 'we,' I mean all the aviation industry and governments who are joined in a common commitment to net zero by 2050.”

IATA has been studying the feasibility of SAF targets, with fuels delivering 65% of planned carbon mitigation in 2050, and has come to the conclusion that there is “more than enough” feedstock for the amounts needed, yet production capacity expansion is lagging.

SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tons in 2025, but that represents only 0.7% of fuel demand. Walsh said that governments are not creating ""supportive policy frameworks,"" that U.S. tax credits that were supposed to support production ramp-up “are now uncertain” and that major energy companies such as Shell and BP have cut back on investment plans.

Also, Walsh pointed out that in his view, government support for CORSIA, the global offset scheme, has weakened and that the European Union (EU) mandate of 2% SAF that is in place now has raised costs, but not production. “It’s an outrage that suppliers are charging airlines compliance fees that value SAF at double its market premium over conventional jet fuel. That’s a billion-dollar windfall for fuel suppliers. This is the EU great green scam.”

Walsh also blasted manufacturers and the supply chain for constant delays. “The manufacturing sector is failing badly,"" he said. Deliveries are down 26% this year versus prior promises, 1,100 aircraft under 10 years of age are in storage and lead times between order and delivery not be 14 years. “It is just not acceptable that it should take until the end of the decade” for supply chain issues to be sorted out, he said.

The average fleet age has risen from 13 to 15 years, according to IATA, as airlines hold on to aging aircraft longer to ensure they have sufficient capacity.

“This is not where we should be in 2025,” Walsh said. “We have a quarter century to get to net zero. There is no time for delay and no tolerance for government greenwashing and unnecessary cost increases. We need urgent actions.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-06-03 06:56:36.005658

Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.
Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular.
Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived.
Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that it expects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to reach 2 million tonnes (Mt) (2.5 billion liters) or 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Problem with the Use of Mandates

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025. Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion. Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh.

IATA’s Role in Supporting the Development of a Global SAF Market

To support the development of a global SAF market, IATA has worked on two initiatives:

• A SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) that brings a transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations such as Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

• The SAF Matchmaker that will facilitate SAF procurement by matching airline requests for SAF with supply offers.

Urgent Action by Governments Is Needed

IATA urges gove​​​​rnments to focus on three areas:

1. Creating more effective policies. Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular. This includes redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel.

2. Develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF. Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production. A wholistic approach should support joint use of infrastructure, co-production and other measures that will benefit the energy transition for aviation and for all other economic sectors.

3. Ensure the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions. IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date Guyana is the only state to have made their carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against their CORSIA obligations.

Focus on India

India, one of the emerging economies on the world stage today, is the third-largest oil user after the US and China. India launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to position biofuels as a key to energy transition and economic growth. This includes a target for 2% SAF blending for international flights by 2028 with enabling policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards. IATA will be working with the Indian Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) and Praj Industries Limited, to provide guidance on global best practices for life cycle assessment of the use of feedstocks in the country.

As the third-largest global civil aviation market, India can strengthen its leadership in biofuels with the accelerated adoption of SAF through progressive policies.","https://dev-aspire.imgix.net/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/website/logos/1746635074307-aviationpros_logo_tm.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=solid&fill-color=&w=1200&h=627",N,,2025-06-03 06:57:12.964058

As the first airline to implement this technology, TAP is setting a new industry standard for fuel management, driving significant cost savings while contributing to environmental sustainability. By leveraging data-driven insights, TAP aims to significantly reduce fuel consumption across its fleet, marking a crucial step toward greener aviation practices and a more sustainable future for the industry. The adoption of IATA FuelIS positions TAP as a leader in the global effort to reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency in aviation.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently announced a significant milestone in the aviation industry: GOL and TAP Air Portugal have become the first airlines to implement IATA FuelIS, an advanced analytics solution aimed at optimizing fuel consumption. This marks a pivotal moment in the aviation sector’s push toward greater fuel efficiency and sustainability.

IATA’s roadmap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions, laid out in their comprehensive 2050 strategy, emphasizes that technological advancements and operational efficiencies will play a crucial role in reducing emissions. These improvements, which directly lower fuel consumption, are expected to contribute roughly 10% of the emissions reductions required to meet the 2050 target. With aviation being a major contributor to global emissions, the implementation of such technologies is essential to the industry’s long-term sustainability.

IATA FuelIS: Revolutionizing Fuel Management

IATA FuelIS is a cutting-edge analytics tool designed to assist airlines in improving fuel efficiency by offering data-driven insights into fuel consumption patterns across various aircraft types, engines, and fleet operations. This solution enables airlines to benchmark their fuel performance against industry standards, identifying opportunities for optimization and ultimately driving down costs. The system uses real-world operational data to evaluate how efficiently an airline is using fuel compared to its peers, providing actionable insights that help airlines make informed decisions about their fleets and operations.

The FuelIS platform leverages data from the IATA Global Aviation Data Management (GADM) platform, which aggregates a vast amount of information gathered from the Flight Data eXchange (FDX) program. The FDX program currently compiles fuel consumption data from over 220 airlines worldwide, representing more than 8 million flights annually. This extensive database enables FuelIS to offer a highly accurate and reliable picture of fuel consumption trends across different regions, markets, countries, and fleet types. By tapping into this wealth of operational data, airlines gain access to a comprehensive and up-to-date view of their fuel usage, which is essential for developing effective fuel management strategies.

FuelIS also integrates seamlessly with IATA’s Fuel Efficiency Gap Analysis (FEGA), a tool that helps airlines track their fuel efficiency over time. FEGA analyzes the data collected by FuelIS to identify the “fuel efficiency gap”—the difference between current performance and industry best practices. This analysis supports the development of targeted fuel strategies and allows airlines to track their progress in improving fuel efficiency. The combination of FuelIS and FEGA provides a powerful suite of tools that airlines can use to minimize fuel consumption, reduce operational costs, and contribute to the broader goal of sustainability.

The Economic and Environmental Impact

The implementation of IATA FuelIS is expected to have both economic and environmental benefits. On the economic side, airlines that use FuelIS can achieve significant cost savings by identifying inefficiencies in fuel usage and addressing them through data-driven solutions. Over the years, IATA’s collaboration with airlines has led to impressive results. Since 2005, IATA has worked with airlines around the world to uncover opportunities for reducing fuel consumption by an estimated 4.76 million tonnes annually. This reduction translates into savings of approximately \$3.8 billion each year. These figures highlight the substantial impact that improved fuel management can have on an airline’s bottom line.

From an environmental perspective, optimizing fuel usage is one of the most effective ways for the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint. As global air traffic continues to grow, the pressure on airlines to adopt more sustainable practices becomes even more critical. By implementing technologies like FuelIS, airlines can make significant strides toward lowering their carbon emissions, which is in line with the broader goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition to fuel efficiency, the data insights provided by FuelIS also support other sustainability efforts, such as the identification of operational improvements that reduce aircraft emissions and minimize the environmental impact of air travel.

The Future of Fuel Management in Aviation

The adoption of IATA FuelIS by GOL and TAP Air Portugal represents just the beginning of what is expected to be a broader trend across the aviation industry. As airlines continue to face mounting pressure to improve sustainability and reduce their carbon emissions, tools like FuelIS will become increasingly important.

IATA director general Willie Walsh noted that while the expected doubling of SAF production to two million tonnes is encouraging, it still represents a small fraction of aviation’s fuel needs. He added that the increase would add US$4.4 billion globally to the fuel costs, and stressed the need to accelerate production and improve efficiencies to reduce expenses.

Most SAF currently supplies Europe, where EU and UK mandates came into effect on January 1, 2025. Walsh highlighted concerns about the doubling of SAF costs to airlines in Europe due to compliance fees imposed by producers or suppliers. For the estimated one million tonnes of SAF to meet European mandates in 2025, the cost at market prices is projected at US$1.2 billion, with additional compliance fees adding US$1.7 billion. Walsh pointed out that this extra cost could have been used to reduce a further 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

He questioned the implementation of mandates ahead of adequate market conditions and safeguards, noting that increasing the cost of decarbonisation – already estimated at US$4.7 trillion – could hinder progress. Walsh suggested that Europe may need to reassess its current approach.

To support a global SAF market, IATA has developed two initiatives. The first is a SAF registry, managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), which provides a transparent, standardised system for tracking SAF purchases, usage, and emissions reductions in line with international regulations such as the Carbon Offsetting Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The second initiative, the SAF Matchmaker, aims to facilitate SAF procurement by connecting airline requests with supply offers.

IATA has called on governments to take urgent action in three key areas. First, governments should create more effective policies by removing the disadvantages renewable energy producers face compared to fossil fuel industries, including reallocating some of the US$1 trillion global subsidies currently directed at fossil fuels. Second, a comprehensive energy policy is required, one that increases renewable energy production and ensures an appropriate allocation for SAF. This should include support for shared infrastructure and co-production to benefit aviation and other sectors. Third, governments should ensure the success of CORSIA by making Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines; to date, only Guyana has made its carbon credits accessible for this purpose.

India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer after the US and China, has launched the Global Biofuels Alliance to promote biofuels as a key component of its energy transition and economic growth. This includes a target of two per cent SAF blending in international flights by 2028, supported by policies such as guaranteed pricing, capital support for new projects, and technical standards.

LATAM Airlines Group to host 82nd IATA AGM in Rio de Janeiro​: IATA announced that the 82nd IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2026, hosted by LATAM Airlines Group.
The last time the IATA AGM was in South America was in 1999, also in Rio.
“LATAM is proud to host the IATA AGM in Brazil in 2026, the main market for our airline group connecting South America to the world.","Policy shortcomings put SAF production at risk: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that it expects Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production to reach 2 million tonnes (Mt) (2.5 billion liters) or 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025. “While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to 2 million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates kicked in on 1 January 2025. Unacceptably, the cost of SAF to airlines has now doubled in Europe because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion. Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices—an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions. Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel. “This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way,” said Walsh. IATA urges governments to focus on three areas: Creating more effective policies. Eliminating the disadvantage that renewable energy producers face compared with big oil is necessary to scale renewable energy production in general and SAF production in particular. This includes redirecting a portion of the $1 trillion in subsidies that governments globally grant for fossil fuel. Develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF. Firstly, advancing SAF production requires an increase in renewable energy production from which SAF is derived. Secondly, it also requires policies to ensure SAF is allocated an appropriate portion of renewable energy production. A wholistic approach should support joint use of infrastructure, co-production and other measures that will benefit the energy transition for aviation and for all other economic sectors. Ensure the success of CORSIA as the sole market-based mechanism to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions. IATA urges governments to make Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. To date Guyana is the only state to have made their carbon credits available for airlines to purchase and claim against their CORSIA obligations.

IATA Diversity & Inclusion Awards announced: IATA announced the winners of the annual IATA Diversity & Inclusion Awards: Inspirational Role Model: Claudia Zapata-Cardone, President of the Latin Professionals in Aerospace (LPA); High Flyer: Katherine Moloney, Founder of Elevate (her) Aviation; Diversity & Inclusion Team: Air Canada. “Diversity and inclusion is strategic for aviation as the industry’s growth is contingent upon attracting a strong talent pool with a wide variety of skills. Congratulations go to this year’s awardees who have all excelled at creating the potential for any individual to have a great career in aviation—an industry that is a powerful force for social and economic prosperity. Their achievements are examples for others to follow,” said Karen Walker, Editor-in-Chief, Air Transport World and Chair of the judging panel. “As we mark the seventh year of the IATA Diversity and Inclusion Awards, they continue to play a pivotal role in making aviation a more inclusive and representative industry that supports innovation, enhances decision making, and strengthens customer engagement. These awards highlight how inclusion is not just the right thing to do—it’s also a strategic advantage. I commend all the nominees, and especially the winners,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. The IATA Diversity & Inclusion Awards are sponsored by Qatar Airways. Through their support, each winner receives a prize of $25,000, payable either to themselves or their nominated charities.

$1.3 billion in airline funds blocked by governments: The International Air Transport Association reported that $1.3 billion in airline funds are blocked from repatriation by governments as of end April 2025. This is a significant amount, although it is an improvement of 25% compared with the $1.7 billion reported for October 2024. IATA urged governments to remove all barriers preventing airlines from the timely repatriation of their revenues from ticket sales and other activities in accordance with international agreements and treaty obligations. “Ensuring the timely repatriation of revenues is vital for airlines to cover dollar-denominated expenses and maintain their operations. Delays and denials violate bilateral agreements and increase exchange rate risks. Reliable access to revenues is critical for any business—particularly airlines which operate on very thin margins. Economies and jobs rely on international connectivity. Governments must realise that it is a challenge for airlines to maintain connectivity when revenue repatriation is denied or delayed,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. Pakistan and Bangladesh, previously in the top five blocked funds countries, have made notable progress in clearing their backlog to $83 million and $92 million, respectively (from $311 million and $196 million in October 2024, respectively). Mozambique has climbed up to the top of blocked funds countries, withholding $205 million from airlines, compared with $127 million in October 2024. The Africa and Middle East (AME) region accounts for 85% of total blocked funds, at $1.1 billion as of end April 2025. The most significant improvement was noted in Bolivia, fully clearing its backlog that stood at $42 million at end October 2024.

​​Luis Gallego chairs IATA board​: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced that Luis Gallego, CEO of International Airlines Group (IAG), has assumed his duties as Chair of the IATA Board. His one-year term began at the conclusion of the 81st IATA Annual General Meeting in New Delhi, India, on 2 June 2025. Gallego is the 83rd Chair of the IATA Board on which he has served since 2018. Gallego succeeds IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers, who will continue to serve on the Board. “I am honoured to be taking up the position of Chair of the IATA Board. The airline industry faces significant challenges—accelerating environmental action, managing geopolitical shifts and supply chain issues, and dealing with concerns over infrastructure capacity and costs. At the same time, the industry has incredible strengths to call on— most of all the quality of the people that strive to make aviation a safe, secure and rewarding experience for millions of travelers every day. IATA has a vital role in harnessing these human and technical resources to deliver leadership and innovation. I look forward to playing my part in steering IATA in its long mission for a strong and successful airline industry,” said Gallego. Gallego has nearly 30 years of broad experience in the aviation industry. He became IAG’s chief executive in September 2020, joining from Iberia, where he was chairman and chief executive from January 2014. During his tenure at Iberia, he turned the airline around and improved its efficiency, customer service and brand. Before that, Gallego launched Iberia Express, as chief executive from January 2012, making the new Iberia subsidiary one of the most efficient and punctual airlines in Europe.

LATAM Airlines Group to host 82nd IATA AGM in Rio de Janeiro​: IATA announced that the 82nd IATA Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 2026, hosted by LATAM Airlines Group. “We are excited to accept LATAM’s offer to host IATA’s 82nd AGM in Rio de Janeiro.

Understanding Green Methanol: A Key to Sustainable Energy

Green methanol is a renewable fuel produced by combining carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from renewable sources with green hydrogen generated from biogenic sources or through electrolysis powered by renewable electricity. This process results in a liquid fuel that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional fossil fuels.

The production of green methanol involves several pathways:

Biomass Gasification: Converting organic materials such as woody biomass and agricultural waste into syngas, which is then synthesized into methanol.

Electrofuel Pathways: Utilizing renewable electricity to produce hydrogen, which is then combined with captured CO2 to create methanol.

These methods not only provide a use for waste materials but also offer a means to store renewable energy in a liquid form, facilitating easier transportation and storage.

The Benefits and Applications of Green Methanol

Green methanol offers numerous advantages that make it a compelling alternative to traditional fossil fuels:

Significant Emission Reductions: It can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 95%, nitrogen oxide emissions by up to 80%, and virtually eliminate sulfur oxide and particulate matter emissions.

Versatility: Applicable across various sectors, including maritime shipping, aviation, and chemical manufacturing.

Compatibility: Can be used in existing internal combustion engines, facilitating simple adoption and integration into today's infrastructure.

Energy Storage: Acts as an efficient energy carrier, storing renewable energy in a stable, liquid form.

These attributes position green methanol as a pivotal component in the global strategy to achieve net-zero emissions and combat climate change.

Looking Ahead

The developments surrounding the Beaver Lake project and the substantial investment by industry leaders underscore the growing commitment to green methanol as a cornerstone of sustainable energy solutions. As technology advances and production scales up, green methanol is poised to play a critical role as a cleaner solution for various sectors by supplying an additional low-carbon fuel source.

Sustainable aviation fuel production to double in 2025, says IATA

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts SAF production to reach 2 million tonnes in 2025. Although a positive direction for the aviation industry, the rising production in SAF will not add to the 0.7% of total airline fuel consumption the fuel contributes. The production will further add $4.4 billion to the global aviation fuel bill due to rising costs. IATA warns that the slow increase in SAF investment is not enough to meet 2050 net-zero emissions. Issues of supply and demand plague the aviation industry as Airbus and Boeing struggle to bring to market fuel-efficient aircraft at a rate that is fast enough to meet demands. To accelerate sustainable solution adoption, companies will require the use of sustainability tools as industries like aviation move towards net-zero adoption.

Their groundbreaking work in developing a liquid hydrogen storage and delivery system promises to elevate zero-emission aviation from visionary concept to near-term commercial reality—even as early as 2035.

Bridging the Hydrogen Divide

Hydrogen’s potential as an aviation fuel is undisputed: its energy density far surpasses conventional jet fuel, and it burns without producing carbon dioxide. However, its practical adoption is hampered by formidable engineering challenges. Storing hydrogen safely requires cooling it to a staggering –487.4°F (–253°C), and traditional techniques rely on heavy, separate systems to manage fuel storage and thermal regulation. This dichotomy has long been the Achilles’ heel for hydrogen’s role in aviation.

The FAMU-FSU team has taken a holistic approach by designing an integrated system that uses hydrogen not only as fuel but as a built-in cooling agent. This synergy is a paradigm shift—eliminating the need for bulky additional equipment while solving multiple technical hurdles simultaneously.

The Heart of the Innovation: Technical Advances Unpacked

A Leap in Gravimetric Efficiency

One of the most impressive breakthroughs achieved is the development of a system with a gravimetric index of 0.62. In simple terms, 62% of the total weight of the storage system is usable hydrogen—not the heavy, cumbersome structure typical of conventional designs. This dramatic improvement means that every kilogram saved on structure is another kilogram available to power the future of flight.

Pump-Free, Pressure-Regulated Delivery

Mechanical pumps, indispensable in many fuel systems, become liabilities under cryogenic conditions. They add both weight and potential failure points. Addressing this, the FAMU-FSU engineers have devised a pump-free delivery mechanism. By regulating tank pressure through dynamically controlled feedback loops, the system adjusts fuel flow in real time. High-pressure injections boost flow when needed, while venting excess vapor fine-tunes the balance. This elegant solution minimizes moving parts, enhances reliability, and optimizes the delivery of hydrogen under the severe conditions of flight.

Integrated Thermal Management: Dual-Purpose Design

Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the system lies in its use of hydrogen for thermal management. By channeling the ultra-cold liquid hydrogen through a series of strategically placed heat exchangers, the system performs a dual function. First, it cools critical high-performance components—such as superconducting generators, motors, and power electronics. In doing so, it extracts waste heat and, simultaneously, preheats the hydrogen to optimal operating temperatures for fuel cells and turbines. This staged thermal integration not only streamlines system architecture but also directly contributes to overall energy efficiency, setting the stage for truly sustainable aviation.

Meeting the Demands of Modern Flight

Simulation studies underscore the system’s robust performance. With hydrogen delivery rates reaching 0.25 kilograms per second, it can supply up to 16.2 megawatts of electrical power—precisely what is required during the high-demand phases of takeoff or emergency maneuvers. The focus on system-level optimization, including the precise management of vent pressures and heat exchanger dimensions, ensures that the design is primed for commercial aviation use.

Toward Commercialization and Beyond

While detailed simulations mark a significant step forward, the journey from concept to widespread adoption continues. The next phase involves building a prototype system for experimental validation—a critical milestone under NASA’s Integrated Zero Emission Aviation program. This initiative, which brings together leading institutions nationwide, is instrumental in driving research that translates into operational, zero-emission aircraft.

Beyond aviation, the principles underlying this hydrogen storage system have far-reaching implications. The integrated approach to fuel storage and thermal management could transform storage solutions in other high-demand sectors, laying the groundwork for a broader hydrogen economy.

Redefining the Future of Flight

The work at FAMU-FSU sets a new industry benchmark. It challenges long-held assumptions about the limits of hydrogen as an aviation fuel and provides a realistic pathway for integrating hydrogen’s inherent advantages with the demanding thermal and power control requirements of modern aircraft. For industry leaders and policymakers alike, this research is not only a signal that zero-emission aviation is achievable—it’s a blueprint for how to get there.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250602-132159-8ec-From%20left%2C%20graduate%20student%20Parmit%20Singh%20Virdi%20and%20Professor%20Wei%20Guo%20work%20on%20a%20custom-built%20test%20facility%20used%20to%20measure%20the%20heat%20transfer%20coefficients%20of%20cryogenic%20working%20fluids%20in%20the%20National.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 18:56:33.207405

Project leaders from KBR, Pittsburgh International Airport and Avina acknowledged the global support and potential impact the project would have.
“Pittsburgh International Airport has long been committed to resiliency and driving innovation in the aviation and energy industries,” Cassotis said.","Pittsburgh International Airport and Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel are partnering to develop the first on-airport sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility utilizing one of the very first alcohol-to-jet pathways in the U.S.

Avina said it will build a state-of-the-art facility to provide ASTM certified fuel on airport property just south of PIT’s terminal by deploying KBR’s innovative PureSAF alcohol-to-jet technology, developed and owned by Swedish Biofuels AB and exclusively licensed globally by KBR.

This facility will be a gamechanger in the infrastructure and economic development for the Pittsburgh region and will present a unique opportunity for airline partners to secure SAF readily and cost-effectively to meet their ambitious decarbonization targets. This development supports PIT’s unrelenting commitment to resiliency and energy innovation initiatives for the aviation industry.

The facility, through multiple phases of development, is expected to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually to meet local and regional commercial and cargo needs at PIT and beyond. Avina’s SAF facility will provide the opportunity for hundreds of full-time jobs, when constructed. The plant will have a carbon intensity that is at least 65 percent lower than that of conventional jet fuel, according to Avina’s May 29 press release.

Support from Global Aviation Leaders

The project has earned support from international aviation leaders.

“In pursuit of responsible and resilient growth in aerospace, Boeing supports the development of advanced, synthetic fuels here in the U.S. to power air travel into the future,” said Mike Caston, Director, Americas Partnerships and Policy, Boeing.

Project leaders from KBR, Pittsburgh International Airport and Avina acknowledged the global support and potential impact the project would have.

“KBR is proud to support the Pittsburgh International Airport team and enable it to be one of the first airports globally to provide SAF to its customers by producing it onsite at the airport,” said Hari Ravindran, KBR’s Global SVP for Technology said. “PureSAF (alcohol-to-jet) Technology, is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100 percent drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel. This project is a real example of how innovation and strong business relationships are delivering tangible benefits to the aviation industry.”

“This unique partnership with Avina and KBR will result in on-site SAF production and fills a growing need for our airline partners and the industry overall,” said Christina Cassotis, CEO of Pittsburgh International Airport. “With abundant natural resources, robust energy infrastructure, and available fuel storage, PIT is uniquely positioned to meet these goals and serve the growing demands for SAF.”

Vishal Shah, Founder and CEO of Avina said, “Avina is excited to support the vision of Pittsburgh International Airport and bring a SAF production facility to their doorstep. We are committed to bringing hundreds of jobs to the community and expanding the energy production ecosystem. With Pittsburgh’s commercial and cargo demand along with the network to connect to the other regional hubs, we aim to set the platform for such developments nationally and globally.”

Latest Addition to PIT’s Energy Resiliency and Innovation

The announcement adds to the airport’s energy portfolio, which includes a first-in-the-world microgrid launched in 2021.

Power outages that shut down London Heathrow Airport and airports in Spain and Portugal earlier this year highlighted the significance of PIT’s award-winning microgrid, a blueprint for airport resiliency around the world.

Thanks to the microgrid, PIT is the first to completely generate its own power using natural gas and solar energy – and, in addition to boosting resiliency, has saved the airport more than $1 million per year in electricity costs.

In addition, the airport announced a project in April to more than double the 10,000 solar panels that already exist on airport property.

Unlike rival Heart Aerospace, which is developing the ES-30 hybrid-electric 30-seat airliner, Deutsche Aircraft has opted for conventional propulsion provided by off-the-shelf PW127XT-S powerplants, similar to those on the ATR 42-600.
Although Deutsche Aircraft has not announced firm orders for the D328eco, Neumann says the company is talking to around 60 potential customers and has “lots of” letters of intent or LOIs.
Founded in Friedrichshafen in 1914 by Claude Dornier, the original Dornier company set up its Oberpfaffenhofen factory in the 1930s and became one of the biggest names in German aviation.
Neither will Deutsche Aircraft be rushing to join the electric or disruptive propulsion bandwagon.","Excitement and pride were in plentiful supply on 28 May as politicians, dignitaries, and suppliers joined Deutsche Aircraft management and staff in an Oberpfaffenhofen hangar to hail the roll-out of the D328eco as the first all-German commercial aircraft in a generation to enter production. “German aviation is back home,” enthused the company’s co-chief executive Nico Neumann as employees embraced amid the applause.

Airbus – which assembles airliners in Hamburg, fighters in Manching, and helicopters in Donauworth – and the likes of military trainer specialist Grob might take issue with Deutsche Aircraft’s suggestion that it is single-handedly revitalizing the domestic aircraft manufacturing sector. However, the business’s pledge to bring back to life a type introduced almost 35 years ago and become only the second player after ATR in the 40-seat turboprop market is certainly significant.

Sierra Nevada-owned Deutsche Aircraft admits the D328eco – which it hopes to fly later this year with an entry into service target of quarter four 2027 – is not a clean-sheet design. Rather, it is an “advanced evolution” of the original Dornier 328 with the latest version of Pratt & Whitney Canada’s PW100-series engine, new Garmin avionics, redesigned landing gear, and a fuselage stretched by 2.1m (6.9ft) to accommodate 40 seats instead of its predecessor’s 32.

Some might even say the “eco” designation is also a bit of a misnomer. Unlike rival Heart Aerospace, which is developing the ES-30 hybrid-electric 30-seat airliner, Deutsche Aircraft has opted for conventional propulsion provided by off-the-shelf PW127XT-S powerplants, similar to those on the ATR 42-600. The company also makes great play of the D328eco being “100% SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] compatible”, but that hardly makes it unique. Most modern engines are, in theory.

However, the biggest challenge facing Deutsche Aircraft – which succeeded 328 Support Services, the company that took over the type certificate and design rights to the original Dornier 328 turboprop and its 328JET sibling and was subsequently acquired by Sierra Nevada in 2015 – will be breathing new life into a moribund market for sub-50-seat passenger aircraft.

Sales of the ATR 42 are massively outpaced by those of the larger ATR 72. In fact, last year, of 56 ATRs ordered, only five were for the smaller variant. The only other Western company in the segment, De Havilland Canada, which owns the out-of-production DHC-8 series of regional turboprops, has shown little appetite to return to manufacturing.

So, what makes Neumann confident that Deutsche Aircraft can deliver in the sort of numbers that will justify its investment in a new production plant at Leipzig airport capable of building 48 aircraft a year, which will be ready to begin production in early 2026, and a supply chain that includes a rear fuselage assembly line at Dynamatic Technologies in Bengaluru, India? “Quite simply, the market loves this product,” he says.

Although Deutsche Aircraft has not announced firm orders for the D328eco, Neumann says the company is talking to around 60 potential customers and has “lots of” letters of intent or LOIs. On top of a “replacement market” for ageing small regional aircraft – including 150 legacy 328 turboprops and jets still in service – there are “classic growth markets” in India and the rest of Asia, where demand for regional air services is growing exponentially, he asserts.

He refutes the suggestion that most new airlines in emerging markets want to start large – eschewing 40-seat regional turboprops for bigger regional jets or even Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies. Many existing carriers offering essential connectivity services around the world have “had the chance to go big and haven’t”, he suggests. He cites Norway, Australia, and the north of Canada as being among the territories where there is the largest need to replace ageing fleets.

While Neumann makes much of the “Dornier DNA” behind the D328eco, Deutsche Aircraft decided not to build the aircraft in the erstwhile brand’s spiritual home of Bavaria, where Dornier made its name and the original 328 was assembled. Instead, it chose Saxony in eastern Germany where wages and living costs are lower. Leipzig, says Neumann, is also “well connected” by transport links and, as a DHL hub, is one of the centres of the European air freight industry.

Construction of the new facility began a few weeks ago, and Deutsche Aircraft aims to have it ready before the end of the year, when it will begin installing jigs and assembly lines. Neumann expects output in the first full year to be around 12 aircraft, rising into the 20s in the second or third and eventually into the forties, although he is reluctant to set out a precise ramp-up timetable.

The aircraft unveiled at Oberpfaffenhofen – test aircraft or TAC 1 - was lacking engines. Its PW127XTs are poised at P&WC’s facility at Longueuil near Montreal but shipping them over for a roll-out ceremony months before they are required would be “sending the wrong signal” to staff at a time when the business needs to preserve cash, says Neumann.

TAC 1’s fuselage is constructed from two separate legacy 328 structures – the nose and empennage from one and centre section from the other – to achieve a stretch without plugs. TAC 2 will join it in flight testing next year, chiefly to evaluate aircraft systems, while a third test platform, with final cabin configuration, will be the first example assembled in Leipzig.

Following its appearance at last year’s Farnborough event, Deutsche Aircraft will be at the Paris air show with a mock-up of the D328eco on display in its chalet. The company is one of at least three spin-offs from the original Dornier – others are Dornier Seawings, developer of the Seastar CD2 amphibian, which has offices next to Deutsche Aircraft in Oberpfaffenhofen, and General Atomics AeroTec Systems, an offshoot of the US defence giant, which is behind the NXT variant of the original Dornier 228 turboprop.

Founded in Friedrichshafen in 1914 by Claude Dornier, the original Dornier company set up its Oberpfaffenhofen factory in the 1930s and became one of the biggest names in German aviation. In the mid-1990s, the business was taken over by US firm Fairchild, becoming Fairchild Dornier and continuing production of the 328, which entered service in 1993, as well as developing a 70-seat regional jet called the 728JET. However, the costs of the latter programme proved too much and Fairchild Dornier collapsed in 2002, days after rolling out the prototype.

A short-lived venture, AvCraft, acquired the rights to the 328 and planned to restart production of the jet, but itself went bankrupt three years later. 328 Support Services took over the entire 328 programme in 2006 – with the aim of providing maintenance, repair, and overhaul services to operators of the existing fleet. Nine years later, 328 Support Services was itself taken over by Sierra Nevada, which in turn renamed it Deutsche Aircraft with plans to resume production of the turboprop.

However, the 328JET will not be resurrected. “There is no market in a sustainable aviation world for a [regional] jet,” says Neumann. Neither will Deutsche Aircraft be rushing to join the electric or disruptive propulsion bandwagon. “Maybe down the line we could look at a hybrid or even hydrogen in 15 years, but our priority is establishing the D328eco,” he says.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/4/9/110249_tac1_706811.jpg,N,,2025-06-02 15:57:08.913708

Singh highlighted the state’s strategic advantages as a potential hub for SAF production, citing proposed incentives, streamlined facilitation processes, and robust logistics infrastructure. He emphasized that the policy aims not only to attract investment but also to create significant benefits for the agricultural community in the state.

The SAF sector’s reliance on biomass and grain-based feedstock—such as sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, wheat straw, and surplus grains—could open new revenue streams for farmers, Singh said. By sourcing raw materials locally, the initiative is expected to boost rural incomes and offer better price realisation for agricultural produce.

“This initiative not only strengthens our commitment to green energy but also ensures that farmers become direct beneficiaries, enhancing their earnings while contributing to a more sustainable future,” Singh stated.

A detailed presentation by Invest UP outlined the state’s vision for SAF and was followed by a discussion session with key industry stakeholders. Topics such as land availability, policy framework, and ease of doing business were addressed during the interaction.

The event drew strong interest from investors, with over 18 companies expressing a willingness to set up SAF manufacturing units in the state. These firms collectively proposed investment intents exceeding ₹3,000 crore.

Singh also underscored Uttar Pradesh’s unparalleled connectivity, pointing to its extensive air, rail, and road network, including five international airports, which offers seamless logistics and market access for potential investors.

However, this increased output will still only account for a mere 0.7 percent of the fuel used by airlines.

IATA, a key industry organization, has consistently cautioned that airlines face significant hurdles in achieving their environmental sustainability targets. It has previously described the rate of SAF production as disappointingly slow, noting that this greener fuel is also more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, acknowledged the positive news of increased production but highlighted the financial implications. He stated that even this relatively small amount of SAF will add an estimated $4.4 billion to the global aviation industry’s fuel expenses.

“The pace of progress in boosting production and finding ways to make it cheaper must get faster,” Walsh urged in a statement.

In 2021, the broader aviation industry committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This ambitious goal largely depends on a gradual shift towards SAF, which is manufactured from waste oils and biomass.

Airlines are currently facing disagreements with energy companies over the limited availability of SAF.

This archetypal deal illustrates what credible transition finance could look like.
The nascent transition finance market often lacks consensus on assessing additionality.
Without a transition plan to contextualize it, this type of UOP, asset-level financing would risk being just a “transition-compatible” BAU activity rather than an example of transition finance.
First, a transition plan contextualizes measures like energy efficiency upgrades relative to other decarbonization levers like SAF.","Banks can highlight to clients why granular, entity-level transition planning enables corporations to credibly finance low-hanging fruit like energy efficiency. For high-emitting corporations, near-term, decarbonization actions like energy efficiency are important to their net-zero journey despite being activities they might do regardless of climate goals (e.g., airlines buying fuel-efficient aircraft). These activities are usually necessary but insufficient to reach net -zero and shouldn’t inhibit/replace more difficult, transformative changes to capital stock in the medium -term. Transition plans can address this nuance by contextualizing near-term versus medium-term actions to protect against greenwashing.

Disclaimer: This hypothetical case study is based on several real-world transactions and conversations with aviation and sustainability bankers. This archetypal deal illustrates what credible transition finance could look like.

The nascent transition finance market often lacks consensus on assessing additionality. For example, whether and how to reward companies for conducting practices that could contribute to climate targets but also be business as usual (BAU), such as investing in energy efficiency.

Airlines routinely replace old aircraft with new ones and, generally, each new generation of aircraft is more energy efficient than the last. Airlines prioritized energy efficiency long before they set climate targets because efficiency improvements pay for themselves via lower fuel expenses (fuel costs can be 30%-40% of operating expenditure). Today, therefore, it could be unclear whether acquisition financing for new aircraft can be labeled as transition finance or whether this activity should be seen as BAU.

Simply replacing old aircraft with more efficient new models is necessary but insufficient to achieving net -zero; quickly modernizing fleets is one part of a comprehensive aviation transition plan that also includes switching to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), mitigating contrails, and electrifying airport infrastructure in the medium- to long-term.

Additionally, rather than buying new, highly efficient aircraft, an airline may use bank financing to replace old/inefficient aircraft with used, slightly less inefficient aircraft because they are cheap and available. On the surface, it may look like the airline has improved its fleet’s overall efficiency, but deeper analysis would show the marginal improvement isn’t enough to align with sector decarbonization pathways. Transition-labeled UOP acquisition financing for a purchase like this could result in greenwashing accusations for lenders.

In this archetypal case, the banks determined that replacing an old aircraft with the new Boeing 787-8 supported the client’s broader transition plan by helping keep the airline’s emissions trajectory inside a 1.5°C pathway. The banking syndicate could finance the purchase via a transition-linked loan tied to the airline’s overall Scope 1 GHG emissions decreasing ~20% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline, in line with aviation sector transition pathways.

Without a transition plan to contextualize it, this type of UOP, asset-level financing would risk being just a “transition-compatible” BAU activity rather than an example of transition finance. Good corporate transition planning can give private and public lenders high quality data on which to base financial offerings — especially for high capex, higher risk parts of the client’s transition. A good transition plan helps banks credibly disburse asset-level loans — and potentially also much larger general corporate purpose debt packages — in two main ways.

First, a transition plan contextualizes measures like energy efficiency upgrades relative to other decarbonization levers like SAF. Fuel efficiency comprises up to 45% of aviation sector emissions reductions (see infographic below), according to Mission Possible Partnership. In this archetypal case, a robust transition plan would quantify the (important but limited) role that this type of $100 million energy efficiency deal played in the airline’s net-zero transition relative to investments in SAF. Banks could do this energy-efficiency deal knowing that the client also plans to invest the appropriate amount in SAF.

Second, a transition plan would provide granularity on the airline’s energy efficiency strategy, including the annual aircraft replacement rate needed to modernize the airline’s fleet in line with transition pathways. A robust plan would define what efficiency thresholds new aircraft need to meet to be considered “additional” beyond BAU. The Boeing 787, for example, is widely accepted as a leading example of an energy- efficient aircraft. Energy efficiency in aviation can entail near-term, low-hanging fruit (e.g., carbon fiber instead of metal alloys in planes’ wings) as well as more radical, medium-term changes (e.g., replacing traditional propulsion systems with novel propulsion systems like hydrogen fuel cells and batteries).

Restarting ethanol production is projected to bring economic benefits to Luverne and surrounding communities by supporting local agriculture and boosting the regional economy.","Gevo Inc. has signed a definitive agreement to sell its wholly owned subsidiary, Agri-Energy LLC, to Minnesota-based A.E. Innovation LLC for $7 million. The transaction includes the 18-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility located in Luverne, Minnesota. The sale marks a significant step in Gevo’s ongoing strategic repositioning, as it focuses on renewable fuels and sustainable chemicals.

As part of the agreement, Gevo will retain select isobutanol-related assets and a portion of the undeveloped land at the Luverne site. These retained assets could support future production of up to 1 million gallons annually of isobutanol, which may be sold as a specialty chemical or converted into renewable fuels such as isooctane and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Ethanol production at the Luverne facility has been idled since 2022. A.E. Innovation, an agriculture-driven investment group, intends to restart operations and repurpose the site into a hub for scaling new technologies in the biofuel and renewable chemicals sectors.

“We’re seeing rapid innovation in bio-based fuels and chemicals, and Agri-Energy has a strong track record of being on the leading edge,” said Dave Kolsrud, principal of A.E. Innovation. “Luverne, with its low-carbon corn, wind power, and community spirit, is the right place to advance the next generation of biofuel technologies.”

The Luverne facility has played a key role in demonstrating regenerative agriculture practices in collaboration with local farmers. It has also served as an educational platform showcasing the versatility of corn and the potential of biofuels, including ethanol, SAF, and isobutanol.

Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber expressed optimism about the partnership with A.E. Innovation. “We see tremendous opportunities for growth and collaboration,” Gruber said. “Luverne and its farming community are ideal for building forward-thinking, sustainable solutions based on carbohydrate-derived energy and chemicals.”

Under the terms of the deal, Gevo will receive $2 million at closing, with an additional $5 million to follow under the purchase agreement. The transaction is also expected to generate about $3 million in annual savings by eliminating current facility idling costs. Gevo anticipates potential synergies from operating isobutanol production alongside renewed ethanol output.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2025, pending A.E. Innovation’s financing and standard closing conditions. Restarting ethanol production is projected to bring economic benefits to Luverne and surrounding communities by supporting local agriculture and boosting the regional economy.

In 2025, the global average cost for SAF is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel.
This extra cost is largely the result of SAF ‘compliance fees’ being levied by European fuel suppliers to hedge their potential costs as a result of European SAF mandates to include 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply.
“The behaviour of fuel suppliers in fulfilling the SAF mandates is an outrage.
Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers,” said Walsh.","Willie Walsh, Director of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has hit out at fuel suppliers for “profiteering” by levying “compliance fees” as the European and UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates came into force.

SAF production is projected to double to two million tonnes (approximately two and a half billion litres) in 2025, which would meet around 0.7% of global airline fuel demand, IATA has calculated.

However, Walsh warned that this progress, while encouraging, is insufficient and comes at a significant cost. “Even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill,” he said. “The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

IATA expressed significant concerns regarding the implementation of SAF mandates, particularly in Europe, where EU and UK regulations came into force on January 1, 2025.

IATA estimates that the average cost of SAF in 2024 was 3.1 times that of jet fuel, for a total additional cost of $1.6 billion. In 2025, the global average cost for SAF is expected to be 4.2 times that of jet fuel. This extra cost is largely the result of SAF ‘compliance fees’ being levied by European fuel suppliers to hedge their potential costs as a result of European SAF mandates to include 2% SAF in the jet fuel supply.

“The behaviour of fuel suppliers in fulfilling the SAF mandates is an outrage. The cost of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is estimated to be an enormous $4.7 trillion. Fuel suppliers must stop profiteering on the limited SAF supplies available and ramp up production to meet the legitimate needs of their customers,” said Walsh.

The carriers hope to launch the partnership early next year, with interline flight sales beginning late this year.

Executives of the two carriers met to discuss the potential tie-up at the IATA Annual General meeting here.

The partnership, should it come to fruition, would be the second for Southwest since it began searching for airline partners as part of an ongoing commercial transformation. Southwest began interlining with Icelandair in February.

Other key elements of the transformation include Southwest's recent imposition of bag fees as well as ongoing aircraft retrofits that will enable the airline to introduce an extra-legroom product and do assigned seating.

The global aviation industry earned a total profit of 36 billion dollars in 2024, translating to a modest margin of just 3.7%, according to senior economist and Vice President Thomsen, who addressed presspersons on Monday. She described aviation as a “capital-intensive and complex endeavour,” heavily reliant on passenger revenue, which accounts for over 70% of the sector’s earnings.

Speaking about rising operational costs, Thomsen noted that fuel alone makes up 26% of the industry’s total expenditure. “In 2025, every passenger flying contributed an average of 7.2 billion dollars in earnings to the aviation sector. In contrast, a passenger in the Middle East brought in 27.2 billion dollars, while in Africa it was just 1.3 billion dollars,” she said, attributing the Middle East’s high figure to significant investments in infrastructure.

Thomsen suggested that airlines could explore alternatives like manufacturing their own fuel internally, particularly Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), to ease dependency and reduce long-term fuel costs.

Supply chain disruptions remain a major challenge, she pointed out. “The industry is severely impacted by delays, especially when it comes to the delivery of regional jets and turbojets,” she said, adding that long waiting periods for aircraft are impeding fleet expansions and operations.

On the question of airfares, Thomsen remarked that fares have been on a consistent downward trend since the industry's early years. “This decline is likely to continue, thanks in part to the reduction in fuel costs,” she said.",https://media.assettype.com/newindianexpress%2F2025-06-02%2Fih6efk09%2F1000449348.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-06-02 12:56:54.152103

The funding will bolster SkyNRG’s first SAF production facility, which will be built in Delfzijl, Netherlands and is expected to become operational in 2028 with a planned annual capacity of approximately 120,000t.

In 2019, Shell Aviation announced its support to SkyNRG for the development of its SAF production facility in Delfzijl.

The Delfzijl plant will process low-quality oils and fats that would otherwise be burned, while avoiding mainstream waste cooking oils and virgin vegetable oils.

Other projects in SkyNRG’s pipeline will utilise different technologies such as eSAF, a synthetic aviation fuel made from renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and captured carbon dioxide.

The deal’s completion is contingent upon receiving regulatory approvals and is anticipated to occur in the latter half of 2025.

The aviation sector is claimed to account for roughly 2.5% of global annual CO2 emissions.

SAF offers a minimum emissions reduction of 80% compared to fossil jet fuel over its lifecycle, according to the company.

APG infrastructure associate director Jan Jacob van Wulfften Palthe said: “As the transition to net zero accelerates, SAF offers a viable pathway towards decarbonising the sector.

“It utilises renewable feedstocks and can be blended with or replace fossil jet fuel. SAF’s key advantage is its “drop-in” compatibility, integrating seamlessly into existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure without modifications, unlike hydrogen or battery-electric alternatives that require extensive redesigns.”

Founded in 2009 and based in Amsterdam, SkyNRG has supplied SAF to more than 30 airlines across six continents and is claimed to have facilitated the world’s first commercial SAF-powered flight in 2011.

""The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate,"" Walsh said in a statement.

The broader aviation sector agreed in 2021 to target net-zero emissions in 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to SAF, which is made from waste oil and biomass.

Airlines are at odds with energy companies over scarce supplies of SAF, while also pointing the finger at plane makers Airbus and Boeing over delays in delivering more fuel-efficient jets.

Still, that will amount to just 0.7% of aviation fuel needs in 2025, the airline trade group says.

Overall, IATA expects approximately 660 million gallons of SAF to be produced globally this year. Approximately 60% of that supply will be required for airlines in the U.K. and EU to meet SAF mandates that went into effect this year.

Under both mandates, SAF must account for 2% of fuel supply this year.

'A great green scam'

At its annual meeting here on Sunday, IATA restated its opposition to those mandates, saying that they have doubled the cost of SAF in Europe due to compliance fees charged by SAF producers and suppliers. Those extra costs are expected to amount to $1.7 billion this year, the trade group said.

IATA director general Willie Walsh called the mandate ""a great green scam"" during his opening address at the IATA AGM.

IATA has longed advocated for government incentive programs to spur SAF investment, rather than mandates. The airline group said governments subsidize fossil fuel production to the tune of $1 trillion per year and is advocating for a portion of such funds to be re-allocated to SAF.

Airlines have set goal of net-zero emissions

Airlines globally have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with 65% of the reductions to come from a ramp-up of SAF usage. IATA estimates the SAF transition will cost $4.7 trillion. Despite the enormous price tag, the trade group's chief economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, said it is achievable during a June 1 press briefing.

IATA says there is adequate SAF feedstock to meet the 2050 commitment. But it says governments aren't making the required commitments.

Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates for a 2% SAF blend kicked in on 1 January 2025, noted IATA.
The cost of SAF for airlines has now doubled in Europe, said the association, because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging.
For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion.
Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.","Ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties have brought significant unpredictability to global markets, including commercial aviation. But according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 2025 will nonetheless be a slightly better year for airlines than in 2024, albeit a touch below IATA’s previous predictions.

“The biggest positive driver is the price of jet fuel which has fallen 13% compared with 2024 and 1% below previous estimates,” IATA Director General Willie Walsh said at the IATA annual general meeting (AGM) in New Delhi, India.

“Moreover, we anticipate airlines flying more people and more cargo in 2025 than they did in 2024, even if previous demand projections have been dented by trade tensions and falls in consumer confidence.”

The result for airlines, he said, is an improvement of net margins from 3.4% in 2024 to 3.7% in 2025. “That’s still about half the average profitability across all industries. But considering the headwinds, it’s a strong result that demonstrates the resilience that airlines have worked hard to fortify.”

In 2025, total traveler numbers are expected to reach a record high 4.99 billion, representing a 4% increase on 2024, but below the previously projected 5.22 billion.

Other highlights from the air transport industry’s expected 2025 financial performance see net profits rising to $36 billion from the $32.4 billion earned in 2024, but slightly down on the previously projected $36.6 billion; and total revenues reaching a record high of $979 billion, a 1.3% increase on 2024, but below the $1 trillion previously predicted by IATA.

Air cargo volumes are expected to inch up by 0.6% year-over-year to 69 million tonnes, which is below the prior forecast of 72.5 million tonnes.

“Perspective is critical to put into context such large industry-wide aggregate figures,” said Walsh. “Earning a $36 billion profit is significant. But that equates to just $7.20 per passenger per segment. It’s still a thin buffer and any new tax, increase in airport or navigation charge, demand shock or costly regulation will quickly put the industry’s resilience to the test.

“Policymakers who rely on airlines as the core of a value chain that employs 86.5 million people and supports 3.9% of global economic activity, must keep this clearly in focus.”

Even as the price of jet fuel has fallen, the high cost of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) remains a continued pain point for airlines. Most SAF is now heading toward Europe, where the EU and UK mandates for a 2% SAF blend kicked in on 1 January 2025, noted IATA. And those blend requirements will rise in the coming years.

The cost of SAF for airlines has now doubled in Europe, said the association, because of compliance fees that SAF producers or suppliers are charging.

For the expected one million tonnes of SAF that will be purchased to meet the European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion.

Compliance fees are estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices — an amount that could have abated an additional 3.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions.

Instead of promoting the use of SAF, Europe’s SAF mandates have made SAF five times more costly than conventional jet fuel.

“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization,” said Walsh.

“Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”

To support the development of a global SAF market, IATA has worked on two initiatives: a SAF registry managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) that brings a transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in compliance with international regulations such as global offsetting scheme CORSIA and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme; and the so-called SAF Matchmaker program that will facilitate SAF procurement by matching airline requests for SAF with supply offers.

But IATA is calling for “urgent action” by governments to create more effective policies, develop a comprehensive approach to energy policy that includes SAF; and ensure the success of CORSIA “as the sole market-based mechanism” to address international aviation’s CO2 emissions.

“Good intentions will not get us to net zero,” warned Walsh in New Delhi. “Action is what we need. Fortunately, it’s not too late to pick up pace and re-align us on the path to success.”

British Airways has so far opted to pay the initial costs of SAF itself.
But Mr Counsell said: “If we can get to 20 million tonnes, the price will halve.” The Independent has contacted British Airways for comment.
In September, British Airways became the largest carbon removal purchaser in the UK after agreeing to a more than £9 million partnership with UK-based company CUR8.","British Airways may soon offer cheaper, more eco-friendly flights than competitor airlines thanks to its early investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Under parent company IAG, the airline has committed $3.5 billion (£2.6bn) in SAF investments to meet sustainability targets and lower operational costs.

SAF refers to aviation fuels that are synthetic, biofuels or recycled carbon, some produced from used cooking oil, tyres and forestry waste.

Unlike conventional fuels, the carbon dioxide generated by SAF is already part of the carbon cycle, reducing carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent over the fuel lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuel.

Jonathon Counsell, IAG sustainability head, said at a summit last week that investing in sustainable fuel early would give the group a “competitive advantage” over other airlines, reported The Times.

According to the outlet, executives from the airline conglomerate said it is currently paying less than 60 per cent of the market rate for SAF after locking in long-term contracts with suppliers early and at favourable rates.

IAG spent €7.6 billion on fuel in total in the last financial year, making it the group's largest single expense.

According to British Airways, SAF accounts for 2.7 per cent of its total fuel use today.

The airline was the first in the world to use SAF produced on a commercial scale in the UK after signing a multi-year agreement with Phillips 66.

The SAF Mandate says 2 per cent of total UK jet fuel demand should be SAF in 2025, increasing to 10 per cent in 2030 and then to 22 per cent by 2040.

However, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive to produce than traditional jet fuel.

The mandate is set to drive up flight fares as airlines face environmental surcharges and spend more on SAF over the coming years.

British Airways has so far opted to pay the initial costs of SAF itself. Seat prices to fly BA from the UK, Switzerland, and Norway could become more competitive if savings from discounted SAF contracts are passed on to passenger pricing.

Airlines that delay securing SAF are likely to face higher procurement costs that could hike costs for customers.

Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic have already added a SAF supplement to tickets to fund their sustainable fuel expenses – up to €72 (£61) per ticket and up to £24 per ticket, respectively.

The IAG group plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Mr Counsell told the Latin American Travel Association Expo 2025: “We’re going to be using liquid fuel for the next 30 or 40 years.”

He added at the conference in Windsor today: “There is more than enough SAF.”

Many airlines complain about the high price of sustainable aviation fuel, and the mandate to use an increasing proportion of it. But Mr Counsell said: “If we can get to 20 million tonnes, the price will halve.”

The Independent has contacted British Airways for comment.

In September, British Airways became the largest carbon removal purchaser in the UK after agreeing to a more than £9 million partnership with UK-based company CUR8.

The airline said that roughly one-third of its emissions reductions will come from carbon removals – the process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it – by 2050.","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/02/7/08/iStock-531320870.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,91&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-06-02 10:56:43.144576

Through a pioneering project called GRIM-SAF (GRound-Based and Inflight Measurements), experts are investigating how sustainable aviation fuel could reduce aircraft emissions of soot and volatile particles, and a range of gases including nitrogen oxides, often referred to as the non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

Led by scientists from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, academics from Manchester Met are working with a group of universities, research centres and aerospace companies to understand how different aviation fuels change the emissions and therefore the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

In a UK-first experiment held at RAF Brize Norton, two aircraft flew in formation – with one trailing the other to sample its emissions – to compare the pollutants produced by sustainable aviation fuel and traditional jet fuel.

Previous in-flight emissions work in the UK has involved following several miles behind other aircraft whereas the aircraft involved in GRIM-SAF were able to get within 60 metres of each other.

Both aircraft also landed at RAF Brize Norton to make detailed ground-based measurements with the goal of linking this to the in-flight work.

Dr Simon Christie, Research Fellow at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: “The chase experiment marks a significant milestone in our research as we now have a real-life scenario through which to analyse the environmental impacts of sustainable aviation fuel against traditional jet fuel.

“We look forward to continuing to work with our partners to shape global measures to mitigate aviation’s climate change effects.”

These non-CO2 effects include the emission of soot and other substances, such as lubrication oil vented from aircraft engines, that can cause contrails to form.

Contrails are long, thin clouds made of ice crystals, which form when water vapour condenses on the tiny particles emitted by aircraft engines. Contrails sometimes spread out over large areas and can affect the Earth’s climate in the same way as naturally-formed cirrus clouds.

Emissions from aircraft aren’t just limited to the skies; ultrafine particles have been detected many kilometres downwind of airports at ground level, especially major airports that see heavy air traffic.

Dr Paul Williams, from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of Manchester, said: “Although this type of experiment, with one aircraft following another in formation, is very useful for scientists to get an understanding of the emissions produced by burning different types of fuels, it is environmentally costly.

“GRIM-SAF aims to understand the emissions on the ground, and correlate these to emissions at altitude so future experiments don’t rely on chasing aircraft with other aircraft.”

GRIM-SAF aims to give scientists a better understanding of gaseous and particulate emissions from aircraft.

In addition to the chase experiments, the team used a specialist sampling probe - a facility unique to Manchester Met - to monitor the non-CO2 emissions from the aircraft on the ground to correlate future ground-based measurements with in-flight predictions.

The progress of the GRIM-SAF project follows Manchester Met’s announcement earlier this year of the £4.2 million PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) project, which brings together partners from four European countries to look at ways to minimise the climate impact of non-carbon dioxide emissions.",https://www.mmu.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph_image/public/2025-06/IMAGE.jpg?h=8869a3dd&itok=xc-wOj2w,N,,2025-06-02 11:56:41.652072
