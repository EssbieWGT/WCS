Budapest Airport

Chris Dinsdale has worked at Budapest Airport since 2015, originally as CFO until March 2021, where he was nominated for the position as CEO. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dinsdale, as CFO of the airport at the time, fought relentlessly to make sure that the company survived the crisis and worked with great commitment to secure the funding of the airport. For example, a voluntary salary cut for the executives and the founding of the Budapest Airport Foundation, which supports blue collar workers who lost their job during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After being nominated to CEO position in March 2021, Dinsdale continues to work closely with the executive team to create a clear COVID-19 recovery strategy for Budapest Airport. This will also mean that we come out stronger of the pandemic and have a clear focus. Dinsdale is an inspiring true leader who helped us all to cope with the very difficult times of the pandemic and I am convinced that he truly deserves this award.

CEO

Swedavia Airports

Jonas Abrahamsson has shown the strength to steer the company towards its long-term sustainable goals, despite the challenges of COVID-19. Abrahamsson has ensured that Swedavia achieved its net zero target for all ten of the airports in 2020 and has continued to support strategic development and innovation to further the cause of sustainable air travel. During 2020, when passenger numbers where down over 90 per cent and a lot of investments were paused, he decided that investments in the company’s net zero target should proceed, allowing Swedavia to become the first net zero airport group by the end of 2020.

Airport General Manager

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport

Balram Bheodari leads Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as North America’s most efficient airport, due to his vast knowledge of and astute attention to efficiency in aviation, which has allowed the airport to thrive in the most difficult of markets. Bheodari combines operational expertise, integrity, and selflessness to provide a quality of leadership throughout Atlanta Airport. He oversees all facets of airport governance, including operations and a multi-billion-dollar capital improvement programme, ATLNext, designed to pave the way for Atlanta’s growth over the next 20 years. During COVID-19, Bheodari developed a comprehensive resumption of operations playbook that served to support ATL’s recovery efforts. With guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid evolving health and safety guidelines, Bheodari steadfastly encouraged collaboration among stakeholders, team-building among aviation employees, and adaptability in uncertain times. Throughout the pandemic, he participated in daily calls with Airports Council International and other large-hub airports to share best practices as well as information from Washington, D.C. federal offices and the CDC.

He aimed to restore customer confidence and ensure the airport was a healthy facility using COVID-19 safe protocols. Since, the airport achieved Airport of the Year by the Airport Minority Advisory Council (AMAC).

During the height of the pandemic, Bheodari was the most ardent supporter of our mission-critical employees. Having worked his way up through the ranks, he fully appreciates the oftentimes thankless jobs these employees perform that keep the Airport safe and running optimally at all times. Morale never flagged because Bheodari made sure those employees felt valued through hazard pay, special meals, social media posts, intranet spotlight features, and other incentives.

His actions and his directives all reflect his commitment to the three key focus areas of our organisation’s strategic plan: people, purpose and performance.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

However, the championship's emissions rose by 11% compared to Season 9.

This rise, the report says, was primarily due to the transition from secondary assumptions to primary data for the business travel of each team in the championship.

Jeff Dodds, CEO of Formula E, says: “Season 10 proved once again that elite sport and sustainability are not mutually exclusive – they are mutually reinforcing.

“From using sustainable aviation fuel across continents to leaving lasting legacies in host cities through our Better Futures Fund, our purpose is clearer than ever: to accelerate sustainable human progress through the power of electric racing.

“While many treat sustainability as a destination or make commitments without true action, our strategy is to always go further, be more ambitious and continually uncover new ways of being innovative and impactful.”

The logistics of racing around the world

Formula E improved its logistics in Season 10, supported by a new global hub in Valencia, Spain, which replaced its previous logistics base at Donington Park in the UK.

The new hub’s proximity to a major port allowed Formula E to optimise its freight routes and increase its use of sustainable sea freight.

It also partnered with DHL to prioritise the use of ships powered by sustainable biofuels.

Formula E successfully completed its logistics transition by the start of Season 11 despite challenges including an unexpected flood in Valencia in October 2024.

The championship also successfully used sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to transport freight between Berlin and Shanghai using DHL’s GoGreen Plus service.

This service uses a book and claim system, with SAF used by air carriers and the emission reductions allocated to shippers as certificates.

Paul Fowler, Vice President Motorsports at DHL, says: “Our collaboration with Formula E shows what’s possible when logistics and sport work together.

“By partnering closely and rethinking freight strategies, we’ve identified practical ways to reduce emissions – optimising routes and shifting to sea and road transport –while ensuring the championship runs smoothly.""

Formula E’s benchmarks and certifications

For a second consecutive year, Formula E was awarded first position in the Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sport with a best-ever score of 85%.

It reaffirmed its environmental credentials, aligning with standards including ISO 20121, ISO 14064 and the IWA 42 framework for climate governance and emissions transparency.

Formula E also became the first sport to receive BSI’s Net Zero Pathway certification.

The Pathway provides independent assurance across an organisation's carbon inventory, targets and management controls to help ensure net zero goals are realistic and achievable.

“Sport has the opportunity to play a leading role in our transition to a sustainable world,"" explains Matt Page, Senior Vice President, Assurance Services EMEA at BSI.

“This achievement reflects a deep, long-term commitment to credible climate action and demonstrates what is possible when ambition is matched with transparency and robust governance.”

LanzaTech CEO Jennifer Holmgren said the proposed project aims to convert waste industrial gases in Oman into valuable ethanol, which can then be refined into sustainable aviation fuel - enabling aircraft to fly on recycled carbon instead of fossil fuels.

“I recently had the privilege of signing a landmark agreement that sets a bold new course for aviation and climate action in Oman,” Holmgren said. “Oman is fast becoming a leader in the circular carbon economy - showing how industrial expertise and forward-thinking policies can turn waste carbon into valuable products. In the GCC, countries like Oman and Saudi Arabia are paving the way for a future where carbon is recycled and reused, unlocking new possibilities to make circular carbon a reality,” she stated in a post.

Stage 1 is currently underway, with LanzaTech and the IFC conducting a joint feasibility study that includes detailed assessments of feedstock and product markets, CAPEX projections, and financial modelling - all aimed at defining a clear route to FID and project execution.

Illinois-based LanzaTech’s technology will be central to producing SAF in Oman. Its biorecycling process captures carbon-rich gases directly from energy-intensive industrial sites, preventing their release into the atmosphere. The recovered carbon is then converted into sustainable alternatives to fossil-derived materials, with applications ranging from detergents and textile fibres to packaging and transportation fuels.

At present, around six commercial plants worldwide are operating based on LanzaTech’s platform. The company says it is building a strong new value chain - recycling carbon into ethanol and then into SAF - and believes Oman has the right conditions to emerge as a regional and potentially global hub for circular carbon solutions.

According to Holmgren, the SAF project will have a “real measurable impact” for Oman. “Projects like this have the potential to produce 80,000 tonnes of SAF annually, advancing Oman Vision 2040, creating jobs, and supporting economic diversification,” she noted.

“SAF is expected to deliver over 60% of aviation’s CO₂ reductions by 2050. If just 15–20 more plants of this scale are built globally, we could see more than 1.5 million tonnes of sustainable fuel produced each year — 50% more than last year’s global SAF output. That’s the transformative scale the world needs,” the CEO remarked.

Oman’s abundant access to diverse carbon-rich feedstocks, coupled with world-class industrial infrastructure, positions the country ideally to pioneer circular carbon solutions. This initiative, the company added, reinforces Oman’s role as a regional trailblazer in carbon circularity.

Underscoring the significance of the proposed project for Oman, IFC commented: “The project is in line with the Oman Vision 2040 agenda for sustainable manufacturing, economic diversification, and job creation — an essential pillar of the World Bank Group’s mission in the country. This collaboration reflects IFC’s continued expansion in Oman following landmark agreements announced during the World Bank Group Day last year.”",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/12/11/thumbs/600x600/3220418.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 12:56:40.879370

According to Iata, African carriers continue to face the highest operating costs in the world, with average cost per available tonne-kilometre, nearly double the global average.
Supply chain issues are slowing fleet renewals, pushing the average global aircraft age above 15 years—the oldest on record.","African carriers are heading into 2026 with profitability still stuck at the lower end of the global industry spectrum, as structural pressures that have long constrained the continent’s aviation sector show little sign of easing.

The latest financial outlook from the International Air Transport Association (Iata), released on December 9, projects another year of modest gains for African airlines despite stronger traffic growth than the global average.

The outlook, released on the sidelines of Iata Global Media Day in Geneva, highlights a widening performance gap between Africa and the rest of the world, driven by entrenched structural constraints – fragmented markets and policy frameworks as well as fuel that costs 20 percent more than elsewhere- that continue to weigh heavily on the continent’s aviation prospects.

Passenger traffic is projected to be well above the global average but profits remain elusive.

African airlines are expected to earn a net profit of $200 million in 2025, representing a 1.1 percent margin—the lowest of any region.

Profit per passenger is forecast at $1.40, a fraction of the global average of $7.90.

The outlook for 2026 shows little change; profits remain at $200 million, while margins slip slightly to 1 percent, with profit per passenger easing to $1.30.

Passenger traffic is projected to grow by 6 percent, outpacing the global forecast of 4.4 percent, but capacity is expected to rise by only 5.7 percent.

According to Iata, African carriers continue to face the highest operating costs in the world, with average cost per available tonne-kilometre, nearly double the global average.

A combination of high fuel prices, older fleets, fragmented markets, and taxes averaging 28 percent — the highest globally — continues to limit their resilience.

Demand is further restricted by visa challenges, restrictive bilateral agreements, and high passenger charges, keeping travel highly price-sensitive across much of the continent.

Net margin

Globally, airlines are projected to generate $1.008 trillion in revenue in 2025, increasing to $1.053 trillion in 2026.

Net profit for 2025 is estimated at $39.5 billion, rising slightly to $41 billion again in 2026—a record figure, though still representing a modest 3.9 percent net margin.

Iata director-general Willie Walsh noted that while stability is welcome, profitability remains thin relative to the industry’s economic importance and capital intensity.

“Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9 percent net margin and a $41 billion profit in 2026. That’s extremely welcome news considering the headwinds the industry faces,” Walsh said, pointing to supply chain bottlenecks, geopolitical volatility, rising regulatory burdens and infrastructure constraints.

Despite improved margins, the industry will still fall short of covering its cost of capital in 2026, with return on invested capital at 6.8 percent versus a weighted average cost of capital of 8.2 percent.

Air cargo continues to be a bright spot, defying earlier predictions of decline. Shipments tied to e-commerce and semiconductor manufacturing — fuelled by demand for AI-related technologies — have supported steady performance.

The sector has also benefited from early shipments ahead of US tariff deadlines, as well as re-routing of goods to new markets.

But cost pressures remain high. While fuel costs are expected to ease slightly in 2026, non-fuel expenses—including labour, maintenance, and airport charges—will continue to rise.

Supply chain issues are slowing fleet renewals, pushing the average global aircraft age above 15 years—the oldest on record.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) costs are also climbing, with incremental expenses projected to hit $4.5 billion in 2026 as airlines increase compliance with global emissions reduction schemes.

For Africa, the Iata outlook underlines a long-standing dilemma. Traffic growth is accelerating, yet profitability remains stuck at near-break-even levels.

Low GDP per capita across much of the continent limits discretionary spending, making air travel highly price sensitive and restricting its growth potential.

Without relief on costs, taxes, and market fragmentation, the region’s airlines are likely to continue operating with limited buffers even as demand expands.

The report suggests that easing visa regimes, revisiting bilateral air service restrictions, reducing fuel markups, and addressing ageing fleets could help unlock the continent’s aviation potential—transforming growth into sustainable profit.

For now, African carriers remain caught between rising passenger demand and structural inefficiencies that erode margins, leaving them more exposed to shocks than their global counterparts.",https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/image/5294102/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/bff6365689c524ebe4e11ecb1510719e/PZ/pic-airlines.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:49.341722

Through its Dublin hub, Aer Lingus provides convenient connections that link Pittsburgh with over 30 destinations across Europe and the U.K.,” said Susanne Carberry, Aer Lingus Chief Customer Officer.

Officials said this announcement sends a message to the global industry about the strength of the Pittsburgh market.

“The Pittsburgh region’s connections to Ireland run deep – both in today’s strong business market and ancestral ties – and this is a route that community leaders have been seeking,” Pittsburgh International Airport CEO Christina Cassotis said. “We are thrilled to have a partner in Aer Lingus that will serve Pittsburgh’s growing market for nonstop service to Ireland and beyond, and we look forward to welcoming even more European travelers to Pittsburgh.”

This route addition is building on long-term ties between Pittsburgh and Ireland. One of the NFL’s premier teams with followers around the globe, the Pittsburgh Steelers were selected to play the first-ever NFL regular-season game in Dublin in September 2025 in part because the Rooney family, which has owned the team since its founding in 1933, has deep connections to Ireland. The Rooneys trace their ancestry to Newry in Northern Ireland and the late Steelers Chairman Dan Rooney Sr. co-founded The Ireland Funds, a philanthropic organization promoting peace and reconciliation, and served as the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland from 2009 to 2012.

“The Pittsburgh Steelers and Rooney family, with strong ties to Ireland, are thrilled by today’s announcement that Aer Lingus, an Official Airline of the Pittsburgh Steelers, will launch nonstop service between Pittsburgh and Dublin. This announcement builds off deep connections between these two regions and will help to drive economic growth, investment, and vitality in both markets. We applaud the partnership, with Christina Cassotis at the helm, that came together to secure this economic win for our region,” said Dan Rooney, Vice President of Business Development and Strategy, Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Steelers game in Dublin this September bolstered and highlighted the relationship between the regions, but the roots go much deeper. Several major Pittsburgh-based companies have operations in Ireland, including:

Martin O’Brien, chief executive of the Louth & Meath Education and Training Board in Dundalk, Ireland, struck a partnership with the Ireland Institute of Pittsburgh and Catalyst Connection, a Pittsburgh economic development nonprofit that assists small manufacturing firms. In 2022, O’Brien spent three days touring Pittsburgh-area companies and research hubs, including Neighborhood 91, a center for 3D printing and additive manufacturing at the Pittsburgh International Airport campus. Catalyst Connections and Ireland’s Southern Regional College also announced an apprenticeship exchange program in September 2025.

The nonprofit Ireland Institute connects Pittsburgh and Irish companies through the Pittsburgh Irish Business Network to explore trade and investment opportunities. James Lamb, president of the Ireland Institute of Pittsburgh, is the city’s honorary consul of Ireland, responsible for facilitating business opportunities and cultural exchange.

“As someone with deep and personal ties to Ireland, I have a strong understanding of the importance of Pennsylvania’s rich history of Irish heritage. Our commonwealth was built on the contributions of our Irish ancestors and those who continue to carry their legacies, values and traditions. Just last year, I led the successful effort to create an Ireland Trade Commission to foster stronger ties between Pennsylvania and Ireland, and now with this nonstop service from Aer Lingus, that mission has become that much easier to accomplish,” said Pennsylvania State Senator Devlin Robinson.

Before the Steelers took to the field in Dublin, a contingent of Pittsburgh business and government leaders, including Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis, state Department of Community and Economic Development Secretary Rick Siger, Allegheny Conference CEO Stefani Pashman and Rooney, promoted the opportunities for new investment in Pittsburgh.

They were joined by representatives from Pittsburgh International Airport, the Allegheny Conference, Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, and VisitPittsburgh to pitch Pittsburgh’s strengths in sectors ranging from healthcare and life sciences to manufacturing and technology to potential partners.

“We’re thrilled to welcome this new international route, which further strengthens Pittsburgh’s global connectivity and underscores the incredible momentum across our region. Pittsburgh is a city forging ahead—with major investments, a growing innovation economy, and a vibrant cultural scene that continues to draw visitors from around the world. This flight makes it easier than ever for international travelers to experience everything that makes Pittsburgh a must-see destination. We look forward to partnering with Pittsburgh International Airport and our new airline partners at Aer Lingus to ensure this route thrives for years to come.” Said Jerad Bachar, CEO and president of VisitPittsburgh.

Those business connections will be enhanced by Aer Lingus, which the international air transport rating organization Skytrax has awarded four stars. Aer Lingus’ nonstop service between PIT and Dublin is expected to create an economic impact of approximately $23 million per year supporting 156 jobs, according to a model by EDRG.

Pittsburgh is the only North American market included in today’s Aer Lingus announcement, which included four additional European routes. Pittsburgh now features three trans-Atlantic routes (along with London and Reykjavik). This route becomes the 63rd non-stop destination from PIT and increases the airport’s number of airlines to 16.

The flights to Dublin on Airbus A321LR aircraft will depart from Pittsburgh at 8:40 p.m. and arrive in Dublin at 8:40 a.m. The flight back will depart from Dublin at 4:10 p.m. and arrive in Pittsburgh at 7:10 p.m. Travelers on flights from Dublin arrive at PIT pre-cleared, meaning they have completed their immigration and customs inspections before boarding their flight. This allows travelers to proceed directly to the baggage claim or terminal exit after arriving without the need to clear customs at PIT, providing a smoother travel experience.

The airline is a member of International Airlines Group (IAG), the corporate parent for British Airways. As part of IAG, Aer Lingus has pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to power 10 percent of its flights with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030.

That aligns with PIT’s industry-leading initiative to produce SAF on its campus in partnership with Avina Synthetic Aviation Fuel. The facility is expected to produce over 100 million gallons of SAF annually. It could be operational by 2028, making PIT the first on-airport SAF facility in the U.S. to provide fuel for aircraft using the airport.

That would be the latest in PIT’s energy innovations, which include its first-of-its-kind microgrid, powered by natural gas and a solar farm. The microgrid enables the airport to be resilient against power outages that can compromise safety and disrupt the industry, while saving in utility costs.",https://blueskypit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Aer_Lingus-A321LR_AirToAir-1-ref132234-BSN.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 10:56:09.978737

These milestones reflect Delta’s ongoing commitment to transforming the future of flight and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and were instrumental in driving cost savings for the company.

Check out the progress Delta made toward its decarbonization goals this year:

WHAT WE FLY

Partnering with revolutionary tech players to advance more fuel-efficient aircraft

Delta announced a new partnership with JetZero to accelerate the development of JetZero’s blended wing-body (BWB) aircraft, a design that is expected to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than aircraft in operation today.

Delta is providing its best-in-class operational expertise through its Sustainable Skies Lab to bring the BWB aircraft to commercial viability as part of the global carrier’s work toward net-zero emissions by 2050. Delta will also consult on the interior design to re-invent and further elevate both customer and employee experiences.

Delta’s revolutionary fleet portfolio continued to grow in 2025. Delta also announced a new partnership with Maeve Aerospace to advance the development of Maeve’s hybrid electric aircraft for regional flights. Compared to today's regional aircraft designs, Maeve's aircraft design aims to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 40%' + drupalSettings.data.extlink.extLabel + ' using conventional jet fuel, with further lifecycle emissions reductions possible when using SAF.

Maeve joins Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab as the fifth revolutionary fleet partner, advancing a key milestone in Delta’s 2023 Sustainability Roadmap to accelerate innovative solutions for a more sustainable future of travel.

As a regional, hybrid-electric solution, Maeve’s exclusive partnership with Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab rounds out Delta’s portfolio of revolutionary fleet partners across short, medium and long-haul markets. Other revolutionary fleet partners include JetZero with its blended wing body mainline aircraft; Joby with their home-to-airport air offering; and Airbus and Boeing, both of which are exploring next generation technology.

Next-generation fleet technology

While Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab continues to look toward the future by pursuing partnerships and investments to support revolutionary technologies – such as with JetZero, Maeve, and Joby – Delta also continues its fleet renewal program by investing in state-of-the-art aircraft that provide safe, reliable and premium customer experience while delivering superior fuel efficiency. In 2025, Delta is on track to take delivery of more than 35 aircraft that are on average more than 25% more fuel efficient per seat mile than the aircraft retired since 2019.

HOW WE FLY

Achieving a major fuel savings milestone with Carbon Council

In 2025, Delta met and exceeded its near-term (2025) fuel savings goal of one percent fuel burn savings, by delivering over 55 million gallons* of jet fuel savings from operational improvements.

The airline was able to achieve and surpass this goal in the first quarter of 2025, thanks to Delta’s cross-enterprise Carbon Council that works with operating divisions and critical teams to implement flight metrics and actions that reduce jet fuel consumption, including Delta’s airport customer service teams, Flight Operations and Technical Operations teams. This achievement of 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings is worth more than $125M in annual cost savings for the global carrier. Reducing fuel consumption was accomplished in several ways, including:

Reducing weight on board

Introducing technology to track and reduce Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) usage between flights, empowering pilots, airport customer service agents, and Delta aircraft maintenance technicians to contribute to cost, fuel, and emissions savings

Optimizing aircraft speed and routing

Certifying new landing procedures

Adding drag reduction technology – like winglets – to existing fleet

Delta is also working to embed a sustainability mindset throughout the business with operational fuel-efficiency KPIs to engage employees, unify efforts and empower teams to drive impact toward Delta’s sustainability goals. Earlier this year, Delta launched a new program, Green Station of the Year, to activate more than 65% of Delta people who can help achieve fuel savings in their daily work. These frontline team members directly contribute to operational KPIs, which show the power of Delta people through friendly competition that drives fuel savings through APU reduction.

*Compared to 2019, and relative to what we would have used if Delta had not undertaken any fuel efficiency efforts, not including fleet renewal.

More sustainable travel experiences

Sustainability on board and on the ground matters, too. This year, Delta officially rolled out new paper cups across its entire operation. Years ago, Delta began the journey to reduce single-use plastics in flight to deliver a more premium customer experience. One major step toward that goal was finding a more sustainable alternative to plastic cups. In 2023, Delta began final testing of these new cups on transcontinental domestic flights. After completing testing in 2024, teams across Delta worked through inventory, supply chain and logistics to make the transition.

Additionally, Delta opened the new Delta One Lounge and a second Delta Sky Club at Seattle-Tacoma International, the entirety of both created with sustainability in mind with features like smart windows that adjust to sunlight, all-electric energy with motion-sensing lights and reusable dinnerware to reduce waste. These thoughtful touches help lower energy consumption while fostering a comfortable and elevated atmosphere.

Finally, Delta continues to support regional flight innovation with a new partnership with Green Taxi Aerospace to explore electric taxiing technology that aims to reduce fuel use, operating costs, taxi time, and carbon emissions. Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab is contributing decades of operating experience to help Green Taxi optimize its electric taxing system at airports for regional aircraft, though their long-term vision extends is to offer this technology for larger aircraft as well.

Deepening Airbus and Delta's partnership

Delta continues to deepen its relationship with Airbus, positioning the world’s leading aircraft manufacturer and its largest operator at the forefront of advancing next generation aviation technologies to revolutionize the future of flying. Earlier this year at CES, Delta announced a number of initiatives with Airbus, including working with Airbus to test a new flying technique called fello’fly, which takes inspiration from migrating geese and showcases the power of collaboration by pairing flights. With this flying technique, the lead aircraft creates an uplift that drives fuel efficiency for the trailing aircraft, called wake energy retrieval, which can reduce fuel consumption up to 5% for the follower aircraft on long-haul flights.

This fall, Delta took a leading role in the next phase of testing, alongside Airbus and its partners. This trial phase' + drupalSettings.data.extlink.extLabel + ' showcased the feasibility of the Airbus Paring Assistance Tool (PAT), demonstrating capability to safely guide two aircraft to meet at a precise time and place, called the rendezvous point, while maintaining full vertical separation and remaining compliant with air traffic regulations. Teams across Delta, including the OCC and Flight Operations, worked together and with participating airlines to showcase the viability of the PAT technology.

Continued inspiration from nature

While fello’fly takes inspiration from geese, Delta’s biomimicry work doesn’t stop there. Earlier this year, Delta added a new partner to its Sustainable Skies Lab that is driving fuel efficiencies inspired by an unlikely source: sharks. MicroTau is an Australian aerospace technology company developing a ‘Riblet Modification Package’ that mimics shark skin to drive drag reduction. This “shark skin” technology can be applied to an aircraft’s fuselage, wings and tail, and once applied, may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4% according to MicroTau’s estimations. Delta is working with MicroTau to ensure their riblet film meets rigorous material-specification requirements prior to installing and testing on live aircraft

Delta is also testing finlets. Finlets are fins, similar to the ones fish have, that can be installed on the back of an aircraft on the fuselage to reshape airflow and reduce drag, ultimately leading to reduced fuel consumption and carbon emissions.

Similarly, Delta has been working for years to add enhanced winglets and lightweight landing gear to its fleet to make them as efficient as possible. Winglets are the curved surfaces seen on the wingtip of aircraft to smooth airflow and reduce drag, allowing aircraft to burn less fuel. Delta finalized the modifications of the split-scimitar winglet upgrade on the 737-800 fleet this year, marking the completion of Delta adding the most advanced winglet technology available to all existing fleets that can be modified.

With approximately 90% of Delta’s carbon emissions coming from jet fuel each year, every decision and modification can drive fuel savings that add up, and these decisions are indicative of Delta’s commitment to make changes within its control on its existing fleet, while also purchasing next-gen aircraft that are more fuel-efficient and supporting research into aircraft that will help Delta reach its decarbonization goals.

THE FUEL WE USE

Ongoing efforts to scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

SAF is the most promising lever known today to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions from conventional jet fuel' + drupalSettings.data.extlink.extLabel + ' and decarbonize Delta’s operation, and it can help support a robust farming, agriculture, and energy industry that supports economic growth in the U.S. However, there isn’t enough SAF available to meet global demand for even a week. That’s why Delta continues to work across industries and with state and federal lawmakers to enact policy solutions that will allow for the U.S. SAF market to reach scale and flourish.

Roots to Runway SAF

In 2025, Delta is on track to increase its SAF usage by 50% compared to 2024. Additionally, Delta collaborated with key partners, including Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland for the first commercial-scale SAF uplift at Portland International Airport (PDX). This marked the first commercial scale SAF uplift at PDX.

Delta was also named one of the world’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company for the fifth time. This time around, Delta was recognized in the No. 3 spot – the only airline ranking – in the Corporate Social Responsibility category for its tangible efforts in scaling SAF.

Finally, Delta re-launched Elevate Your Status for the first time since 2019, with a meaningful update. Through Dec. 31, eligible U.S.-based SkyMiles and Medallion Members can make a one-time MQD purchase to reach the next Medallion tier for 2026, with 100% of proceeds (excluding processing fees*) going to support Delta’s SAF program.

Looking ahead

2025 was a year of action, but the journey continues. From scaling SAF to advancing next-generation aircraft, Delta remains committed to transforming the future of flight, all of which is accomplished by Delta’s 100,000 people that help make this work possible.",https://news.delta.com/sites/default/files/styles/twitter_share_1200/public/delta_aircraf_saf.jpg?itok=TJK7uqq_,N,,2025-12-11 10:56:14.366275

Green biotech firms to open factories in Grangemouth

Severin Carrell

Two green biotechnology firms have announced they will build new factories at Scotland’s Grangemouth site which will employ up to 460 people, in the first phase of projects to replace hundreds of jobs lost when the PetroIneos refinery closed down.

The projects by MiAlgae, a start-up based in Edinburgh which uses whisky waste to make fish-free Omega 3 oils, and Celtic Renewables, which uses whisky and agricultural byproducts to make chemicals, have won £10m in funding from the Scottish and UK governments to build new plants at Grangemouth.

MiAlgae’s founder and chief executive Douglas Martin said their Omega 3 plant would start production in the second quarter of 2026, employing 75 people. It uses whisky wash, a byproduct, of whisky production to produce plant-based Omega 3 for pet food and fish farm feed.

Martin said their modular plant, which has been given £3m by the UK and Scottish governments, can be rapidly expanded to eventually create up to 310 jobs. Celtic Renewables, which uses agricultural byproducts to make acetone, butanol and ethanol used in cosmetics, chemicals and has been given £6.23m to build a plant expected to employ 149 by 2030.

The projects are being funded by the Grangemouth just transition fund and are linked to the Project Willow programme run by Scottish Enterprise to replace the 400 jobs lost when Grangemouth’s refinery closed down earlier this year, fueling a political storm over mounting job losses from North Sea industries.

Its closure is believed to affect up to 4,200 other jobs in the wider supply chain, intensifying pressure on both governments and Scottish Enterprise to quickly bring in high value jobs.

Jan Robertson, Scottish Enterprise’s director of Grangemouth transition, said both firms were expected to be part of a closely integrated supply and production chain which connected waste and byproducts from farms, food producers and whisky distilleries with bio-energy and bio-technology companies.

The investment agency has been in talks with 140 firms interested in investing at Grangemouth: the long-term goal is to see a sustainable aviation fuel refinery and plastics recycling plants built there.

Oracle shares tumble over 15%

As feared, shares in Oracle have tumbled at the start of trading as Wall Street gives its verdict to the tech giant’s results last night.

Oracle’s shares have dropped by 15.7% at the start of trading, down to $188.29. That, by my maths, knocks almost $100bn off the company’s market capitalisation.

As flagged earlier (see opening post), Oracle missed revenue forecasts last night – and also hiked its capital expenditure plans by $15bn.

That has led to mounting concerns about the company’s massive AI spending and the lack of a clear timeline on returns from the investments.

Cost of insuring Oracle debt against default jumps

Back in the AI world, the cost of insuring Oracle’s debt against default has risen to its highest in at least five years.

That reflects investor concerns about Oracle’s borrowing spree to fund its AI investments, after it missed Wall Street forecasts last night.

Reuters flags that Oracle’s five-year credit default swaps, a derivative that pays bondholders in the event an issuer defaults, rose by nearly 12 basis points on the day to 139 bps, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

This was the highest since at least September 2020, according to LSEG data.

It means it would cost $139 to insure $10,000 of Oracle debt, so still implying a low risk.

Oracle shares are currently down 13.7% in pre-market trading.

Hopes for more green industries to move to Grangemouth

Severin Carrell

Gillian Martin, the Scottish government’s net zero secretary, said she expected other green, low carbon industries such as plastics recycling and sustainable aviation fuel to set up in Grangemouth following the decision by the Scottish and UK governments to fund two bio-technology factories there (see earlier post).

She said the new MiAlgae plant at Grangemouth, which expects to employ 75 people making omega 3 oils for animal and fish farm feed from whisky waste from spring next year, was additional to the types of industries proposed by the Project Willow programme to attract major new employers to Grangemouth, published after PetroIneos announced it was closing its oil refinery there.

Speaking at the site of MiAlgae’s new plant, she said:

“The projects we are announcing today are outwith what we anticipated would be the main outcomes of Project Willow and that’s actually really exciting.

“Today we’re able to make announcements about tangible operations that are going to be here that are going to be providing highly skilled jobs. But I think the most exciting part of it is its future industries.

“It’s industries that are going to be displacing an awful lot of carbon intensive processes, like MiAlgae are doing today - meaning that we’re not importing fish oil from around the world, and we’ve actually got a more sustainable product, but highly skilled work as well.

“The only way to turn the terrible negativity - because people are losing their jobs in traditional industries like PetroIneos, who have made decisions that are outwith government control - is to step in and do what you say you’re going to do, and that’s actually facilitate replacement jobs happening in that area. And that’s what we’re doing here today. We’re only at the start of this.”

Michael Shanks, the UK government’s energy minister, said the announcement of nearly £10m in funding to build two new green biotechnology plants at Grangemouth, following the closure of PetroIneos’s oil refinery, was “a really important moment.”

Speaking as heavy machinery began cutting away tarmac for MiAlgae’s new plant, he said: “the truth is, we should have been doing a lot of this a long time ago.”

He said it took time to “get those viable projects coming forward [and] they give us not a sort of flash in the pan moment, they are sustainable, a business rooted in a community like this and interested in expanding”.

Shanks told the Guardian:

“Yes, it’s jobs early next year, which is really important for us to say - that there are jobs coming to Grangemouth very soon. But secondly, it’s a statement of faith that Grangemouth is a positive place, that actually, this isn’t just a place of decline as we’ve seen too much of, but is a huge opportunity as well.”

Pressed on whether enough was being done to demonstrate the transition to net zero created high value jobs and wealth, he said:

“We need to see a lot more examples of these kind of businesses coming forward to demonstrate the jobs. There are actually many and the thousands of jobs being created in Scotland right now in offshore wind, in hydrogen in ports. But we’re not telling the story often enough.

“MiAlgae is actually is a brilliant story to tell of good, well-paid sustainable jobs, of cutting edge innovation. But also it’s the climate argument in a nutshell. It’s good jobs here at Grangemouth, but they’re helping to save the planet.”

Green biotech firms to open factories in Grangemouth

Severin Carrell

Two green biotechnology firms have announced they will build new factories at Scotland’s Grangemouth site which will employ up to 460 people, in the first phase of projects to replace hundreds of jobs lost when the PetroIneos refinery closed down.

The projects by MiAlgae, a start-up based in Edinburgh which uses whisky waste to make fish-free Omega 3 oils, and Celtic Renewables, which uses whisky and agricultural byproducts to make chemicals, have won £10m in funding from the Scottish and UK governments to build new plants at Grangemouth.

MiAlgae’s founder and chief executive Douglas Martin said their Omega 3 plant would start production in the second quarter of 2026, employing 75 people. It uses whisky wash, a byproduct, of whisky production to produce plant-based Omega 3 for pet food and fish farm feed.

Martin said their modular plant, which has been given £3m by the UK and Scottish governments, can be rapidly expanded to eventually create up to 310 jobs. Celtic Renewables, which uses agricultural byproducts to make acetone, butanol and ethanol used in cosmetics, chemicals and has been given £6.23m to build a plant expected to employ 149 by 2030.

The projects are being funded by the Grangemouth just transition fund and are linked to the Project Willow programme run by Scottish Enterprise to replace the 400 jobs lost when Grangemouth’s refinery closed down earlier this year, fueling a political storm over mounting job losses from North Sea industries.

Its closure is believed to affect up to 4,200 other jobs in the wider supply chain, intensifying pressure on both governments and Scottish Enterprise to quickly bring in high value jobs.

Jan Robertson, Scottish Enterprise’s director of Grangemouth transition, said both firms were expected to be part of a closely integrated supply and production chain which connected waste and byproducts from farms, food producers and whisky distilleries with bio-energy and bio-technology companies.

The investment agency has been in talks with 140 firms interested in investing at Grangemouth: the long-term goal is to see a sustainable aviation fuel refinery and plastics recycling plants built there.

London's Heathrow Airport names former BT boss Jansen as chairman

City veteran Philip Jansen has a new challenge – steering Heathrow though its plans for a new runway and terminal expansion.

Jansen has today been named as the chairman of Heathrow, replacing Lord Paul Deighton when he steps down on 31 December.

Heathrow says:

Jansen’s significant experience working with private investors as well as successfully leading a business within a highly regulated environment means that he is ideally placed to help prepare the airport for its next phase of modernisation and oversee the airport’s future strategy.

That strategy includes Heathrow’s proposal for a £33bn scheme for a 2.2-mile (3.5km) north-western runway crossing the M25 motorway, which the government backed last month.

It is also proposing a £15bn project to expand Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3.

Jansen has plenty of experience for the role; he’s currently Chair of WPP (the advertising group which is being relegated from the FTSE 100), and was previously the CEO of BT Group, Worldpay Group and Sodexo.

Jansen says:

“Heathrow is the UK’s gateway to growth, therefore I am delighted to be taking on the role as Chairman at this pivotal time for both the business and the country.

I’m keenly aware of the instrumental role Heathrow plays in the success of the UK economy and I’m motivated to play my part in its future, helping to navigate the UK’s hub as it looks to modernise and expand.”

Bain: Global M&A stages great rebound in 2025

A surge of $5bn-plus megadeals has helped to make 2025 the second-largest year for merger and acquisition activity on record, a new report from Bain & Company shows.

Technology M&A, powered by AI-related deals, was behind the year’s surge in merger activity, Bain reports, with $4.8tn of M&A activity this year.

Those $5bn-plus deals “contributed 75% of strategic deal value growth”, Bain says – big bets on large-scale, transformational mergers that are potentially both high-risk and high reward for acquiring companies.

Suzanne Kumar, executive vice president of Bain & Company’s M&A and Divestitures practice, explains:

“Companies across industries are seeing an urgent need to reboot strategy. Amid improved deal market conditions, with both buyers and sellers more confident about valuations, strategic buyers are again putting M&A front and center to drive business growth. The number one reason for increased dealmaking was M&A’s central role in strategy, according to our survey of more than 300 M&A executives,” said

“We see important implications from the dealmaking rebound. This was a year of big bets by companies that traditionally make few deals, and often large-ticket deals become make-or-break moves. Big deals grounded in sound strategy can transform a business and set a new growth trajectory. But deals for less-strategic reasons can be a recipe for value destruction. It’s impossible to overstate the importance to value-creation of clear and early answers to fundamental questions on factors such as shared vision, operating models, decision-making and execution and culture.”

French insurer Axa has revealed it is exercising greater caution on the artificial intelligence build-out when backing financing for the sector.

“We are convinced of the medium-term trend, but we want to avoid financing technological gambles,” AXA Group chief investment officer Jean-Baptiste Tricot told Bloomberg, adding that AI infrastructure has seen “astronomical volumes allocated in recent months.”

Tricot said:

“We are trying to avoid overly specialized data centers and data centers that are dedicated or customized for a single player or a single technology, because we don’t know yet which actor or technology will ultimately win the AI race.”

Axa is “more interested in financing data centers that have inference and general-purpose capabilities,” he added. More here.

Interest rates cut in Turkey

Turkey’s central bank has cut interest rates, in response to a slowdown in inflation, but borrowing costs remain very high.

The Central Bank of the Republic of Türkiye has cut its policy rate from 39.5% to 38%, and also lowered its overnight lending and borrowing rates.

It says:

In November, consumer inflation was lower than expected due to a downward surprise in food prices.

Following an increase in September, the underlying trend of inflation declined slightly in October and November. Quarterly GDP growth turned out higher than projected in the third quarter.

Leading indicators for the last quarter point out that demand conditions continue to support the disinflation process. While showing signs of improvement, inflation expectations and pricing behavior continue to pose risks to the disinflation process.

Over in Switzerland, the central bank has left interest rates on hold at 0%, a day after America’s central bank cut rates.

Explaining the decision, the SNB says:

Inflation in recent months has been slightly lower than expected. In the medium term, however, inflationary pressure is virtually unchanged compared to the last monetary policy assessment.

Our monetary policy helps to keep inflation within the range consistent with price stability and supports economic development. We will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our monetary policy if necessary, in order to ensure price stability.

READ MORE: Formula E's drive for sustainability

Season 12 promises the biggest, boldest calendar in Formula E history, a record 17-race calendar, spanning iconic cities and cutting-edge circuits. Each stop on the global tour has been engineered with precision, grouping destinations by continent to slash freight mileage and significantly cut CO₂ emissions—proving that scale and sustainability can go together.

The new season started in São Paulo on 6 December, a city powered predominantly by renewable energy, including significant hydropower and bioenergy, which underscores Formula E’s intent to race in markets aligned with its clean-mobility mission.

As the world’s first all-electric FIA World Championship, Formula E doubles down on its mission to deliver world-class racing whilst pursuing its continued commitment to sustainable motorsport, global social impact, and environmentally responsible event delivery.

Key achievements from the Season 10 Sustainability Report

Record-breaking social impact

Social impact programmes reached over 32,000 people across host cities through community outreach and education.

The global initiative FIA Girls on Track expanded to all 11 race markets covered in Season 10, with a year-on-year doubling of participation—and for the first time a “podium commitment” saw a FIA Girls on Track participant present trophies at every E-Prix.

The launch of the education platform Driving Force (presented by PIF) provided modules on air pollution, circular economy, renewable energy and diversity, equity and inclusion.

The introduction of the Better Futures Fund delivered €75,000 in grants to community-led sustainability projects in four host cities Berlin, Shanghai and Portland.

Operational Excellence and Carbon Management

Improvements in logistics enabled by a new global hub increased reliance on biofuel powered sea freight, while the first use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for transcontinental freight—notably between key venues—cut transport-related emissions substantially.

Formula E reaffirmed its environmental credentials, aligning with international standards such as ISO 20121, ISO 14064 and the IWA 42 framework for climate governance and emissions transparency.

Industry Recognition and Global Leadership

Named #1 in the Global Sustainability Benchmark in Sport (GSBS) for a second consecutive year.

Achieved best-ever GSBS score of 85%, with category leadership in Environmental (77%), Social (88%) and Governance (86%).

Actively represented at New York Climate Week alongside the UN General Assembly, reinforcing Formula E’s leadership role in the global climate conversation.

Jeff Dodds, CEO, Formula E, said: “Season 10 proved once again that elite sport and sustainability are not mutually exclusive - they are mutually reinforcing. From using sustainable aviation fuel across continents to leaving lasting legacies in host cities through our Better Futures Fund, our purpose is clearer than ever: to accelerate sustainable human progress through the power of electric racing. Each year we continue to set new records and break new ground, yet our dedication to continually improve is unwavering. While many treat sustainability as a destination or make commitments without true action, our strategy is to always go further, be more ambitious and continually uncover new ways of being innovative and impactful.”

Julia Pallé, VP Sustainability, Formula E, said: “We believe electric racing can do more than inspire - it can directly drive change. Over the last 10 seasons, we have not only inspired others to act but also helped them in delivering real impact. Whether we’re supporting charities, investing in renewable energy or working directly with diverse communities and charity groups, we’re a series not focused on pledges and aspirations, but delivering true progress that can be felt and benefited from right now. For Season 10, we significantly deepened our local community impact and strengthened our commitment to building a more inclusive, equitable and resilient future in every city we race.”

Matt Page, Senior Vice President, Assurance Services EMEA at BSI, said: “Sport has the opportunity to play a leading role in our transition to a sustainable world. Formula E becoming the first sport certified to BSI’s Net Zero Pathway marks an important milestone, not only for the championship, but for global sport as a whole. This achievement reflects a deep, long-term commitment to credible climate action and demonstrates what is possible when ambition is matched with transparency and robust governance.

“Our Net Zero Pathway provides independent assurance across an organisation’s carbon inventory, targets, and management controls, helping ensure that net zero goals are both realistic and achievable. By prioritising real emissions reductions over offsetting, and by auditing progress year-on-year, the Pathway is designed to give organizations the confidence that they are firmly on track to meet net zero by 2050 or sooner.

“We have been proud to collaborate with Formula E, an organisation that continues to set new benchmarks in sustainability. Their leadership shows how any organisation, regardless of sector, can take meaningful and measurable steps toward a net zero future.”

Paul Fowler, VP Global & UK Motorsports DHL, said: “Our collaboration with Formula E shows what’s possible when logistics and sport work together. By partnering closely and rethinking freight strategies, we’ve identified practical ways to reduce emissions - optimising routes and shifting to sea and road transport—while ensuring the championship runs smoothly.""

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents aviation’s most promising and practical path to reducing carbon emissions and achieving 2050 sustainability goals. In May 2025, the UK Government introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which has reached Report Stage in Parliament. The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT UK) is helping the government with advice and guidance on SAF and how it can help the logistics and transport sector.

Understanding SAF’s workings and benefits is crucial for the aviation sector, which is why it must be embraced sooner rather than later. Geoff Maynard, Member of the Aviation Policy Group at CILT (UK), recently gave evidence in Parliament to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill Committee as MPs further consider the Bill.

Geoff Maynard has worked in the aviation sector for over 25 years, undertaking a wide range of aviation-related commissions, many with extensive environmental content. Educated at Queen’s College, Cambridge, with a degree in Natural Sciences, Geoff has held senior positions in both the private and public sectors. He has worked on many major projects, including Heathrow’s T5, the Olympic Terminal in Beijing, and a new airport for Eswatini.

Here, Geoff gives his expert insight into SAF, its benefits, challenges, future and why the sector must embrace it.

The case for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel that can power aircraft without engine or infrastructure changes. Produced from sustainable resources like agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and municipal solid waste, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that can be used in existing aircraft engines and fuel systems without modifications. It performs identically to traditional jet fuel in terms of energy density, freezing point, and combustion characteristics, requiring no special training or new equipment.

SAF can also be produced using green electricity, water and carbon dioxide extracted from the air. This SAF, also known as e-fuel, could be produced in very large quantities – constrained only by the investment in a new plant.

Raw materials undergo treatments to remove impurities, then hydro processing, gasification, or fermentation are used to transform them into high-quality aviation fuel that mimics traditional jet fuel properties. The aim for the government is to blend SAF fuel with traditional fossil jet fuel and, with time, increase the SAF fuel ratio and thus lower the use of fossil jet fuel.

SAF offers significant environmental advantages, primarily through a substantial reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions. Unlike traditional jet fuel, which releases ancient carbon into the atmosphere, SAF is derived from materials that recently absorbed atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a closed carbon loop. This process can lead to lifecycle carbon emission reductions of up to 80% compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

Additionally, SAF contributes to waste reduction by repurposing materials such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and municipal waste into energy, fostering a circular economy in waste management and energy production.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel policy and adoption

The government is encouraging this trend by first, mandating the percentage of SAF that must be included in aviation jet fuel sold in the UK. Second, the SAF billcurrently going through Parliament establishes a company that can contract with industry to produce SAF at an agreed cost. If the SAF is ultimately sold at a price more than the agreed cost, the excess is returned to the government.

Conversely, if the SAF is sold at less than the agreed cost, the government reimburses the producer for the loss. In this way, the government eliminates the uncertainty that private industry faces in producing SAF, ensuring they cover their costs but also ensuring sufficient SAF is available to meet the mandated percentage.

These measures will help SAF overcome its adoption barriers, primarily its high cost, which is two to five times greater than traditional jet fuel, impacting airline profitability and passenger pricing. The government expects that as the mandated SAF percentage rises, volumes produced will rise and it will naturally bring the price down as demand goes up.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel development

The development of SAF is creating new industries and economic opportunities, with companies investing in production facilities, research, and supply chains. This investment is generating jobs. For airlines, SAF is vital for achieving sustainability goals and meeting passenger demands for eco-friendly travel.

The ability to hit sustainability targets by simply adding a fuel to the mix is the biggest pull factor, but for this to happen, government must encourage and support the development and introduction of SAF. This year, all jet fuel sold in the UK must, by law, contain 2% SAF, with the percentage rising linearly to 10% by 2030, and on to 22% by 2040.

The future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The future of SAF looks promising due to advancements in technology and increased production. Researchers are creating new methods that lower costs and reduce environmental effects. Major airlines aim for net-zero, which means SAF will play a vital role. Aircraft are being designed for 100% SAF, and production capacity is set to grow.

The availability of fossil jet fuel will reduce as other sectors, notably road transport, move away from fossil diesel and petrol. SAF will fill this gap, and with the support of CILT UK, we are helping bridge the conversation between our industries, airlines and government.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-1816525962.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:57:18.946202

Their consensus? The green transition must be both environmentally effective and socially just – or risk undermining the livelihoods of millions who depend on Africa’s export economy. International trade is a proven route of economic development yet there are risks of reductions in market entry because of the design and application of some trade related climate measures.

European climate measures such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are rapidly transforming global agrifood markets, given the inclusion of fertiliser but also transportation by maritime and aviation. The roundtable spotlighted how these policies are already impacting exporters, producers and supply cains, given retailers responses, forcing a rethink of how high-value fresh produce reaches consumers.

James MacGregor from Fairmiles warned that decisions made in European horticulture and fresh produce buyer boardrooms ripple through entire value chains in Africa. “Buyers must move beyond carbon metrics and costs alone,” he said. “They need to consider what those decisions mean for the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, workers and communities whose incomes depend on these exports.

Emphasis was placed by TMA CEO, Dave Beer on the adjustment costs related to climate-linked trade rules to African exporters, especially in agri-forestry, horticulture, and emissions-intensive sectors. To aid the readiness of businesses in the continent, TMA is responding by building national traceability systems, supporting modal shifts to low-emission freight, and positioning compliance readiness as a competitive advantage for African trade.

Jodie Keane, Principal Research Fellow at ODI Global emphasised the risk of a poorly designed green transition: without solid evidence, fair pricing arrangements and technology tailored to producers’ realities, the green transition could become “economically destructive rather than environmentally transformative”. She called for clear, accessible data and communication to demonstrate how better-designed supply chains can deliver positive outcomes for all.

The modal shift debate: air freight vs sea freight

One of the roundtable’s most pressing concerns was the growing trend among buyers de-risking by reducing air-freighted imports in favour of sea freight, despite limited evidence that is always better for the climate or consumers. Participants cautioned that when the associated costs of certification, carbon credits or modal shifts are passed straight to farmers, the transition threatens to become unsustainable.

Kenya’s recent pilots under the TMA’s EU-funded BEEEP programme offer a glimpse of what’s possible. By shifting products from road and air to a combination of rail Standard Gauge Railway) and refrigerated sea shipping, these trials have maintained freshness and reduced emissions. However, Charles Tulezi of the Kenya Flower Council highlighted the trade-offs: moving to sea freight often requires different crop varieties, new post-harvest treatments, stronger cold-chain systems and investment in inland consolidation hubs are critical to success. Without these, smallholder farmers, who form much of the export base, risk exclusion from lucrative EU markets.

Aviation’s role in a just transition

Airlines are offering climate-mitigation alternatives such as carbon-compensation schemes and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) options, as shared by Lufthansa Cargo’s Zlatic Zlatko. While SAF supply remains costly and scarce today, industry leaders predict prices will fall as demand grows. Against a backdrop where millions of livelihoods are tied to fresh-produce exports, the notion of a just transition was a recurring theme throughout the debate. The consensus was that neither air freight nor sea freight alone can safeguard Africa’s export economy in a low-carbon future.

What is needed, they concluded, is a balanced, multi-modal strategy supported by robust data and coherent policy that reflects the complex realities of African supply chains.

James MacGregor stressed that a fair transition depends on retailers and consumers in export destinations sharing the burdenof climate costs. “Climate-related expenses cannot simply be transferred to African producers,” he said, while Trizer Omugar, TMA’s Green Trade Programme Officer, urged stakeholders to co-invest, co-design, and embed compliance into the DNA of Africa’s trade systems to turn the climate-trade regulatory compliance burden into an opportunity for spurring continental business competitiveness. Jodie Keane added that the “green squeeze must be avoided. We need to work to find solutions that are both good for the climate and make commercial sense”.

David Beer, CEO of TradeMark Africa, echoed this sentiment underscoring that decarbonisation and development must go hand in hand. “The transition must be green – but it must also be fair,” he concluded.",https://media.odi.org/images/Securing_a_Fair_Greener_Transitio.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:57:23.475692

The decision follows the signing of a Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) agreement using Topsoe’s solid oxide systems, reports H2-View.

The project will use 120MW of renewable energy to power Topsoe’s electrolysers. The hydrogen produced at the Workington site will be converted into 25,000 tonnes of e-SAF each year.

Project Starling has received £6 million from the UK government through the Advanced Fuels Fund and is now in the engineering design stage. Construction is planned to start in 2028, with the first operations expected in 2031, depending on CNF’s final investment decision (FID). Once operating, the plant could lower lifecycle emissions by 89% compared with conventional jet fuel.

The agreement marks the first time Topsoe’s solid oxide technology will be used commercially for clean fuel production. The modules for the project will be manufactured at the company’s new 500MW facility in Herning, Denmark, and are scheduled for delivery in 2028, subject to the FID.

This matters for business travel because climate-related disruptions such as extreme weather and infrastructure failures pose growing risks to mobility and safety.
Turning COP30 takeaways into action Post-COP30, the message to business travel is clear – now is not the time to take our eye off the ball.","While the recent COP30 summit that took place in Belém, Brazil, did not fully meet the high expectations set by many in the climate community – particularly around a binding commitment to phase out fossil fuels and more ambitious emissions targets – it nonetheless marked important progress. The summit delivered new pledges to triple adaptation finance and advance harmonisation of carbon reporting standards, and saw unprecedented engagement from both the public and private sectors.

The legitimacy and long-term relevance of the business travel sector will increasingly depend on its willingness to lead on climate action. Companies that embed sustainability in their travel programmes will be better positioned to meet future requirements, manage risk, and capture competitive advantage.

The disappointment voiced by many observers reflects the scale of the challenge and the urgency for faster action. However, COP30’s outcomes reinforce that waiting for perfect policy consensus is not an option.

SAF remains a critical lever

One of the most significant COP30 announcements for business travel was the pledge to quadruple sustainable fuel (SAF) production and use by 2035, known as the Belém 4X initiative.

This is a voluntary, international pledge endorsed by 23 countries, including Brazil, Italy, Japan, and India. It is designed to accelerate decarbonisation in hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, with technical support from the International Energy Agency. The goal is for sustainable fuels to cover up to 15 per cent of global aviation demand by 2035, compared to less than 1% today.

For travel managers, this means: partnering with airlines committed to SAF purchase; exploring SAF purchase agreements or credits to offset flight emissions; and communicating SAF adoption as part of your sustainability narrative.

Scope 3 emissions and carbon reporting

COP30 amplified the focus on Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect emissions from activities like business travel by advancing global standards for carbon reporting and signalling a shift toward mandatory disclosure.

Many organisations already report Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but Scope 3 often represents the largest share of their carbon footprint, sometimes up to 90 per cent of total emissions for companies in particular sectors. This is set against the backdrop of upcoming sustainability reporting regulations in many parts of the world.

New partnerships between the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO are making it easier and more consistent for organisations to measure and report these emissions. For corporate travel, this means embedding carbon metrics into booking platforms, using dashboards to monitor progress against reduction targets, and integrating carbon data into procurement and reporting frameworks. Companies that proactively manage and disclose travel emissions can strengthen their sustainability credentials, meet growing investor expectations, and stay ahead of evolving regulations.

Adaptation finance and climate resilience

Beyond emissions, COP30 delivered a major boost to adaptation finance, pledging to double funding by 2025 and triple it by 2035. Adaptation finance is funding which is dedicated to helping other countries, communities and businesses adjust to the impacts of climate change such as extreme weather, rising sea levels and infrastructure risks.

Unlike mitigation finance, which focuses on reducing emissions, adaptation finance supports investments in resilience measures – such as flood defenses, early warning systems or contingency planning – that help organisations and travellers manage climate-related disruptions.

This matters for business travel because climate-related disruptions such as extreme weather and infrastructure failures pose growing risks to mobility and safety. Companies should integrate climate risk assessments into travel policies and consider resilience measures such as diversified supplier networks and contingency planning.

Sustainable business travel in corporate strategy

COP30 reinforced that the direction of policy, regulation, and stakeholder expectation is clear: progress continues, and the industry can no longer use uncertainty as an excuse for inaction when it comes to sustainability. Companies that embed sustainability in their travel programmes will be better positioned to meet future requirements, manage risk, and capture competitive advantage. A recent GBTA survey found that 78% of travel buyers consider sustainability a top priority, and the developments we’ve seen at COP30 are likely to accelerate this trend.

Turning COP30 takeaways into action

Post-COP30, the message to business travel is clear – now is not the time to take our eye off the ball. To stay ahead of regulatory changes, meet stakeholder expectations, and contribute meaningfully to global climate goals, travel managers and procurement leaders should undertake the following:

• Audit current emissions: Establish a baseline for your organisation’s travel-related carbon footprint;

• Update travel policies: Encourage rail over air for short-haul routes and promote hybrid meetings;

• Engage suppliers: Partner with those offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) options or carbon offset programmes;

• Invest in technology: Use tools that calculate emissions per booking and suggest lower-carbon alternatives;

• Align reporting frameworks: Integrate carbon data into procurement decisions and ensure reporting meets COP30-aligned standards for transparency;

• Communicate progress: Share sustainability achievements with stakeholders.

Congress had extended the broader clean fuel credit earlier this year but removed the bonus rate for SAF, a change that caught many in the industry by surprise. SAF developers warned that without the higher credit, financing for new plants would become more difficult.

Some projects were paused almost immediately, and others were pushed into “wait and see” mode. Supporters of the new bill say it offers the long-term clarity producers need to resume construction and move ahead with expansion plans.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a drop-in replacement for conventional jet fuel that can be used by today’s aircraft without modification. It is produced from a range of feedstocks, from agricultural waste to used cooking oil, municipal waste streams and, in the case of e-SAF, synthetic fuels created with renewable energy and captured carbon.

SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions compared with fossil-based jet fuel, making it central to the aviation industry’s decarbonization plans. But supply remains extremely limited, and production costs are far higher than traditional fuel.

Those limitations are front of mind for airlines. At the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Media Day on December 9, 2025, Director General Willie Walsh warned that global SAF production is nowhere near meeting demand and that even the industry’s 2030 goal of 10% SAF use now appears out of reach.

Walsh argued that the barrier is not willingness to buy the fuel but the lack of availability. He also criticized the European Union’s mandates, saying they have pushed up prices without delivering the supply needed to meet airlines’ commitments.

Lawmakers behind the new US bill say the updated tax credit is aimed at addressing that problem. Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska said the measure would help drive a new “biofuels revolution” and support rural economies that supply feedstocks. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas said producers, farmers, and airlines need long-term policy signals so they can plan investments with confidence.

Industry groups have welcomed the bill. Airlines for America, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition, and the National Business Aviation Association all issued statements supporting the move, saying the extended credit gives producers the predictability they need to build out capacity. NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen said restoring the full rate “provides the clarity and stability needed to unlock investment, expand supply and accelerate progress.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/2025/12/An-aircraft-being-refueled-with-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-1200x800-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 09:58:00.846411

The firm, which manages more than US$1 trillion in assets, will seek to bring in as many as four people to be based in Singapore to focus on such deals, said Daniel Cheng, Brookfield’s head of renewable power and transition for Asia-Pacific. That will add to a hire earlier this year.

Countries in the region are “growing very rapidly,” Cheng said in an interview. “They recognise they both need to address the demand side for power and energy, but also the technologies available to actually decarbonise.”

The clean technology sector has rebounded this year on forecasts for electricity consumption to keep soaring as air conditioners to AI data centres add new demand, and as investment on decarbonisation climbs.

The S&P’s main gauge tracking clean energy has advanced about 44 per cent this year, well over double the gain in the MSCI World Index.

Brookfield, which has more than a dozen people in its Asia-Pacific renewable power and transition team, said in October it had raised US$20 billion for the world’s largest private fund dedicated to the global clean energy transition.

BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners LP and Pentagreen Capital have also boosted infrastructure debt teams in South-east Asia amid a push on decarbonisation projects.

At the same time, European utilities including EDP Renewables, Equinor and Orsted are among those to have recently paused or withdrawn from projects in South-east Asia, blaming a lack of long-term policy clarity and disconnected grid infrastructure.

“We’re leaning in rather than pulling out, and hopefully other investors leaving the region will make it more attractive for us,” Cheng said. “Less competition is always good.”

Last month, Brookfield completed the acquisition of Alba Renewables, with projects in the Philippines and Thailand, and also added a wind project in Vietnam. The asset manager is working to jointly develop and operate at least 1.5 gigawatts of utility-scale solar and battery energy storage projects with Malaysia-based Solarvest Holdings Bhd.

An expanded Brookfield team in Singapore will also examine opportunities related to biofuels, sustainable aviation fuel and carbon capture.

LONDON, Dec. 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Sulphur shortages, oil surpluses, carbon costs, and the geopolitics of critical minerals and trade tariffs are all set to cast a long shadow over commodities markets in the coming 12 months. Those are among the many major issues — some more surprising than others — identified in global energy and commodity price reporting agency Argus' new Energy and Commodities horizon published today.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: ""The world has grown used to the remarkable resilience of commodities markets over the past three years. But the challenges of 2026 look set to shake things up in a way not seen since Russia went into Ukraine. And as a net importer, Europe's commodity markets look set to be in the crosshairs.""

10 Key Commodity and Energy Market Themes for 2026:

UKRAINE of course will remain central to the fate of many markets. Supply chains for oil, coal, fertilizers, wheat, and natural gas have all reshaped themselves since 2022. If there is a peace deal, then the global flow of commodities may radically change again. Moscow is unlikely to agree to anything which does not remove sanctions and tariffs on its commodities; Europe's ""once bitten twice shy"" political stance may melt at the prospect of cheap diesel, or even a possible return of natural gas. That in turn could alter the picture for India, China, Brazil and the Middle East, all of whom have benefited in different ways from Europe's self-imposed Russian abstinence. And a flood of cheap oil products could spell doom for the continent's already struggling refining sector.

Europe ratchets up efforts to CUT CARBON EMISSIONS. The effects of the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are difficult to predict. It could drive up import costs for everything from steel to fertilizers. But a lot of smart money is on CBAM forcing a margin reduction for non-European producers competing with EU commodities that already carry a carbon tax. Uncertainty about how the mechanism will be implemented could also starkly affect the volume of imports in the first six months of 2026.

AVIATION faces an interesting ride as the screws tighten on carbon obligations for jet fuel. The first year of European obligations to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) saw SAF prices assessed by Argus fall to record lows of 2.3x conventional jet fuel, before rising to peak at more than 4x and then falling back to 3x after an influx of SAF imports in the final quarter. Volatility is likely to persist going into the second year of obligations. UK and EU regulators are pinning hope on the use of synthetic e-SAF, which is derived from clean hydrogen and Argus shows is around 13x the cost of conventional jet fuels. Ambitious mandates for e-SAF kick in over the coming years but a standoff between policy makers, producers and airlines is hindering the region's uptake of SAF and e-SAF.

BIOFUELS markets could be disrupted by the uneven application of differing regimes across Europe — the EU's new RED III renewable energy directive is supposed to go live in a couple of weeks, but member governments, including in Europe's biggest biofuels markets, Germany and the Netherlands, were still finalising legislation in the closing weeks of 2025 for compliance starting 1 January. Despite differing degrees of progress across EU member states, Argus expects European biofuel demand in road transportation to jump by 8% next year, driven mostly by hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).

The SULPHUR market is sounding alarm bells. Long regarded as a low-volatility oil and gas refining by-product feeding into the phosphate fertilizer market, sulphur has attained new importance because of its use in the electric vehicle (EV) battery sector — for nickel processing and LFP (lithium iron phosphate) production. Coupled with a Russian ban on sulphur exports while Moscow struggles to fix its damaged refineries, this new dynamic has pushed up Argus sulphur prices from their normal $80-180/t fob Middle East range to close to $500/t. That has serious implications for farmers around the world.

Geopolitics, trade wars, tariffs and sanctions will continue to dominate METALS. Critical minerals and rare earths dominated the headlines for much of this year. Despite confident noises from Washington and now Europe, there are only tentative signs of any easing of China's export controls on rare earth metals. And despite greater government support for critical mineral projects, the west's dependence on Chinese supply is not going to disappear any time soon, given the lead time involved in such complex operations. The technology and military sectors also remain in a bind, courtesy of Beijing's restrictions on exports of electronics metals such as germanium, prices for which have more than tripled to around $6,000/kg since controls were introduced in 2023.

In CRUDE OIL, the debate is not whether there will be a surplus, but how big it will be — Argus' own estimates point to something in the order of 1.5mn b/d. This has raised questions over whether the Opec+ group of producers, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, can press ahead with regular output increases as it seeks to unwind some 1.65mn b/d of output cuts. The group has already agreed to pause monthly increases in the first quarter — a tacit acknowledgement of those oversupply concerns. But unless crude prices collapse to the mid-$50s/bl, Opec+ may be tempted to start opening the taps again from the second quarter, prioritising internal group harmony over propping up prices.

NATURAL GAS: The flexibility challenge facing European gas and global liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets may shift gear in 2026, if we see closures of some underground gas storage sites in Germany. Argus forecasts that shuttering the two German sites most at risk of closure would reduce Europe's supply buffer by the equivalent of nearly 60 LNG cargoes per year and make the continent even more reliant on LNG during the winter. Europe's gas market has been transformed since 2022 — LNG shipments have increased by nearly two-thirds and now total close to 120mn t/yr, having replaced most Russian pipeline supply. Nevertheless, in 2026, one or two large gas storage sites may close, because the difference between the price of gas in the summer and winter — how traders make money from using storage — is shrinking. If this happens, it would increase price volatility and raise the risk of price spikes, particularly in late-winter periods. LNG should be able to fill the supply gap, but it is slower to respond to price signals, and Europe potentially has to fend off competition from Asia to secure volumes.

FREIGHT could return to the Red Sea. Containership owner Maersk has already indicated it is considering a return, and at least two containerships have recently sailed through the Suez Canal, which gives rise to hope that 2026 could be the year that shipowners return en masse. Tankers will be slower to respond than container vessels, as the shorter journey will generate lower profits and require higher risk. More generally in tanker markets, a shortage of available very large crude carriers (VLCCs) will push crude traders to seek smaller-sized vessels for their WTI shipments to Europe next year. A lack of recent VLCC deliveries from shipyards and booming demand for the 2mn bl ships to carry Americas crude to Asia is narrowing any economy-of-scale savings traders get with larger vessels.

Thermal COAL markets will be buffeted by the Ukraine conflict and pressure from global decarbonisation efforts. Any peace deal that eases sanctions on Russia could flood the market with cheap, high-quality Russian coal. This will create immense pressure on export prices in competing nations such as Australia and Indonesia, while also offering cheap base-load energy for the world's two biggest importers, China and India, and growing demand hubs in southeast Asia. Meanwhile, the pace of nuclear plant restarts in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, along with renewables growth, is encouraging more power generators to switch away from coal. That said, the thirst for power created by the expansion of AI data centres is likely to provide support and keep overall production and trade volumes hovering around 2024's record highs, when trade hit 1.1bn t and production reached 7.8bn t. A key question is whether the US coal renaissance will gather even more momentum, now that Henry Hub gas prices are back above $5/mn Btu and power demand is set to surge.

Potential to further develop system support capabilities and FlexGen

Drax Group CEO, Will Gardiner said:

“It is vital that the UK maintains its energy security and delivers affordable routes to decarbonisation into the 2030s and beyond. Drax stands ready to invest in and grow our portfolio to deliver the renewable and flexible power the country needs while also supporting economic growth in the communities where we operate.

“By 2050, demand for power is expected to double, while secure gas generation reduces and intermittent renewable generation increases, meaning more dispatchable and reliable generation will be required to help keep the lights on when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining.

“Aligned to the UK’s future energy needs and underpinned by a strong balance sheet, good cash generation, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are working to maximise the value of our existing portfolio, while driving growth over the short, medium and long term.

“Our year to date operational and financial performance has been strong, and we are focused on delivering c.£3 billion of free cash flow between 2025 and 2031, which can support investment in energy security, data centres and flexible, renewable energy underpinning long-term value creation and returns to shareholders.”

Full year expectations

Reflecting a strong performance across the Group in the second half of 2025, Drax now expects 2025 full year Adj. EBITDA to be around the top end of consensus estimates(3). Full year expectations remain subject to continued good operational performance.

Generation contracted power sales

As at 9 December 2025, Drax had c.£2.3 billion of contracted forward power sales between 2025 and Q1 2027 on its Renewables Obligation (RO) biomass, pumped storage and hydro generation assets. RO generation is fully hedged for 2025 and 2026, with over £1 billion of associated ROCs.

Capital returns

In October 2025, the Group completed a £300 million share buyback programme which had commenced in August 2024. The Group subsequently began a £450 million share buyback programme (first announced in July 2025), with an initial £75 million tranche. In aggregate, during 2025, up to 9 December 2025, the share buyback programmes have purchased c.33 million shares for c.£216 million. The total number of voting rights in Drax Group, excluding treasury shares, as at 9 December 2025 was c.341 million. In October 2025 an interim dividend of 11.6 pence per share was paid, totalling c.£40 million.

Outlook

Adj. EBITDA and free cash flow targets from existing business

The Group is continuing to target post 2027 Adj. EBITDA of £600-700 million pa before development expenditure. Delivery of this target is underpinned by disciplined cost management and an operating model adapted to reflect the structure of the recently signed low-carbon, dispatchable CfD agreement with the Low Carbon Contracts Company (a UK Government body) for Drax Power Station, combined with a high-performance culture.

Reflecting growing UK power demand, combined with an increased system reliance on intermittent and inflexible generation, Drax expects to grow its FlexGen business to comprise a greater proportion of total Adj. EBITDA over time.

Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGTs) will be a key component of the FlexGen portfolio. The flexibility of these grid balancing assets can enable the increased use of intermittent renewables across the UK system, supporting energy security and a reduction in net carbon emissions. Reflecting these factors, Drax now expects to retain these assets as a part of its FlexGen portfolio.

Taking strong cash flows from the current business (2025-2026) together with targeted Adj. EBITDA (2027-2031), plus working capital, less maintenance capex, interest and tax, Drax is targeting free cash flow of c.£3 billion (2025-2031)(5).

The Group’s capital allocation policy remains unchanged. Drax expects to initially allocate >£1 billion of free cash flow to shareholder returns (2025-2031). This is inclusive of the ongoing £450 million three-year share buyback programme and the continuation of its long-standing policy to pay a sustainable and growing dividend, through which the dividend per share has grown on average by 11% pa since 2017.

Drax expects to allocate up to c.£2 billion to incremental investment, primarily in the flexible and renewable energy the UK needs, as well as opportunities to maximise value from the Drax Power Station site.

Returns to shareholders and investment for growth follow a capital ranking process which aims to maximise risk adjusted returns to shareholders.

Options to invest in growth – FlexGen – flexible, renewable energy

The UK National Energy System Operator’s Future Energy Scenarios indicate a doubling of power demand by 2050, via electrification and new sources of demand, including data centres. At the same time, the continued decarbonisation of the system is leading to a greater reliance on intermittent renewables. The system is becoming cleaner but more volatile, driving a growing need for dispatchable power and system support services, creating long-term earnings opportunities for, and value from, the Group’s FlexGen assets. While the trend is clear, it is hard to forecast from year to year, being dependent on weather and associated renewable activity as much as underlying commodity prices.

This position informs the Group’s view on the value of its FlexGen portfolio and opportunities for growth which can support energy security and the continued deployment of renewables. Since acquisition of the pumped storage and hydro assets in 2018, utilisation of these assets has increased significantly, delivering a five-year payback.

Pumped Storage and Hydro

An £80 million investment to refurbish and upgrade two units at Cruachan Power Station is progressing, with an initial planned outage programme through 2025. The project, which is underpinned by 15-year Capacity Market agreements worth over £220 million (c.£15 million Adj. EBITDA pa), will add 40MW of additional capacity by 2027 and improve unit operations. An additional planned outage programme associated with a transformer upgrade is expected to complete shortly.

OCGTs

Drax expects to take commercial control of the first of the three OCGTs (Hirwaun Power) in Q1 2026. The unit is now commissioning and receiving capacity market payments. The second and third sites are expected to commence commissioning in 2026.This is later than originally planned, primarily due to delays in grid connection by the relevant authorities.

Inclusive of the OCGTs Drax remains committed to its validated SBTi(9) targets and continues to assess options to realise this commitment.

BESS

The Group sees BESS as an important new technology for its FlexGen portfolio, adding fast response capabilities to long duration pumped storage and OCGT assets, which could allow the portfolio to provide a wider range of system support services to the grid.

Drax is developing a GW scale pipeline of BESS opportunities comprised of (1) physical assets and (2) the capabilities to optimise third-party assets with the provision of route to market, floor and tolling structures. In this regard, Drax already provides a route to market for c.2,000 embedded third-party renewable assets with capacity of c.800MW via its Energy Solutions business.

In October 2025, Drax signed an agreement with Apatura Limited (“Apatura”) to acquire three BESS projects, which when fully commissioned will provide capacity totalling 260MW. Drax will pay a fixed amount of £157.2 million in staged payments between 2025 and 2028, reflecting construction milestones and including payments to Apatura linked to their delivery of the projects. The acquisition of the Marfleet (England) and Neilston (Scotland) projects is now complete, with the acquisition of the East Kilbride (Scotland) project expected to be finalised in 2026.

The Group is also assessing options for other renewables, which can complement its FlexGen model.

Options to invest in growth – Drax Power Station Site

The Drax Power Station site comprises over 1,000 acres and 4GW of capacity and grid access, with 2.6GW of active dispatchable generation, cooling systems, and proximity to the UK fibre network.

The Group is focused on options to maximise value from the site, which could utilise multiple generation technologies including its existing biomass generation as well as flexible, renewable energy, to continue to support energy security, while potentially meeting the power demands of a large-scale data centre and in the long-term the potential for carbon removals from BECCS(10).

Data centre

Drax is considering a range of options for the site which could utilise its existing land, grid access, active generation, cooling solutions, site security, location and skilled workforce to meet the needs of data centre developers.

Drax is preparing a planning application to support the potential option for a first phase data centre of c.100MW on land identified at Drax Power Station, using existing infrastructure and transformers previously used to support coal generation to import power directly from the grid (front-of-the-meter). This could support the operation of a data centre at Drax Power Station as soon as 2027.

In November 2025, Drax signed a CfD agreement with the UK Government to provide c.6TWh of biomass generation pa between April 2027 and March 2031 – equivalent to c.30% of baseload output – with a strike price of £109.90/MWh (2012 real). In addition to the option to produce additional merchant generation above the cap and for system support and ancillary services, the agreement includes a mechanism for Drax to request up to 500MW to power a data centre during this period. This is subject to agreement with the UK Government, taking into account a number of factors, including value for money for consumers, energy security, and sustainability.

In the long term Drax is assessing options for over 1GW of data centre capacity, which is expected to utilise existing generation capabilities at Drax Power Station to provide a distributed (behind-the-meter) energy solution with around-the-clock renewable power directly to a data centre under a long-term Power Purchase Agreement, subject to necessary consents.

Any decision to develop data centres at Drax Power Station will require a full assessment of the capital cost and investment case as well as establishment of the commercial and development structures, including joint ventures.

Pellet Production

In the medium term, the Group’s US business is well underpinned by sales into the UK. The Group’s Canadian business, which primarily sells pellets into Asia, is expected to be more challenged, which has contributed to the decision to close Drax’s pellet plant in Williams Lake. Against this backdrop the Group does not currently expect to invest in additional capacity in the short to medium term, including the paused Longview project.

In the long term, Drax remains positive on biomass’ role in industrial decarbonisation and carbon removals via its Elimini business. Drax is continuing to assess options for own-use and third-party sales, from existing and new markets, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which could represent a major market opportunity from 2030 onwards.

Other matters

Drax will report its full year results on Thursday 26 February 2026.

Notes:

Flexible Generation (FlexGen) is currently comprised of the Group’s pumped storage and hydro assets, three OCGT plants which are expected to enter commercial service in 2026 and an Energy Solutions business which provides renewable energy and services to I&C customers as well as a route to market for small renewable assets.

According to IATA, SAF production in 2025 is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), doubling from the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024.
“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry.
“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park.
“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released updated estimates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, highlighting significant challenges for the aviation industry in meeting decarbonisation targets.

According to IATA, SAF production in 2025 is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), doubling from the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024. However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, reaching just 2.4 million tonnes. SAF will account for only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8% in 2026, while the SAF premium is expected to add $3.6 billion (€3.1 billion) in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

This downward revision from earlier forecasts reflects insufficient policy support, high SAF prices — up to five times the cost of fossil-based jet fuel in mandated markets — and underutilised production capacity.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further decarbonisation, regulators need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will actually work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA director general.

Mandates in Europe and the UK have failed to accelerate SAF adoption. In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation framework has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains, forcing airlines to pay up to five times the price of conventional jet fuel without guaranteed supply or consistent documentation. In the UK, SAF mandates have triggered similar price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb significant costs.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Regulators must recognise the current approach is not working and urgently correct course. Announcements alone are not enough – action is required,” Walsh added.

“Current policies are not producing the desired effect. Regulators must ensure SAF production is viable long-term, achieve scale, and bring costs down. Mandates alone have done the opposite, and it would be outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IATA-warns-pic-Biofuel-11-12-5486732-768x576.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 02:56:57.440146

Including coprocessing volumes, biodiesel and renewable diesel production can now equate to more than 10% of Canada’s diesel use.
Tidewater Renewables Ltd., Canada’s first greenfield renewable diesel facility, brought a countervailing (anti-subsidy) and anti-dumping complaint to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal regarding imported U.S. renewable diesel.
However, concerns about an even playing field for Canada’s renewable diesel industry remain.
It’s really value-added manufacturing, more biofuels.” A Level Playing Field The BPI could help level the playing field for Canadian biofuel producers, but Baines is waiting for the final ruling to see what tangible impact the incentive and CFR amendments will have.","In the pursuit of supporting biofuels, both sides of the U.S.-Canada border have implemented incentive structures to encourage the production or use of renewable fuels over fossil fuels. However, the U.S. 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit has proven to be a powerful driver of domestic production by granting producers monetary compensation aligned with a lower CI score. U.S. biofuel producers responded, but with increased production came the need for somewhere to send that fuel. Less than two years before the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Z took effect in 2025, Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations—which incentivize the use of renewable fuels—were rolled out nationwide.

Almost simultaneously with the rollout of 45Z, trade turbulence between the U.S. and Canada began, followed by tensions with China that caused disruptions for Canadian biofuel producers, oilseed processors and farmers. Biofuel producers are encouraging the Canadian government to take a strong stance in support of the domestic industry in response to the United States’ 45Z credit. In September 2025, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced a Biofuels Production Incentive totaling $370 million over two years, designed to support the country’s biofuels industry. At the time, Biodiesel Magazine reported that the incentive would be applied on a per-liter basis to producers of biodiesel and renewable diesel from January 2026 through December 2027, capped at 300 million liters per facility.

Fred Ghatala with Advanced Biofuels Canada calls the BPI a “step toward” addressing the competitive landscape that has emerged in North America. He explains that the complete renewable diesel and biodiesel supply chains—from feedstock origination to processing to end use under Canada’s federal Clean Fuel Regulations and various provincial policies—can now take place in Canada for “one of the first times in the history of the Canadian biofuel sector.” Canada has roughly 2.4 billion liters (634 million gallons) of installed renewable diesel capacity and 500 million liters of installed biodiesel capacity. Including coprocessing volumes, biodiesel and renewable diesel production can now equate to more than 10% of Canada’s diesel use.

With the introduction of the CFR and British Columbia’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Canada became a top destination for renewable fuels due to the monetary incentive created by compliance credit values. Canadian producers have struggled to maintain ongoing production, since U.S. producers can access production credits under 45Z, then export fuel to Canada and also receive credits under the CFR, BC LCFS, and other provincial programs with compliance credit systems.

Tidewater Renewables Ltd., Canada’s first greenfield renewable diesel facility, brought a countervailing (anti-subsidy) and anti-dumping complaint to the Canadian International Trade Tribunal regarding imported U.S. renewable diesel. The Canadian Border Services Agency’s investigation was dropped by the tribunal in early May 2025. However, concerns about an even playing field for Canada’s renewable diesel industry remain.

“Our big irritant has been the unlevel playing field with the U.S. subsidies, being able to get a production subsidy and then also attract the emissions credits on the other side going across a free trade border,” says Jeremy Baines, president and CEO of Tidewater Renewables.

In light of Canada’s endorsement of the Belém 4X Pledge—which aims to quadruple biofuels use by 2035—the BPI aims to stabilize domestic producers while amendments are made to the CFR that provide the sector with a competitive edge and increase production. “Essentially, the BPI helps us survive so that we can thrive in the near- to medium-term to expand and increase agricultural economic resilience, domestic energy security, Canadian GDP and of course reduce GHG emissions in the process,” Ghatala says.

Accompanying the BPI, the Canadian government announced support for canola farmers through updates to the AgriMarketing Program, which promotes Canadian agri-food products, and the Advanced Payments Program, which offers low-interest cash advances of up to 50% of the expected value of eligible products. The announcements included an added $75 million investment in the AgriMarketing Program over five years and an increase in the interest-free limit for canola advances from $250,000 to $500,000 under the Advanced Payments Program.

Canola Complications

The canola industry is also facing trade-related challenges. Canadian canola farmers and processors are seeking new markets after China—Canada’s second-largest market for canola behind the U.S.—closed its doors by implementing prohibitively high tariffs on canola seed, oil and meal. Beginning in March 2025, Canadian producers were unable to ship canola oil and meal to China. Canola seed shipments were cut off in August with the implementation of additional tariffs. As relationships with the U.S.—Canada’s largest trading partner—remain strained following tariffs imposed in early 2025 by the Trump administration, Canadian oilseed processors and farmers need another market, preferably a domestic one.

Markets the size of the U.S. and China are hard to replace, explains Chris Vervaet, representative of the Canola Council and executive director of the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association. However, he says this challenging season could galvanize the pursuit of new opportunities.

Renewable diesel production has the potential to utilize significant amounts of canola. A renewable diesel plant producing 1 billion liters of fuel annually requires roughly 2.5 million metric tons of canola seed when using canola oil as the feedstock. This volume represents about half of what is typically exported to China each year. “That’s the opportunity that we’re chasing, that’s the opportunity that we’re talking about when it comes to biofuels and market diversification,” Vervaet says.

He adds that the CFR is starting to bear fruit; additional renewable diesel capacity has come online, and refiners have announced further investments in coprocessing capacity. Unfortunately, Canada’s renewable diesel industry has encountered headwinds in recent years with the end of the biodiesel blenders tax credit and the implementation of 45Z. Although the biofuels sector has room to expand and utilize the growing amount of canola oil crushed domestically in western provinces such as Saskatchewan, the industry is currently in survival mode, according to Ghatala. “Keeping the lights on” for Canadian biofuel producers is crucial as producers on both sides of the border deal with uncertainty caused by the new variable credit structure based on carbon intensity.

Vervaet explains that—on its own—the BPI does not meet the challenge. “What it does is keep the lights on for some of the existing biofuel facilities in Canada that are making renewable diesel and biodiesel,” he says. “And that’s a good thing, but it doesn’t drive any incremental demand for canola, and in the situation that we find ourselves where the largest, or one of our largest, markets is completely closed for canola, we need more. We need more than just keeping the lights on.”

Ghatala explains that while the U.S. 45Z works as an “exportable trade subsidy,” the BPI does not have the same scope, serving instead as a short-term measure while CFR amendments are made to help domestic producers be competitive in their own market.

Competition and Development

Tidewater has experienced the challenges of competing with imported American fuels firsthand, according to Baines. Completed in 2023 and operating starting in the first quarter of 2024, the facility produces 3,000 barrels per day of renewable diesel. Baines emphasizes that his team is “confident” that their company provides the lowest-cost fuel to its market. “We should be very competitive, and when you have all these imports coming in, really cratering the market and [in] our trade case, the numbers suggested dumped,” says Baines. “It’s not even just at parity price; it’s like they’re [sending] it into our market then we need Canada … to respond or lose that economic activity.”

Baines says historical imports of renewable diesel to British Columbia—Tidewater Renewables’ primary market—doubled from 2022 to 2023 and doubled again from 2023 to 2024. He explains that although Tidewater’s renewable diesel has the lowest delivered cost in B.C., imports are cratering the market, making it difficult to sell the fuel. “We basically had a very unlevel, unfair playing field where you had all this subsidized product that was being moved to Canada,” Baines says.

Tidewater Renewables uses tallow and used cooking oil alongside its primary feedstock, canola oil. Baines explains that Canadian farmers produce roughly 21 million metric tons of canola seed, 6 million tons of which is exported, with 50% to 70% historically going to China. Canada crushes about 15 million tons of canola, sending about 4.9 million tons of canola oil to the U.S. “A huge portion of that goes into the U.S. biofuels industry,” Baines says. “And then it’s been recycled back across the border as the U.S. biofuels have been imported into Canada. So, what do we need to do to find a new domestic sink? It’s really value-added manufacturing, more biofuels.”

A Level Playing Field

The BPI could help level the playing field for Canadian biofuel producers, but Baines is waiting for the final ruling to see what tangible impact the incentive and CFR amendments will have. The province of British Columbia, where Tidewater is located, has been receiving significant volumes of fuel from U.S. producers. The province did increase the required percentage of domestically produced biofuels in its fuel supply, and Baines says he has seen some small benefits to his business from the change.

A “North American ring fence” made up of policies that favor regionally produced feedstocks could help create market diversification opportunities for farmers in both the U.S. and Canada, Vervaet says. “We actually think that makes a lot of sense, and we believe something like that could be in scope for these targeted amendments and could go a long way ensuring that as biofuel production grows in Canada, we see canola’s utilization grow in lockstep.”

Expanding domestic renewable diesel is a strong start toward creating a sink for canola oil, but Baines sees sustainable aviation fuel as the next step. He would like to see the government encourage development of this type of value-added manufacturing rather than relying on exporting canola seed in raw form.

Prioritizing domestic production is a key component of the strategy needed for Canada to follow through on its international decarbonization commitments. Although the government is taking important steps toward developing domestic infrastructure projects—something Ghatala emphasizes is important—the biofuels industry must not be overlooked. “If we’ve all affirmed our commitment to the Belém 4X pledge, it’s essential that we’re able to expand our renewable fuel demand, and we can’t expand demand unless we have viable supply,” he says. “The BPI is helping.”

Airlines in Europe report paying up to five times the cost of conventional jet fuel and double prevailing market prices for SAF, without guaranteed availability or documentation.
Airlines globally are expected to pay a USD 2.9 billion premium for the 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025.
IATA cautions that current policy structures could repeat existing problems, as e-SAF carries an even higher production cost—potentially up to twelve times that of conventional jet fuel.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has issued updated projections for global Sustainable Aviation Fuel output, revealing slower near-term growth and signalling wider concerns about policy structures in major mandated regions. IATA now expects 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) of SAF to be produced in 2025, equivalent to 2.4 billion litres and double the estimated 1 Mt produced in 2024.

Output in 2026 is forecast to reach 2.4 Mt, marking a deceleration relative to previous expectations.

Despite this increase, SAF volumes remain a small proportion of aviation’s fuel demand.

Production in 2025 is projected to account for just 0.6 per cent of global jet fuel consumption, rising marginally to 0.8 per cent the following year.

At prevailing prices, this gap adds substantially to operating costs. IATA calculates a SAF premium of USD 3.6 billion for the airline sector in 2025.

Capacity constraints and policy challenges

IATA’s revised 2025 estimate represents a downward adjustment from earlier forecasts.

The association cites insufficient policy incentives, particularly in mandated markets, to utilise existing capacity fully and stimulate further investment.

SAF prices currently exceed those of fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, rising to as much as five times higher in regions with mandatory blending obligations.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said, “SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry… they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.”

Problems in Europe and the UK

IATA highlights the impact of ReFuelEU Aviation, arguing that limited supply options and concentrated supplier power have pushed prices to unsustainable levels.

Airlines in Europe report paying up to five times the cost of conventional jet fuel and double prevailing market prices for SAF, without guaranteed availability or documentation.

The UK’s mandate has led to similar price spikes, forcing carriers to absorb additional costs.

Airlines globally are expected to pay a USD 2.9 billion premium for the 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025.

Of this total, USD 1.4 billion is attributable to the baseline price difference between SAF and kerosene.

Walsh warned that uneven and fragmented regulation is deterring investment.

He added that many airline commitments, including targets to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030, may need to be reassessed due to the lack of available supply.

Preparing for e-SAF requirements

Attention is now turning to forthcoming e-SAF mandates in the UK from 2028 and the EU from 2030.

IATA cautions that current policy structures could repeat existing problems, as e-SAF carries an even higher production cost—potentially up to twelve times that of conventional jet fuel.

Without incentive-led frameworks, production volumes are unlikely to meet mandated levels, and compliance costs could reach EUR 29 billion by 2032.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/12/10/neste_sustainable_aviation_fuel_-_tunker_truck_at_airport_1.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 02:57:08.602619

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market is gaining significant momentum, driven by airlines and regulations striving for lower emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. As we step into new regulatory environments favoring sustainability, the market is projected to soar, aiming for remarkable figures by 2035. Forecasts indicate that the market will reach an impressive USD 357.41 billion while experiencing a staggering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 65.56% between 2026 and 2035.

Understanding What Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Is

Sustainable aviation fuel is an innovative type of biofuel created from renewable and waste feedstocks. It aligns perfectly with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure, providing a viable alternative to conventional jet fuel. The growing demand is primarily attributed to its ability to slash emissions significantly. With supportive policies and increased investments in advanced bio-refineries, airlines are gradually transitioning toward SAF, making commercial aviation the leading consumer.

Key Highlights of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market

Recent analyses highlight significant trends and segmentation across various categories:

In terms of geography, North America holds the upper hand, commanding over 47.11% of the market share in 2025.

When considering feedstock sources, vegetable oils account for about 36.11% share, reflecting their critical role in SAF production.

The hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology stands out, representing 41.23% of the market share in 2025, showcasing its reliability and maturity.

In application, commercial aviation utilizes SAF the most, with a reported revenue share of 71.09%, while private and business aviation is expected to exhibit growth due to emerging demand.

The direct sales channel to airlines dominates the distribution landscape, indicating a focus on long-term partnerships for steady fuel supply.

The Environmental Benefits of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

One of the most substantial advantages of SAF over fossil fuels lies in its emission reduction capabilities. A life cycle analysis reveals that SAF can lead to a remarkable 87% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions when compared to traditional jet fuels. Also, reductions in particulates and sulfur emissions are reported at rates of 91% and 100%, respectively, marking SAF as a crucial player in the fight against climate change.

Innovative Production Techniques of SAF

The production of sustainable aviation fuels is on an upward trajectory, leveraging various feedstocks like food waste, woody biomass, and waste oils—representing a promising avenue for renewable energy.

Pathways to SAF Production

Here’s a brief overview of the key production pathways:

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA): This technology enables efficient conversion of triglyceride feedstocks into high-quality SAF, sustaining compliance with stringent aviation standards.

Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis: This process transforms various renewable feedstocks, including agricultural residues, into high-purity fuels that align well with global decarbonization efforts.

Alcohol-to-Jet Pathway: It involves converting alcohol derived from sustainable materials into jet fuel, further expanding the feedstock base while maintaining economic feasibility.

The Future Landscape of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

With resources readily available for SAF production, such as corn grain, oils, and other fats, the U.S. Department of Energy argues the potential for tripling biomass output to more than 1 billion tons annually. Such advancements in biomass utilization present opportunities to meet aviation needs while nurturing the environment.

The domestic market is set for expansion, increasing job opportunities within rural communities and improving sustainability practices across multiple sectors. The integration of AI and technology is poised to enhance innovation within the industry, streamlining processes from feedstock selection to production optimization.

Government Initiatives Supporting SAF Development

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry.
The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets.
“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.
Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production showing that in 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) (2.4 billion literers), double the 1 Mt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

VIEWPOINT: Net zero by 2050 — Fuhgeddaboudit

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025. The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

IATA also said mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption. In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation. The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel, IATA said.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably many airlines that have committed to use 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF. Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/Neste-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:56:49.990408

Steven Fitzgerald, Director of Sustainability and Finance at Ryanair, positioned affordable connectivity as “the engine of tourism growth”.
“Sustainable tourism strategy is essential for us”, she said.","The European Parliament hosted yesterday the conference Sustainable Tourism The Challenges of the Decade, an event organised by Portuguese MEP Sérgio Humberto.

Apostolos Tzitzikostas, the European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, opened the discussion by reminding participants of the scale of what is at stake. “Tourism is one of the most important pillars of the European economy”, he said. “Travellers spent more than three billion nights in Europe in 2024, a 50% increase compared with fifteen years ago.”

He noted that this success is powered by more than three million small businesses and 20 million workers, yet the sector is exposed to some of the most complex crises of the decade. Geopolitical instability, hybrid attacks, rising energy prices, climate shocks and pressure on infrastructure all require a new approach. “The challenges we face today are very real”, he said. “We must make sure that local communities and businesses continue to benefit from tourism.”

A historic first for Europe

In his address, the Commissioner made a striking admission. Despite the importance of tourism, Europe had never had a dedicated tourism portfolio in the European Commission and never had a common European tourism strategy.

“For a reason that I cannot understand, even though tourism brings 10% of European GDP, there was not even a Commissioner for tourism”, he said. “I am the first, and hopefully not the last.”

The strategy he will present in spring 2026 is built around three core priorities.

First, ensuring that Europe remains the world’s leading tourist destination. “We are a superpower in tourism” he said. “We have to realise that and work to maintain this position.”

Second, ensuring that the benefits of tourism are genuinely shared by local communities and businesses. This, he stressed, is essential to preventing the rise of anti tourism sentiment. “Tourism only works when communities support it.”

Third, transforming today’s pressures into opportunities by investing in innovation, digital transition, mobility and quality data. This includes creating a new European data space for tourism and strengthening destination management organisations so they can manage flows rather than simply promote destinations.

The Commissioner also highlighted a major challenge. Europe is currently missing around one million workers in tourism. Training, upskilling and talent retention must therefore be placed at the heart of the new strategy. “Sustainability is not only about the environment”, he said. “It is also about the economy, the enterprises, the infrastructure and the jobs.”

He repeatedly referred to Portugal as an example. “You are turning ambition into reality”, he told the Portuguese delegation, praising the country’s forward-looking policies, its sustainability support line and its free training programmes for tourism professionals.

Portugal’s Strategy 2035

Pedro Machado, Portugal’s Secretary of State for Tourism, Commerce and Services, explained how the national Strategy 2035 aligns with the new European vision. Portugal will present its full framework by the end of 2025, and the goal is clear. The country wants to combine stronger growth with more balanced territorial development, better data sharing and decisive climate action.

Machado described tourism as part of a “virtuous triangle” that links sustainable economic growth, territorial cohesion and climate responsibility. With an average annual growth target of 6% for the next decade, tourism could reach close to 20% of Portugal’s GDP by 2035.

Central to this approach is ensuring that communities feel the benefits of tourism. Better distribution of wealth, stronger local participation and new opportunities in low-density territories were repeatedly emphasised. “Tourism must be interpreted as a powerful instrument to compensate for the development gaps of more distant territories”, Machado said.

Climate adaptation is another pillar. Water scarcity, extreme weather and ecological stress are already affecting destinations. “We have to look at resources differently,” he said, noting that sustainability must be understood as the management of natural capital as much as the deployment of technology. Artificial intelligence can support decision-making, but only if it serves people.

Machado also stressed the vital role of mobility and connectivity for peripheral countries. Aviation remains essential for Portugal’s accessibility, and the country must work with European partners to ensure that sustainability objectives do not undermine the right to travel.

Digitalisation, innovation and artificial intelligence permeate the Strategy 2035. More than half of Portugal’s future flagship measures are technology-driven, focusing on efficiency, data and smarter services. Yet Machado insisted that technology remains a tool. “Talking about tourism is not just talking about destinations” he said. “It is talking about values and about people.”

Airlines, airports and hospitality in transition

The conference ALSO brought together Ryanair, ANA Aeroportos de Portugal and HOTREC, providing a practical dimension to the policy discussions.

Steven Fitzgerald, Director of Sustainability and Finance at Ryanair, positioned affordable connectivity as “the engine of tourism growth”. He warned that the cost of the green transition risks falling disproportionately on families and regional economies. Sustainable aviation fuel remains scarce and extremely costly, and ETS charges continue to rise. “Policies that simply make flying more expensive do not reduce emissions”, he said. “They reduce accessibility.”

He called for more European investment in the production of sustainable aviation fuel, stronger incentives and a shift away from punitive cost mechanisms.

Thierry Ligonnière, President of ANA Aeroportos de Portugal, described how connectivity has transformed the country over the last decade. Portuguese airports now handle close to 69 million passengers a year, supporting more than 21 billion euros in tourism impact. Lisbon’s airport is, however, facing a severe capacity limit, and the new airport announced for the capital region is now a priority.

Ligonnière stressed that airport growth must be compatible with environmental and social sustainability. ANA aims to reach carbon neutrality well before 2030 and has already reduced water consumption per passenger by nearly half. “There is no growth that is not sustainable”, he said.

Representing the hospitality sector, Marta Machado, Deputy Director General of HOTREC, reminded participants that 90% of tourism businesses are micro companies. They face high energy costs, digital platform pressures, labour shortages and a heavy regulatory burden. She called for better access to financing, realistic legislative timetables and stronger enforcement of EU rules on short-term rentals and online platforms. “Sustainable tourism strategy is essential for us”, she said. “It must give companies the tools to lead the green, social and digital transition.”

A strategy shaped beyond Brussels

As the conference closed, Sérgio Humberto underlined that the discussion in Brussels would not stay in the Parliament bubble. “Our objective is to bring this debate to the whole territory and beyond our borders”, he said. If the ambition expressed in the European Parliament is matched by concrete action, the coming decade could see Europe move from fragmented efforts to a coherent strategy where tourism remains a force for prosperity, sustainability and cohesion.",https://traveltomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-10-at-09.53.38.jpeg#163257,N,,2025-12-10 21:56:18.182312

As we look ahead to 2026, the global biofuels market is entering a period of rapid change. These shifts will be shaped by evolving policy frameworks, tightening feedstock availability, and intensifying demand from hard-to-abate sectors.

Here are the top five insights shaping the 2026 biofuels landscape.

1. Policy Tightening Around Waste Oils Will Fundamentally Reshape Feedstock Flows

Several global regions are implementing stricter rules on used cooking oil (UCO) imports and traceability. The EU’s increasing scrutiny of Asian-origin UCO, along with broader concerns about fraudulent feedstock reporting and anti-dumping rulings, is tightening compliance requirements across the board.

These changes will directly impact trade flows into Europe by raising the bar on documentation and verification. This will also put pressure on producers dependent on imported waste oils.

As these developments show, policy is no longer just a background factor in the biofuels market. It's one of the primary market drivers for 2026.

2. SAF Demand Continues Climbing, While Blending Timing is Becoming More Seasonal

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains one of the fastest-growing segments, driven largely by mandates and airline commitments. But the webinar highlighted an emerging pattern: buyers increasingly delay blending until the second half of the year, leading to a seasonal “catch-up” effect.

Related: UK SAF Prices Jump Over 60% as Demand Surges

This behavior is likely to persist into 2026 as buyers optimize credit positions, navigate uncertain pricing, and respond to evolving compliance rules. SAF demand will stay strong. But supply planning will become more complex and uneven through the year.

3. Renewable Diesel Markets Face Continued Volatility with Margin Pressure and Imports

Renewable diesel (HVO/RD) markets are feeling the strain from multiple factors:

Fluctuating Feedstock Prices

Uncertain Import Volumes

Tightening Renewable Fuel Standards

While demand remains resilient, margins are sensitive. And producers are paying closer attention to trade developments from the US, Asia, and the Middle East.

Expect 2026 to bring greater emphasis on flexible feedstock strategies, diversification of supply chains, and heightened sensitivity to regulatory shifts in major producing regions.

4. Biofuel Producers Will Prioritize Reliable, Scalable Feedstocks

One of the strongest themes in the webinar was that producers are shifting away from purely cost-driven feedstock procurement. Instead, they are focusing on:

Long-Term Supply Security

Robust Sustainability Documentation

Scalable Volumes Tolerant of Policy Tightening

The convergence of fraud concerns, import restrictions, and rising verification costs means that buyers are placing a premium on trusted supply partners rather than opportunistic sourcing. This shift will deepen in 2026, especially for UCO, tallow, and other key waste-based fats.

5. The Market is Preparing for a Major Cross-Commodity Scramble

SAF, e-Fuels, and renewable diesel are all competing for the same limited waste-oil and bio-intermediate pools. Accordingly, pressure across the value chain is intensifying.

The webinar noted that inter-sector competition for feedstocks is already reshaping price signals. This is particularly strong where obligations are the most prevalent, such as aviation.

This multi-sector pull on finite supplies is expected to escalate through 2026. It will place upward pressure on premium waste oils and increase the need for advanced verification and logistics solutions.

Ultimately, this convergence of demand means that producers, traders, and obligated parties will need more streamlined sourcing strategies, more transparent partnerships, and deeper biofuels market intelligence to stay ahead.

2026: Rewards Ahead for Early Planners and Adopters

The 2026 biofuels market will be shaped by the interaction of tightening policy, constrained feedstock availability, and accelerating demand from aviation and renewable diesel.

Industry players that invest early in documentation, risk management, and diversified supply chains will be better positioned to maintain compliance. Doing so will also protect their margins in a more competitive environment.

The forecast shows that airlines are strengthening resilience even as operating conditions remain uneven. With passenger numbers projected to reach 5.2 billion in 2026, airlines are benefiting from sustained demand and high load factors. The industry is also taking advantage of steady macroeconomic conditions, including stable GDP growth and easing inflation.

Aviation’s Profit Outlook

IATA expects operating profit to climb to USD 72.8 billion in 2026, improving from USD 67 billion in 2025 as revenues rise to USD 1.053 trillion.

The net profit per passenger is forecast at USD 7.90, which remains below the 2023 peak but aligns with 2025 results. Load factors will continue to set records, reaching 83.8% due to tight global capacity and slow aircraft deliveries.

Return on invested capital is estimated to hold at 6.8%, still short of the industry’s weighted average cost of capital.

This gap demonstrates a long-term challenge, as airlines generate high economic value yet often fail to earn returns comparable to suppliers such as engine and avionics manufacturers.

Revenue Trends in Aviation

Passenger ticket revenue is expected to rise 4.8% to USD 751 billion, supported by a nearly 5% expansion in revenue passenger kilometers.

Yields are forecast to remain stable as airlines balance demand with constrained supply. Cargo revenue is projected to reach USD 158 billion, driven by strong e-commerce flows and semiconductor shipments that continue to support AI-driven industries.

Ancillary revenue will increase to USD 145 billion, representing nearly 14% of total airline income. These gains reflect the growing role of paid add-ons, flexible travel options, and premium service upgrades across markets.

Cost Pressures

Fuel costs are expected to ease slightly to USD 252 billion in 2026 due to lower crude prices, though jet fuel will not fall as sharply because of a widening crack spread.

Non-fuel costs, however, will continue rising as labor, maintenance, and leasing expenses increase. Labor costs now account for 28% of total expenses, driven by strong wage growth and ongoing training demands.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel procurement and CORSIA-related compliance are also adding costs.

The industry expects to use 2.4 million tonnes of SAF in 2026, representing 0.8% of total fuel consumption but contributing significantly to incremental spending.

Bottom Line

The 2026 outlook confirms that airlines are entering a phase of steady, but not spectacular, profitability. This table summarizes public opinion data from an IATA survey, showing how travelers view the role of the global airline industry.

Strong demand, record load factors, and stable revenue streams are supporting margins, yet the industry still faces structural challenges, including stagnant returns on capital, supply chain bottlenecks, and rising regulatory burdens.

Despite these issues, airlines continue to deliver economic value and maintain confidence among travelers, who overwhelmingly view air travel as essential and beneficial.

That leaves an export gap of about 160 million gallons, worth an estimated $300 million for U.S. suppliers.
Malaysia has also moved to strengthen market competitiveness for U.S. ethanol.

Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade has approved a new roadmap that will expand ethanol blending across all road fuels. The plan increases national integration of ethanol to 5% (E5) and 10% (E10) blends, marking one of the most significant shifts in the country’s fuel policy in years.

The announcement follows years of technical cooperation and policy support from the U.S. Grains & BioProducts Council and USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service. Their work focused on broadening Vietnam’s ethanol mandate and lowering tariff barriers for U.S. exports.

Beginning in January, fuel distributors in Vietnam will start converting all RON95 gasoline—currently 80% of the market and containing no ethanol—to E10. Full compliance for RON95 is required by June 1. The remaining 20% of the market, E5 RON92, may continue until 2030, though distributors may voluntarily move to E10 earlier. All RON92 must shift to E10 by 2031.

Caleb Wurth, the Council’s regional director for Southeast Asia and Oceania, said the policy marks a turning point for U.S. producers. He noted that Vietnam’s entire gasoline pool—2.7 billion gallons annually—will now require ethanol. He said the country’s fuel ethanol demand will rise to 243 million gallons starting in June, with domestic output at roughly 84 million gallons. That leaves an export gap of about 160 million gallons, worth an estimated $300 million for U.S. suppliers.

Malaysia has also moved to strengthen market competitiveness for U.S. ethanol. Under the U.S.–Malaysia Reciprocal Trade Agreement announced in October, Malaysia has eliminated the import duty on U.S. denatured ethanol. The tariff on undenatured ethanol will be gradually reduced over nine years until it reaches zero.

Wurth said the agreement clears the way for importers and blenders in Malaysia to use denatured ethanol for future applications in gasoline, sustainable aviation fuel and marine fuels. With Malaysia consuming 4.5 billion gallons of gasoline annually—the second-largest gasoline market in Southeast Asia—he said the move represents an important step toward a cleaner energy future in the country.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ethanol-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 17:56:55.021121

SAF production will slow in 2026, according to the latest IATA forecast. Many airlines have pledged to do 10% of their flying with SAF by 2030, but that doesn't seem likely now. IATA director general Willie Walsh said on Dec. 9 at IATA's Global Media Day, ""I believe those figures are going to be impossible to achieve.""

Among the airlines that have established 10% SAF targets by 2030 are Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, Air France-KLM and the collective membership of the Oneworld alliance, which includes American, Alaska Airlines and British Airways.

Air New Zealand this year became the first global carrier to back away from a 2030 sustainability commitment, saying that a supply shortfall will make them unachievable. Walsh predicted many others will follow.

IATA projects that global SAF production this year will be 634 million gallons, nearly double last year's figure. Next year, an estimated 800 million gallons of SAF will be produced, a percentage growth of 26%.

SAF production this year will account for just 0.6% of global jet fuel consumption and will increase to an estimated 0.8% next year.

IATA has sharply opposed mandates that went into effect this year in the U.K. and EU, requiring SAF to account for 2% of fuel supply. At the IATA meeting, Walsh said large fuel producers have exploited the mandates to price gauge on SAF, which has diminished demand. IATA says prices of SAF in the U.S. are approximately five times conventional kerosene-based jet fuel. There's an additional price premium of approximately 20% in the in the EU and U.K.

The U.S. leads the world in SAF production, with upwards of 50% more production than Europe, a state of affairs that IATA attributes, at least in part, to the approach of the U.S. federal government and some U.S. states to providing tax incentives for SAF production, rather than enforcing mandates.

Congress and the Trump administration extended federal SAF incentives this year, though at a lower incentive rate than the Biden administration.

Airlines globally have committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with 65% of the reductions to come from a ramp-up of SAF usage.

Walsh said he believes the goal is still achievable. ""I believe 2050 is still possible but getting more and more challenging,"" he said.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/All_TW_Art/Shutterstock_Art/2019/AirlineEmissions.jpg?n=2311&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-12-10 16:56:48.600210

One critical caveat: the law bans the crediting of residues from palm oil production starting in 2027, which creates a narrow window.
""Single-counted, no more double-counting = bullish for POME because the plants will run more,"" said one Singapore-based biofuel trader, referring to palm oil mill effluent.","The German Cabinet on Dec. 10 approved a sweeping draft law to reform the country's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Quota (THG-Quote), setting an ambitious long-term trajectory to reduce fuel emissions by 59% by 2040, integrating binding Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandates, and introducing stringent new fraud prevention measures that could reshape European biofuel trade flows.

The ""Second Law for the Further Development of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Quota"" is designed to implement the EU's RED III directive and the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation into national law. It aims to provide investment security for producers of advanced biofuels and green hydrogen while cracking down on fraudulent imports that have plagued the market in recent years.

Market activity across the biofuels complex in recent weeks has been suppressed amid ongoing speculation about the expected timeline for implementing Germany's RED III bill. The German Cabinet was initially scheduled to discuss the legislation in the first week of October, with the aim of transposing it ahead of Jan. 1, 2026.

Subsequently, however, the Cabinet postponed reaching a decision on the bill week to week, amid a reported lack of consensus among the key ministries involved in drafting the bill.

As a result, the available window for the bill to pass this year through both the lower and upper houses of Germany's parliament, known respectively as the Bundestag and Bundesrat, has now become too tight. Consequently, the legislation will be passed into law in 2026, with most, but not all, policies within instructed to take effect retroactively from Jan. 1, 2026.

Ambitious quota trajectory

According to the draft text seen by S&P Global Energy, the headline GHG reduction obligation for fuel suppliers is expected to rise significantly from current levels. The law sets a fixed trajectory extending well beyond the previous 2030 horizon:

2026: 12%

2030: 25%

2035: 36%

2040: 59%

This effectively mandates a near-total decarbonization of the fuel mix by 2040, requiring a renewable energy share of approximately 62% in the transport sector.

End of double counting

The draft law confirms the elimination of the ""double counting"" mechanism for advanced biofuels. The government argues that market availability is now sufficient and that double-counting artificially inflates quota compliance without delivering real physical emissions reductions.

Additionally, the government confirmed that the double crediting of advanced biofuels will cease from Jan. 1, 2026, onwards despite the reality that the bill will not pass formally into law until later in the year.

The sub-quota for advanced biofuels, without the application of double counting, will also be raised:

2026: 2.0% (up from current mandates)

2030: 3.5%

2040: 9.0%

Crackdown on fraud and palm oil

In a direct response to recent scandals involving suspected fraudulent biofuel imports from Asia, the draft legislation introduces a ""protection of integrity"" clause. Crucially, renewable fuels will only be eligible for the quota if on-site inspections by competent authorities are permitted at the production facilities. This applies to both biofuels and Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs).

""Renewable fuels are only eligible for credit if on-site inspections by state inspectors are possible,"" the draft states, signaling a move away from reliance solely on third-party voluntary certification schemes.

Furthermore, the bill codifies the complete exclusion of palm oil-based biofuels from the quota. This ban extends to residues and waste materials from palm oil production—such as palm oil mill effluent (POME)—closing loopholes that regulators feared were being used to cross-subsidize unsustainable palm production.

That said, the draft law further stipulates that the requirement for on-site audits will only become effective from 2027 onwards, reflecting the complexity of retroactively implementing certain policies into law.

Similarly, taking effect from 2027, is the complete exclusion of palm oil-based biofuels from the quota. This ban extends to residues and waste materials from palm oil production -- such as palm oil mill effluent (POME) -- closing loopholes that regulators feared were being used to cross-subsidize unsustainable palm production. Fuels derived from palm-oil-based residues and waste will remain eligible for quota in the 2026 commitment year, however.

New RFNBO, SAF mandates, maritime excluded

For the first time, Germany is introducing a dedicated sub-quota for RFNBOs (green hydrogen and synthetic fuels) across all transport modes, replacing the previous sector-specific targets. This quota begins at 0.1% in 2026, increasing to 1.2% by 2030 and reaching 8.0% by 2040.

The use of RFNBOs will be further incentivised by a multiplier, set at 3x from 2024 onwards, 2.5x from 2037, and gradually falling to 1x by 2040.

The legislation also formally integrates the ReFuelEU Aviation mandates into German law, requiring aviation fuel suppliers to blend a minimum share of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and synthetic kerosene. Penalties for non-compliance in the aviation sector are set at steep levels to ensure enforcement: EUR 4,700 per metric ton for missing SAF volumes and EUR 17,000/mt for missing synthetic aviation fuel volumes.

Conversely, the international shipping sector will not be obligated under the RED III mandate in Germany, in contrast to plans for neighbouring market Belgium and the Netherlands.

Market impact

The reforms are expected to increase compliance costs for fuel suppliers by approximately EUR 2.7 billion in 2030. However, the Federal Ministry for the Environment (BMUKN) argues this is necessary to drive ""real"" decarbonization and spur domestic investment in electrolyzers and advanced biofuel plants.

POME (palm oil mill effluent)—historically a second-tier feedstock—becomes the marginal source. Indonesian and Malaysian producers currently banking on double-counting benefits face an immediate viability crunch unless they can ramp volumes or negotiate offtake agreements. Conversely, POME processors with existing European supply relationships expect 20%–30% price appreciation as fuel suppliers scramble for any eligible advanced feedstock to backfill the multiplier loss.

One critical caveat: the law bans the crediting of residues from palm oil production starting in 2027, which creates a narrow window. POME demand is expected to surge in 2026–27, but regulatory headwinds are anticipated to emerge thereafter. Smart traders will front-load POME commitments before the 2027 restriction becomes tighter, increasing compliance.

Market participants tracking the legislation note the move is immediately bullish for advanced feedstock demand. ""Single-counted, no more double-counting = bullish for POME because the plants will run more,"" said one Singapore-based biofuel trader, referring to palm oil mill effluent. ""The elimination of double-counting multipliers will force fuel suppliers to source substantially more actual physical biofuel volume starting mid-2026, tightening feedstock markets across Asia-Pacific.""

The draft law will now proceed to the Bundestag for parliamentary approval, with the legislative process expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from Oct 1 that year.
Mr Walsh stressed that robust accounting measures must be in place to prevent the double counting of different types of emissions.
Scope 1 emissions are produced directly by a company’s operations while Scope 2 emissions result from its purchase of electricity.
Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist, said Singapore’s SAF levy was “probably better” than a mandate.","– The roll-out of the green jet fuel levy for passengers flying out of Singapore will be closely watched to see if it can effectively stimulate production of the fuel, said the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) chief Willie Walsh.

He said that while he instinctively does not like levies, he is optimistic that Singapore’s approach could result in the desired outcome of stimulating production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The airline industry body is also watching to see if such a model can be replicated in other parts of the world, Mr Walsh said during IATA’s global media day in Geneva, Switzerland, on Dec 9. “I think we’re all looking to see what happens in Singapore because it would be great if it proved to be an effective model for stimulating the growth of production. So I remain optimistic that we will see a positive outcome from the levy,” he said.

Passengers flying out of Singapore from October 2026 will pay a levy of between $1 and $41.60 that will go towards the purchase of SAF, which is typically made from waste materials such as used cooking oil and animal fat and can cost two to five times more than traditional jet fuel.

The levy will apply to tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore from Oct 1 that year.

The SAF will be blended with traditional aviation fuel and used to refuel planes at Changi and Seletar airports. The target is for SAF to constitute 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at the two airports in 2026, with the goal of reaching 3 per cent to 5 per cent by 2030.

Mr Walsh stressed that robust accounting measures must be in place to prevent the double counting of different types of emissions.

Scope 1 emissions are produced directly by a company’s operations while Scope 2 emissions result from its purchase of electricity. Scope 3 emissions arise indirectly from a company’s supply chain, including its suppliers and customers.

Mr Walsh gave the example of a corporate customer claiming an SAF-related reduction for its Scope 3 emissions while the same reduction also counts towards an airline’s Scope 1 emissions.

If the reduction in emissions is double counted, it would undermine the credibility of these schemes, he added.

Dr Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist, said Singapore’s SAF levy was “probably better” than a mandate.

The association does not “necessarily appreciate monopoly buyers” as this removes the possibility for airlines to negotiate their own fuel purchases on their own terms, she added.

But Dr Thomsen said that as the production and adoption of SAF is not making much progress globally, IATA will “see if this (levy) can actually work” in Singapore and trust that the country will course-correct if it does not deliver the desired results.

IATA said on Dec 9 that SAF production is projected to rise to 2.4 million tonnes in 2026, constituting 0.8 per cent of total fuel consumption. In 2025, 1.9 million tonnes of such fuel is expected to be produced, slightly lower than the initial forecast of 2 million tonnes, as planned production has faltered.

Planned maintenance at major refineries, including at Finnish biofuel producer Neste’s facility in Singapore, is also temporarily reducing available supply.

Dr Thomsen said more capital should be pumped into emerging technologies to boost SAF production, such as synthetic fuels and alcohols like ethanol, as most SAF output in 2026 is expected to be made from waste materials.

On Singapore as an aviation hub, Mr Walsh said that while the country is very convenient as an intermediate point, it is becoming more expensive in terms of operational costs. He cited higher airport charges and continuing challenges in recruiting and retaining people to support the expansion of the airport and airlines as potential risks for Singapore.

Passengers and airlines at Changi Airport are

set to pay higher fees and levies in the coming years,

which will fund a $3 billion improvement plan across its four terminals and cover rising operating costs in areas such as energy and labour.

“I don’t think it’s a particular problem that we face today, but I think based on what we’re seeing, it could be a challenge for Singapore in the years ahead,” Mr Walsh said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/b1bf2b6b411a0367fb0fde089b6a807ab8a027848ec2645b0dbdea93c718d75a,N,,2025-12-10 17:57:10.208636

What do ultra-long-haul flights mean for the climate?","Taking an astonishing 29 hours, the world’s longest flight made its record-breaking debut this month.

China Eastern Airlines operates the marathon link between Shanghai and Buenos Aires, with a short stopover in Auckland.

The inaugural service departed Shanghai Pudong International Airport on 4 December. The southbound journey takes just over 25 hours, while the return to China stretches to roughly 29 hours in the prevailing winds.

Operated by a 316-seat Boeing 777-300ER, the twice-weekly service covers around 20,700 kilometres and lands at Ezeiza International Airport outside the Argentine capital.

A new ‘southbound corridor’ between three continents

China Eastern has described its new flight as a step toward creating an “Air Silk Road” connecting Asia with Oceania and South America.

Around 55,000 Chinese nationals live in Argentina, making it a key market for the airline.

Prices range from €1,320 to €1,950 in economy to about €4,200 for business class.

The carrier says the new “southbound corridor” links opposite ends of the Pacific and strengthens travel options between three continents.

What are the world’s longest flights?

The flight also reflects how rapidly ultra-long-haul travel is expanding. Powered by lighter aircraft and better fuel efficiency, airlines are seeking direct links between far-flung regions – even, as China Eastern puts it, “antipodal” destinations.

The new journey joins a small but growing group of ultra-long-haul routes already in the skies.

Singapore Airlines currently operates the longest non-stop service, connecting Singapore and New York’s JFK Airport.

The eastbound and return flight last about 18 hours and are flown in an ultra-long-range Airbus A350, a type of plane that can remain airborne for nearly 18,000 kilometres. The airline also offers a slightly shorter Singapore-Newark service.

Other airlines maintain routes that regularly exceed 15 hours. Qatar Airways links Doha and Auckland, while Qantas operates two major long-hauls: Perth to London Heathrow and Melbourne to Dallas Fort Worth.

All fall within the ultra-long-haul category, defined as flights lasting 16 hours or more.

Ultra-long-haul flights: What’s next for air travel?

Soon, travellers unbothered by extremes can take even lengthier journeys.

Qantas plans to introduce its ‘Project Sunrise’ routes either in late 2026 or 2027. Using specially configured Airbus A350-1000s fitted with additional fuel tanks, Qantas will offer non-stop flights from Sydney to London and Sydney to New York, with journey times expected to range between 19 and 22 hours.

The aircraft are due for delivery in October 2026, with Sydney-London expected to be the first departure.

Other long-haul additions are also planned for 2026, although China Eastern’s eye-reddening journey is likely to be the only one long enough to watch an entire season of your favourite show.

Etihad will introduce a new Abu Dhabi-Charlotte service in May, expanding its US network with near-15-hour flights. Delta is set to launch its first nonstop route between Atlanta and Riyadh in late 2026.

Meanwhile, Ireland’s Aer Lingus will expand its transatlantic network with a new Dublin-Raleigh Durham route and British Airways is adding extra flights to Miami and Bangkok and reopening seasonal links to Jamaica.

What do ultra-long-haul flights mean for the climate?

This upward trend may tickle travellers fascinated by the experience of flying, but it’s bad news for the climate.

Taking one long-haul flight generates more carbon emissions than many people around the world produce in a whole year – and more than an average European emits with heating their home and eating – according to campaign group Stay Grounded.",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/57/82/05/1200x675_cmsv2_985eb726-c387-5432-aca9-a97d9bdfd112-9578205.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 12:57:37.664292

AI-driven personalization is redefining the passenger experience. For decades, flying was largely transactional – moving travelers efficiently from point A to point B. Today, airlines recognize the economic and experiential value of tailoring offers and services to individual preferences and travel contexts.

AI-driven personalization now spans dynamic pricing, targeted promotions, in-flight entertainment, loyalty engagement, and real-time chatbots. The goal is clear: increase satisfaction and yield by aligning experiences with each traveler’s unique profile. Leading carriers such as Lufthansa, Delta, and JetBlue are already deploying advanced data platforms that connect digital, operational, and service touchpoints to create seamless journeys.

Yet this growing intimacy comes with a dual challenge. On one hand, AI enables unprecedented understanding of traveler behavior. On the other, it risks eroding privacy and trust when data is over-collected, shared with partners, or monetized externally. The core dilemma is how to personalize responsibly while maintaining profitability in an industry of thin margins and price-sensitive customers.

Balancing privacy and profitability

Running an effective personalization program means reconciling two opposing forces: protecting customer privacy and maximizing revenue. Regulations such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) impose strict limits on profiling and automated decision-making.

Meanwhile, airlines must still compete on differentiated offers and personalized pricing.Traditional ‘segment of one’ personalization often relies on detailed user profiles – precisely what GDPR seeks to limit. Overly individualized targeting risks breaching principles of transparency, purpose limitation, and data minimization. Conversely, cautious approaches can dilute marketing precision and revenue potential.

Quad Advisory’s Personalized AI (PAI) system offers a solution grounded in optimization and privacy. Drawing on deep revenue-management expertise, it balances personalization depth with responsible data design through a framework built on multidimensional microsegments.

Microsegments: Contextual personalization without intrusion

A key principle of the PAI system is that personalization does not require knowing every traveler individually. Instead, it organizes passengers into microsegments – groups of travelers with similar behavioral and contextual attributes – while anonymizing identities. Each microsegment integrates both customer features (purpose of travel, purchase behavior, seasonality) and airline features (route, market, channel, point of sale, agent, competition, Equipment).

This dual-lens approach enables demand forecasting and dynamic pricing that reflect both customer intent and profit optimization. For example, two passengers with similar demographics might belong to different microsegments if they travel in distinct markets such as the US and Europe, where pricing dynamics diverge. Likewise, a business traveler may shift segments when booking a short domestic trip versus an international family vacation.

At the computational level, each microsegment is powered by tensor-based AI models, enabling rapid processing of large datasets while preserving privacy. The system continuously learns from new data, adjusting forecasts and recommendations without referencing personal identifiers. This design delivers contextual accuracy – ‘personalization with privacy.’

A major Asian carrier, for example, used the PAI system to unify its domestic and international pricing and sales promotion models. By clustering routes into 500 microsegments instead of millions of individual profiles, it increased total revenue while running promotions and price cuts in critical microsegments – a demonstration that discounts and revenue increase can coexist when personalization is mathematically structured.

Aligning short-term revenue with long-term loyalty

Effective personalization must serve two key objectives: near-term yield and long-term loyalty. The PAI system enables airlines to set optimization goals for each microsegment— maximizing revenue in some while emphasizing retention or share growth in others.

Quad’s research identifies multiple strategic personalization scenarios, ranging from high-impact revenue opportunities to cases that demand product or pricing redesign. By classifying microsegments into these scenarios, the PAI system ensures that marketing and pricing efforts focus where personalization delivers the greatest economic and experiential value.

Enterprise-wide Personalization

A defining feature of Quad’s approach is consistency across the organization.

Insights derived from microsegments inform both strategic and operational decisions:

Executives use them to shape revenue and loyalty strategies.

Marketing and pricing teams apply them to campaigns and dynamic offers.

Frontline agents rely on them for tailored upgrades or service recovery gestures.

This vertical integration ensures that personalization is not confined to marketing but is embedded across all customer touchpoints.

Agentic AI: the new frontier and its risks A new wave of Agentic AI – autonomous systems capable of executing complex commercial actions – is beginning to transform airline operations. Agentic AI can autonomously manage offers, bookings, and service recovery, dynamically adjusting prices or even completing reservations on behalf of travelers. While this autonomy promises efficiency and speed, it introduces new risks, including opaque decision-making, unintended biases, privacy exposure, and suboptimal financial outcomes if not properly constrained.

Unsupervised or heuristic-driven agentic systems may prioritize short-term conversion over long-term profitability or compliance. To counter this, Quad’s PAI system embeds quantitative optimization layers that bound agentic actions within measurable, profit-driven, and policy-compliant limits. By integrating mathematical rigor and interpretability into autonomous personalization, it ensures that AI agents act within quantifiable business and ethical constraints – protecting both traveler privacy and airline revenue integrity.

The regulatory dimension: ethical AI in aviation

AI-based personalization can easily cross regulatory lines if implemented without transparency or consent. Large language models (LLMs), increasingly used for conversational and recommendation interfaces, intensify the risk. These models can infer sensitive traits such as health status or behavioral tendencies, even from minimal data.

As airlines adopt autonomous and agentic AI for pricing, disruption management, and service automation, maintaining data protection by design is crucial. Decisions about how much autonomy to grant AI systems – and how much transparency to enforce – will define the next generation of responsible personalization.Compliance with GDPR and similar frameworks is not optional; it is the foundation of digital trust.

The study, Enabling Hydrogen in the European Aviation Market, found that hydrogen in aviation offers a unique opportunity to achieve both emissions reduction and market expansion. The analysis shows that introducing hydrogen alongside Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can accelerate progress towards net zero, particularly when policy incentives reward low-carbon fuels and if hydrogen were to be included within the EU’s SAF mandate1.

The research also found that targeted hydrogen infrastructure at around 20 major European airports, including Heathrow, could deliver more than 80% of the emissions benefits of full hydrogen availability across the continent. Concentrating investment at key ‘hydrogen hubs’ would therefore provide a practical and cost-effective path to early adoption.

Further modelling indicates that the earlier novel technologies, such as hydrogen, can be introduced, the more opportunity they present for CO2 emission reductions, underscoring the value of early technological transition where it is financially and technically viable.

The study is underpinned by UCL ATSLab’s Airline Behaviour Model (ABM), which represents the complexity of airline decision-making through specific behavioural variables. Building on this, the research evaluates how fuel costs, incentives and new technologies shape airline responses. This provides a research-based, realistic picture of how hydrogen adoption could evolve, highlighting both opportunities and potential challenges for adoption.

Prof. Hervé Morvan, Chief of Future Platforms, Group R&T, Rolls-Royce, says: While our immediate opportunities lie with increased engine efficiency and SAF adoption, by continuing the industry’s development of hydrogen propulsion and strategic infrastructure investment, we stand to achieve net-zero faster while protecting the vital economic benefits that aviation brings. This research demonstrates hydrogen’s potential to deliver substantial emissions reductions and growth advantages as part of a diverse long term technology strategy.”

Lahiru Ranasinghe, Director of Sustainability, easyJet, says: This study outlines the importance of hydrogen as one of the solutions that can help accelerate decarbonisation and support economic growth at the same time. There are many technological and infrastructure challenges to overcome, however we continue to see progress and we remain committed to playing an active role on this journey.”

Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy, Heathrow, says: It’s exciting to see the study confirm how hydrogen infrastructure at a small number of major airports could deliver most of the carbon benefits of hydrogen aircraft adoption. At Heathrow, we’re preparing to support multiple measures to address aviation emissions, ensuring safe and effective adoption as soon as these technologies arrive.”

Dr Khan Doyme, Senior Research Fellow, Air Transportation Systems Lab, says: Our modelling shows that hydrogen and SAF together can deliver both sector growth and decarbonisation. Coordinated action between manufacturers, airlines and airports will be essential to realise hydrogen’s full potential.”

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Outlook 2025

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Market Outlook, developed in close collaboration with ICF today. This year’s edition highlights both the progress made and the important steps still needed to ensure a resilient, scalable SAF industry capable of meeting long-term decarbonization goals.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Production

SAF can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks including, but not limited to, the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks. SAF production is in its early stages, with three known commercial producers:

World Energy began SAF production in 2016 at its Paramount, California, facility and initially supplied fuel to Los Angeles International Airport prior to supplying additional California airports.

International producer Neste began supplying SAF to San Francisco International Airport in 2020 before expanding to other California airports in 2021 and 2022, as well as Aspen/Pitkin County Airport and Telluride Regional Airport, both in Colorado.

Montana Renewables LLC began production in partnership with Shell at an existing petroleum production plant in 2023, supplying fuel to several partner airlines.

Additional new domestic plants are expected. Many airlines have signed agreements with existing and future SAF producers to use all their expected output. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) collects renewable fuel data as part of the Renewable Fuel Standard, which provides an approximate consumption for novel biofuels such as SAF. EPA's data show that approximately 5 million gallons of SAF were consumed in 2021, 15.84 million gallons in 2022, and 24.5 million gallons in 2023.

There are multiple technology pathways to produce fuels approved by ASTM and blending limitations based on these pathways. ASTM D7566 Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons dictates fuel quality standards for non-petroleum-based jet fuel and outlines approved SAF-based fuels and the percent allowable in a blend with Jet A. All three existing plants use the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids pathway shown in the table on this page. New domestic plants using the alcohol-to-jet pathway with ethanol as a feedstock are expected. ASTM D1655 Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuels allows co-processing of biomass feedstocks at a petroleum refinery in blends up to 5%.

Both ASTM standards are continuously updated to allow for advancements in technology to produce SAF. DOE's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Review of Technical Pathways provides details on various SAF production pathways. The pathways below represent only those currently approved by ASTM. Processes and tests exist for the approval of other feedstocks, fuel molecules, and blending limits, and the types of approved fuels will increase as these are evaluated through this process.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Safe, Reliable, Low Carbon

SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional jet fuel but with a smaller carbon footprint. Depending on the feedstock and technologies used to produce it, SAF can reduce emissions dramatically compared to conventional jet fuel. Some emerging SAF pathways even have a net-negative emissions footprint.

SAFs lower carbon intensity makes it an important solution for reducing emissions, which make up 9%–12% of U.S. transportation emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

A Menu of Feedstocks for Producing SAF

The U.S. Department of Energy’s 2023 Billion-Ton Report: An Assessment of U.S. Renewable Carbon Resources concluded that the United States could triple its production of biomass to more than 1 billion tons per year producing an estimated 60 billion gallons of low emission liquid fuels. These resources include:

Corn grain

Oil seeds

Algae

Other fats, oils, and greases

Agricultural residues

Forestry residues

Wood mill waste

Municipal solid waste streams

Wet wastes (manures, wastewater treatment sludge)

Dedicated energy crops.

This vast resource contains enough feedstock to meet the projected fuel demand of the U.S. aviation industry, additional volumes of drop-in low carbon fuels for use in other modes of transportation, and produce high-value bioproducts and renewable chemicals.

SAF Benefits Beyond Lowering Emissions

SAF developed from a wide dispersion and variety of biomass resources will ensure that the benefits of expanded biomass production extend to both rural and urban areas. Resources, like energy crops, in a future mature market can provide more than 400 million tons of biomass per year above current uses. In addition, expanding biomass production can create new economic opportunities in agricultural and urban communities, improve the environment, and even boost aircraft performance.

Extra Revenue for Farmers

By growing biomass crops for SAF production, American farmers can earn more money during off seasons by providing feedstocks to this new market, while also securing benefits for their farms like reducing nutrient losses and improving soil quality.

Environmental Services

Biomass crops can control erosion and improve water quality and quantity. They can also increase biodiversity and store carbon in the soil, which can deliver on-farm benefits and environmental benefits across the country. Producing SAF from wet wastes, like manure and sewage sludge, reduces pollution pressure on watersheds, while also keeping potent methane gas out of the atmosphere.

Improved Aircraft Performance

Many SAFs contain fewer aromatic components, which enables them to burn cleaner in aircraft engines. This means lower local emissions of harmful compounds around airports during take-off and landing. Aromatic components are also precursors to contrails, which can exacerbate environmental impacts.

Biofuels Production Supports American Jobs

The United States is the largest producer of biofuels in the world, which contributes to our domestic economy, creates jobs, and reduces emissions.

Expanding domestic SAF production can help sustain the benefits of our biofuel industry and forge new economic benefits, creating and securing employment opportunities across the country. These include jobs in:

Feedstock production in farming communities

Construction for building cutting-edge biorefineries

Manufacturing for operating SAF biorefineries and infrastructure

Government Initiatives for the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Industry:

ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative (European Union): This policy mandates that aviation fuel suppliers at EU airports must blend a minimum share of SAF with conventional jet fuel, starting at 2% in 2025 and increasing to 70% by 2050, to create a guaranteed market and drive investment.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge (United States): A government-wide strategy to expand domestic SAF production, setting an ambitious goal of achieving 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand.

Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Tax Credits (United States): The IRA provides significant production tax credits (45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit) to incentivize the production of clean transportation fuels, including SAF, and help bridge the price gap with conventional jet fuel.

National SAF Blending Targets (India): India has approved indicative blending targets for SAF in aviation turbine fuel, starting with 1% by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030 for international flights, to promote self-reliance and decarbonization.

Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) (ICAO): This global market-based measure, established by the International Civil Aviation Organization, requires airlines to offset emissions above a set baseline from international flights, thereby creating a demand signal for SAF use.

UK SAF Mandate (United Kingdom): Similar to the EU, the UK has introduced a mandate requiring fuel suppliers to ensure a minimum proportion of the UK's aviation fuel mix is SAF, starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 10% by 2030.

Responding to this industry shift, PAC Powered by AC has introduced Sustain2D, a transformative family of turnkey GC×GC-FID analyzers engineered for the demands of ASTM D8396. By combining flow-based modulation, quantitative FID detection, and PAC Powered by AC’s proven global GC platform, Sustain2D brings advanced multidimensional chromatography into reach for routine laboratories, all without adding operational complexity.

Purpose-Built for Jet Fuel and SAF

Today’s SAF production landscape spans a wide range of technologies from HEFA, FT, and ATJ, to emerging pathways, each producing fuels with unique molecular profiles. Understanding these subtle yet consequential differences requires analytical resolution far beyond what traditional GC methods can offer.

Sustain2D is built for precisely this challenge. Its dual-column configuration and flow-based modulation deliver high-resolution separation of paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics, revealing the structured, highly resolved elution patterns needed for confident group-type quantification. This clarity is essential not only for accurate compositional analysis but also for blending decisions, certification workflows, and compliance across diverse SAF and Jet Fuel matrices.

Turnkey by Design: Ready on Day One

One of the most persistent obstacles to GC×GC adoption has been the operational overhead of cryogenic systems, external hardware, and complex configurations that create barriers to implementation. Sustain2D was designed to eliminate that friction entirely.

Each system arrives fully assembled, configured, and performance-tested for ASTM D8396, allowing laboratories to begin running methods immediately without any need for a specialized setup, no additional hardware, and no cryogenics required. Its flow-based modulator reduces bench space, lowers maintenance needs, and simplifies ongoing operation. In practice, this means labs can introduce the resolving power of GC×GC without disrupting existing workflows.

Familiar Workflow, Elevated Performance

Despite its advanced multidimensional capability, Sustain2D preserves the usability and reliability of a conventional GC platform. Built on the world’s most trusted GC architecture and equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector, it delivers fast, quantitative hydrocarbon analysis through workflows analysts already know. Its automated liquid autosampler, split/splitless inlet, dual capillary columns, and integrated flow modulator function as a tightly coordinated analytical ecosystem, ensuring stability and repeatability in every run. This familiar yet elevated design positions GC×GC not as a specialist’s tool, but as a dependable part of daily lab operations.

That dependability is reinforced by real-world performance. Sustain2D has been validated using gravimetric blends of paraffins, naphthenes, and aromatics, demonstrating accurate analyte transfer, optimized modulation timing, and clean, high-resolution chromatographic patterns. These capabilities are essential for modern SAF quality assurance, where laboratories must confidently detect trace-level components and fully characterize fuel chemistry with uncompromising precision.

“This move has major significance for the U.S. ethanol industry as the country’s entire annual gasoline pool of 2.7 billion gallons must now be blended with ethanol,” said Caleb Wurth, USGBC regional director for Southeast Asia & Oceania (SEA&O).","Recent policy changes in Malaysia and Vietnam have opened significant market opportunities for U.S. producers, underscoring the region’s support for ethanol’s utility as a clean, affordable energy source.

In November, the Vietnam Ministry of Industry & Trade announced a new roadmap for fuel ethanol use that will expand the country’s ethanol integration to 5% and 10% blending rates for all road fuels.

The new E5/E10 policy announcement follows multiple years of intensive support of Vietnamese government and industry stakeholders by the U.S. Grains & BioProducts Council and the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service to both migrate Vietnam’s ethanol policy to the entire gasoline pool and reduce U.S. ethanol’s tariff incidence.

Beginning in January, Vietnamese fuel distributors will begin transitioning RON95 gasoline to an E10 blend, with all RON95 gasoline required to be blended at that rate by June 1. RON95 fuel currently accounts for 80 percent of the country’s gasoline consumption and contains 0 percent ethanol, marking a sizeable rise in overall demand.

Fuel distributors will be allowed to continue selling E5 RON92, which currently accounts for 20 percent of the country’s gasoline consumption, until the end of 2030. Fuel distributors are permitted to migrate to E10 RON92 before this date on a discretionary basis but must transition RON92 to E10 by 2031.

Leading these efforts to find solutions are general insurance companies. Keeping in mind the current importance of the very essence of insurance — security and solving social issues — Tokio Marine & Nichido is tackling the challenge of transforming the company into a corporation that goes beyond the framework of its core insurance business. These initiatives are in line with the issues addressed by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the creation of a safe and secure society.

Extending Support for Disaster Victims That Goes Beyond Insurance

In February this year a wildfire broke out in Ofunato City, located in Japan’s northeastern prefecture of Iwate, burning about 33.7 square kilometers and damaging more than 200 buildings. In terms of the fire-damage, it was the largest forest fire since the 1970s. Peaking in early March, the number of evacuees caused by the blaze reached 4,310, a number just over 10% of the city’s population.

Relief items are critical for supporting the lives and stability of disaster victims, but matching these needs with the available aid can be difficult to manage. Accurate identification of survivor necessities is crucial, as are timely responses to changes as they occur. To this end, Tokio Marine & Nichido teamed up with Smart Supply Vision, a nonprofit organization operating a support platform that is based on citizen participation, to explore new ways of handling assistance for disaster relief.

Their system was used in Ofunato and will also be used for disasters like this. First, Tokio Marine & Nichido’s local agents in the areas concerned rely on their networks to collect information on the needs of the affected communities. The data collation also includes people who are not policyholders, and once the information is in hand it will then be registered on the platform to outline what is needed and the required quantities. Using donations received from across Japan, the essential supplies are purchased and sent to the agents who deliver them to the stricken areas. Photos of the deliveries and updates are then posted on the website so that those who donate can see the results of their contributions.

Full-scale operation started in January 2024 during the Noto Peninsula earthquake. This project seeks to emphasize the essence of insurance — mutual support — even in areas of life usually considered beyond the scope of traditional insurance.

This challenge is now extending throughout the entire Group. To support disaster prevention and mitigation, the Tokio Marine Group established Tokio Marine Resilience in 2023 and launched the all-in-one crisis management system called imatome. In the event of catastrophe, the service not only allows companies to manage employee safety and the status of business sites, but also identifies matters in need of urgent action while compiling and understanding information to enable efficient disaster responses and business continuity.

Natural disasters are not the only risks that need to be addressed. For example, take the transportation sector, where in addition to the primary challenges of preventing road accidents, companies are now required to exercise strict vehicle management oversights as well as monitoring labor conditions and health for drivers.

Tokio Marine Smart Mobility was established in 2023 to oversee these kinds of operations. It offers MIMAMO DRIVE, an automotive fleet management service for monitoring the real-time operational status of company vehicles and drivers. The system makes it simple to issue daily and monthly reports on operations using the collected data. It also allows for adding a management function to comply with mandatory alcohol checks.

In recent years, the general insurance industry has been hit by a series of issues that include price adjustments for corporate insurance premiums and information leaks. Tokio Marine & Nichido is also pursuing customer-driven reforms. True recovery can only be achieved by sincerely understanding society’s needs and responding to them with complete honesty.",https://project.nikkeibp.co.jp/ESG/atcl/eng/sdgf/94/og.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 10:56:55.154403

Japanese organizations are adopting inclusive hiring, tailored evaluations and workplace adjustments to integrate diverse talent.

Work is not only a means of contributing to society and the economy, it is a vital pathway to economic independence and social inclusivity. The UN SDGs call for “sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all” clearly reflects this principle. Crucially, this goal is intended for everyone, regardless of disability.

According to a 2023 report by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), approximately 11.6 million people (9.2% of the population) live with a disability. In 2024, the actual employment rate of persons with disabilities reached 2.41% in private-sector companies, 3.07% in national public institutions and 3.05% in prefectural public institutions. The private-sector employment rate has risen steadily from 1.46% in 2004 to 2.41% today, a 1.65-fold increase over 20 years. While around 30% of graduates from special needs schools enter regular employment, approximately a third use employment-related welfare services. Notably, the number transitioning from these services into private-sector jobs has increased nearly 20-fold in the same period.

Japan’s demographic challenges compound the importance of expanding inclusive employment. A July 2025 survey found that 50.8% of companies reported shortages of full-time workers, while 28.7% faced shortages of non-regular employees. Strengthening pathways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce can help mitigate these shortages while fostering more diverse corporate cultures, advancing CSR and encouraging workplace redesign through adapted accommodation.

How is the World Economic Forum promoting sustainable and inclusive mobility systems?

The World Economic Forum’s Platform for Shaping the Future of Mobility works across four industries: aerospace and drones; automotive and new mobility; aviation travel and tourism; and supply chain and transport. It aims to ensure that the future of mobility is safe, clean, and inclusive.

Through the Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, more than 100 companies are working together to power global aviation with 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.

In collaboration with UNICEF, the Forum developed a charter with leading shipping, airlines and logistics to support COVAX in delivering more than 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines to vulnerable communities worldwide.

The Road Freight Zero Project and P4G-Getting to Zero Coalition have led to outcomes demonstrating the rationale, costs and opportunities for accelerating the transition to zero emission freight.

The Medicine from the Sky initiative is using drones to deliver vaccines and medicine to remote areas in India, completing over 300 successful trials.

The Forum’s Target True Zero initiative is working to accelerate the deployment and scaling of zero emission aviation, leveraging electric and hydrogen flight technologies.

In collaboration with the City of Los Angeles, Federal Aviation Administration, and NASA, the Forum developed the Principles of the Urban Sky to help adopt Urban Air Mobility in cities worldwide.

The Forum led the development of the Space Sustainability Rating to incentivize and promote a more safe and sustainable approach to space mission management and debris mitigation in orbit.

The Circular Cars Initiative is informing the automotive circularity policy agenda, following the endorsement from European Commission and Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council countries, and is now invited to support China’s policy roadmap.

The Moving India network is working with policymakers to advance electric vehicle manufacturing policies, ignite adoption of zero emission road freight vehicles, and finance the transition.

The Urban Mobility Scorecards initiative – led by the Forum’s Global New Mobility Coalition – is bringing together mobility operators and cities to benchmark the transition to sustainable urban mobility systems.

Government initiatives to expand disability employment

In January 2023, MHLW announced plans to raise the statutory employment rate of private-sector companies for persons with disabilities from 2.5% to 2.7% by FY 2026. The target has already increased in stages, from 2.3% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2024, with a further rise to 2.7% scheduled.

In October 2025, a new nationwide Employment Choice Support programme was launched, strengthening systems that help individuals select work arrangements that suit their abilities and aspirations. The programme is expected to expand career options and improve job retention, while promoting more flexible pathways to work.

In November 2025, MHLW proposed revising the criteria of the “Monisu” certification programme, originally created to promote disability employment in SMEs and extending eligibility to large corporations. Established in 2020, the scheme provides certified SMEs with access to low-interest financing, with 545 certified companies as of June 2024. Current discussions focus on improving objectivity in evaluation criteria, introducing mandatory requirements and balancing corporate burdens through levies and incentive schemes.

Strengthening support for employers

Support systems for employers are also evolving. In August 2025, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government launched the Severe Disability Employment Support platform, providing practical information and services to jobseekers and companies. The platform connects individuals with severe disabilities to support organizations employers. It also shares case studies and introduces digital assistive technologies tailored to different types of disabilities including eye-tracking input systems and chin-controlled device. It deploys specialized coordinators to support job matching and workplace adjustments.

Japan’s Organization for Employment of the Elderly, Persons with Disabilities and Job Seekers (JEED) offers foundational training programmes for professionals working in disability employment support across the welfare, education and healthcare sectors. It aims to strengthen the skills and capacity of those who support jobseekers.

Expanding corporate engagement in disability employment

Momentum is also building in the private sector. Sony Group has pursued a recruitment policy based on the principle of hiring “people who can work together with Sony,” regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation or disability status. Many employees with disabilities work as full-time employees. Recognizing diversity as a driver of innovation, Sony promotes inclusion through four pillars: leadership commitment, peer awareness, employee self-empowerment and workplace infrastructure developed by HR and general affairs.

Money Forward, a cloud-based accounting software company, has introduced a tailored performance evaluation system for employees with disabilities. New hires start on fixed-term contracts focused on integration and retention, before transiting to productivity-based evaluation as permanent employees. Opportunities to transition into general career-track roles are supported by performance-based management with appropriate accommodation. At Sumitomo Precision Products, employees with hearing impairments play an essential role in welding aircraft components, among other skilled tasks.

Building a society where everyone can work

Expanding access to work strengthens the social participation and economic independence of people with disabilities and brings diverse talent and unique perspectives into organizations. The cumulative impact of collaboration among government, business and civil society is building the foundation for a more inclusive and resilient society in which no one is left behind.

“The decision to mandate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in our RFP reflects our core value of environmental responsibility,” stresses Juan Carlos Gomez Herrera, from the Catalan administration.

About SAF Hélicoptères SAF Hélicoptères is a major player in the French and international helicopter world, going back more than 40 years.
*Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a synthetic fuel.","Book and Claim is helping to promote the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) with the deployment of two H145 helicopters for EMS missions in Catalonia. This major innovation has been made possible by close collaboration between SAF Hélicoptères and Airbus.

SAF (Service Aérien Français) Hélicoptères is a long-standing operator in France. However, the acronym SAF also now stands for *Sustainable Aviation Fuel. It might be a happy coincidence that a service contract has brought the two SAFs together, but this link-up also provides a valuable lesson for the future.

“Under the terms of our service contract with the Catalan Department of Health’s Emergency Medical Services (EMS), we provide two H145 helicopters along with the pilots, technical aircrew, line maintenance and training,” explains SAF Hélicoptères co-director, Jean-Louis Camus. “These two helicopters support two hospital bases, which in turn supply the medical teams.” So far, so very traditional. What is less conventional is the environmental stipulation written into the contract signed by both parties.

“The decision to mandate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in our RFP reflects our core value of environmental responsibility,” stresses Juan Carlos Gomez Herrera, from the Catalan administration. “It’s a natural extension of our duty to promote public health – not only through immediate medical care, but also by reducing long-term environmental impacts.”

SAF Hélicoptères responded to this requirement by taking advantage of the *Book and Claim system in cooperation with Airbus Helicopters. But what does it actually entail?

Understanding Book and Claim

Using SAF requires the fuel to be made available at a given airfield, by means of pipelines or tankers. While the logistics are perfectly possible for a major airport, they remain out of reach for a small hospital helipad. Therefore, instead of promoting the fuel by using it directly, the system requires payment to be made for a specific production volume. The fuel itself is then consumed by another operator. “In my contract, I state that I will pay the equivalent of a portion of my helicopters’ fuel usage in exchange for a certificate,” summarises Jean-Louis Camus. “But what sounds like a simple solution on paper is actually quite complex to implement.”

This assessment is backed up by Laurie Ceccan, who is responsible for Book and Claim at Airbus Helicopters. “In the short term, SAF is the key component in our plans to decarbonise aviation. We have therefore invested a lot of time and effort in this system, in which Airbus acts as a facilitator. We source SAF certificates at the best price through direct calls for tenders from producers. Then we work with the platform provided by our partner RSB to manage and transfer these certificates to our clients. The process is totally transparent for the operator and the end user of the helicopters. Ultimately, the convergence of everyone’s goodwill allows us to achieve this solution.”

This collaboration has allowed us to see how the Book and Claim system can provide traceable, verifiable SAF benefits, even where direct physical supply is not feasible,” notes Juan Carlos Gomez Herrera. “The SAF certification system implemented by RSB and supported by Airbus provides the independent verification, traceability and compliance we require to ensure credibility. This rigorous validation guarantees that the SAF attributes we purchase translate into real, measurable carbon reductions – consistent with our ethical code’s emphasis on honesty, accountability and sustainability.”

Catalonia’s ambition is now to strengthen its requirements for SAF in future calls for tender. At SAF Hélicoptères, there is a readiness to extend Book and Claim to other applications. For its part, Airbus Helicopters is promoting the scenario to its clients. It seems the stars are aligning to give SAF its rightful place in the world of rotary wing aviation.

About SAF Hélicoptères

SAF Hélicoptères is a major player in the French and international helicopter world, going back more than 40 years. Three service lines have dominated the group’s activities from the outset: medical evacuation and HEMS, firefighting, and humanitarian missions. Today, SAF employs 600 people with a global fleet of more than 100 helicopters based at some 40 locations around the world.

SAF was the first private operator of the H145 and currently has seven of the type in service, including the two in Catalonia. It also operates 20 H125s, 21 H135s and seven Super Pumas.

About Emergency Medical Services (EMS): Helicopters serving the Catalan people

Covering an area of 32,108 km² and with a population of over eight million, Catalonia’s geography makes the helicopter an essential mode of transport for emergency services in the most tricky-to-access areas. With four bases at its disposal, Catalonia can guarantee a response time of under 30 minutes in 90% of cases. Around 3,000 missions are flown every year, resulting in a total of 2,000 flight hours. Some 85% of the activities involve emergency evacuations, while the remaining 15% relate to inter-hospital transfer flights.

*Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a synthetic fuel. In order to be considered sustainable, it must be made from renewable sources or feedstocks, such as used cooking oils, fats, plant oils, municipal, agricultural and forestry waste. It must also meet a set of stringent sustainability requirements including regulations set by ICAO’s CORSIA scheme and the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED). These requirements include food security, water management and human rights considerations. For example, SAF certification bodies independently verify that feedstocks for SAF do not divert resources needed for food production.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102583/775008-qmnr2ind43-preview.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 08:56:34.894324

“Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products.
“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab, Executive Director, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition.","U.S. Representative Sharice Davids (D-KS-03) alongside Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE-01), Troy Carter (D-LA-02), and Tracey Mann (R-KS-01) introduced the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act, bipartisan legislation designed to strengthen the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry, create economic opportunities for farmers, and reduce emissions in the transportation sector.

“Investing in sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just good for the environment it’s good for Kansas farmers, our communities, and our economy,” said Davids. “The SAF Act ensures that clean fuel production incentives are strong and long-term so businesses, farmers, and innovators can plan for the future with confidence. The bipartisan support shows the incredible potential we have to build a healthier, stronger, and more prosperous future for generations to come.”

“America is on the cusp of the next great biofuels revolution,” said Representative Mike Flood (R-NE-01). “The Securing America’s Fuels Act is yet another way Congress can grow our bio economy and encourage innovation that creates great jobs across rural America. Sustainable aviation fuel will help lower emissions while expanding domestic markets for our nation’s farmers, ensuring that our ag economy thrives for generations to come. I want to thank Congresswoman Davids for introducing this much-needed bill and look forward to working together to advance this commonsense, bipartisan bill through Congress.”

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry currently relies on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to make production economically viable. While recent legislation extended the credit for all clean fuels, it eliminated the SAF-specific bonus. To address this challenge, the SAF Act would:

Reinstate the SAF bonus credit eliminated under the recent federal budget, allowing qualifying SAF producers to receive up to $0.35 or $1.75 per gallon.

Extend the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit for all clean fuels through 2033, providing long-term stability for the growing clean fuels industry.

SAF is a game-changer for local communities, agriculture, and the transportation industry. Scaling SAF to meet U.S. goals could generate 33,000 construction jobs over five years, sustain 4,500 permanent operations jobs, and support 60,000 jobs in agriculture and logistics by 2030. SAF can also reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent, delivering major environmental benefits while using existing aviation infrastructure.

""Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” said Representative Troy Carter (D-LA-02). “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

“Sustainable aviation fuel is a worthwhile investment for American agriculture and for American energy dominance,” said Representative Tracey Mann (R-KS-01). “The Securing America’s Fuels Act gives Kansas farmers the certainty they need to plan, invest, and keep supplying fuel to the country and our aviation sector. I will always support legislation that supports rural communities and helps the United States continue to lead the world in producing the fuels of tomorrow.”

Davids co-chairs the Congressional Sustainable Aviation Caucus (CSAC), which works to reduce the aviation industry’s environmental impact and maximize its financial sustainability. By leveraging federal policy, holding forums, and bringing together public and private partners, the caucus plays a key role in the integration of new technologies into the nation’s aviation network.

The bipartisan legislation is endorsed by major industry and agricultural groups, including National Corn Growers Association, SAF Coalition, Airlines for America, Kansas Farm Bureau, Renew Kansas, Kansas Corn, Kansas Soybean Association, Greater New Orleans Inc., Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Twelve, Darling Ingredients, Louisiana Farm Bureau Foundation, Advanced Biofuels Association, Global Business Travel Association, and American Sugarcane League.

“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab, Executive Director, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition. “This legislation continues the broad, bipartisan support for SAF in Congress and recognizes SAF’s unique ability to fuel America’s energy dominance while supporting American farmers. The SAF Coalition urges Congress to pass this legislation so we can grow America’s rural economies, create new markets for our farmers and secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

The demonstration, held at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley earlier this year, focused on a system called the Strategic Deconfliction Simulation, which helps coordinate flight plans before takeoff, reducing the risk of conflicts in busy urban environments

At the event, researchers demonstrated NASA’s Situational Viewer and Demand-Capacity Balancing Monitor, which visualizes air traffic and adjusts flight plans in real time. The simulation demonstrated traffic scenarios involving drone operations throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area, testing how preplanned flights could improve congestion and manage the demand and capacity of the airspace – ensuring that all aircraft can operate smoothly even in crowded conditions.

Working with industry partners is critical to NASA’s efforts to develop and refine technologies needed for future air mobility. During the simulation, the company, ANRA Technologies, demonstrated its fleet and vertiport management systems, which are designed to support the coordination of multiple aircraft and ground operations.

“Simulating these complex environments supports broader efforts to ensure safe integration of drones and other advanced vehicles into the US airspace,” said Hanbong Lee, engineer at NASA Ames. “By showcasing these capabilities, we’re delivering critical data and lessons learned to support efforts at NASA and industry.”

This demonstration is another step toward the NASA team’s plan to hold a technical capability level simulation in 2026. This upcoming simulation would help shape the development of services aimed at managing aircraft flying in urban areas.

The simulation was created through a NASA team from its Air Mobility Pathfinders project, part of the agency’s continuing work to find solutions for safely integrating innovative new aircraft such as air taxis into U.S. cities and the national airspace. By developing advanced evaluations and simulations, the project supports safe, scalable, and publicly trusted air travel in urban areas, paving the way for a future where air taxis and drones are a safe and reliable part of everyday life.

I think it’s certainly timely,” Smith said during an interview at the Nebraska Farm Bureau annual meeting.

Smith said he expects producers to welcome the payments but remains focused on securing durable trade agreements so future farm income relies on markets rather than federal aid.","KEARNEY, Neb. — Rep. Adrian Smith says the Trump administration’s newly announced $12 billion farm aid package will help farmers absorb some of the strain from the ongoing trade war, but he cautions that long-term stability will depend on trade agreements that can be enforced regardless of who occupies the White House.

President Donald Trump unveiled the plan Monday, calling it a one-time “bridge payment” aimed mostly at row-crop producers facing high input costs and lower prices amid stalled exports to China. Since Trump reinstated tariffs shortly after taking office in January, China has sharply reduced purchases of soybeans and sorghum — two key Nebraska commodities.

Smith, a Republican whose 3rd District covers most of the state’s agriculture footprint, said the payments are “timely,” given the impact of the trade fight.

“The president’s trying to make some folks whole who have sacrificed considerably… and I want to keep an open mind. I think it’s certainly timely,” Smith said during an interview at the Nebraska Farm Bureau annual meeting.

China has signaled it will resume some soybean purchases, but Smith said U.S. officials must ensure those commitments are met.

“That’s the challenge with China… they agree to something, and yet they don’t always keep that agreement,” he said. “We’ve seen that from the first Trump administration and what China agreed to and did not follow through. So we need to stay on top of all this and all hands on deck to make sure that we keep any agreements to be enforceable.”

Smith said codifying trade agreements in Congress would give farmers more certainty and prevent reversals from future administrations.

“Ultimately, the enforcement in a very direct and technical sense — Congress codifying trade agreements — that’s kind of the ultimate enforcement,” he said.

While he said he is “not a fan of tariffs,” Smith argued they have brought some countries back to the table.

“Other countries have made concessions,” he said. “The UK, for example — they once wanted a trade agreement with nothing on agriculture. Now they’ve made concessions on beef and ethanol. That would never have happened under a Biden administration.”

The aid package, administered through USDA, is expected to make initial payments by December, with most funds released by February. Smith said he views the assistance as a temporary measure while broader market opportunities develop.

He pointed to expanded ethanol use — particularly E15 — as one area of near-term potential.

“Given corn prices where they are, more E15 availability could actually bring corn prices up a little — and save taxpayer dollars. That’s a good combination,” he said.

Smith also cited growth in Nebraska’s bioeconomy, including biodiesel and emerging sustainable aviation fuel markets, as part of the longer-term solution.

“The innovation involved in taking a kernel of corn and breaking it down into so many different things… that’s what it’s about. More options for consumers,” he said.

“Sustainable tourism strategy is essential for us”, she said.","The European Parliament hosted yesterday the conference Sustainable Tourism The Challenges of the Decade, an event organised by Portuguese MEP Sérgio Humberto.

Apostolos Tzitzikostas, the European Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, opened the discussion by reminding participants of the scale of what is at stake. “Tourism is one of the most important pillars of the European economy”, he said. “Travellers spent more than three billion nights in Europe in 2024, a 50% increase compared with fifteen years ago.”

He noted that this success is powered by more than three million small businesses and 20 million workers, yet the sector is exposed to some of the most complex crises of the decade. Geopolitical instability, hybrid attacks, rising energy prices, climate shocks and pressure on infrastructure all require a new approach. “The challenges we face today are very real”, he said. “We must make sure that local communities and businesses continue to benefit from tourism.”

A historic first for Europe

In his address, the Commissioner made a striking admission. Despite the importance of tourism, Europe had never had a dedicated tourism portfolio in the European Commission and never had a common European tourism strategy.

“For a reason that I cannot understand, even though tourism brings 10% of European GDP, there was not even a Commissioner for tourism”, he said. “I am the first, and hopefully not the last.”

The strategy he will present in spring 2026 is built around three core priorities.

First, ensuring that Europe remains the world’s leading tourist destination. “We are a superpower in tourism” he said. “We have to realise that and work to maintain this position.”

Second, ensuring that the benefits of tourism are genuinely shared by local communities and businesses. This, he stressed, is essential to preventing the rise of anti tourism sentiment. “Tourism only works when communities support it.”

Third, transforming today’s pressures into opportunities by investing in innovation, digital transition, mobility and quality data. This includes creating a new European data space for tourism and strengthening destination management organisations so they can manage flows rather than simply promote destinations.

The Commissioner also highlighted a major challenge. Europe is currently missing around one million workers in tourism. Training, upskilling and talent retention must therefore be placed at the heart of the new strategy. “Sustainability is not only about the environment”, he said. “It is also about the economy, the enterprises, the infrastructure and the jobs.”

He repeatedly referred to Portugal as an example. “You are turning ambition into reality”, he told the Portuguese delegation, praising the country’s forward-looking policies, its sustainability support line and its free training programmes for tourism professionals.

Portugal’s Strategy 2035

Pedro Machado, Portugal’s Secretary of State for Tourism, Commerce and Services, explained how the national Strategy 2035 aligns with the new European vision. Portugal will present its full framework by the end of 2025, and the goal is clear. The country wants to combine stronger growth with more balanced territorial development, better data sharing and decisive climate action.

Machado described tourism as part of a “virtuous triangle” that links sustainable economic growth, territorial cohesion and climate responsibility. With an average annual growth target of 6% for the next decade, tourism could reach close to 20% of Portugal’s GDP by 2035.

Central to this approach is ensuring that communities feel the benefits of tourism. Better distribution of wealth, stronger local participation and new opportunities in low-density territories were repeatedly emphasised. “Tourism must be interpreted as a powerful instrument to compensate for the development gaps of more distant territories”, Machado said.

Climate adaptation is another pillar. Water scarcity, extreme weather and ecological stress are already affecting destinations. “We have to look at resources differently,” he said, noting that sustainability must be understood as the management of natural capital as much as the deployment of technology. Artificial intelligence can support decision-making, but only if it serves people.

Machado also stressed the vital role of mobility and connectivity for peripheral countries. Aviation remains essential for Portugal’s accessibility, and the country must work with European partners to ensure that sustainability objectives do not undermine the right to travel.

Digitalisation, innovation and artificial intelligence permeate the Strategy 2035. More than half of Portugal’s future flagship measures are technology-driven, focusing on efficiency, data and smarter services. Yet Machado insisted that technology remains a tool. “Talking about tourism is not just talking about destinations” he said. “It is talking about values and about people.”

Airlines, airports and hospitality in transition

The conference ALSO brought together Ryanair, ANA Aeroportos de Portugal and HOTREC, providing a practical dimension to the policy discussions.

Steven Fitzgerald, Director of Sustainability and Finance at Ryanair, positioned affordable connectivity as “the engine of tourism growth”. He warned that the cost of the green transition risks falling disproportionately on families and regional economies. Sustainable aviation fuel remains scarce and extremely costly, and ETS charges continue to rise. “Policies that simply make flying more expensive do not reduce emissions”, he said. “They reduce accessibility.”

He called for more European investment in the production of sustainable aviation fuel, stronger incentives and a shift away from punitive cost mechanisms.

Thierry Ligonnière, President of ANA Aeroportos de Portugal, described how connectivity has transformed the country over the last decade. Portuguese airports now handle close to 69 million passengers a year, supporting more than 21 billion euros in tourism impact. Lisbon’s airport is, however, facing a severe capacity limit, and the new airport announced for the capital region is now a priority.

Ligonnière stressed that airport growth must be compatible with environmental and social sustainability. ANA aims to reach carbon neutrality well before 2030 and has already reduced water consumption per passenger by nearly half. “There is no growth that is not sustainable”, he said.

Representing the hospitality sector, Marta Machado, Deputy Director General of HOTREC, reminded participants that 90% of tourism businesses are micro companies. They face high energy costs, digital platform pressures, labour shortages and a heavy regulatory burden. She called for better access to financing, realistic legislative timetables and stronger enforcement of EU rules on short-term rentals and online platforms. “Sustainable tourism strategy is essential for us”, she said. “It must give companies the tools to lead the green, social and digital transition.”

A strategy shaped beyond Brussels

As the conference closed, Sérgio Humberto underlined that the discussion in Brussels would not stay in the Parliament bubble. “Our objective is to bring this debate to the whole territory and beyond our borders”, he said. If the ambition expressed in the European Parliament is matched by concrete action, the coming decade could see Europe move from fragmented efforts to a coherent strategy where tourism remains a force for prosperity, sustainability and cohesion.",https://traveltomorrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/WhatsApp-Image-2025-12-10-at-09.53.38.jpeg#163257,N,,2025-12-10 08:56:46.511685

The refinery converts UCO into SAF using a series of chemical processes.
To boost SAF production, Pertamina was working to increase the proportion of UCO in its blends and improved catalysts were also being tested, the report said.
The country uses about 6M-7M tonnes/year of cooking oil, Pertamina deputy president director Oki Muraza was quoted as saying.
Local collection initiatives could redirect more of this toward domestic SAF production, BioEnergy Times wrote.","As part of its plans, the company would be expanding SAF output at its existing refineries and studying the development of new green refineries, the 26 November report said.

The company, which currently produces SAF at its Cilacap refinery in Central Java, will be developing further facilities in South Sumatra, Riau, West Java and East Kalimantan, according to the report.

At the November COP30 climate conference in Brazil, the Indonesian government - which is aiming to increase the national SAF blending mandate for international flights to 5% by 2035 - announced a target of producing more than 1M kilolitres/year of SAF by 2030, with used cooking oil (UCO) set to be a major feedstock.

Pertamina’s Cilacap refinery has a production capacity of produce approximately 1.4M litres of SAF/day with UCO comprising around 3% of its feedstock.

The refinery converts UCO into SAF using a series of chemical processes. The oil is mixed with kerosene, heated to about 70°C and then moved into a reactor where it is heated to over 300°C and passed through layers of catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions. Hydrogen is also added to stabilise the mixture.

To boost SAF production, Pertamina was working to increase the proportion of UCO in its blends and improved catalysts were also being tested, the report said.

“Our research and development team is always trying to improve the catalyst so that the used cooking oil content can be increased to more than 3%,” process engineer Novan Adhi Prakasa was quoted as saying.

“This can also be achieved by increasing the capacity and productivity of the green refinery unit.”

Indonesia has significant potential UCO supplies, according to the report.

The country uses about 6M-7M tonnes/year of cooking oil, Pertamina deputy president director Oki Muraza was quoted as saying.

“If we could collect just 20% of that, like in developed countries, we would have a large amount of raw material – enough to supply the domestic industry.”

Although Indonesia has an estimated potential of around 1M litres/year of UCO, almost 95% of it is exported to Europe and other Asian markets, according to the report.

IATA said that the total output of what the industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would reach 1.9 million tonnes in 2025 – nearly double the amount produced in the previous year.
But this was a downgrade on IATA’s previous production estimate for this year of 2.1 million tonnes and it only expects alternative fuel production to reach 2.4 million tonnes in 2026.
Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, said: “Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF production.
The association also criticised the UK’s SAF mandate for “triggering price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden”.","The growth in the production of alternative aviation fuels is set to slow during 2026, according to airline association IATA, which blamed “poorly designed” mandates and a “lack of policy support” for declining momentum.

IATA said that the total output of what the industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would reach 1.9 million tonnes in 2025 – nearly double the amount produced in the previous year.

But this was a downgrade on IATA’s previous production estimate for this year of 2.1 million tonnes and it only expects alternative fuel production to reach 2.4 million tonnes in 2026.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, said: “Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognise that its approach is not working and urgently correct course.

“The recent European Commission STIP (Sustainable Transport Investment Plan) announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter.”

Walsh added that many airlines who have vowed to use 10 per cent alternative fuels by 2030 may have to “re-evaluate these commitments”.

“SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” he said.

IATA said the EU’s ReFuelEU mandate, which requires the sector to use at least 2 per cent SAF this year, had led to airlines paying “up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF”, as fuel suppliers have pushed up their prices.

The association also criticised the UK’s SAF mandate for “triggering price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden”.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTNE/uploadedImages/1_News/Air_Travel/Neste%20SAF%20Tanker%20truck%202024%20web.jpg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-12-10 08:57:04.258943

They argue it would have “sweeping and unintended consequences” for local healthcare, transportation, and agricultural organizations that regularly utilize high-valued aircraft for essential operations.
“General and business aviation are essential to Washington’s economy, public safety, healthcare access, agricultural success, and community connectivity,” the groups said in the letter to Ferguson.
“This coalition is intent on communicating that commitment, while also dispelling misconceptions and highlighting aviation’s positive contributions to environmental progress,” said NBAA regional director Phil Derner.
“By resetting the business aviation community’s relationship, we intend to keep legislators and the public better informed on our industry’s commitment to Washington state, its economy, and its environment,” Derner said.","The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) is stepping up its advocacy efforts in the Pacific Northwest, announcing Monday that it has brought together a new industry coalition to address the recent legislative action in Washington state that looks to levy a 10 percent tax on the sale, lease, or transfer of noncommercial aircraft valued at over $500,000.

In a news release on Monday, the association said that the new coalition is made up of state and national NBAA members, the Pacific Northwest Business Aviation Association, allied national associations, as well as local businesses and representatives across the aviation industry. The group’s stated mission for now is to provide a consolidated industry response to SB 5801, which was signed into law by Governor Bob Ferguson in May.

While the bill was awaiting the governor’s signature after passing through the state legislature in April, industry leaders—many of whom are also a part of the newly established coalition—sent a letter addressed to Ferguson’s office urging him to line-item veto the provisions in the bill related to the luxury tax. They argue it would have “sweeping and unintended consequences” for local healthcare, transportation, and agricultural organizations that regularly utilize high-valued aircraft for essential operations.

The groups said the state’s general and business aviation sectors support more than 31,000 jobs and generate $8.6 billion, in addition to 407,000 airport jobs, all of which would experience diminishing returns due to the tax.

“General and business aviation are essential to Washington’s economy, public safety, healthcare access, agricultural success, and community connectivity,” the groups said in the letter to Ferguson. “We urge you to protect these vital activities and ensure our aviation system remains strong by vetoing these harmful provisions.”

The law establishes that all revenue collected by the luxury tax on high-value aircraft will be deposited in a sustainable aviation fuel account. The NBAA stated that the tax, scheduled to go into effect on April 1, 2026, has some businesses considering whether it will be possible to remain economically viable if they are to continue operations in Washington state under the new law.

Part of the impetus, the association said, for bringing together aviation groups was because the passage of the legislation was done so with little input from the industry. So it said there remained a need for a unified voice among the larger aviation community—a void that the new group hopes to fill.

“This coalition is intent on communicating that commitment, while also dispelling misconceptions and highlighting aviation’s positive contributions to environmental progress,” said NBAA regional director Phil Derner. “We are here to build a constructive relationship that incentivizes and empowers our industry to be a better participant in sustainability and a better neighbor in communities throughout the state, not just in the big cities.”

Nearly 100 industry and community representatives gathered recently at Paine Field (KPAE) in Everett, Washington, outside Seattle to hear from state Representative Tom Dent, leader of the state’s aviation caucus and discuss needs moving forward.

“By resetting the business aviation community’s relationship, we intend to keep legislators and the public better informed on our industry’s commitment to Washington state, its economy, and its environment,” Derner said.",https://planeandpilot.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/BAI-March-April-2021-Member-Prof.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 08:57:41.950732

In the trial, HVO was derived from vegetable-origin feedstock (cashew nut shell oil) and co-processed with crude oil, while SAF was produced by processing partially refined used cooking oil alongside conventional feedstocks.

Independent laboratory analysis confirmed that both products met required fuel specifications.

MOL Group says the outcome demonstrates its readiness to scale up alternative fuel production. The trial at Slovnaft — preceded by earlier co-processing efforts at its Danube refinery — emphasises the company’s commitment to lowering emissions from diesel and jet fuels.

By showing that conventional refinery infrastructure can be adapted to produce low-carbon fuels, MOL Group aims to contribute to regional energy security and support EU decarbonisation targets. The company plans further development to enable commercial-scale output of HVO and SAF.

While that would be an increase from the estimated 1.9 million metric tons produced in 2025, the growth rate would be lower than the near doubling of production from 1 million metric tons of SAF in 2024.
IATA director general Willie Walsh in a statement charged that ""poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry,"" limiting production momentum.
""If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,"" according to Walsh.

While that would be an increase from the estimated 1.9 million metric tons produced in 2025, the growth rate would be lower than the near doubling of production from 1 million metric tons of SAF in 2024.

IATA's production estimate for 2025 is a downward revision from its June forecast of 2 million metric tons ""due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities,"" according to IATA.

IATA director general Willie Walsh in a statement charged that ""poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry,"" limiting production momentum.

The United Kingdom this year implemented a mandate that 2 percent of fuel used in U.K. flights must be SAF. Additionally, the European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation for 2025 requires similar SAF levels at EU airports.

""If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park,"" according to Walsh. ""But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.""

Mandates in the EU and U.K. have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption, according to IATA. ""Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments,"" Walsh said. ""SAF is not being produced in efficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition.""

In addition, airlines paid $2.9 million for the SAF produced in 2025. Of this $1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel, according to IATA.

In Europe, ReFuelEU has ""sharply increased costs"" amid limited SAF capacity and ""oligopolist supply chains,"" according to IATA, with airlines paying up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF.

""The U.K. SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden,"" IATA noted, adding that with synthetic SAF, or e-SAF, mandates approaching in the U.K. in 2028 and the EU in 2030, ""it's essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.""

IATA estimated that e-SAF could cost as much as 12 times that of conventional jet fuel, and without production incentives instead of mandates, supply will fall short of targets.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTN/uploadedImages/2015_Site_Maintenance/BTN_Link_PreviewLogo.png?n=3260&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-12-10 00:56:15.077325

The original 45Z tax credit, as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provided a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

President Trump on July 4 signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a budget reconciliation package that extended the 45Z credit through the end of 2029, altered the credit by limiting eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Canada or Mexico, and eliminated the “special rate” for SAF. The elimination of the “special rate” effectively caps the value of the SAF credit at $1 per gallon starting in 2026.

The SAF Act is not the only legislation introduced in recent months to reinstate the SAF bonus credit. In October, Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., introduced a bill that aims to reinstate many of the renewable energy tax credits eliminated by the OBBBA. One provision of that bill aims to reinstate the 45Z credit premium for SAF.

C O 2 emission reduction of sectors such as aviation, maritime shipping, road haulage, and chemical production is challenging but necessary. Although these sectors will most likely continue to rely on carbonaceous energy carriers, they are expected to gradually shift away from fossil fuels. In order to do so, the prominent option is to utilize alternative carbon sources—like biomass and C O 2 originating from carbon capture—for the production of non-fossil carbonaceous vectors (biofuels and e-fuels). However, the limited availability of biomass and the varying nature of other carbon sources necessitate a comprehensive evaluation of trade-offs between potential carbon uses and existing sources. Then, it is primordial to understand the origin of carbon used in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to understand the implications of defossilizing aviation for the energy system. Moreover, the production of SAF implies deep changes to the energy system that are quantified in this work. This study utilizes the linear programming cost optimization tool EnergyScope TD to analyze the holistic French energy system, encompassing transport, industry, electricity, and heat sectors while ensuring net greenhouse gas neutrality. A novel method to model and quantify carbon flows within the system is introduced, enabling a comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas neutrality. This study highlights the significance of fulfilling clean energy requirements and implementing carbon dioxide removal measures as crucial steps toward achieving climate neutrality. Indeed, to reach climate neutrality, a production of 1,046 TWh of electricity by non-fossil sources is needed. Furthermore, the findings underscore the critical role of efficient carbon and energy valorization from biomass, providing evidence that producing fuels by combining biomass and hydrogen is optimal. The study also offers valuable insights into the future cost and impact of SAF production for air travel originating from France. That is, the European law ReFuelEU would increase the price of plane tickets by +33% and would require 126 TWh of hydrogen and 50 TWh of biomass to produce the necessary 91 TWh of jet fuel. Finally, the implications of the assumption behind the production of SAF are discussed.",https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/styles/img/transparent_logo.svg,N,,2025-12-10 05:56:58.607607

U.S. Representative Sharice Davids, along with three other lawmakers, has introduced the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act. This bipartisan bill aims to strengthen the sustainable aviation fuel industry, create new opportunities for farmers, and cut emissions from transportation.

The SAF industry currently depends on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to stay economically viable. Although the credit was recently extended, lawmakers removed the extra incentive specifically for SAF producers. The new bill would restore that bonus credit, allowing qualifying producers to earn up to $1.75 per gallon, and it would extend the 45Z credit for all clean fuels through 2033 to give the industry more long-term stability.

Supporters say expanding SAF will benefit local communities and agriculture by creating thousands of construction, operations, and agriculture-related jobs in the coming years. SAF can also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 80 percent.

There was a great country music song in the 1980s by a guy named Johnny Lee titled “Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places.” I feel at times that could be a soundtrack for ethanol as the industry slogs its way through the mud of politics and big oil looking for love in the form of increased demand. In recent years, it has been Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and recently ethanol as a marine fuel getting attention. Both face significant challenges and at least for now may be the wrong places to look as compared to the world’s largest gasoline market right in front of us.

For starters, the push for alternatives to petroleum in both aviation and marine use markets are in large part based on reducing carbon and greenhouse gases. As I wrote about last month, during the Biden administration, reducing carbon was everything. Regulations and policy essentially dictated massive changes in our fuels and automobiles. With the Trump administration completely reversing course, beginning with their new determination that GHGs does not represent a health risk, we are witnessing the fallout from carbon-based business decisions. The auto industry is absolutely reeling, with new reports every day about layoffs and plant closures as the zero emission dreams of EVs face reality. Billions of dollars in clean energy projects have been scrapped across the country. The 45Z tax credits have yet to be finalized and only have a few years of life to begin with before expiring.

The aviation industry is on record stating subsidies and incentives are critical to SAF, and we have learned over the years the dangers of relying on subsidies that expire. As soon as the International Maritime Organization proposed carbon reducing regulations, the Trump administration threatened tariffs and other punitive measures on countries that enforced these measures. Even when carbon reduction was all the rage, Sustainable Aviation Fuels and Marine Fuels combined only represent roughly 6 percent of global GHG emissions.

Furthermore, these potential new ethanol markets like marine and aviation face stiff challenges from other technologies and fuels both from an economic and performance standpoint. In contrast, we know that ethanol stands alone as a proven additive to gasoline providing clean octane to the 270 million light-duty vehicles on the road today. E15 is a great start but to maximize that opportunity we need to be pushing for much greater blend volumes. We see in real time how 15 percent blends are reducing gas prices, an E30 blend would be twice as nice.

Lastly, and certainly not to be forgotten, is the role of ethanol in protecting public health, which despite what EPA says, is still their mission. Ethanol is and can continue to replace the carcinogenic aromatics refiners use for octane and reduce the toxic particulates that are directly tied to the family of benzene compounds. The late C. Boyden Gray was White House Counsel to President George Bush and one of the architects of the Clean Air Act. We worked closely with him on fuel provisions of that legislation and on more than one occasion when asked why he supported ethanol, Boyden would simply say, “because it saves lives!”

Again, E5 is a great step forward but with just one point of octane it falls short as a real game changer for replacing aromatics. The truly higher blends like E30 double up everything and can be utilized immediately in cars on the road today. The Department of Energy used E20 and even E30 in their testing of E15 and found no problems. The recent Nebraska demonstration of E30 is confirming that legacy vehicles can safely and efficiently use 30 percent blends. Brazil just last month formed an exploratory committee to look at blends of 35-40 percent and keep in mind there are millions non-FFVs in use there. We need to get in the game and make sure we are not selling ethanol short by limiting ourselves to E15 which, at least in terms of RVP relief, we would be by supporting current legislation. Bills in both the House and Senate must be fixed by applying the RVP waiver to all blends.

With the refiners constantly undermining the RFS and attacking ethanol, and now API reneging on their support of E15, why are we pulling our punches? Are we afraid the petroleum industry will be less helpful? The powerful grassroots voice of the ag and ethanol industries should demand the enforcement of clean octane requirements that EPA has ignored for decades. EPA and oil insist on labeling pumps with 10 percent ethanol, corn growers should launch a national labeling campaign to warn consumers that the gas they are pumping contains up to 25 percent carcinogens right next to it.

Our internal studies at CFDC make the case that if refiners basically outsourced their octane to ethanol it would dramatically free up refining capacity and allow them to process more products out of the oil barrel while capturing the margins; a win-win for everyone. While we haven’t heard much about the Trump Domestic Energy Council since they first announced it, ethanol can wrap itself in the flag and work with domestic refiners and oil interests instead of constantly battling with them.

Aviation and marine use should continue to be explored but spending a lot of time and money on them at this time when the internal combustion engine and gas-powered cars are now back in charge seems off target. So, I refer back to Johnny Lee and his warning about looking in the wrong places – instead let’s seize this path of least resistance and go for truly higher blends.",https://governorsbiofuelscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/favicon-biofuels.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 17:56:34.739607

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made largely from waste or used cooking oil, can cut emissions significantly compared with traditional jet fuel. However, it remains two to five times more expensive than conventional fuel.

IATA expects 2.4 million metric tons of SAF to be available in 2026, covering just 0.8% of total fuel consumption. That means the growth of the SAF sector has slowed – production growth doubled between 2024 and 2025, but will likely only grew by 0.5 million metric tons between 2025 and 2026, IATA said.

The wider aviation sector committed in 2021 to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, relying heavily on a gradual switch to SAF.

Airlines have long said that they are willing to buy all of the SAF available, but accuse jet fuel producers of artificially inflating prices and failing to produce enough of the greener fuel.

“It’s not an issue of price, it’s an issue of availability, and they’re just not able to get their hands on the SAF that they require to fulfil the ambition that they expressed,” Walsh said.

IATA’s Chief Economist Marie Owens Thomsen added that regulatory mandates introduced by the European Union and Britain have encouraged fuel producers to raise prices on SAF even further, with Walsh adding that the practice is synonymous with price gouging.",https://governorsbiofuelscoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/favicon-biofuels.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 18:56:27.320273

Washington, DC, Dec. 9, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) today welcomed a new bipartisan bill that would restore the full value of the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) tax credit and extend the incentive for eight years.

The Securing America’s Fuels Act (SAF Act), introduced by Reps. Mike Flood (R-01-NE) and Sharice Davids (D-03-KS), follows congressional passage of legislation earlier this year that extended the 45Z tax credit but reduced its value, rendering many new SAF projects less financially feasible.

The new bill would return the credit to $1.75 per gallon and extend it through 2033 – key steps to scaling domestic production of the low-carbon fuel.

The tax credit helps close the cost gap with conventional jet fuel, enabling producers to bring more SAF to market while creating new home-grown economic opportunities for farmers, rural communities and fuel producers.

“NBAA thanks Reps. Flood and Davids for introducing this measure and understanding SAF’s economic and sustainability benefits,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “Restoring the full credit provides the clarity and stability needed to unlock investment, expand supply and accelerate progress toward our industry’s long-term environmental commitments.”

SAF is a drop-in jet fuel produced from bio-based feedstocks and can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over legacy fuels. The fuel is central to business aviation’s commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Beyond SAF, the business aviation community continues to drive a broad range of sustainability innovations – from operational improvements and airspace modernization to emerging propulsion technologies and hybrid-electric systems. Together with strong policy support, these initiatives form the foundation of the industry’s long-term decarbonization strategy.

- Solar Installations Peak (for Now) –

LONDON and NEW YORK and SINGAPORE, Dec. 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Global Energy today released its Top Trends report identifying the pivotal developments shaping clean energy technology, sustainability and growth in global energy markets in 2026. The report was produced by analysts of its Horizons team, which provides comprehensive energy expansion and sustainability intelligence, from big picture trends to asset level insights.

""In 2026, AI's surging power demand growth will be testing grid limits, revenue models and sustainability goals,"" said Eduard Sala de Vedruna, Vice President and Head of Research, Horizons, S&P Global Energy. ""The pace of progress will depend on unlocking new capacity and flexibility, with grid modernization a key constraint on energy security and competitiveness.""

S&P Global Energy Horizons Top Trends for 2026—tackling themes from AI's rapid growth, geopolitical realignments, and mounting climate risks—highlight how energy expansion and sustainability are necessarily interlinked.

""The interplay of AI-driven demand, grid bottlenecks, evolving procurement strategies, and rising climate risks highlights how energy expansion and sustainability are not parallel ambitions, but intertwined imperatives,"" said Leanne Todd, Senior Vice President, Global Head of Horizons, S&P Global Energy.

TOP TRENDS IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT:

As AI uptake soars in 2026, energy supply and sustainability commitments face a breaking point. S&P Global Energy Horizon's high growth view shows global datacenter power demand increasing 17% to 2026 and 14% per year through 2030, reaching potential demand of over 2,200 TWh, equivalent to India's current electricity use. This surge is testing grid limits and sustainability goals, with 38% of assessed companies with datacenter operations lacking net-zero commitments. Major tech firms including Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta are exploring new options to reconcile their power needs without compromising on their climate targets as aggregate US datacenter capital spending approaches $500 billion in 2026.

Solar growth peaks (for now): first annual slowdown in renewables additions in 2026. China's annual additions will fall from roughly 300 GW in 2025 to about 200 GW in 2026, triggered by a major policy shift from guaranteed pricing to competitive bidding. With China accounting for 50% of global additions over the past decade, this slowdown will have a deep impact. For the first time ever, new global solar installations are expected to decline year-on-year, albeit by less than 10%, as emerging markets take up some of the slack Despite this contraction, cumulative PV capacity is still expected to double over the next five years, supported by emerging markets and continued innovation, including faster deployment of battery energy storage.

Grid modernization becomes a key energy security, transition and competitiveness constraint. Decades of underinvestment have created a critical bottleneck as the world races to electrify and decarbonize. With 40% of EU grids over 40 years old, the European Commission estimates €584 billion in grid capital expenditure is needed by 2030 to support decarbonization. The US faces potential limitations on the ability to deliver needed power without investment to support explosive AI-driven datacenter growth, making grid modernization a national competitiveness issue.

Flexible Power Purchase Agreements become the new standard as price volatility reshapes how risks are managed. Increasing renewable capacity is leading to more zero- and negatively priced settlements, driving the evolution from traditional PPAs to complex hybrid structures that integrate multiple technologies and storage. The market is moving toward shorter contract terms and stronger downside protections as extreme price swings become more visible, particularly in Europe where PPA indices remain well below cost-based levels. Datacenters account for 27 gigawatts (GW), or 43% of total corporate power procurement in 2025 through October, continuing as a leading sector for clean energy procurement.

As the rest of the world slows down to consider, China gets serious about green hydrogen. Chinese projects will install about 1.5 GW of electrolyzers in 2025, nearly doubling the 1.7 GW installed globally at end-2024, with deployment projected to reach 4.5 GW in 2026. Electrolyzer stack prices have plunged from $250 per kilowatt (/kW) in early 2024 to under $100/kW due to oversupply and fierce competition. Unlike solar and batteries, Chinese firms aim to export energy as well as technology, with at least two Chinese green ammonia plants receiving EU certification for clean molecule exports, with indications of prices as low as $600 per metric ton on a free-on-board basis (FOB).

Global SAF capacity expands by one third in 2026—Asia leads, Europe pays. Global dedicated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) capacity is expected to rise by about one third to eight million metric tons (MMt), though the speed of growth slows compared to the near doubling seen annually from 2022 to 2025. More than half of global SAF capacity will be concentrated in Asia despite modest regional demand, as producers target a European market facing supply shortfalls. Beyond 2026, capacity could increase eightfold to 42 MMt by 2030 if announced projects materialize, though only 7.3 MMt have reached final investment decision.

EV uptake continues as China has shown that EVs can be price-competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. China appears on track to become the first major ""EV majority"" market globally, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) representing about 50% of new light vehicle sales in the first three quarters of 2025. Europe shows renewed growth due to stricter CO2 standards, while the US faces its first test of organic consumer demand without tailwinds of federal EV tax credits in 2026. Emerging markets including Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Mexico, Nigeria and Malaysia are identified as relatively ripe for Chinese EV adoption.

Global trade and climate policy is increasingly focused on harmonizing emissions reporting. The EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) takes effect January 1st, 2026, requiring accountability for carbon intensity of imported goods, while major revisions are proposed for the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standard. Potential proliferation of carbon border adjustment mechanisms requires companies to report different emissions to different regulators, complicating global trade. The harmonization of product-level carbon accounting is increasingly seen as prerequisite for markets to differentiate products based on carbon intensity.

China leverages global clean energy leadership and further expands influence. China has consolidated its leadership in clean energy deployment, technologies and supply chains. With overall cleantech spending growing 30% over the next five years while upstream spending is expected to remain constant, new global energy investment is shifting eastward. Meanwhile, the US is adopting a more interventionist industrial strategy, featuring greater government involvement through equity stakes and targeted support for technologies like nuclear and advanced geothermal. Diplomatically, China continues active climate participation while the US challenges multilateral efforts, creating additional space for China to expand global influence.

As emissions could drive a 2.3°C rise by 2040, adaptation shifts from optional to essential in 2026. Extreme weather and climate hazards are creating escalating risks for infrastructure, physical assets, and operations. S&P Global Energy Horizons projects annual climate-related costs of ~$885 billion for large publicly traded companies in the 2030s. Climate risk assessments and adaptation planning show patchy uptake across sectors, with an evident adaptation gap even in industries where risk assessment is more common. The increasingly urgent question is no longer whether companies will adapt, but how quickly.

In 2007 and early 2008, business aviation was also booming.
Business aviation appears healthy — maybe a little too healthy.
“When you go to the NBAA [National Business Aviation Association] events, there’s almost no talk of sustainability anymore,” he said.
Public opinion will shape aviation’s future, and if the economy weakens or the stock market turns, business aviation could again become a political target.","By almost any metric, business aviation is enjoying one of the strongest periods in its history. Manufacturers are reporting record sales, OEM backlogs in some cases stretch years into the future, and private flying remains far above pre-pandemic levels as more well-heeled travelers continue to enter the market. To many, it feels like an industry with limitless momentum.

But aviation has been in this situation before — and the warning signs of structural risks now emerging look uncomfortably familiar.

In 2007 and early 2008, business aviation was also booming. Then the financial crisis hit, and the same jets celebrated as symbols of global industrial strength became objects of political outrage. Executives abandoned their aircraft to avoid scrutiny, demand collapsed, and values cratered. The recovery took years.

The message today? Business aviation appears healthy — maybe a little too healthy.

Kevin Singh, founder and CEO of Icarus Jet, a charter and aircraft management firm with offices in Dallas, Dubai, and London, says he believes the industry may again be drifting into dangerous territory as lessons from 2008 fade. And this time, he argues, the vulnerabilities may actually run deeper.

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Singh said, “there were guardrails to our industry. There was a respect for the crew, respect for the owner, respect for the airport, and respect for people and cities that were invested into this. There was a status quo, and today that is completely gone.”

He argues that the current boom has eroded the discipline that shaped business aviation in the years after 2008, as the cycle of greed and fear is again swinging recklessly toward excess. “Now, everybody has a private jet,” he said. “But what happened to our infrastructure in the meantime? You can’t take off from Morristown, Teterboro, White Plains, because you have two-hour delays. You can’t park in Europe because the infrastructure is bursting at its seams.”

In Singh’s view, the system was never designed to handle today’s traffic. Staffing shortages, airport congestion, and supply-chain fragility are no longer abstract concerns but real operational threats, with crews, maintenance teams, and air traffic controllers stretched to their limits.

That fragility extends to industry culture. Singh describes a marketplace where cost discipline and operational maturity have been replaced by vanity purchases, aggressive marketing, and a general erosion of responsibility.

“We went from naming and shaming people for having private jets and spray-painting their jets and yachts to ‘Look at me, I’m breaking speed records between two city pairs,’” he said. “The message is: I’m going zero to Mach 1 — and what are you going to do about it?”

Market behavior reflects the same drift. “Catering should not cost $5,000 for six sandwiches,” he said. “Somebody needs to step in and say this isn’t right.” Training costs have soared too, he said: “Fifty, sixty thousand dollars for recurrent training? We never paid more than 18 to 25. So greed has taken over. Responsibility has taken a back seat. Efficiency in this booming market is gone.”

The result, Singh said, is a “cavalier” attitude — with owners buying aircraft larger than they need because tax incentives and bragging rights shape their decisions, operators chasing sales at any cost, and an industry that has stopped explaining its value to the public.

He also worries that sustainability has nearly disappeared from industry discourse. “When you go to the NBAA [National Business Aviation Association] events, there’s almost no talk of sustainability anymore,” he said. A major private jet firm once promoted a sustainable aviation fuel message on the side of its aircraft, he noted. “Today, the pitch is that they offer a hypoallergenic mattress.”

Ignoring climate concerns, he argues, is strategically dangerous. Public opinion will shape aviation’s future, and if the economy weakens or the stock market turns, business aviation could again become a political target. “Once the tax incentive dries up or they lose Congress, there’s no longer a unified voice for our industry,” he said.

That vulnerability will only grow if the industry fails to explain its social value. “We have to make sure that we continue to educate people about why business jets exist, and that they do not take away anything from public resources,” he said.

Singh paints a stark contrast between two possible futures. One path blends better technology with real discipline and transparency. “If we use technology and AI to design better aerodynamics, better engines, emissions standards are going to be met,” he said. “Rather than, ‘Look, the Emperor is wearing the most luxurious fine linen and everybody else is hungry and poor,’ we need to create a future built on a sustainable, responsible industry.”

The darker path is what happens if nothing changes — if the boom continues on its current trajectory while airline service grows ever worse and consumer protections erode. “If we choose the other option where 500 ultra-wealthy people own 600 jets and everybody else is traveling on airlines that can’t even get them from point A to point B,” he said, “there is going to be a dangerous collective anger.” In that scenario, he warned, “five years later, we will pay those high-tier taxes for business aviation and have higher prohibition of movement of aircraft. We need be very careful.”

Singh stresses that outside scrutiny shouldn’t be seen as hostility but as a signal that the industry needs to evolve. “Engagement makes us better,” he said. “If people have questions or criticisms, we should be willing to meet them, explain what we do, and show how we’re addressing their concerns.”

For Singh, the stakes reach far beyond a temporary cooling of demand. The boom is real — but so are the structural vulnerabilities. “If we keep operating in a way that works against our own long-term interests,” he said, “costs will spiral out of control, the margins shrink, safety will suffer, and eventually the model stops working.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/private_jet-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 14:57:36.435275

Why is Australia Next such an important event for Tourism Australia?

It’s a signature event for us because it works and delivers great results. Last year in Cairns, we had 161 leads worth almost $170 million, and we are confident this year’s event will deliver more great results.

We know the best way to showcase our country is to show, not tell, what we have to offer. It’s an opportunity to open the eyes of both media and planners – to inspire, excite, and demonstrate the diversity of what we can do.

Every year we challenge ourselves to innovate, make it different, and worthy of the bucket-list incentive destination that we are.

What are the key developments across Australia should the MICE industry know about?

The hotel pipeline over the last few years has been phenomenal. Almost 270 new hotels have opened around the country, and around 60 to 70 per cent of those are luxury hotels so ideal for the incentive market.

Here in Melbourne, we’ve had the W Hotel and 1 Hotel brands make their debut, the first Mondrian property in Australia opened on the Gold Coast, plus lots of new Marriott hotels, and the Crystalbrook hotels in Cairns. That’s replicated in every state and city, so if you’re looking for something new, you will find it.”

Are there particular regions experiencing strong or unexpected growth?

The cities always do well for incentive groups, but some regions are really benefiting from improved accessibility and infrastructure.

Far North Queensland is performing well thanks to Singapore Airlines increasing their aircraft capacity into Cairns. Gold Coast is also seeing strong growth, as are South Australia and Perth. Perth is benefiting from the direct London–Perth flight, and in 2027 we’ll have the Sydney–London direct flights with Qantas’ Project Sunrise, which is a super exciting development.

One of our greatest strengths is how easy it is to do multi-destination programs. Our domestic aviation network is very strong and easy to navigate. Our research tells us that 38 per cent of people coming for a business event will go on to a second, if not a third destination. It comes back to Australia being a bucket list destination, and people wanting to see more and do more when they are here.”

Sustainability is a key concern for international planners. What actions is Tourism Australia taking?

We think of sustainability in the holistic sense – the environmental side, the cultural side, and the economic sustainability side. It is not a new thing for us.

We have a national sustainability to guide us, and all our own events are carbon neutral including Australia Next, but we make sure we are not just offsetting. We offset as little as possible by mitigating first.

On the aviation side, we know that people need to fly to get here, but sustainable aviation fuel is developing, and we have made a commitment to that as an industry and a government. There are also next generation aircraft coming that are greener and more sustainable.

On the ground, our product makes it easy. Many of our venues are world leading – Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre was the first in the world to receive a six-star Green Star rating – and Adelaide has a food waste system recognised as the best in the world by EarthCheck. Local hotel groups like Crystalbrook are also very sustainable.

One thing you might not know is that Tasmania is already net zero as a destination. Linking to the CSR side of sustainability, purposeful travel is key. You might be doing a citizen science project or the Reef Connect project when you are up north, which is about visiting but also educating yourself, giving back, and leaving a positive impact. They are doing amazing work.

We are also blessed with our bureaus and our DMCs. They are such high quality in what they do. They can help any planner meet their sustainability goals, and they drive the conversation because it is important to them as well.

How can planners incorporate Indigenous culture into their programs in an authentic way?

It is such an important element. We are really blessed to have the world’s oldest living culture here in Australia, and no one else can claim that. We live it as an organisation in what we do, and we share with planners how they can make it authentic and bring it into their programs.

It can be a Welcome to Country, a dot painting class, a cooking class, an arts experience, or a traditional dance. It is so varied. The soprano who performed this morning was a great example, using traditional language in her performance. There are so many ways to include it.

Education is a big part of it. The Botanic Gardens in Melbourne and Sydney have storytellers who bring traditional bush medicine to life from a tree you would normally walk past without knowing. That kind of authentic storytelling makes it very easy to immerse yourself.

If you had to give international planners three reasons why Australia should be on their destination shortlist, what would they be?

First, it is the depth and diversity we offer as a destination. That is especially important if you have repeat visits. We are very blessed with our repeat visitation. We are often seen as a bucket list destination, but then people come back, so the depth and diversity really matter.

Second, we genuinely over-deliver as a destination. Our research tells us we exceed expectations in every category. People think we are safe and secure, they expect great nature and wildlife, and food and drink are less well known, but we exceed them all.

And third, it is the Aussie welcome. That warmth is something people remember and talk about, and it really sets us apart.

What keeps Australia competitive globally?

I think the word-of-mouth element of what we can do is very powerful. We work hard to stay top of mind with media, with delegates, and with planners, and to get them here, because there is nothing like experiencing Australia firsthand. It is a hugely competitive market, but we know our campaign cuts through.

The leisure campaign you are seeing in the UK is performing in the top one percent of adverts for cut-through. Eighty-eight percent of people who see it take the next step in planning and put Australia on their consideration list. It works. We are very active in our marketing and in staying top of mind.

We also have such a strong cultural connection with the UK, and we really lean into that. It helps us stay competitive.",https://micebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favicon_m-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-09 17:56:44.074680

Conclusion: A Journey Toward Greener Travel Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a vital part of the future of eco-friendly air travel.
The current pace of SAF production and the challenges posed by EU and UK mandates could mean higher travel costs and delays in greener flight options.","In a world increasingly focused on sustainability, the aviation industry’s push towards Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a key component of reducing carbon emissions from air travel. However, recent reports reveal that SAF production is not growing fast enough to meet the future needs of the aviation industry. This could have a direct impact on travelers worldwide, leading to higher costs and slower progress toward eco-friendly flights. Here’s what global travelers need to know.

The Struggle to Meet SAF Targets

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has raised concerns over the slow growth of SAF production, which is vital for achieving global aviation sustainability goals. While the production of SAF is expected to double by 2025, from 1 million tonnes to 1.9 million tonnes, the future growth looks uncertain. In 2026, production is projected to slow down, raising concerns about whether the aviation industry can meet long-term sustainability targets.

For travelers, this means that although airlines are committed to reducing their carbon footprint, it could take longer than expected to achieve the necessary fuel output. The slow pace of SAF production could also result in higher ticket prices, as the cost of SAF is currently much higher than conventional jet fuel.

The Economic Impact on Air Travel

SAF prices are substantially higher than traditional jet fuel, which presents a significant economic challenge for airlines. According to IATA, by 2025, airlines are expected to pay an additional $3.6 billion for SAF. This premium cost could be passed on to passengers, leading to higher airfare prices.

Travelers booking flights to Europe or the UK in the coming years may see this price increase reflected in their tickets, especially as policies around SAF grow more complex. For those flying from regions with strict SAF mandates, the impact may be even more pronounced, leading to additional costs and delays in the availability of greener travel options.

Europe’s SAF Mandates and Their Impact on Travelers

Europe, with its ambitious goals for reducing aviation emissions, has implemented SAF mandates to push the industry toward sustainability. However, these policies have not had the desired effect. In the European Union, the ReFuelEU initiative has increased SAF costs significantly, without a corresponding increase in production. Airlines are paying up to five times more for SAF than for traditional jet fuel, without guaranteed supply or consistent quality.

As a result, many airlines are finding it difficult to meet their SAF targets, forcing them to reconsider their sustainability goals. For travelers, this means potential flight delays and higher prices, as airlines struggle to meet demand without sufficient fuel supplies.

Looking Ahead to e-SAF: The Next Challenge for Aviation

The future of SAF could be even more complex with the looming introduction of e-SAF (electro-fuel) mandates in the UK and EU. Expected to be much more expensive than conventional jet fuel, e-SAF could be up to 12 times more costly. This will undoubtedly affect global flight prices, potentially increasing costs even further. Without strong incentives to boost e-SAF production, airlines may face steep compliance costs, with estimates suggesting an additional EUR 29 billion by 2032 if production targets are not met.

For global travelers, this means that while the promise of sustainable aviation is on the horizon, the journey will be far from smooth. Higher fuel costs could lead to more expensive flights, especially for long-haul international travel. Travelers should prepare for potential price hikes and slower transitions to more eco-friendly flying options.

What Can Travelers Expect?

As airlines struggle to balance sustainability with affordability, travelers can expect a mixed experience. The push for greener aviation is a long-term goal, but the short-term challenges are significant. High fuel prices, limited SAF availability, and policy missteps could lead to higher flight prices, especially in regions with stringent SAF mandates.

However, it’s important to note that the aviation industry is actively working toward solutions. Governments and airlines will need to collaborate on new policies that encourage SAF production while maintaining the affordability of air travel.

For now, travelers should be aware of the ongoing challenges in the aviation sector and adjust their expectations accordingly. If you’re planning to fly in the next few years, understanding how SAF production issues could affect ticket prices and availability of green flights will help you make informed decisions.

Conclusion: A Journey Toward Greener Travel

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a vital part of the future of eco-friendly air travel. However, for global travelers, it’s clear that SAF production must ramp up significantly to meet the aviation industry’s ambitious goals. The current pace of SAF production and the challenges posed by EU and UK mandates could mean higher travel costs and delays in greener flight options.

As travelers, it’s crucial to stay informed about how SAF policies and production levels might affect your future journeys. While the promise of sustainable aviation is a bright one, the path forward may be slower and more expensive than anticipated. Still, the ultimate goal of reducing aviation’s carbon footprint remains in sight, and with the right policy adjustments, we may soon be able to enjoy a more sustainable flying experience.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/5nov10.jpeg,N,,2025-12-09 13:56:16.115194

Geneva, Switzerland, Dec. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --

New Funding Push Accelerates Europe’s Quantum-Safe Digital Ecosystem, Develops a Sovereign Quantum Computer, and Establishes a European Quantum Corridor

SEALSQ Corp (NASDAQ: LAES) (""SEALSQ"" or ""Company""), a company that focuses on developing and selling Semiconductors, PKI, and Post-Quantum technology hardware and software products, supported by a strong liquidity position of almost $450 million, today announced its strategic decision to reinforce Europe’s leadership in Quantum Security, Post-Quantum technologies, and sovereign Quantum computing by increasing Quantum Investment Fund from $35 million to over $100 million. With this step, SEALSQ has significantly amplified its intention to drive Europe’s technological sovereignty, accelerate the rollout of a fully Quantum-Safe digital ecosystem, contribute to the development of a European sovereign Quantum Computer, establish a pan-European Quantum Corridor connecting research, industry, and secure infrastructure across the continent.

A sovereign Quantum Computer is a Quantum computing system that is designed, manufactured, operated, and secured entirely within Europe, without dependence on foreign technologies, cloud infrastructure, or supply chains. Such a system would ensure full regional control over Quantum processors, secure elements, cryptographic layers, algorithms, and data flows. Such a system could embody strategic autonomy, eliminate exposure to foreign vulnerabilities or extraterritorial regulations, preserve European intellectual property, and comply with sovereign cybersecurity and data-protection frameworks. SEALSQ believes that the development of a sovereign Quantum Computer is essential for maintaining Europe’s long-term technological independence and protecting sensitive governmental, industrial, and scientific workloads in the Quantum era.

SEALSQ’s expanded Quantum Fund is being deployed with the goal of accelerating the convergence of Quantum-resilient hardware, PQC algorithms, secure satellite and terrestrial communications, blockchain-backed identity systems, and AI-enhanced hardware security modules. SEALSQ maintains that these foundational elements are necessary not only to build a Post-Quantum secure digital ecosystem but also to create the technological infrastructure required for a sovereign Quantum Computer and a unified continental Quantum Corridor.

Several strategic investments already executed demonstrate SEALSQ’s coordinated approach and its global expansion. Specifically…

In Spain, the company, along with its parent company, WISeKey International Holding AG, (“WISeKey”) (SIX: WIHN, NASDAQ: WKEY), a leading global cybersecurity, blockchain, and IoT company, has committed approximately $12 million to develop a Post-Quantum Semiconductor Personalization and Test Center in Murcia, supported by €20 million from the Spanish government’s SETT.ES program.

In Switzerland, a $3.5 million investment in WeCan Group aims to integrate PQC-secured blockchain identity capabilities into financial and enterprise systems. SEALSQ has also deployed $10 million into WISeSat.Space with the aim to further develop its satellite constellation to deliver Post-Quantum encrypted global communications, enabling secure connectivity across the Quantum Corridor’s terrestrial and space-based nodes.

In France, the acquisition of IC’Alps for a total consideration valued at approximately $14 million enhances SEALSQ’s ability to develop custom Quantum-ready silicon optimized for algorithms such as CRYSTALS-Kyber. An investment in French startup ColibriTD brings QKD and hybrid PQC capabilities into SEALSQ’s architecture, strengthening the end-to-end secure communication needed for Europe’s Quantum future.

In USA, the company has made a strategic investment in EeroQ, a U.S.-based quantum chip design company pioneering a breakthrough approach to building a quantum computer using electrons on helium (eHe). This investment aligns with SEALSQ’s Quantum Made in USA strategy and reinforces its commitment to strengthening the United States and Europe’s leadership in quantum-resistant technologies and future quantum computing platforms.

As Quantum computing evolves, traditional encryption and legacy cybersecurity systems are expected to become vulnerable. SEALSQ’s expanded Quantum Fund plans to ensure that Europe can protect its data, communications, and digital identities against Quantum-enabled threats while laying the groundwork for a sovereign Quantum Computer and a pan-European Quantum Corridor that unites critical infrastructure, research, and industry in a secure, interoperable framework.

“This integrated strategy is not a collection of isolated technologies, it is a coordinated mission to build the world’s first fully vertically integrated quantum computing ecosystem, support the development of a sovereign European Quantum Computer, and establish a Quantum Corridor that ancors Europe’s technological future,” said Carlos Moreira, CEO of SEALSQ. “By increasing our Quantum Fund to over $100 million, we are accelerating the innovation required to protect governments, enterprises, and citizens in the Quantum era. We are building the critical infrastructure of tomorrow, today.”

With its strong liquidity, expanding technological footprint, and commitment to European digital sovereignty, SEALSQ is uniquely positioned to shape the secure Quantum future of Europe and beyond.

,,2025-12-09 16:59:57+00:00,Representative Sharice Davids,"Davids, Colleagues Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Boost Sustainable Aviation, Support Farmers ...",Not Available,,,,,http://davids.house.gov/media/press-releases/davids-colleagues-introduce-bipartisan-bill-boost-sustainable-aviation-support,"“Investing in sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just good for the environment — it’s good for Kansas farmers, our communities, and our economy,” said Davids.
“The Securing America’s Fuels Act is yet another way Congress can grow our bio economy and encourage innovation that creates great jobs across rural America.
Sustainable aviation fuel will help lower emissions while expanding domestic markets for our nation’s farmers, ensuring that our ag economy thrives for generations to come.
“Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products.
""The development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) holds great promise for Nebraska biofuels producers as well as Nebraska's farmers and ranchers,” said Mark McHargue, President, Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation.","Today, U.S. Representative Sharice Davids (D-KS-03) — alongside Representatives Mike Flood (R-NE-01), Troy Carter (D-LA-02), and Tracey Mann (R-KS-01) — introduced the Securing America’s Fuels (SAF) Act, bipartisan legislation designed to strengthen the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry, create economic opportunities for farmers, and reduce emissions in the transportation sector.

“Investing in sustainable aviation fuel isn’t just good for the environment — it’s good for Kansas farmers, our communities, and our economy,” said Davids. “The SAF Act ensures that clean fuel production incentives are strong and long-term so businesses, farmers, and innovators can plan for the future with confidence. The bipartisan support shows the incredible potential we have to build a healthier, stronger, and more prosperous future for generations to come.”

“America is on the cusp of the next great biofuels revolution,” said Representative Mike Flood (R-NE-01). “The Securing America’s Fuels Act is yet another way Congress can grow our bio economy and encourage innovation that creates great jobs across rural America. Sustainable aviation fuel will help lower emissions while expanding domestic markets for our nation’s farmers, ensuring that our ag economy thrives for generations to come. I want to thank Congresswoman Davids for introducing this much-needed bill and look forward to working together to advance this commonsense, bipartisan bill through Congress.”

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry currently relies on the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit to make production economically viable. While recent legislation extended the credit for all clean fuels, it eliminated the SAF-specific bonus. To address this challenge, the SAF Act would:

Reinstate the SAF bonus credit eliminated under the recent federal budget, allowing qualifying SAF producers to receive up to $0.35 or $1.75 per gallon.

Extend the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit for all clean fuels through 2033, providing long-term stability for the growing clean fuels industry.

SAF is a game-changer for local communities, agriculture, and the transportation industry. Scaling SAF to meet U.S. goals could(link is external) generate 33,000 construction jobs over five years, sustain 4,500 permanent operations jobs, and support 60,000 jobs in agriculture and logistics by 2030. SAF can also reduce(link is external) lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent, delivering major environmental benefits while using existing aviation infrastructure.

""Without coordinated action between government and industry, greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase as more people and goods fly through our skies,” said Representative Troy Carter (D-LA-02). “Sustainable aviation fuel is an exciting, new green fuel that’s creating jobs in Louisiana and driving demand for American agricultural products. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation to ensure America is on track to meet the growing demand for cleaner transportation and healthier communities.”

“Sustainable aviation fuel is a worthwhile investment for American agriculture and for American energy dominance,” said Representative Tracey Mann (R-KS-01). “The Securing America’s Fuels Act gives Kansas farmers the certainty they need to plan, invest, and keep supplying fuel to the country and our aviation sector. I will always support legislation that supports rural communities and helps the United States continue to lead the world in producing the fuels of tomorrow.”

Davids co-chairs the Congressional Sustainable Aviation Caucus (CSAC), which works to reduce the aviation industry’s environmental impact and maximize its financial sustainability. By leveraging federal policy, holding forums, and bringing together public and private partners, the caucus plays a key role in the integration of new technologies into the nation’s aviation network.

The bipartisan legislation is endorsed by major industry and agricultural groups, including National Corn Growers Association, SAF Coalition, Airlines for America, Kansas Farm Bureau, Renew Kansas, Kansas Corn, Kansas Soybean Association, Greater New Orleans Inc., Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Twelve, Darling Ingredients, Louisiana Farm Bureau Foundation, Advanced Biofuels Association, Global Business Travel Association, and American Sugarcane League.

“The SAF Coalition applauds Reps. Sharice Davids and Mike Flood for their leadership in introducing The Securing America’s Fuels Act,” said Alison Graab,Executive Director, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Coalition. “This legislation continues the broad, bipartisan support for SAF in Congress and recognizes SAF’s unique ability to fuel America’s energy dominance while supporting American farmers. The SAF Coalition urges Congress to pass this legislation so we can grow America’s rural economies, create new markets for our farmers and secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

“Agriculture and aviation are crucial to Kansas’ economy and Kansas Farm Bureau appreciates Rep. Sharice Davids’ leadership in introducing the Securing America’s Fuels Act alongside Rep. Tracey Mann. Incentivizing the use of domestic crops to produce sustainable fuels creates a new market for Kansas farmers while lowering the carbon emissions of the aviation industry,” said Joe Newland, President, Kansas Farm Bureau.

""The development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) holds great promise for Nebraska biofuels producers as well as Nebraska's farmers and ranchers,” said Mark McHargue, President, Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation. “We appreciate the leadership of Nebraska Congressman Mike Flood in offering this legislation that provides incentives that will help get this emerging industry off the ground. Nebraska Farm Bureau stands ready to work to get this legislation approved and help Nebraska become the SAF epicenter of the country.""

“It is crucial that Congress finds ways to support farmers with good domestic policy, at this time when international trade negotiations have left farmers in difficult market conditions,” said Richard Fotenot, President, Louisiana Farm Bureau. “Congressional policy changes can also provide relief to American consumers. The SAF Act does both. It creates consistency in domestic aviation fuel markets in a sustainable manner important to consumers. We are grateful to Congressman Carter and his colleagues for continuing to find ways to support these efforts through ideas like the SAF Act.”

“SAF may offer a great opportunity for sugarcane farmers,” said Jack Pettus, VP of Government Relations, American Sugar Cane League. “Our mills use bagasse, the fibrous byproduct of recovering sugar from the sugarcane plant, to power their operations during harvest season. Our farmers have been growing and delivering this renewable fuel for over a century and we are anxious to find new uses for the excess biofuel (bagasse) that we currently produce. The American Sugar Cane League appreciates this bipartisan effort to identify and encourage demand for domestic renewable energy feedstocks in markets like aviation fuels.”

“The Advanced Biofuels Association strongly supports this bipartisan effort to strengthen sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers and improve the overall availability of renewable fuels for America’s airline industry,” said Michael McAdams, President, Advanced Biofuels Association. “This type of legislation is essential in the United States’ effort to achieve its energy dominance policy agenda.”

“Delta applauds Reps. Flood, Davids, Mann, and Carter for their leadership in introducing the Securing America's Fuels Act, which will ensure 45Z reaches its full potential and provides the critical investment certainty necessary to bring additional SAF production facilities online to meet our industry's unprecedented demand for cost-competitive, homegrown fuels,"" said Cherie Wilson, Vice President, Government Affairs - Sustainability, Delta Air Lines.

“U.S. airlines are grateful to Representatives Flood, Davids, Carter, and Mann for introducing legislation that would restore and extend the full 45Z tax credit,” said Airlines for America. “This will stimulate private sector investment in SAF while also bolstering American energy dominance. This credit is a win-win for both the aviation and agriculture industries, supporting U.S. job growth across the country.”",http://davids.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/davids.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/JoCo%20Airport%20taxiway%20event.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 12:57:11.731795

Le taux de croissance de la production de SAF fléchit – la reprise est essentielle à l’approche des mandats e-SAF (pdf)

Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production showing that:

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (Mt) (2.4 billion liters), double the 1 Mt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 Mt.

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Negative Effects of EU & UK SAF Mandates

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption:

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, USD 1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

Looking Ahead to e-SAF Mandates

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.

Walsh noted that current fuel supply challenges and supplier pricing abuses make the industry’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 even more difficult and costly than anticipated. “We are not seeing SAF production at the volumes we had hoped and expected,” he stressed, adding that the existing regulatory framework, particularly in Europe, has proven ineffective.

All other regions, including Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, are forecast to fall short of the 5% reduction in CO₂ emissions target unless significant additional SAF capacity is developed.
IBA’s analysis shows that North America’s existing SAF capacity is slightly below the level required for 2030.
Still, when factoring in facilities currently under construction, the region's capacity meets and slightly exceeds ICAO’s notional requirement.
In contrast, Europe, despite a comparatively strong project pipeline, remains below the capacity needed to hit ICAO’s 5% benchmark.","IBA reports that North America is currently the only global region on track to meet the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) cleaner-energy goal for 2030 - a 5% reduction in CO₂ emissions from international aviation via Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and other clean energies.

All other regions, including Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, are forecast to fall short of the 5% reduction in CO₂ emissions target unless significant additional SAF capacity is developed.

IBA calculated these figures by combining ICAO’s latest SAF production capacity data with IBA’s independent global fuel demand forecasts to determine whether each region is building sufficient supply to remain aligned with a credible long-term decarbonization pathway.

IBA’s analysis shows that North America’s existing SAF capacity is slightly below the level required for 2030. Still, when factoring in facilities currently under construction, the region's capacity meets and slightly exceeds ICAO’s notional requirement. This reflects the impact of sustained policy support in the United States, including the federal SAF Grand Challenge, tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and state-level incentives such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which together have helped unlock financing for a diverse range of SAF technologies.

In contrast, Europe, despite a comparatively strong project pipeline, remains below the capacity needed to hit ICAO’s 5% benchmark. While the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation sets progressively rising SAF blend levels from 2025, stringent sustainability criteria and high production costs continue to constrain supply development.

However, IBA notes that the European Commission’s newly announced Sustainable Transport Investment Plan aims to address this gap by mobilizing around €100 billion across aviation and shipping to accelerate the deployment of renewable and low-carbon fuels.

Regions including Latin America, Africa and the Middle East remain considerably behind the required levels, reflecting limited operational capacity and fewer advanced projects in the pipeline. IBA highlights that, for these regions to meet their long-term climate goals, rapid acceleration in both investment and enabling policy frameworks will be required across these markets.

Globally, SAF facilities that are operational or under construction currently equate to around 4.5% of global jet fuel supply in 2025, underscoring the significant scale-up required as the sector works toward ICAO’s 2030 milestone and the broader 2050 net-zero commitments.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/SAF_production_capacity.png,N,,2025-12-09 13:56:39.619948

In their study, Wang and colleagues developed the first quantitative online Raman spectroscopy method for β-farnesene detection during fermentation.
The ability of Raman spectroscopy to capture molecular information from aqueous samples without altering them makes it an ideal candidate for real-time bioprocess monitoring.
The team evaluated how Raman spectroscopy could rapidly quantify β-farnesene levels directly from fermentation wells, enabling high-throughput strain screening (1).
The study positions Raman spectroscopy as not merely a supplementary technique, but a central tool for future bioprocess innovation (1).","Recently, a team of researchers from Beijing University of Chemical Technology conducted a study that highlighted how in-situ Raman spectroscopy can help accelerate the development of bio-aviation fuels. This study, which was led by researcher Meng Wang of Beijing University of Chemical Technology and published in the journal Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments, demonstrated that online Raman analysis can detect β-farnesene, which is a key biofuel precursor, up to 48 times faster than conventional technologies (1).

Bio-aviation fuels are rapidly advancing because of a global push around reducing carbon emissions. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is part of this push. SAF takes renewable biomass and waste resources to use as a fuel alternative for petroleum-based jet fuels (2). Scientists have been able to achieve the performance of petroleum-based jet fuels while reducing carbon emissions (2).

The past 15 years have seen even further advancements. In 2021, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) gave approval of the hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway in 2011 and the direct sugar to hydrocarbon (DSHC) pathway in 2014 (1). Both processes relied on efficient microbial fermentation to produce chemical intermediates such as terpenes and fatty acids (1). Despite all of this progress in fuel chemistry, the real-time monitoring of fermentation remains a major bottleneck, limiting researchers’ ability to optimize production at scale.

For the real-time monitoring of fermentation, techniques such as gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) have been used. Although GC and GC–MS provide the accuracy, they are poorly suited for rapid screening or continuous monitoring (1). That is because these methods require intensive sample preparation, are destructive to the sample, and take 20–35 minutes for each measurement (1). In fast-moving fermentation systems, where conditions can shift quickly, these delays impede process control and slow down strain screening efforts.

In their study, Wang and colleagues developed the first quantitative online Raman spectroscopy method for β-farnesene detection during fermentation. Their approach was designed to shorten the testing time from 20 minutes to just 25 seconds, removing the need for pretreatment steps (1). The ability of Raman spectroscopy to capture molecular information from aqueous samples without altering them makes it an ideal candidate for real-time bioprocess monitoring.

β-Farnesene, a well-studied sesquiterpene and an important precursor in renewable jet fuel production, served as the model compound for the study. The team evaluated how Raman spectroscopy could rapidly quantify β-farnesene levels directly from fermentation wells, enabling high-throughput strain screening (1). The experimentation included optimizing measurement distance and other key detection parameters to ensure accuracy and reproducibility (1).

A major advantage of the new system was its compatibility with 24-well fermentation plates, a standard platform for microbial screening. Instead of extracting samples and transporting them to an analytical lab, researchers can now perform direct, in-situ Raman measurements on each well. The method showed relative errors within 5% for single-phase extractant systems and within 10% when applied directly to post-fermentation wells, which are levels of precision that are considered highly reliable for rapid screening purposes (1).

What are the main takeaways from this study?

This Raman-based method enabled swift, non-destructive detection for high-throughput screening of strains producing terpenes, fatty acids, and other bio-aviation fuel precursors. This means that this technique could potentially applied to other biofuel research programs, not just aviation fuel (1). Because of the method’s success characterizing β-farnesene, the study also suggests that the in-situ Raman spectroscopy method could be applied to other compounds with chemical characteristics to β-farnesene (1).

This study paves the way for more research into sustainable aviation. Carbon-neutral fuels are becoming more pervasive because of global demand, and as a result of this trend, having a method that could evaluate microbial strains and fermentation conditions more quickly could help shorten development timelines and scale production technologies more efficiently (1). The study positions Raman spectroscopy as not merely a supplementary technique, but a central tool for future bioprocess innovation (1).

How collaborative workshops drive safety best practices

At Destination 10X workshops, participants are split into small groups, focusing on a dedicated topic. A Middle East event in 2024 directly addressed several primary safety threats. One of the groups worked on runway incursion, assessing the associated risks, brainstorming effective mitigations and designing a storyboard for a short and comprehensive serious comics to raise awareness on this topic.Captain Anders Hedblom, Qatar Airways Airbus Fleet Safety Manager and attending this session, praised the two-day event for its innovative approach: ""Everyone is brought into the discussion, promoting ideas and learning from others”, he said.

XCF expects New Rise Reno 2 to start production 2028, along with two other SAF projects in the United States.
The budget includes New Rise Reno and New Rise Reno 2.
Besides New Rise Reno 2, another project in Ft Myers, Florida, will be built on a site with access to port infrastructure.","XCF Global Inc said it had completed the initial site work for its second sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility, which will rise adjacent to the one it had put onstream in Storey County, Nevada, early this year.

New Rise Reno 2's 10-acre parcel has been graded and access roads have been built, according to Houston, Texas-based XCF.

""Engineering, design and project planning are underway, positioning construction to begin in 2026"", it said in a press release.

""Located adjacent to the existing New Rise Reno facility in Nevada, the new site will benefit from integration with common facilities such as gas, water, rail and personnel offices as well as existing pre-treatment, hydrogen production and broader logistics infrastructure - reducing capital costs, lowering execution risk and accelerating time to production.

""Since inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF's flagship New Rise Reno facility. New Rise Reno 2 represents the next phase of this growth strategy, with an expected $300 million investment enabling XCF to double SAF production capacity to ~80 million gallons annually"".

XCF expects New Rise Reno 2 to start production 2028, along with two other SAF projects in the United States. All three have a planned nameplate capacity of 40 million gallons a year.

New Rise Reno began production in the first quarter. It has a nameplate capacity of 38 million gallons a year, according to XCF.

""The facility is designed and configured to produce 3,000 barrels per day of synthetic blending component for blending to make sustainable aviation fuel. All fuel is made from renewable triglyceride feedstocks (corn oil, soybean oil or other qualifying oils) that meet the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard"", according to the project website.

XCF chief executive Chris Cooper said, ""This expansion exemplifies how XCF grows: intentionally, efficiently and with a platform built to meet surging global demand"".

XCF noted, ""Federal targets call for three billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons to satisfy 100 percent of domestic demand by 2050; however, current U.S. production remains below one percent of jet fuel demand"".

""Airlines will be required to blend two percent SAF in 2025, increasing to six percent by 2030 and 20 percent by 2035, ultimately rising to 70 percent by 2050. With regional supply unable to meet these mandated volumes, Europe is expected to face structural shortages and persistently elevated SAF pricing"", it said.

""Together, the U.S. and Europe represent one of the largest and fastest-growing opportunities in the clean-energy transition, with the U.S. SAF market projected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2030 and global demand exceeding $25 billion. XCF's scalable, modular SAF platform is built to scale directly into this opportunity"".

XCF announced July 10 an investment plan of nearly $1 billion over the next three years to build SAF production facilities, with most of its in-the-pipeline projects located in the U.S. The budget includes New Rise Reno and New Rise Reno 2.

The announcement follows the completion of the merger between XCF Global Capital Inc and Focus Impact BH3 Acquisition Co, creating what they said is the first publicly traded pureplay SAF producer in the U.S.

Under its U.S. expansion plan, XCF has acquired three sites ""ready for development"", it said in an online statement July 10. The projects are planned to each have a nameplate capacity of 40 million gallons per annum. XCF expects to put them into operation by 2028.

Besides New Rise Reno 2, another project in Ft Myers, Florida, will be built on a site with access to port infrastructure.

The third will rise in Wilson, North Carolina, eyeing East Coast markets.

""These new sites are expected to replicate New Rise Reno's modular, patent-pending site design and bundled technology stack, allowing for rapid deployment, flexible production and capital-efficient scaling"", XCF said.

""Each facility is expected to have the ability to produce multiple renewable fuel products, including SAF and renewable diesel, supporting a multi-product revenue strategy that maximizes plant utilization and financial performance"".

XCF is also pursuing other ""high-potential"" markets, according to the July statement.

On October 23 it said it had signed an initial deal with New Rise Australia Pty Ltd, its joint venture with Perth-based Continual Renewable Ventures Pty Ltd, ""to accelerate the development of renewable fuel production facilities across Australia"".

""The binding term sheet grants New Rise AU an exclusive 15-year license to use the design, layout and configuration of XCF's New Rise Reno facility to build and operate at least three SAF facilities across Australia"", XCF said.

""XCF will receive a 12.5 percent equity stake, licensing fees and one board seat in New Rise AU"".

""Building on today's milestone, the parties intend to execute a definitive licensing agreement within 60 days, following customary diligence and regulatory review"", XCF said. ""The definitive agreement will include detailed provisions for intellectual property, branding, governance, performance milestones and long-term operational coordination"".

国际航协：航空公司盈利预期稳健 2026年净利率3.9% (pdf)

Geneva – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released its latest financial outlook for the global airline industry showing a stabilization of profitability even as supply chain issues persist. Highlights include:

Airlines are expected to achieve a combined total net profit of $41 billion in 2026 (up from $39.5 billion in 2025). While this would set a new record, the net profit margin is expected to be unchanged from 2025 at 3.9%. Net profit per passenger transported is expected to be $7.90 (below the 2023 high of $8.50, and unchanged from 2025).

Operating profit in 2026 is expected to be $72.8 billion (up from $67.0 billion in 2025) for a net operating margin of 6.9% (improved on the 6.6% expected for 2025).

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is expected to be 6.8% (unchanged from 2025). Despite deleveraging and improved operating profitability, ROIC is expected to remain below the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimated to be 8.2% in 2026.

Total industry revenues are expected to reach $1.053 trillion in 2026 (up 4.5% on the $1.008 trillion expected revenues in 2025).

Load factors are forecast to continue to set record highs with airlines expected to fill 83.8% of all seats over the year 2026.

Passenger numbers are expected to reach 5.2 billion in 2026 (up 4.4% on 2025).

Cargo volumes are expected to reach 71.6 million tonnes in 2026 (up 2.4% on 2025).

“Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9% net margin and a $41 billion profit in 2026. That’s extremely welcome news considering the headwinds that the industry faces—rising costs from bottlenecks in the aerospace supply chain, geopolitical conflict, sluggish global trade, and growing regulatory burdens among them. Airlines have successfully built shock-absorbing resilience into their businesses that is delivering stable profitability,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

While strong performance of airlines in the face of a changing and challenging operating environment is impressive, the fact that the airline industry collectively does not generate earnings that cover its cost of capital remains an issue to be resolved. “Industry-level margins are still a pittance considering the value that airlines create by connecting people and economies. They stand at the core of a value chain that underpins nearly 4% of the global economy and supports 87 million jobs. Yet Apple will earn more selling an iPhone cover than the $7.90 airlines will make transporting the average passenger. And even within the air transport value chain, airline margins are totally out of balance, particularly when compared to margins of engine and avionics manufacturers and many of our service suppliers. Imagine the additional power that airlines could bring to economies if we could re-balance value chain profitability, reduce regulatory and tax burdens, and alleviate infrastructure inefficiencies,” said Walsh.

Air cargo’s performance is of particular interest as it has defied many predictions of gloom to hold its own amid rapidly changing trading conditions. “The resilience in air cargo has been particularly impressive. As trade flows adapt to a protectionist US tariff regime, air cargo has been the hero of global trade buoyed in part by robust e-commerce and semiconductor shipments to support the boom in AI investments. Notably, air cargo enabled front-loading to deliver products ahead of tariff deadlines, and it flexibly accommodated demand surges as tariffed goods normally destined for the US found new markets. The critical role of air cargo is front and center as the global economy adjusts to new realities,” said Walsh.

Outlook Drivers

Overall revenues are expected to grow by 4.5% to $1.053 trillion. This is expected to outpace operating expense growth of 4.2% to $981 billion, leading to a $1.5 billion improvement in industry-wide net profitability in 2026.

Macro-economic factors impacting airlines are mixed for 2026. On the positive side, GDP growth is expected to be largely stable at 3.1% and inflation is expected to ease slightly to 3.7%. World trade growth is, however, expected to be anemic at 0.5%.

Revenue

Passenger ticket revenues are expected to reach $751 billion in 2026 (+4.8% on $716 billion in 2025). This growth will be primarily driven by a 4.9% expansion of industry-wide revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) expected in 2026. Yields are expected to remain relatively flat while the passenger load factor is expected to set a new record at 83.8% as new aircraft remain in short supply.

Ancillary and other revenues are projected to rise by 5.5%, reaching $145 billion. Ancillary services now account for nearly 14% of total revenue, up from 12-13% pre-pandemic.

Cargo revenue is forecast to reach $158 billion in 2026 (+2.1% on $155 billion in 2025). This moderate expansion is driven by continued growth in cargo, particularly in time-sensitive shipments and e-commerce volumes (+2.6% growth in cargo tonne kilometers or CTK in 2026, slowing from +3.1% growth in 2025). Coupling these factors with tightening capacity, cargo yields are expected to remain stable (-0.5% on 2025) and elevated (approximately 30% above pre-pandemic levels), despite a broader slowdown in global trade.

Costs

Overall, the 2026 cost outlook points to a more balanced environment. Fuel relief is offset by rising non-fuel pressures, but the broader slowdown in inflation is helping to stabilize the cost base.

Fuel costs are expected to decline slightly to $252 billion in 2026 (-0.3% from $253 billion in 2025). The consensus forecast is for crude oil prices to decline to $62/barrel Brent (-11.0% on $70/barrel in 2025). Jet fuel prices are only expected to decline by 2.4% from $90/barrel in 2025 to $88/barrel in 2026 as the crack spread widens. The expiration of higher-cost hedges from 2025 should allow airlines to realize lower average prices that are closer to market levels. Fuel is set to account for 25.7% of total operating expenses, down from 26.8% in 2025.

Fuel efficiency gains are expected to be just 1.0% as supply chain issues continue to hamper fleet renewal and push the average aircraft age to over 15 years, the highest ever. Factoring in industry growth, fuel consumption is expected to increase to 106 billion gallons in 2026 (+2.7% on 103 billion gallons in 2025).

The cost of compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is expected to grow to $1.7 billion for 2026 (up from $1.3 billion for 2025).

The incremental cost of airline purchases of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is expected to reach $4.5 billion in 2026, with the expectation of 2.4 million tonnes of SAF being available (0.8% of total fuel consumption).

Non-fuel costs are forecast to be $729 billion (+5.8% on $689 billion in 2025). Labor costs are now the largest cost component (28%) as wage growth continues to outpace inflation amid very tight labor market conditions. Despite strong hiring, the airline industry has struggled to restore employment productivity to 2019 levels, as rapid workforce growth has outpaced gains in output per employee amid ongoing operational and training challenges.

Maintenance costs are climbing due to the aging fleet and supply chain disruptions that affect the availability of parts. Lease rates have reached record highs, pushing up ownership costs. Airport and en-route charges continue to rise as well.

A weaker US dollar is expected to benefit non-USD-based airlines’ profitability and margins by reducing US dollar-denominated costs such as fuel, aircraft leases, and maintenance. IATA estimates that 55–60% of global airline costs are denominated in USD, compared to 50–55% on the revenue side. Based on this, a 1% weakening of the USD against global currencies may lift global airline profits by 1% and improve operating margins by around 0.05 ppt.

Risks, Constraints, and Opportunities

Supply chain challenges continue to constrain airlines’ ability to meet consumer demand for air transport. While some improvements are expected in 2026, the backlog in aircraft orders is expected to continue to grow. High load factors and yield stability are partially attributable to supply chain issues. However, the growth-constraining impact of supply chain challenges remains a drag on airline profitability. Even as aircraft deliveries are projected to increase significantly in 2026, the pace of new orders is outstripping production, causing the backlog to reach new highs and signaling that supply constraints, and their financial impact, will persist well beyond the near term.

The regulatory cost burden on airlines is significant. While significant deregulation is being pursued in the US, European regulators have yet to act on the recommendations of the Draghi report to make significant improvements in competitiveness by easing regulatory burdens. A case in point is the attempt to reform the European regulation on passenger rights (EU261), which has been watered down in ambition and convoluted with proposals to essentially make cabin baggage a passenger right irrespective of an airline’s business model or customer need.

Infrastructure constraints are not expected to ease significantly in 2026. However, US plans to renew its air traffic management system in the coming years would be a major improvement. While regulators have reaffirmed International Civil Aviation Organization principles for infrastructure charges, most have failed to use the principles to realize cost efficiencies. A case in point is London’s Heathrow Airport where the potential cost of expansion plans could render the airport uncompetitive without significant reforms.

Conflict continues to hamper airlines with significant costs. Airspace closures, GNSS interference, and re-routing for both political and safety reasons are constraining operations and reducing efficiencies.

Low GDP per capita across much of the continent limits discretionary spending, making air travel highly price sensitive and restricting its growth potential. Demand is further constrained by visa restrictions, restrictive bilateral agreements, and high passenger charges. Moreover, African carriers face the highest unit costs globally, with average cost per ATK near 140 US cents, almost double the industry average. Among the many factors contributing to the high cost of operations in Africa are high fuel costs, fragmented markets, older fleets, and average corporate tax rates of 28% (the highest among all regions).

Until these constraints ease, Africa’s airline industry will operate with thin margins and limited resilience, even as traffic expands faster than the global average.

Passenger demand remains robust, with China and India leading regional expansion, driven by rising tourism activity and the growing middle classes. Easing visa requirements for Chinese group tours to South Korea and for visitors to China are expected to stimulate short-term inbound demand, particularly during peak holiday periods.

Overcapacity remains a challenge amid a slower recovery in international traffic putting pressure on yields. Deflationary pressures are also driving yields lower in China. Nevertheless, Asia Pacific remains the largest contributor to global traffic growth, with load factors projected to reach 84.4% in 2026, an all-time high for the region.

While Chinese exports to the US have declined, substitution effects have helped offset the impact of trade tensions, as Chinese goods have found alternative markets.

Europe is projected to deliver the strongest financial performance in absolute terms among all regions. European airlines show disciplined capacity management and strong load factors. Low-cost carriers are performing particularly well, expanding at double-digit rates and outperforming full-service carriers on net profit margin, fueled by strong intra-European traffic and leisure market. Traffic growth is moderating as the market matures and amid tepid economic conditions in the Euro zone where GDP growth lags the global average.

On the cost side, the strength of the Euro has provided a partial offset to inflationary pressures, particularly in fuel and leasing expenses, helping carriers maintain margins despite volatility in input costs.

The regulatory cost burden is increasing with the ReFuelEU initiative requiring a 2% SAF blend at EU airports from 2025. This coincides with mounting operational headwinds: labor unrest, drone disruptions, and persistent air traffic control bottlenecks.

Traffic growth remains robust driven by economic stability and enhanced intra-regional connectivity. Demand between the Americas has softened, though this has been offset by increased regional flows and a solid transatlantic performance, highlighting the adaptability of carriers in the face of shifting travel patterns.

Operating profitability is anticipated to rebound again in 2026, benefiting from the gradual strengthening of the region’s fundamentals. However, currency fluctuations remain a critical headwind. Although 2025 saw temporary relief with local currencies appreciating, volatility is expected to continue to challenge cost management and profitability.

With several major carriers in the region realizing the benefits of Chapter 11 restructuring, the region’s environment has shifted from crisis-driven survival to cautious, efficiency-focused rebuilding.

The Middle East is the strongest region in terms of net profit margin and profit per passenger. This performance attests to the difference a positive regulatory operating environment can make, and to the region’s strategic position as a global connecting hub.

Passenger demand continues to be robust, driven by long-haul traffic and the expansion of hub carriers. Governments and airlines are doubling down on infrastructure investments to secure long-term growth. While geopolitical tensions remain a feature of the regional landscape, they are not expected to negatively impact growth, particularly as efforts to secure lasting peace continue.

Middle Eastern carriers are mitigating aircraft delivery delays through retrofit programs and fleet life extensions, though capacity growth will remain constrained in the near term.

North American profitability remains stable, but the region ceded its most profitable ranking to Europe in 2025.

The United States suffered stagnating overall growth and a domestic market contraction in the face of policy uncertainty around tariffs, tighter immigration enforcement dampening both inbound and domestic travel, and a lengthy government shutdown. Capacity constraints, pilot shortages, engine reliability issues, and rising labor costs continue to restrict expansion. Despite these hurdles, airlines managed to protect margins in 2025, supported by stable yields and lower fuel prices. Performance, however, varies by business model. Low-cost carriers are under pressure, heavily exposed to the shrinking US domestic segment, growing passenger preferences for premium services, and facing the disadvantages of single-type fleets amid supply chain disruptions.

Looking ahead, 2026 is expected to see some easing of these challenges and the opportunity for a gradual increase in demand.

Travelers’ Viewpoint

Air travel continues to deliver exceptional value to consumers. Average real return air fares in 2025 US dollars were 34.7% cheaper compared to 2015. And passengers are expected to benefit from efficiency gains and competitive forces that will likely see 2026 average return air fares at 36.8% below 2015 level.

An IATA public opinion poll conducted in October-November 2025 (14 countries, 6,500 respondents who have taken at least one trip in the last year) revealed that 97% of travelers expressed satisfaction with their last travel experience. Moreover, 88% agreed that air travel makes their lives better, 78% agreed that air travel is good value for money, and 87% said they cared about their ability to fly in future.

Passengers are counting on a safe, sustainable, efficient, and profitable airline industry. The IATA public opinion polling demonstrated the important role that travelers see the airline industry playing:

90% agreed that air connectivity is critical to the economy

88% said that air travel has a positive impact on societies, and

82% said that the global air transport network is a key contributor to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

83% care about the success of the aviation industry

The air transport industry is committed to its goal of achieving net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Travelers are expressing high levels of confidence in this endeavor with 79% agreeing that the industry is demonstrating commitment to work together to achieve its ambitious goal, 77% agreeing that aviation leaders are taking the climate challenge seriously.

Newland highlighted the importance of backup power systems, especially during extreme weather. He emphasized the vulnerability of the current electrical grid, noting, “Our grid is probably more vulnerable today than it has been in a long time, and that’s due to power plants, the old ones, coming offline, and all the AI technology that’s coming online.” He explained that propane-powered generators can either supplement existing systems or fully power a farm continuously, ensuring that critical operations remain functional during outages. Newland also references the Department of Energy’s resource adequacy report, which he encourages producers to read.

Addressing financial considerations for growers, Newland described incentive programs available to support the transition to propane-powered equipment. He said, “Anybody that’s investing in propane powered equipment around the farm, we have a very unique program…farmers can get a rebate from us up to $10,000 when they purchase propane powered equipment.” He also recommended exploring national grant programs such as USDA’s REAP and EQUIP programs, which could potentially provide additional funding alongside the propane-specific rebate.

On the topic of propane accessibility and reliability, Newland reassured rural producers that supply is robust, noting, “We’ve got, gosh, roughly 3,000 companies selling propane around the country. We’ve got a lot of fuel.” He discussed advances in renewable propane, produced as a byproduct of sustainable aviation fuel, which has “a much lower carbon intensity score” than conventional propane, highlighting the fuel’s clean-burning qualities and its potential for future sustainability improvements.

Newland also touched on innovations in propane-powered agricultural equipment and technology. He described how propane is used in various new applications, saying, “So we’re killing weeds with propane. Classifies as organic pre plant, and then in crop as well. We’ve got a product out in California. We’re injecting steam prior to vegetables being planted, and then that same technology is going to be tested on strawberry production here very soon as well.” These examples illustrate ongoing efforts to expand propane’s versatility in agriculture beyond heating and drying.

Finally, Newland hinted at future developments in mobile and automated solutions, signaling ongoing innovation in propane technology for farms. He expressed optimism about the potential impact of these projects: “We’re always looking for new opportunities. We’re having some mobile ag discussions as well, and we’ll talk more about those hopefully in the coming years, as we get those projects up and get them running.” His comments reflect both the current utility of propane in farming and the sector’s evolving focus on efficiency, sustainability, and advanced automation.",,N,,2025-12-09 09:56:41.026604

We recently performed engine tests on a static engine stand, and used specialist sampling probes to monitor non-CO2 emissions from the jet engine running on different fuels.

This is part of a pioneering project called GRIM-SAF (GRound-Based and Inflight Measurements), which is investigating how sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could reduce aircraft emissions of soot and volatile particles, and a range of gases including nitrogen oxides, often referred to as the non-carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

– Dr Ruth Purvis, research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of York

“We often talk about the environmental impact of air travel in terms of the carbon dioxide emissions produced, but this is just one part of the picture. Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) is a measure of a particular pollutant or sector’s impact on climate. Non-CO2 emissions can contribute up to 66% of aviation’s ERF, compared with 33% from CO2. Additionally, it’s important to understand what effects they have on our local air quality around airports,” explains Dr Paul I Williams, senior research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of Manchester and project lead for GRIM-SAF.

Emissions from aircraft aren’t just limited to the skies; ultrafine particles have been detected many kilometres downwind of airports at ground level, especially major airports that see heavy air traffic. Increased particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the air is a sign of poor air quality, which can be harmful for people living in these locations.

Burning SAF in jet engines still generates air pollution that affects public health, particularly on the ground during idle and taxi when fuel is being burned somewhat inefficiently. If aviation volumes increase in the UK, fuelled by SAF, there will be noise and air quality impacts that need considering alongside greenhouse gas emissions.

– Professor Ally Lewis, research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of York

“This amazing experiment, funded by NERC and the Department for Transport, is making new measurements that will shed some light on the air quality impacts of burning SAF in jet engines. It was coordinated by Dr Andrew Crayford and Dr Eliot Durand at Cardiff University, as well as Dr Paul Williams and Dr Ruth Purvis at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science.

“Some newly built instruments have been used, including a 60 second cycle-time Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer for Volatile Organic Compounds designed by Dr Steve Andrews, and a super high precision sulfur dioxide monitor from Peter Edwards’ group – both developed at the University of York.

“Sulfur dioxide and black soot emissions will likely be lower when adding SAF, but it’s not yet clear what will happen to NOx or other less talked about air pollutants such as benzene, formaldehyde or ultrafine particles,” says Professor Ally Lewis, research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and University of York.

Nitrogen oxides, known as NOx, are significant contributors to air pollution, impacting air quality and affecting our climate. The majority of NOx emissions presently come from cars and HGVs, but as electric cars become more widespread the aviation sector will become responsible for a larger share of this.

Production of SAF doubled between 2024 and 2025 but has not grown at the same rate since. Volumes did not reach the levels that stakeholders had anticipated. Commitments made in 2015 aimed for increases, but progress stalled.

Willie Walsh told the end of year media briefing by IATA in Geneva that airlines had committed to targets such as 10% sustainable aviation fuel usage by 2030. These goals proved difficult to achieve due to limited availability rather than cost issues. Airlines entered these commitments with expectations of greater supply, but shortages forced reevaluations.

He saidegulatory frameworks, particularly in Europe, contributed to this situation by imposing measures that raised costs for airlines. Suppliers implemented compliance fees that elevated fuel prices, affecting the sector’s ability to meet obligations.

He namechecked New Zealand for confronting reality and suspending its targets, highlightiing the broader challenges in the SAF supply chain.

Production continued at current levels without corresponding expansions in infrastructure or policy support. The introduction of mandates has led to suppliers charging additional fees, which airlines viewed as exploitation of their market position. This dynamic protected supplier profits while failing to deliver the required fuel volumes. Airlines struggled to acquire the necessary amounts to fulfill their pledges.

Non-financial measures are a focus as obligations increase into 2026. The failure of the supply side prompted more carriers to assess the feasibility of their earlier targets. Regulators observed these developments without intervening, allowing the price increases to persist. This lack of action compounded the difficulties for the industry.

Key takeaways include the need for improved regulatory frameworks to boost production, the importance of addressing supply shortages to meet commitments, and the call to hold suppliers accountable for fee structures. The sector requires coordinated efforts to prevent further reevaluations of sustainability goals.

Mr Walsh shared: “I’m disappointed that the piece of progress and there are some worrying developments that we witness during 2025.”

“This is a great disappointment a couple of airlines who have committed to high levels of SAF in 2013 made 10pc by 2030 I believe be challenging for the industry to achieve.”",https://www.travelextra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/willie-walsh-of-IATA-853x1024.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 11:57:41.635918

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry.
The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets.
“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.
Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) released new estimates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production showing that:

In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (MMt) (2.4 billion liters), double the 1 MMt produced in 2024. However, in 2026, SAF production growth is projected to slow down and reach 2.4 MMt.

SAF production in 2025 represents only 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption, increasing to 0.8% the following year. At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

The estimated SAF output for 2025 of 1.9 Mt is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities. SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

The Negative Effects of EU & UK SAF Mandates. Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption:

In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have widened their profit margins to such an extent that airlines pay up to five times more than the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF. All this comes without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation.

The UK’s SAF mandate has triggered price spikes, leaving airlines to absorb the burden.

The cumulative impact of poorly designed policy frameworks is that airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 MMt of SAF available in 2025. Of this, $1.4 billion reflects the standard SAF price premium over conventional fuel.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The failure to accelerate the expansion of SAF production capacity will cause many airlines to review their own SAF targets. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

Looking Ahead to e-SAF Mandates. With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), it’s essential not to repeat the policy missteps seen with SAF.

Already, e-SAF faces a much higher cost base, potentially up to 12 times that of conventional jet fuel. Without strong production incentives (as opposed to mandates), supply will fall short of targets. On top of that, compliance costs could escalate to EUR 29 billion by 2032 if targets aren’t met, as seems very likely with the current policy framework.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.

By 2050, when the aviation sector must reach net-zero emissions, Mexico is expected to produce only 3% of the region’s SAF. “SAF is an alternative, but not the only one, and even if we operated entirely with SAF, it is not perfect from an emissions standpoint,” said Roberto Alvo, ALTA chair and CEO, LATAM Airlines. He emphasized that SAF requires long-term, complex investment and should not be treated as the sector’s sole decarbonization tool.

Global carriers have committed to carbon-neutral operations by 2050, requiring fleet modernization, broad SAF integration, and operational efficiency gains. Brazil has introduced the region’s first mandate—requiring airlines to use at least 1% SAF by 2027—though the country does not yet produce the fuel. Industry leaders caution that such measures could raise fares. “In the end, the customer pays the cost,” said SKY Airlines President Holger Paulmann.

ALTA estimates that SAF-related cost increases could be significant. Citing the Air Transport Action Group’s Waypoint analysis, the organization warns of a US$318 billion burden for Latin America and the Caribbean. Copa Airlines CEO Pedro Heilbron stressed that responsibility cannot fall solely on carriers. “Aviation carries that burden, but airlines have the least influence. We do not produce oil, regulate, or finance. This requires joint effort,” he said.

About 75% of aviation’s long-term emissions-reduction potential depends on scaling SAF. Another 20% could come from new technologies, infrastructure upgrades, and fleet renewal. With Latin America operating one of the world’s youngest aircraft fleets—averaging 10.5 years, compared with 16.7 in the United States and 13.5 in the European Union—the region still holds substantial decarbonization potential. “Airlines in our region have worked to maintain newer fleets to achieve lower emissions,” said Estuardo Ortíz, CEO, JetSMART.

Despite the challenges, a 2025 MIT study highlights the emissions gains possible from SAF adoption. Funded by LATAM Airlines Group and Airbus, the analysis finds that aviation emissions in Latin America could fall by up to 60% by 2050 if SAF reaches 65% of total fuel use and is paired with efficiency improvements and supportive policies.

However, the report underscores that costs remain the main barrier. Conventional jet fuel in Latin America averages US$0.70 per liter, while SAF ranges from US$1.11 to US$2.86 per liter, depending on feedstock and production pathway. Because fuel represents more than 40% of airlines’ operating costs, this price gap poses risks to fares, demand, and profitability.

MIT researchers outline several strategies to narrow the cost gap. One option is deeper regional economic integration: countries with stronger SAF feedstock potential—Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru—could supply nations with limited capacity, such as Chile and Mexico. The study estimates such coordination could reduce market disruption by up to 40%. It also identifies feedstocks with strong scalability potential, including ethanol from sugarcane and corn, and HEFA fuels derived from palm or soybean oil. Meeting projected SAF demand, however, will require an estimated US$204 billion in regional production-facility investment through 2050.

Stronger government action will be essential for SAF competitiveness. According to the report, policy tools—including carbon pricing, blending mandates, feedstock certification, and tax incentives—could accelerate adoption. Researchers point to the US 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit, which offers US$0.75–US$1.75 per gallon, as an effective model.

“SAF is a promising decarbonization pathway, but it must be combined with an economy-wide emissions mitigation policy that uses market-based mechanisms to offset the remaining emissions,” said MIT researcher Sergey Paltsev.

LATAM Airlines Group Director of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Juan José Tohá stressed that the region cannot meet its climate goals without SAF. “We must chart the right path to reduce the risk of rising costs and avoid compromising regional connectivity,” he said. “Regional integration is a key alternative to limit cost overruns and ensure the transition toward more sustainable aviation.”",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/pexels-pixabay-62623.jpg?h=32973ddf&itok=OI3X_yDA,N,,2025-12-09 09:57:03.367104

Abu Dhabi Advances Circular, Low-Carbon Aviation with First Commercial-Scale Waste-to-SAF Project

A Continental Push for Energy Efficiency

At the heart of the AU’s strategy is a major drive to improve energy efficiency across industrial, commercial, transport, and residential sectors.

African states are being encouraged to adopt stronger energy-performance standards, digitize power systems, modernize grids, and transition large-scale operations toward low-waste, high-efficiency models.

This is particularly significant for fast-growing economies where demand for power is rising sharply. Enhanced energy productivity will help reduce strain on national grids, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and lower energy costs for businesses and households.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Becomes a Priority

A major highlight of the AU’s strategy is Africa’s bold commitment to developing local supply chains for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Low-Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF).

This move aims to give the continent a leadership position in the global aviation decarbonization race, especially as airlines worldwide face increasing pressure to meet net-zero aviation goals.

With vast biomass resources, emerging biofuel innovators, and growing airport infrastructure, Africa has the potential to become a key SAF producer and exporter.

The strategy encourages member states to:

Build regional refineries and bioprocessing hubs

Develop supportive policies and incentives

Foster public-private partnerships with airlines and energy companies

Invest in research and innovation for next-gen aviation fuels

Smart Infrastructure for a Low-Carbon Future

Beyond fuels and energy systems, the AU’s framework emphasizes smarter, climate-resilient infrastructure. This includes digitalized transport networks, energy-efficient buildings, and adaptive urban planning capable of supporting Africa’s rapidly expanding cities.

Smart infrastructure will play a crucial role in helping African nations withstand climate impacts while unlocking new growth opportunities through green industries, manufacturing, and clean mobility.

Aligning with Agenda 2063

The AU’s new energy and aviation policies directly support the continent’s long-term development blueprint — Agenda 2063. By prioritizing sustainability, innovation, and low-carbon development, the strategy positions Africa to attract global climate finance, strengthen regional trade, and advance the transition to a modern clean-energy economy.

Conclusion: A Unified Continental Leap Toward Sustainability

Africa’s endorsement of energy-efficiency reforms, sustainable aviation fuels, and climate-smart infrastructure marks a major turning point in its green transition journey.

With coordinated regional action and a future-focused policy framework, the continent is not only addressing climate challenges but also positioning itself as a competitive force in the global green economy.

London, UK – 8th, December, 2025: Rolls-Royce, easyJet, Heathrow and University College London Air Transportation Systems Lab (UCL ATSLab) published a report highlighting how hydrogen-powered aircraft could enable European and UK aviation to cut carbon emissions while supporting future growth.

The study, Enabling Hydrogen in the European Aviation Market, found that hydrogen in aviation offers a unique opportunity to achieve both emissions reduction and market expansion. The analysis shows that introducing hydrogen alongside Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can accelerate progress towards net zero, particularly when policy incentives reward low-carbon fuels and if hydrogen were to be included within the EU’s SAF mandate1.

The research also found that targeted hydrogen infrastructure at around 20 major European airports, including Heathrow, could deliver more than 80% of the emissions benefits of full hydrogen availability across the continent. Concentrating investment at key ‘hydrogen hubs’ would therefore provide a practical and cost-effective path to early adoption.

Further modelling indicates that the earlier novel technologies, such as hydrogen, can be introduced, the more opportunity they present for CO2 emission reductions, underscoring the value of early technological transition where it is financially and technically viable.

North America on track for ICAO’s 2030 cleaner-energy target as other regions lag

IBA, the aviation market intelligence and advisory company, reports that North America is currently the only global region on track to meet the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) cleaner-energy goal for 2030: a 5% reduction in CO₂ emissions from international aviation through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other clean energy sources.

All other regions, including Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, are forecast to fall short of the 5% CO₂ reduction target unless substantial additional SAF capacity is developed.

IBA calculated these figures by combining ICAO’s latest SAF production capacity data with its own independent global fuel demand forecasts to assess whether each region is developing sufficient supply to remain aligned with a credible long-term decarbonisation pathway. The analysis shows that North America’s existing SAF capacity is slightly below the level required for 2030, but when including facilities currently under construction, the region’s capacity meets and slightly exceeds ICAO’s notional requirement. This reflects the impact of sustained policy support in the United States, including the federal SAF Grand Challenge, tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, and state-level measures such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which together have helped unlock financing for a diverse range of SAF technologies.

In contrast, Europe, despite a comparatively strong project pipeline, remains below the capacity needed to achieve ICAO’s 5% benchmark. Although the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation sets progressively rising SAF blend levels from 2025, stringent sustainability criteria and high production costs continue to limit supply growth.

However, IBA notes that the European Commission’s newly announced Sustainable Transport Investment Plan aims to address this shortfall by mobilising around €100 billion across aviation and shipping to accelerate the deployment of renewable and low-carbon fuels.

Regions including Latin America, Africa and the Middle East remain significantly behind the required levels, reflecting limited operational capacity and fewer advanced projects under development. IBA highlights that, for these regions to meet their long-term climate goals, rapid acceleration in investment and enabling policy frameworks will be necessary.

Globally, SAF facilities that are operational or under construction currently represent around 4.5% of global jet fuel supply in 2025, underscoring the substantial scale-up required as the sector works towards ICAO’s 2030 milestone and the broader 2050 net-zero commitments.

Copper miner Antofagasta was down after the copper price eased from a record high as traders looked ahead to the Fed decision and the prospect of tight supply.

The US home improvement chain has forecast comparable sales and profit growth for 2026 below expectations, as higher borrowing costs have led consumers to cut spending on do-it-yourself projects and big-ticket items.

Home Depot shares slid 1.6 per cent in pre-market trading after the retailer outlined financial targets ahead of its first investor day in more than two years.

The retailer expects same-store sales for 2026 of between 0 per cent and 2 per cent, compared with analysts’ expectations of 2.34 per cent, according to LSEG data. It forecast adjusted earnings per share to be flat to 4 per cent higher, against forecasts of growth of 5.6 per cent.

Fraud and error linked to financial support during the coronavirus pandemic cost taxpayers £10.9 billion, a report has found.

The authors warned that only £1.8 billion has been recovered and said “much of the shortfall is now beyond recovery”.

The final report by the Covid counterfraud commissioner, Tom Hayhoe, found that many schemes, including Eat Out To Help Out and Bounce Back Loans, were rolled out quickly with significant risks.

He said many decisions taken during Covid lockdowns “paid too little attention to the risk of fraud”.

Hayhoe said in his report that while the support schemes were credited with helping to prop up the economy, prioritising speed in their delivery led to a “high level” of fraud risk.

More than 38 billion items of personal protective equipment were bought between February and July 2020. Around 11 billion items had not been used by March 2024 and losses amounted to around £10 billion, the report said.

Soup-maker Campbell’s beat Wall Street estimates for first-quarter sales, as consumers eat out less amid economic uncertainty.

Persistent inflation and tariff-related volatility have led to shoppers stocking up on pantry staples to cook meals rather than spending on expensive restaurant food.

The company said in September it will remove synthetic dyes from its food and beverage portfolio, a trend that is accelerating among packaged food makers, as more consumers opt for healthier options and the Trump administration pushes the “Make America Healthy Again” campaign.

Campbell’s reported net sales of $2.7 billion in the first quarter ended November 2, compared with the average analyst estimate of $2.66 billion.

Shares in Applied Nutrition jumped 7 per cent after the protein shake maker backed by Coleen Rooney said it will exceed City forecasts this year.

The Liverpool-based company, which was one of London’s bigger IPO’s last year, expects full year profits to come in about 10 per cent higher than expected.

In an unscheduled trading update, the company said it recognised the “strength of trading and the upcoming peak trading period for health, fitness and wellbeing, which will deliver a particularly strong first half.”

The consensus among analysts is for revenues of £122 million for the 12 months to the end of July, and adjusted underlying profit of £34.4 million.

The statement sent the shares 17¼p, or 8.6 per cent, higher to 217p, a new record, in morning trading. It means Applied shares have risen by more than half since it floated in October 2024 at 140p-a-share

The European Commission has opened a formal competition investigation into Google’s use of publishers’ and YouTube creators’ content to train and power its AI services.

Competition regulators will assess whether Google imposed unfair terms, granted itself privileged access, or hindered rival AI developers. The focus is Google’s use of web material for AI overviews and AI mode without compensation or a meaningful opt-out that wouldn’t jeopardise traffic. Investigators will also examine whether YouTube uploads have trained Google’s models without paying creators, while rival developers are blocked from similar data.

If proven, the practices could constitute abuse of dominance under EU law. Google said: “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever. Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”

BMW has appointed Milan Nedeljkovic as chief executive, replacing long-time boss Oliver Zipse, as the carmaker prepares to launch a new generation of models in the face of strong competition from China and US tariffs that led it to cut its 2025 profit forecast.

Serbian-born Nedeljkovic, 56, is currently head of production and has been with BMW since 1993. He will take up the role on May 14. The company is pinning hopes on the first model from its all-electric Neue Klasse line to drive growth from 2026.

Supervisory board chair Nicolas Peter said Nedeljkovic “unites people and motivates them to achieve peak performance”.

The Railways Bill, which is scheduled for its second reading in the House of Commons today around 12.30pm, will create Great British Railways, bringing together 17 different organisations to run Britain’s railways as a single organisation.

Here is a glimpse of Great British Railways’ branding. This is what the Department of Transport said about it: “The design features a red, white and blue colour scheme and sharp angles to create a striking and memorable design mirroring the Union Flag. The GBR logo has also been revealed, featuring the iconic double arrow symbol in a nod to Britain’s proud railway heritage.”

The global airline industry is set to miss its green fuel targets, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned, citing limited production and regulatory hurdles. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), mainly made from waste or used cooking oil, cuts emissions but remains two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. IATA projects SAF will account for just 0.8 per cent of total fuel use next year, despite the sector’s 2050 net-zero goal relying heavily on it.

Willie Walsh, the director-general, said: “It’s not an issue of price, it’s an issue of availability.” He warned many carriers could fail to meet their sustainability pledges in 2026, underscoring the gap between ambitious climate targets and the limited supply of SAF.

The pound has edged higher against the dollar and the euro this morning, helped by a weaker dollar on expectations of a US Fed rate cut.

The currency was up 0.2 per cent against the dollar to $1.3348 and 0.04 per cent against the euro to €1.1452.

UK borrowing costs have eased with bond yields down across the curve. The yield on the 10-year gilt, a proxy for government borrowing, was at 4.5 per cent, down 4 basis points.

Grocery inflation held steady at 4.7 per cent in the four weeks to November 30, data from Worldpanel showed. The early indicator precedes official UK inflation figures due on December 17 — food prices influence public inflation expectations, which are closely watched by the Bank of England.

Prices rose fastest for chocolate confectionery, fresh meat and poultry, while sugar confectionery, household paper and fragrances saw the largest declines. Grocery sales increased 3.4 per cent over the period, suggesting volumes fell after accounting for inflation. Retailers are boosting promotions to attract shoppers.

The data underlines ongoing cost pressures for households despite headline inflation easing to 3.6 per cent.

Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of American asset manager Blackstone, dismissed concerns over private credit after recent US bankruptcies of First Brands and subprime lender Tricolor. He said at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week that deals were underwritten and syndicated by banks, with private credit largely uninvolved.

Schwarzman said banks were leveraged at least ten to one, compared with about 1.4 times for private credit, emphasising that the latter is far more conservative and poses less systemic risk.

The Bank of England is concerned about threats that could be lurking in fast-growing but opaque and lightly regulated private markets. Andrew Bailey, the Bank governor, said recently that Tricolor and First Brands were partly financed by private credit, which had “intensified the focus” on possible risks in this area.

Hedge fund leaders and the Abu Dhabi investment council see 2026 as a year of opportunity amid geopolitical tensions and diverging interest rates. Speaking at Abu Dhabi Finance Week, Shiv Srinivasan, the chief investor at the state-backed fund, said rising market volatility from elections and global events favours macroeconomic and long-volatility strategies.

Robyn Grew, the Man Group chief, said volatility and market dispersion create trading opportunities, while Brevan Howard’s Aron Landy expects global asset value differences and interest rate divergence to drive gains. Landy also sees potential in cryptocurrencies, noting the risk lies in having no exposure. All emphasised that “with pain comes opportunity” for investors.

Thyssenkrupp expects a net loss of up to €800 million in 2026 due to costs relating to the restructuring of its steel unit, which it is in talks to sell to India’s Jindal Steel International.

The group has struggled to divest its steel division, Germany’s largest, largely due to €2.7 billion in pension liabilities. Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe caused €600 million in impairments last year in the face of Asian competition, US tariffs, and a weak European economy. Thyssenkrupp shares fell 4 per cent.

London’s leading share index opened slightly down as Ukraine prepared to present a revised peace plan to the White House and mixed corporate news.

The Bank of England is planning to cut jobs to cope with the cost of implementing changes highlighted in a review by the former US Federal Reserve chair, Ben Bernanke, including upgrading its economic modelling and forecasting processes.

Bloomberg reported that the central bank is running a time-limited voluntary severance scheme. The Bank may need to levy higher charges on the banks and financial services companies if cost targets are not met. It is said to be looking to save 8 per cent of its operating costs in the next financial year.

German exports edged up 0.1 per cent in October, defying expectations for a 0.5 per cent decline, supported by stronger trade within the European Union, while shipments to the US and China fell sharply, data from the federal statistics office showed.

Imports dropped 1.2 per cent on a seasonal and calendar-adjusted basis. The country’s foreign trade surplus widened to €16.9 billion from €15.3 billion in September and €14.6 billion a year earlier.

IBM is to buy the data infrastructure company Confluent in a deal valued at $11 billion, ramping up its cloud-computing offerings to capitalise on an AI-driven demand boom.

Confluent, based in Mountain View, California, provides the technology needed to manage real-time data streams for artificial intelligence models.

Arvind Krishna, the IBM chief, has been beefing up the company’s cloud and software business as customers upgrade their digital infrastructure to cope with artificial intelligence applications. Krishna said: “With the acquisition of Confluent, IBM will provide the smart data platform for enterprise IT, purpose-built for AI.”

Other companies reporting today include:

Ashtead: The FTSE 100 industrial equipment hire group has reported that interim headline pre-tax profits fell 10 per cent to $1.08 billion in the six months to the end of October, down from $1.19 billion. Revenue over the period rose 1 per cent to $5.76 billion. Alongside the results, Ashtead said plans to shift its primary stock market listing to New York in March were on track.

Chemring: The FTSE 250 defence group has reported that pre-tax profits from continuing operations rose to £67.7 million in the 12 months to the end of October, from £51.8 million the year before. Revenue over the period rose to £497.5 million, from £488.3 million.

British American Tobacco: The tobacco company announced plans to increase its share buy-back programme to £1.3 billion as it said it expects to deliver full-year results in line with City expectations when it posts its results in February.

Frasers: The Sports Direct owner said it has acquired the Swindon Designer Outlet, a 250,000 sq ft out-of-town shopping centre. No financial details of the deal have been disclosed. Michael Murray, the chief executive, said: “Physical retail is central to our … strategy and investing in Swindon — one of the UK’s top five outlets by footfall — strengthens our position as both retailer and landlord.”

Pennon: The owner of South West Water and Bristol Water has confirmed that Susan Davy will step down as chief executive on December 31, after her previously announced retirement. Until her successor, Keith Haslett, joins — expected no later than June 30 — the chairman David Sproul will take on the role of executive chair.

Nickyl Raithatha is stepping down as chief executive of Moonpig on a high note, with the online greeting cards and gifts group returning to profit. Moonpig posted a pre-tax profit of £26.6 million for the six months to the end of October, reversing a £33.3 million loss in the same period last year, while revenue rose 6.7 per cent to £168.6 million.

Raithatha, who unexpectedly announced his departure in June after seven years as chief executive, will leave at the end of the year. Catherine Faiers, currently AutoTrader’s chief operating officer, will succeed him in March. Moonpig’s shares, which soared on its February 2021 debut, are still 38 per cent below their float price, despite recent profit growth. The stock initially jumped from 350p to 488p within months of listing.

Gold edged lower as investors priced in a Federal Reserve rate cut at the start of the US central bank’s two-day policy meeting later today.

Spot gold slipped 0.2 per cent to $4,181.50 an ounce. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields held near a 2½-month high.

Analysts expect a “hawkish cut” with guidance pointing to a high bar for further easing. Markets see an 89 per cent chance of a quarter-point cut this week, according to CME’s FedWatch Tool.

The US will allow Nvidia to export its H200 artificial intelligence chips, its second-best processors, to China and collect a 25 per cent fee on sales, President Trump said on Monday.

The move appears to settle a debate over whether US chipmakers should sell to China to maintain global leadership or restrict exports on security grounds. Beijing has warned companies against using US technology, raising uncertainty over demand.

“We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI,” Trump wrote, adding that Nvidia’s US customers are moving ahead with its latest Blackwell and future Rubin chips, which are excluded from the deal.

Nvidia shares rose 2 per cent in after-hours trading. Trump said President Xi “responded positively”. Officials called it a compromise that limited the advantage of Huawei, the Chinese chipmaker.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fd6875f13-a401-4082-9d2b-41977b90963f.jpg?crop=3902%2C2195%2C0%2C203&resize=1200,N,,2025-12-09 09:57:32.277313

GENEVA, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The global airline industry is likely to miss its targets for green jet fuel use ​in the coming years, the International Air Transport Association said on Tuesday, blaming ‌fuel producers and regulators for the ""disappointing"" progress.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made largely from waste or used cooking oil, can ‌cut emissions significantly compared with traditional jet fuel. However, it remains two to five times more expensive than conventional fuel.

IATA expects 2.4 million metric tons of SAF to be available in 2026, covering just 0.8% of total fuel consumption. That means the growth of the SAF ⁠sector has slowed - production growth ‌doubled between 2024 and 2025, but will likely only grew by 0.5 million metric tons between 2025 and 2026, IATA said.

The wider aviation ‍sector committed in 2021 to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, relying heavily on a gradual switch to SAF.

""We're not seeing SAF produced in the volumes we had hoped for and had expected. That ​is disappointing,"" the trade group's director general Willie Walsh told journalists. He had previously ‌warned that the 2050 net zero goal could be at risk.

Sustainable aviation fuel accounts for about 0.3% of the world's jet fuel use and was projected to reach only 0.7% by 2025, according to IATA data. Experts say production needs to grow quickly for the sector to meet its emissions goals.

Airlines have long said that they are willing to ⁠buy all of the SAF available, but accuse ​jet fuel producers of artificially inflating prices and failing ​to produce enough of the greener fuel.

""It's not an issue of price, it's an issue of availability, and they're just not able to get ‍their hands on the ⁠SAF that they require to fulfil the ambition that they expressed,"" Walsh said.

IATA's Chief Economist Marie Owens Thomsen added that regulatory mandates introduced by the European Union ⁠and Britain have encouraged fuel producers to raise prices on SAF even further, with Walsh adding that ‌the practice is synonymous with price gouging.

Since then, the Aspen-based organization, now called Climate Curve, has awarded $2.75 million to 80 innovators working to curb climate change. The awardees have gone on to raise $2.87 billion in investments.

In February 2026, Climate Curve is launching a new prize focused on methane emissions from food systems. The Climate Curve Prize: Methane will distribute $200,000 across eight solutions worldwide.

Francis told Aspen Public Radio’s Michael Fanelli that methane emissions are growing worldwide, and curbing them could act as a “parachute” to slow the trajectory of global warming.

The conversation below has been edited for clarity and length.

Michael Fanelli: Tell me about the forthcoming methane prize.

Jacquelyn Francis: So it's going to be a first-of-its-kind methane prize that's focused on the food systems. And that basically means everything from soil to soil. So everything where it's grown in agriculture, to livestock, to how things are transported. And also the waste, like what happens before and after it's thrown away, and it's a full cycle kind of idea of circular economy.

MF: Why is this an important thing to focus on now methane?

JF: Methane is just increasing in our world right now, and there's not a lot being done about that. It is a very potent greenhouse gas. It actually disperses into the atmosphere quite quickly. And it's a heat-trapping gas that actually traps 85% more heat than carbon dioxide. So if we were able to actually reduce our man-made methane impacts, then it could be considered like an emergency brake on our global heating that's happening right now. This could give us more time to actually move past some of the other really more embedded systems that we have in our world when it comes to fossil fuels. We're basically falling into a volcano, our entire civilization, and methane [reduction] is a way to kind of slow our fall.

MF: It sounds like this might have an agricultural focus. Can you talk about how this might be relevant to locals here in the Roaring Fork Valley?

JF: Yeah for sure, agriculture and waste [are] all part of our food systems. There are ways that you can actually grow your food differently that can produce less emissions. There are ways that you can feed your cattle differently to increase their ability to digest the food so that they don't have as much methane gas coming from their systems. There are also supplements that can be given to cattle and vaccines that can reduce their methane emissions by about 80-85%. A lot of companies are working on covering landfills in order to capture the methane emissions and then use them as an energy source.

MF: Your main thing you do as an organization is the Keeling Curve Prize. I realize there's been a lot, but can you think of an example or two of a memorable standout project that has won?

JF: There are a few that have really gone on to be incredible investment opportunities. One of those is a company called LanzaTech that actually is a publicly traded company now, and they make materials out of carbon that comes from all different kinds of sources. And one of the things they're working on is sustainable aviation fuel. So I've done a lot of extra work with LanzaTech as well, because I'm really, really interested in the idea of creating a market around sustainable aviation fuel. The real barrier for sustainable aviation fuel is not the technology and what can be done with biotechnology solutions in aviation fuel, but that it costs more. And we're not really willing as a society to pay more for our aviation fuel, which I find to be something that should change. So LanzaTech is one of them. We have a lot of nature-based solutions that I find super interesting. One of them, Canopy Planet, is about supply chains and getting your products from verified sources that have good practices.

MF: Was there anything else that you wanted to touch on?

JF: I think one of the things that I'd like your listeners to hear is: this is a problem that's fixable. And in my view, there are four existential crises in our world. It's nuclear warfare; it's an asteroid hitting us; it's some kind of biological or virus that takes everybody out that's much more powerful than Covid; And it's climate change — climate systems change. And I think people don't understand that this is such an important issue that we can solve, and this is probably the one out of those four that is the most solvable by human ingenuity and momentum building. We can do this. We just have to put more money behind it and more awareness and take on the challenge, just like humans are able to do in a lot of other situations. This is a huge endeavor, but we can do it, and the opportunities around it are — they're just immense. And that's what I want people to understand, that you have to do something about it, and we have to do something about it now, but we can.

MF: I think that's a good note to end on.

The new 10‑year Cleaner Fuels Program is designed to stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.
“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia,” said Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers.
“Low carbon liquid fuels are essential for heavy vehicles and machinery that cannot yet be easily electrified,” he said.
Fast Fact Australia’s new $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program aims to kick-start domestic production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, with first ‘drop-in’ cleaner fuels expected by 2029.","The Australian Federal Government has announced it is investing $1.1 billion in low carbon liquid fuels.

This investment will reportedly bolster the sustainable fuel supply chain for all modes of transport.

The new 10‑year Cleaner Fuels Program is designed to stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The first production of ‘drop‑in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

Australia has access to feedstocks including canola, sorghum, sugar and waste – the goods needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives.

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives could deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow.

The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050.

Funding to make cleaner fuel on Australian shores, from Australian feedstock, will reportedly help back Australian innovators from the farmer to the fuel bowser, make domestic fuel supply greener and more resilient and make low carbon fuels available for early adopters.

Details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place this financial year. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process to ensure we get value for taxpayer funds.

The new production‑linked incentive builds on the government’s support via the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The Government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

A recent report from the CEFC found that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuels industry could deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2‑e in cumulative emissions reduction by 2050. This is equivalent to 2.3 times Australia’s current annual transport emissions, or the annual emissions from 86 million cars.

“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia,” said Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global Net Zero transformation.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global Net Zero supply chains.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, said making cleaner fuels locally from Australian feedstocks creates the path for emissions reduction in sectors that are hardest to clean up.

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production,” he said.

“A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

Murray Watt, Acting Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, said it is essential to invest in future fuels as demand for air travel grows and more goods are moved by road and rail.

“Low carbon fuels have the potential to be a $36 billion industry here in Australia, and we have the opportunity to lead the way on the production of these new fuels,” he said.

“We have the renewable feedstocks, access to clean energy and a strong agriculture base, all of which will allow us to develop this new industry, create new jobs and power how Australians move for decades to come.”

Julie Collins, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, said this investment is great news for farmers and regional communities.

“Producing more low carbon liquid fuels right here in Australia won’t just benefit our fuel security and emissions reduction, it will support Australian farmers, foresters and our regions,” she said.

“Our farmers and foresters have always been innovators and our government is putting their expertise and world‑class production practices at the centre of growing Australia’s low carbon liquid fuel industry.

“This investment will complement our National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy – which we are developing so our agricultural sector can seize the economic opportunities that come with feedstocks.”

NatRoad CEO, Warren Clark, also welcomes this announcement which is in line with NatRoad’s recommendations as part of its advocacy efforts.

“It’s good to see the Federal Government is listening to industry and taking action,” said Clark.

“NatRoad has been working behind the scenes for years now and thanks the government and the departments for making solid progress.

“We have provided multiple submissions recommending low carbon diesel as a key component of the broader plan, and providing monetary support to help kick-start the support and businesses required to reduce heavy vehicle emissions as we transition to Net Zero.

“This includes NatRoad’s Stronger Economy, Lower Emissions policy paper that included low carbon liquid fuels as one of our critical recommendations to government, and this week we provided a submission to the Productivity Commission’s inquiry into cheaper, cleaner energy solutions that supported policies aimed at increasing supply and lowering prices of low-carbon fuels.”

Clark added that while NatRoad welcomes this investment, managing the cost of using alternative fuels for road transport operators will be critical to their effectiveness in lowering heavy vehicle emissions.

“We have made it clear in our advocacy that the road transport industry needs a ‘fair go’ transition strategy, with a clear and cost-effective policy framework to ensure road transport operators aren’t forced to absorb higher fuel costs,” said Clark.

“This is particularly important at a time when margins are incredibly tight, and operators are already dealing with significant uncertainty around costs.”

Clark said the road freight sector is ready to adapt and support the transition to lower carbon-emitting ways of operating, but it is vital that measures are put in place to ensure as many road transport businesses can participate as possible.

“About 98 per cent of the road freight industry consists of small businesses, and we must ensure carbon reduction initiatives aren’t too costly, time consuming or complicated for them to take part,” said Clark.

“We look forward to continuing to work with the Federal Government to help bring about a transition to net zero emissions that is fair, cost-effective and accessible for all the road freight industry.”

In addition to its regular submissions to government on emissions-reduction initiatives, NatRoad has developed a Get Fleet Fit roadmap aimed at helping truck operators cut costs, improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions as part of the Net Zero transition.

Meanwhile, Victorian Transport Association (VTA) CEO, Peter Anderson, described this investment as a vital step in supporting the industry’s transition to a lower-emissions future.

“Low carbon liquid fuels are essential for heavy vehicles and machinery that cannot yet be easily electrified,” he said.

“Supporting local production of these fuels will help reduce emissions while maintaining the reliability and resilience of our supply chains.

“The VTA has long advocated for a supported and realistic transition, and this announcement shows the government understands that decarbonising freight will take time, investment and collaboration.

“We also urge continued support for freight operators, particularly small and medium businesses, as they adapt to new fuel technologies and infrastructure.”

The VTA continues to lead industry efforts to decarbonise through education, advocacy and collaboration.

On 18 November, the VTA hosted its Alternative Fuel Summit in Melbourne, bringing together experts, operators and policymakers to explore the theme ‘Is transport ready to decarbonise?’.

Now in its fourth iteration, the summit reflects the VTA’s ongoing commitment to helping members navigate the transition to low-emission technologies. The event will provide a platform for robust discussion and practical insights into the readiness of the freight sector for this significant shift.

“The Alternative Fuel Summit is about bringing the industry together to ask the hard questions and share knowledge,” said Anderson. “We’re proud to play a role in guiding our members through this transition and ensuring they’re equipped to meet the challenges and opportunities of a low-carbon future.”

Australian Logistics Council CEO, Dr Hermione Parsons, said the commitment is a milestone that recognises the scale of change required across the economy.

“Freight and supply chains enable every sector from agriculture to resources to health care,” she said.

“Decarbonising these systems is not simply an environmental imperative, it is essential to national productivity, resilience and prosperity. The Net Zero Plan sets a platform for action, and the ALC advocates for freight to be positioned at the centre of this transition.”

The plan, according to the ALC, identifies clean electricity, electrification, low carbon fuels and technology innovation as national priorities to ensure freight can contribute effectively to these goals.

“The ALC considers it essential to develop a nationally coordinated transition plan for heavy vehicles,” said Dr Parsons.

“This should include measures such as corridor charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastructure, depot energy planning, targeted operator incentives and reforms to licensing frameworks that currently limit workforce participation.

“The ALC also recommends addressing the operational realities of rail freight, including access regimes, pricing and last-mile bottlenecks to enable genuine mode shift rather than a narrow focus on new technologies.

“Freight continuity, redundancy and cross-border protocols should be embedded into disaster and infrastructure planning to strengthen resilience and prevent communities and businesses from being isolated during crises.”

The transition will also require a workforce transformation, the ALC added.

Investment in skills, training and VET pathways must be matched with deliberate measures to boost diversity and First Nations participation. Licensing and regulatory reforms should also support broader workforce participation, ensuring freight remains safe, efficient and inclusive as the sector modernises.

Infrastructure and construction must also be part of the solution according to the ALC. Measuring and reducing embodied emissions in steel, cement and concrete, embedding circular economy practices and aligning procurement standards will be critical to lowering the carbon footprint of freight infrastructure.

This demands cross-government collaboration, harmonised policy settings, consistent emissions reporting frameworks and interoperable data systems.

Dr Parsons said ALC will work closely with government to ensure the freight sector is positioned at the heart of the transition.

“Australia cannot reach its climate goals without freight,” she said.

“Placing freight at the centre of planning and reform will strengthen supply chains, deliver energy security and create new opportunities for investment and jobs.

“We welcome the ambition of the 2035 target and the Net Zero Plan, and we look forward to working with government and industry to build a resilient, productive and sustainable freight system that supports a prosperous, low-emissions future for Australia.”

After that point, biomass yield is determined by tiller mass.","URBANA, Ill. — To meet ambitious U.S. Department of Energy targets for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), production of purpose-grown energy crops must ramp up significantly. Although researchers have made substantial progress in understanding the management and conversion of these crops, key knowledge gaps hold the industry back. Now, two new studies from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign help fill in the blanks for Miscanthus and switchgrass management.

“We have come a long way in our understanding of purpose-grown energy crops for SAF, but we still need to optimize agronomic management practices, like harvesting and nutrient management, to reduce production costs and incentivize growers,” said D.K. Lee, senior author of both studies and professor in the Department of Crop Sciences, part of the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences at U. of I.

Previous studies have been limited in spatial scale or focused on the first years after establishment, early in the perennial life cycle. But Lee’s group is working to provide more realistic, long-term solutions to maximize biomass productivity and grow a more sustainable fuel industry.

In the first of two recent studies, Lee’s team conducted an economic and environmental analysis of two harvest methods for switchgrass.

“Harvesting operations account for 60-80% of the total production costs for switchgrass,” said Muhammad Umer Arshad, postdoctoral researcher in Lee’s group and first author on the Bioresource Technology paper. “We wanted to understand why the harvesting cost is so high and how each operation contributes to cost, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as identify where reductions are possible.”

Arshad explains that switchgrass harvesting can happen via the stepwise method, in which tasks like mowing, raking, baling, and roadsiding are separated into individual operations; or the integrated method, which uses different equipment to consolidate mowing and raking into one pass. Hypothetically, an integrated approach could reduce effort, energy consumption, and costs. But, after analyzing data from 125 Virginia commercial-scale sites varying in field size and biomass yield, Arshad found a more nuanced answer.

“We found that the integrated method makes more sense for smaller fields (less than 3 hectares, or 10 acres) and low-yield (less than 3.2 tons per acre) conditions, reducing GHG emissions by 9% and energy use by 5%,” Arshad said. “The stepwise method was better for large fields with high biomass yield, reducing harvesting costs to $37.70 per ton and achieving the lowest GHG emissions.”

The costs were estimated assuming the farmers are using their own machinery, tractors, and harvesting equipment.

Lee adds that the results reveal the importance of tailoring harvesting strategies to site-specific conditions and provide the first evidence-based guidance that harvest methods can improve both economic and environmental outcomes.

In a separate study published in Biomass & Bioenergy, the team tackled age-related declines in Miscanthus biomass yield, a function of tiller (stem) mass and density. These long-lived perennial grasses follow a predictable growth trajectory, including a juvenile stage that builds over several years to reach peak biomass yield, followed by a slow decline after about 10 years. Until now, it wasn’t clear which components of yield change over time and how nutrient management might help.

Postdoctoral fellow Nictor Namoi analyzed data from a long-term Miscanthus trial with nitrogen fertilization treatments that varied in amount and timing. First, he looked at how tiller mass and density changed over time and with various nitrogen treatments. Then, he asked what other soil fertility factors may influence the decline in biomass yield in older stands.

“We found that both tiller mass and density increase from the first year of establishment to the fourth year, and if you apply nitrogen, you get an increase in both factors,” Namoi said. “But over time, as you withdraw nitrogen by harvesting biomass, the first component to be impacted is tiller mass. So tiller mass is very sensitive to nitrogen management.”

Namoi adds that tiller density continues to increase until individual stands become saturated, with no more space for further expansion. After that point, biomass yield is determined by tiller mass.

He notes that the decline in biomass yield over time may not be entirely tied to nitrogen. With every harvest, soil nutrients tied up in plant biomass are removed from the system, depleting elements that play a role in photosynthetic efficiency. When Namoi analyzed soil phosphorus and potassium in mature Miscanthus stands, he found significant deficits in both essential nutrients.

“Our findings identify tiller mass as a key determinant of biomass yield in aging Miscanthus and highlight the need for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium management for long-term productivity,” he said.

Both studies provide practical guidance to increase profitability, a key factor for any producer looking to explore biomass crops.

The first study, “Optimizing bioenergy biofuel harvest: a comparative analysis of stepwise and integrated methods for economic and environmental sustainability,” is published in Bioresource Technology [DOI: 10.1016/j.biortech.2025.133288].

Japan agreed to $8 billion in American agricultural purchases including corn, soybeans, ethanol, fertilizer, and sustainable aviation fuel.
At the same time, President Trump is securing new, unprecedented market access for American agricultural producers around the world.","(Washington, D.C., December 8, 2025) – President Donald J. Trump alongside U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (AR), Senator Deb Fischer (NE), Senator John Hoeven (ND), Representative Austin Scott (GA), and farmers from Arkansas, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas today announced the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will make $12 billion available in one time bridge payments to American farmers in response to temporary trade market disruptions and increased production costs that are still impacting farmers following four years of disastrous Biden Administration policies that resulted in record high input prices and zero new trade deals. These bridge payments are intended in part to aid farmers until historic investments from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), including reference prices which are set to increase between 10-21% for major covered commodities such as soybeans, corn, and wheat and will reach eligible farmers on October 1, 2026.

Of the $12 billion provided, up to $11 billion will be used for the Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) Program, which provides broad relief to United States row crop farmers who produce Barley, Chickpeas, Corn, Cotton, Lentils, Oats, Peanuts, Peas, Rice, Sorghum, Soybeans, Wheat, Canola, Crambe, Flax, Mustard, Rapeseed, Safflower, Sesame, and Sunflower. FBA will help address market disruptions, elevated input costs, persistent inflation, and market losses from foreign competitors engaging in unfair trade practices that impede exports. The FBA Program applies simple, proportional support to producers using a uniform formula to cover a portion of modeled losses during the 2025 crop year. This national loss average is based on FSA reported planted acres, Economic Research Service cost of production estimates, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates yields and prices and economic modeling.

Farmers who qualify for the FBA Program can expect payments to be released by February 28, 2026. Eligible farmers should ensure their 2025 acreage reporting is factual and accurate by 5pm ET on December 19, 2025. Commodity-specific payment rates will be released by the end of the month. Crop insurance linkage will not be required for the FBA Program; however, USDA strongly urges producers to take advantage of the new OBBBA risk management tools to best protect against price risk and volatility in the future.

The remaining $1 billion of the $12 billion in bridge payments will be reserved for commodities not covered in the FBA Program such as specialty crops and sugar, for example, though details including timelines for those payments are still under development and require additional understanding of market impacts and economic needs.

The $12 billion in farmer bridge payments, including those provided through the FBA Program, are authorized under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act and will be administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA).

To submit questions, justification for USDA farmer bridge aid, or to request a meeting on farmer bridge aid, producers can reach out to farmerbridge@usda.gov.

“Four years under the failed Biden Administration continues to leave the American farm economy reeling from record inflation, a depleted farm safety net, and delayed disaster assistance. The lack of new trade deals under the last Administration turned a trade surplus under Trump into a $50 billion trade deficit, causing our farmers to lose markets and feel acute pain from lower commodity prices. President Trump will not let our farmers be left behind, so he directed our team to build a bridge program to see quick relief while the President’s dozens of new trade deals and new market access take effect,” said Secretary Brooke Rollins. “The plan we are announcing today ensures American farmers can continue to plan for the next crop year. It is imperative we do what it takes to help our farmers, because if we cannot feed ourselves, we will no longer have a country. With this program serving as a bridge to the improvements President Trump and Republicans in Congress have made, it will allow farmers to leverage strengthened price protection risk management tools and the reliability of fair trade deals so they do not have to depend on large ad hoc assistance packages from the government.”

Additional Farmer First Actions Taken by the Trump Administration

In addition to $12 billion in bridge payments announced today, the Trump Administration has been working around the clock since January 20th to put American farmers first after inheriting one of the worst farm economies the country has experienced in decades. The following actions have been taken to date and together show historic investments and bold and unrelenting dedication to helping our nation’s farmers thrive again.

Over $30 Billion in Ad Hoc Assistance Delivered to Farmers Since January 2025

Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP) is helping farmers recover from the economic hardships of 2024. This program distributed more than $9.3 billion to over 560,000 farmers for soy, corn, sorghum, and other row crops.

Marketing Assistance for Specialty Crops (MASC) is helping specialty crop producers recover from rising input costs and other market disruptions stemming from the Biden Administration. This program distributed over 1.8 billion in assistance to over 52,000 producers.

The Supplemental Disaster Relief Program (SDRP) is helping producers recover from severe weather events in 2023 and 2024. This program has distributed nearly $6 billion to over 388,000 farmers with up to an additional $9 billion to be distributed over the next four months.

Over $2.5 billion via block grants delivered to states and sugar beet and cane processors via block grants to cover losses from 2023 and 2024 that were left uncovered by existing USDA programs.

Trump Supported OBBBA Farmer Wins

With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill in July, President Trump has made crop insurance more workable and affordable for American farmers and ranchers. Crop insurance is an essential risk management tool that allows American farmers and ranchers endure weather and market volatility. The bill increases crop insurance premium support for beginning farmers and ranchers by expanding the definition from five to 10 years of experience, enabling more producers to qualify for assistance over a longer period. These improvements will result in over $400 million in savings every year for America’s farmers on insurance premiums.

For the first time in over a decade the statutory reference prices for the farm safety net programs, ARC and PLC, were raised by 10-21% for major commodities such as corn, soybeans, and wheat. Thanks to OBBBA USDA is also expanding eligibility for these price support programs by adding more than 30 million new base acres to the program making them eligible for future PLC or ARC payments starting in crop year 2026.

OBBBA extended the marketing assistance loan programs through 2031 and updated loan rates for major commodities beginning in the 2026 crop year, providing stronger loan rates for crops like wheat, corn, cotton and soybeans.

The bill included historic investments to the domestic sugar programs and USDA made them available starting October 1, 2025. The loan rate for raw cane sugar has increased to an average 24 cents per pound for the 2025 - 2031 crop years, with refined beet sugar rates increased to an average of 32.77 cents per pound.

OBBBA invested in USDA’s major conservation programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). These funds will result in over $34B in conservation work on agricultural land over the next 10 years.

OBBBA provides $285 million a year for agricultural trade promotion and facilitation. This is in addition to the existing $234M per year of funding for MAP and FMD. These dollars are key to opening and expanding foreign markets.

OBBBA included many important tax provisions for farmers and ranchers. Some of the most impactful provisions for agriculture are the permanency of the 20% qualified business income deduction, full bonus depreciation and the $15 million per individual estate tax exemption, now also indexed for inflation. With the current land values, equipment costs and input prices, even modest-sized farms can easily exceed that threshold, meaning upon the owner’s death, far more family operations would face massive tax bills than previously estimated. A permanent bonus depreciation means that farmers can continue to write off the entire cost of new equipment, land improvements, new barns and other capital upgrades in the year of purchase, rather than depreciating them over many years.

Oversight on Competition & Farmer Input Costs

On September 26, 2025, the USDA and the Department of Justice signed a Memorandum of Understanding (PDF, 1.3 MB) that represents a joint commitment by both agencies to protect American farmers and ranchers from the burdens imposed by high and volatile input costs—such as feed, fertilizer, fuel, seed, equipment, and other essential goods—while ensuring competitive supply chains, lower consumer prices, and the resilience of U.S. agriculture and the food supply.

On December 6, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order to stop price fixing, anti-competitive behavior, and foreign influence that drives up prices and threatens the security of America’s food supply. This EO recognizes that sectors including seed, fertilizer, and farm equipment may be vulnerable to anti-competitive manipulation that result in higher prices for farmers and seeks to take aggressive action in part by the establishment of Task Forces created to investigate price fixing and anti-competitive behavior, especially regarding foreign owned entities.

These actions combined reiterate the Trump Administration’s commitment to scrutinizing competitive conditions in the agricultural marketplace, including antitrust enforcement that promotes free market competition.

Lowering Farm Labor Costs through Deregulatory Actions

Farm labor costs alone increased 47% since 2020 largely due to the high cost of utilizing the H-2A program to secure seasonal labor under the Biden Administration who artificially inflated Adverse Effect Wage Rates set by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) using USDA’s Farm Labor Survey which was never designed to be used for setting government-mandated wage rates and is duplicative of other DOL data sources. As such, USDA discontinued this survey while DOL issued a bold new interim final rule which decreased wage costs for H-2A agricultural employers resulting in initial savings of at least $2 billion. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a final rule, effective October 2, 2025, to streamline the filing process for certain temporary agricultural worker petitions. These actions combined are making farm labor more affordable and more accessible for American agriculture.

USDA is Prioritizing the Purchase of Healthy U.S. Grown Commodities to Feed Those Most in Need through Section 32 Buys

This year alone, USDA has provided nearly $1 billion in Section 32 purchases, all which benefit the charitable feeding network.

On November 24, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced a $30 million Section 32 buy of American grown oranges, grapefruit, and mandarins.

On August 6, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced a $2 million Section 32 buy of invasive Chesapeake Bay blue catfish.

On August 1, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced up to $230 million Section 32 buy of Alaska pollock, catfish, apples, beans and cranberries.

On May 23, 2025, Secretary Rollins announced a $67 million Section 32 buy of American groundfish, pears, cherries, shrimp and beans.

USDA will continue to buy Section 32 commodity purchases to support American seafood, fruit, vegetable, and tree-nut producers for distribution to U.S. food banks, schools, and other outlets serving low-income individuals. These actions support President Trump’s vision to Make America Healthy Again through U.S. local farmer grown, healthy, and nutritious commodities.

This is the most pro-biofuels Administration in history

President Trump recognizes how important the Renewable Fuel Standard is for American corn and soybean farmers. EPA Administrator Zeldin delivered the boldest Renewable Volume Obligations ever and provided much certainty in the market for our producers while delivering lower prices at the pump for consumers. The RVO gives the markets the incentive to invest in American products for American consumers and to export around the world.

EPA’s decision to allow the summer sale of E-15 constituted 2025 year-round E15 and continues to deliver immediate relief to consumers, give more choices at the pump, and drive demand for corn grown, processed, and used right here in America. America’s national security depends on our energy security, and biofuels are a crucial asset that brings more jobs and helps farmers in rural America.

List of Trade & Market Access Wins to Date

USDA announced applications are now open through January 23, 2026, for the $285 million America First Trade Promotion Program (AFTPP), a key component of the Trump Administration’s work to expand global market access and create new export opportunities for America’s farmers, ranchers, and producers.

Additionally, President Trump and his administration have worked to pen new trade deals and trade frameworks with more than 15 countries.

Switzerland and Liechtenstein will invest at least $200 billion in the United States, remove tariffs on several agricultural products, allow for market access for American beef, bison, and poultry, and remove non-tariff barriers for poultry and dairy.

El Salvador has removed non-tariff barriers including fumigation requirements and arbitrary geographic indicator restrictions on dairy product names.

Argentina will allow access for U.S. poultry and poultry products, within one year, and simplify red tape for U.S. exporters of beef, beef products, pork, and pork products. Argentina also has agreed to protect U.S. exporters’ use of certain meat and cheese terms, preserving market access and creating the potential for new opportunities in the region.

Ecuador has reduced or eliminated tariffs on American nuts, wheat, and wine; and will reduce major non-tariff barriers for many agricultural products regarding import licensing and facility registration requirements.

Guatemala will address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in its market; maintain science- and risk-based regulatory frameworks; and efficient authorization processes for agricultural products.

China committed to delaying new export controls on rare earth minerals, resume large purchases of U.S. soybeans, sorghum, and more. To date, China is already purchasing additional soybeans, wheat, and sorghum.

Malaysia will provide significant market access for U.S. products like dairy, horticultural products, poultry, pork, rice, and ethanol; recognize the U.S. food safety systems for U.S. meat, poultry, and dairy products; streamline its halal certification of U.S. food and agricultural products; and open market access for U.S. sorghum.

Cambodia will eliminate 100% of its tariffs on U.S. products, while the U.S. maintains a 19% reciprocal tariff rate for imports from Cambodia. It will also recognize the U.S. scientific guidelines for most U.S. agricultural goods and food.

Thailand will eliminate tariffs on 99% of U.S. goods, including most food and agricultural products and expedite access for USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service-certified meat and poultry products, giving American producers unprecedented access to the market.

Vietnam will accept preferential access for U.S. agricultural goods, including specialty cheese and meats, and is already improving access for U.S. peaches and nectarines. Vietnam will pay the United States 20% tariffs on all goods and 40% on any transshipped goods

South Korea will pay 15 percent tariff to the United States.

European Union will purchase $750 billion of American energy and addressing non-tariff barriers for farmers and ranchers - pork and dairy products. Market access for U.S. agricultural goods like tree nuts, sorghum, and more will also be provided as we work to commit to a simpler regulatory agenda.

Philippines is opening their market to the United States and charging us zero tariffs while the Philippines will pay 19 percent tariffs to the United States.

Indonesia will eliminate 90 percent of tariffs on American exports including for all agricultural products.

Japan agreed to $8 billion in American agricultural purchases including corn, soybeans, ethanol, fertilizer, and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan will increase US rice imports by 75%.

United Kingdom will create $5 billion in new agricultural export opportunities. $700 million in ethanol and better market access for American beef.

At the same time, President Trump is securing new, unprecedented market access for American agricultural producers around the world. For example, wine exports to Mexico are up 30 percent in 2025, reaching $18 million; South Korea has purchased $1 billion in corn, more than double from 2024; Bangladesh purchased $172 million in soybeans; Costa Rica streamlined its dairy access for U.S. producers; and India cut its bourbon tariff in half.

Renewable or low-carbon fuels are alternatives to fossil fuels and are often made from agricultural feedstock, such as canola oil, or waste products.

They are used in industries that cannot be easily electrified, such as heavy transport or aviation.

The United States, Brazil and the European Union are the largest low-carbon fuel producers globally.

Liquid gold

Australia exported nearly 6 million tonnes of canola from 2023–2024 to be turned into biofuel overseas.

Now industry is advocating to create a domestic market for Australia to create and use its own biofuel.

""It will be a big boost for farmers, to be sure,"" Mr Hosking said.

""We produce an incredibly high-quality product … using very low emissions in our cropping systems.""

Industry body GrainCorp's head of agri-energy Jesse Scott said a local industry would lead to more investment in regional Australia and would service domestic demand.

GrainCorp is working with Ampol and super fund IFM Investors to refine canola oil in Australia for use in the aviation industry.

""I fully expect that all parts of Australia are going to contribute feedstock,"" Mr Scott said, adding that Victoria would play a major role.

Waste not

In Victoria's east, a feasibility study is underway at the Australian Paper Mill, near Morwell, to investigate the viability of producing a new biofuel.

The paper mill's owner, Opal, has partnered with renewables developer European Energy Australia to assess the feasibility of carbon capture at the mill to capture biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2).

Biogenic CO2 is carbon dioxide produced from natural sources, and is already produced at the Maryvale facility as a by-product of pulping from one of its boilers.

When combined with renewable energy and water, biogenic CO2 can be used in the production of e-methanol, a low-carbon fuel and alternative to fossil fuels that can be used in freight ships.

European Energy has already used this technology in Denmark to supply e-methanol to international shipping companies.

Opal's general manager of environment and sustainability, David Jettner, said it was still early days but the project had the potential to generate between $25 million and $30 million.

Should it prove to be successful, the project could deliver a significant injection into the local economy — a substantial turnaround for the company, which axed 400 jobs in 2023.

Trash into treasure

The study is not the first biofuel project being explored in the Gippsland region.

An upcycling facility planned for the Wellington Shire that will recycle household waste into hydrogen and low-carbon fuels has been given the green light.

The project, being run by Zerogen, Boson Energy and Xseed Solutions, aims to extract hydrogen for aviation fuel by gasifying household waste.

Zerogen director Scott McArdle said the project would help to reduce waste while developing a low-carbon fuel that could be used in transport, particularly in aviation.

""We are targeting those municipal waste, kerbside garbage, non-recyclables,"" Mr McArdle said.

""Being able to reduce the existing pressures on our landfill infrastructure, we get to extend the life of those facilities and create new industries around it.""

Director of XSeed Solutions Craig Allen said the partners were working to secure funding, but the aim was to be operational by 2028.

""Our Gippsland project continues to progress well,"" he said.

""We're working closely with our partners as they finalise the initial funding round, which is expected to reach completion within the next couple of months.""

Need for a fuel injection

As part of its Future Made in Australia plan, the federal government is fast-tracking support for a low-carbon liquid fuel (LCLF) industry, recently announcing a $1 billion fund to encourage private investors to develop the market.

The government says the domestic LCLF industry will initially focus on sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel to reduce emissions in fuel-reliant sectors, including transport, mining and agriculture.

By 2040, an Australian renewable fuels industry could directly support 13,000 jobs and contribute $13 billion in GDP annually.

While the grants process has been welcomed by industry, proponents say more needs to be done to get it off the ground.

Mr Hosking said Australia would do well to follow the lead of the United Kingdom and European Union and mandate the use of LCLF, to guarantee a market for investors.

""We are talking billions of dollars to build a low-carbon liquid fuel plant, so it's not a small investment for anyone,"" he said.

""What we need is government to send a signal that there will be a guaranteed market for that product at the end.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/27eebb5b5c6afd5c799a42e20e0e3e6e?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1578&cropW=2805&xPos=0&yPos=344&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-12-08 16:57:01.902828

Officials will determine the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy slightly differently for cargo shipments, and for general and business flights.","The Singaporean government will begin taxing the airfare of travelers departing from the country to compensate for the use of eco-friendly fuel.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) shared about the new tax in a November 2025 press release. Known as the “Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy,” the tax will apply to most flights departing from Singapore. These include passenger planes, cargo shipments, and “general and business aviation flights,” according to the government.

For most passengers, that levy won’t put too much of an added expense to their departure from Singapore. Depending on their cabin and flight destination, the additional fee will range from S$1 to S$41.60. That’s up to around $32 on the levy’s higher end. Travelers will see the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy as a distinct fee listed when booking with airlines, as part of their airfare. Notably, the Singaporean government will not tax travelers passing through the country on their way to their ultimate destination.

CAAS detailed that the levy money collected will solely be used to purchase “SAF and/or SAF environmental attributes (EAs)3.” It will also go toward covering “associated administrative costs.” Implementing the tax is Singapore’s way of hitting its goals for more sustainable air travel, with target dates in 2026 and 2030. With the rollout of the “SAF Levy,” Singapore will be the first country in the world to explicitly tax its flyers for the usage of the eco-friendly fuel.

What Else Is There To Know About Singapore’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy?

Flyers will begin seeing the tax on their airfare for tickets sold from April 1, 2026, applying to flights departing on or after October 1, 2026. How much tax will be tacked on depends on the length of a passenger’s flight and how much SAF the plane will need to fly, with aircraft required to use at least 1% of the more eco-friendly fuel. The Singaporean government notes that the levy is also determined by “the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel, and other associated costs, including the cost of certification, blending, and delivery.”

In addition to where they’ll be flying from Singapore, passengers will also be taxed based on their cabin class. Those flying economy will be taxed less than those flying in a premium cabin. Those in the latter section of the plane will pay four times as much for the levy.

Officials will determine the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy slightly differently for cargo shipments, and for general and business flights. Flights exempt from paying the tax include those made for “charitable or humanitarian purposes.”

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) provides insight on what sustainable aviation fuels are. It defines the energy as “renewable or waste-derived aviation fuels that meet sustainability criteria.” The source further asserted that “SAF has the greatest potential to reduce CO2 emissions from international aviation.”

“The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub,” said CAAS Director-General Mr. Han Kok. “It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses, and the public time to adjust.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZV9mP9XaSwLKrQsC.xFzaw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/travel_noire_articles_954/43efcb6105b6cc970a11ce4c3e0c2fbb,N,,2025-12-08 15:58:26.869298

Riyadh, December 08, 2025 –

Saudia, the national flag carrier of Saudi Arabia, begun operating domestic flights using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) uplifted from Red Sea International Airport in September 2025, conducted in partnership with Red Sea Global.

This milestone underscores Saudia’s ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. It also aligns with the General Authority of Civil Aviation’s Comprehensive Environmental Sustainability Program (CAESP), which aims to reduce the aviation sector’s environmental impact.

Maryam Telmesani, Vice President of Sustainability at Saudia Group, said: “This milestone reflects how Saudia is translating its sustainability vision into concrete results. By turning national ambitions into implementation and collaborating with key partners such as Red Sea Global, we are driving meaningful progress across the Kingdom’s sustainability efforts.”

She added: “Our actions contribute directly to both the Kingdom’s domestic and global efforts to support sustainability and the environment, reinforcing Saudia’s role as a leader in advancing efforts for a more sustainable future for aviation.”

Produced through innovative processes that significantly reduce lifecycle emissions, The operation of SAF-powered flights represents a tangible step within Saudia’s broader contribution to the Kingdom’s sustainability efforts. Saudia Group is expanding its efforts by exploring other alternative fuel technologies, including Low Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF) and Emerging/Synthetic Aviation Fuels (eSAF), as part of the Kingdom’s efforts to manage GHGs, and use all available approaches and pathways to diversify energy sources to support sustainable development. These efforts contribute to the Kingdom’s broader transport sustainability targets, in line with its strategy to reduce carbon emissions.

Raed Albasseet, Group Chief Sustainability and Environment Officer at RSG, said: “We are proud to have been the first to introduce SAF into the Kingdom earlier this year, a milestone that reflects our commitment to reducing our emissions. Saudia was the first airline to operate flights to Red Sea International Airport, and it’s fitting that they are now the first to utilize our sustainable fuel supply.”

He added: “We are committed to utilizing all clean energy technologies, including renewable energy and advanced water reuse to low-carbon emission mobility, we’re setting a new benchmark for responsible, regenerative travel.”

As the Kingdom accelerates its transformation, milestones such as the introduction of sustainable aviation fuels highlight how collective national efforts are reshaping the future of air travel.

Today, challenges move faster, cross more boundaries and demand more interdisciplinary thinking than ever before.

In my work at ICF, a global consulting and technology services company, I see this every day. Our teams are on the front lines of some of the toughest challenges facing our generation.

We help communities detect disease outbreaks earlier by using advanced data analytics and improving communications across federal, state and local public health leaders. We supported the first transatlantic flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel — overcoming one of the hardest barriers to decarbonizing the transportation industry. And we’re using AI-driven digital twins to help utilities navigate rising electricity demand from data centers, while strengthening grid reliability and keeping energy more affordable for vulnerable communities.

None of this work is simple. It requires people who can move between disciplines, ask hard questions and stay grounded in the data.

That mindset starts forming long before someone enters the workforce. The engineers who will tackle tomorrow’s challenges are in classrooms and labs right now, learning how to think, how to collaborate and how to approach uncertainty with curiosity rather than fear. That foundation matters. I know because UC Davis gave me mine.

How UC Davis Shaped the Way I Think

My career was shaped in profound ways by UC Davis. The faculty in the Department of Chemical Engineering were committed to teaching us to think, not just to memorize. My professors insisted we understand the underlying math and physics. They pushed us to break down problems instead of jumping to answers. And they expected a level of precision that, at the time, felt demanding but has served me well.

Just as meaningful were the hands-on experiences that brought engineering to life. Long days in the lab made the equations real. An internship with IBM taught me what I did and didn’t want to do with my degree. Studying abroad in England opened up an entirely new world. Those experiences helped me understand how theory meets reality, and they broadened my perspective.

They prepared me for graduate school at MIT and, ultimately, for a career at ICF that has spanned nearly four decades working at the crossroads of engineering, science, policy and technology. They also grounded me in a particular mindset: Solve the problem in front of you using data, technical rigor and collaboration. That approach has carried me through my entire career, and why I think it is important to give back.

How Small Steps Grew into 20 Years of Momentum

My first gifts to UC Davis were small — contributions to an undergraduate scholarship fund. I wasn’t thinking about “philanthropy.” I was simply grateful for what I had received and wanted the next group of students to have something similar.

Years later, the college reached out with a proposal to support scholarships, upgrade aging lab equipment and help develop a new course called “Design of Coffee.” I loved the idea of making engineering accessible and fun without sacrificing precision. I agreed to support the plan and added a scholarship for a student to study abroad each year, because having that opportunity changed my own path.

Over time, my involvement expanded. I’ve served on the College of Engineering Dean’s Executive Committee for more than a decade, including several years as chair, and now chair the Manetti Shrem Museum Advisory Board. That combination may seem unexpected, but UC Davis has always brought together the analytical and creative, and the more I’ve learned about the university’s remarkable role in California’s art history, the more compelled I’ve felt to support it alongside engineering.

The reward for staying close has been seeing the impact firsthand: meeting students, watching new research and design spaces take shape, seeing labs modernized and hearing from scholarship recipients whose paths were changed because someone invested in them.

At the same time, the needs have grown. Enrollment is rising. State support is down. The demand for modern facilities and interdisciplinary learning environments continues to increase.

With these challenges, it’s important to give back. It’s important to invest in the next generation of changemakers.

Showing Up for the Next Generation

Engineers have always been problem solvers, but the problems ahead — AI ethics, climate resilience, sustainable energy, public health, global-scale digital modernization — require a different level of preparation. Students will need strong fundamentals, yes, but also experience working on messy, multidisciplinary challenges. UC Davis is well-positioned to give them that mix.

Philanthropy helps make that possible. Not just big gifts, but all forms: mentoring, advising, opening doors to internships, volunteering time, sharing hard-earned lessons and giving financially when you can. The three “W’s” as I call them — work, wisdom and wealth — are all essential when it comes to giving back. It’s a collective effort focused on continuity, helping ensure students have access to the kinds of transformative, hands-on experiences that shaped me, and that remain essential for the world they’re stepping into and the problems they’ll help solve.

I’ve spent my career working on complex issues. But nothing has been more meaningful than supporting the UC Davis students who will take on the challenges we can’t yet see. The future will be demanding, but it’s full of promise. And every step we take to support today’s students brings us closer to the breakthroughs our world needs.",https://engineering.ucdavis.edu/sites/g/files/dgvnsk2151/files/styles/sf_landscape_16x9/public/media/images/Wasson.png?h=d1cb525d&itok=YANbxV6z,N,,2025-12-08 18:57:05.542047

Topsoe has contributed with technical input to the paper and recommendations on alternative fuel readiness.

Fuel security in Europe is at a crossroads

Over 60% of Europe’s energy is imported, leaving defense operations exposed to external disruptions and market volatility.

Europe is also facing a significant jet fuel deficit. 750,000 barrels per day were imported in July 2025, covering 88% of Europe's average daily demand. Just a few years ago, from 2017 to 2023, imports only accounted for 30% of the region's needs.

This necessitates a reassessment of military fuel readiness.​ Continued reliance on crude oil imports to produce kerosene in European refineries represents an increasing risk due to geopolitical tensions and potential disruptions of the fuel supply chains, not least in wartime.

NBAA is targeting net-zero emissions from business aviation operations by 2050—a goal shared by many U.S. and international organizations.
Derner told FLYING that the Washington coalition may be the first of many.","Aviation industry groups are uniting to fight legislation in Washington state that they argue is based on a “grossly uninformed understanding” of high-value aircraft.

That was the language used by the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), National Air Transportation Association (NATA), General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), Vertical Aviation International (VAI), Corporate Angel Network (CAN), and Angel Flight West in an April letter to Washington Governor Bob Ferguson.

Earlier this year, Ferguson signed off on a provision that will levy a 10 percent tax on the sale, lease, or transfer of noncommercial aircraft valued at over $500,000—as well as users of those aircraft. Proceeds will be deposited into the state’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Account.

On Monday, NBAA announced it formed a coalition with the explicit goal of opposing the tax, which it described as “burdensome” despite the admirable goal of sustainability. Phil Derner, NBAA’s Western region representative, told FLYING the coalition comprises all of the aforementioned groups as well as chambers of commerce and smaller members, including the organization’s entire Washington state mailing list.

NBAA said the legislation has raised “significant concerns for business aviation,” which per Derner has caused some operators to reconsider renewing their leases in the state. He said that while business operators are “at the forefront” of the issue, the luxury tax would affect “nearly every corner of general aviation.”

Per NBAA, the coalition is working to open lines of communication with “key partners,” including the bill’s sponsor. Recently, it said, about 100 stakeholders met at Seattle Paine Field International Airport (KPAE) to discuss their needs and hear from Washington State Representative Tom Dent—a “strong industry advocate” and leader of the state’s aviation caucus.

“Sustainability is a driving force for NBAA and the broader aviation industry, as evidenced in our 2050 net-zero emission target and advocacy for sustainable aviation fuel,” Derner said in a statement. “This coalition is intent on communicating that commitment, while also dispelling misconceptions and highlighting aviation’s positive contributions to environmental progress. We are here to build a constructive relationship that incentivizes and empowers our industry to be a better participant in sustainability and a better neighbor in communities throughout the state, not just in the big cities.”

Case For (and Against) a Luxury Aircraft Tax

Washington state’s 10 percent tax on luxury noncommercial aircraft is set to take effect in April, impacting aircraft plus trade-in property valued over $500,000. For leased aircraft, fair market value at the start of the lease must be greater than $500,000.

Tax will be collected only on the “portion of the selling price in excess of $500,000,” the bill reads. In other words, the buyer of a $600,000 aircraft would be taxed $10,000 because they surpassed that threshold by $100,000. However, Derner said some in the industry have interpreted the language to mean the tax would be $60,000, or 10 percent of the full $600,000 price.

The idea behind the legislation is to generate fresh funding for transportation sustainability projects. But NBAA and other groups in their letter warned it could have “sweeping, unintended consequences” for the state’s economy.

Stakeholders argued that costly, noncommercial aircraft are not just luxury items. CAN and Angel Flight West, for example, operate networks of volunteer pilots that fly to underserved rural areas.

Other organizations, including the Washington State Department of Natural Resources’ aviation division, use expensive helicopters—like the Bell UH-1H(M) Huey—to battle blazes from above or evacuate victims. Agricultural operators often fly costly aircraft for crop dusting and environmental monitoring.

All of these stakeholders, the groups said, would be negatively impacted by the higher tax.

Business and recreational flyers will feel the difference, too, as will airports, which could see fewer operations. According to the groups, operations that would be affected by the tax support 407,000 airport jobs and generate $8.6 billion in economic output. In addition, 107 repair stations, 22 flight schools, 4,400 instructors and nearly 8,000 students would be “adversely affected,” they said.

NBAA said the legislation passed with “limited industry input,” prompting the formation of a coalition to extol the industry’s commitments to sustainability.

NBAA is targeting net-zero emissions from business aviation operations by 2050—a goal shared by many U.S. and international organizations. In 2019, it created an Emerging Technologies Committee to advocate for industry-friendly rules for new, environmentally friendly entrants—drones, electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxis, supersonic jets, and others.

eVTOL aircraft, in particular, will have a “profound impact” on the industry’s future, NBAA wrote in a 2019 report titled “Business Aviation Embraces Electric Flight.”

At the group’s 2025 Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) in October, attendees could purchase helicopter flights from Blade Air Mobility, whose passenger division was acquired by eVTOL developer Joby Aviation in August. While those trips weren’t electric, passengers had the chance to speak with Joby representatives about the company’s plans to integrate air taxis on the Blade platform. That combination—as well as a planned integration with Uber —could happen in the next few years.

“By resetting the business aviation community’s relationship, we intend to keep legislators and the public better informed on our industry’s commitment to Washington state, its economy and its environment,” Derner said of the new coalition.

Derner told FLYING that the Washington coalition may be the first of many.

To initiate this engagement, in collaboration with leading management consultants Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Roland Berger and Estuaire, RMI has led a series of corporate contrail accounting and reporting pilots to develop and compare methodologies for measuring contrail impacts associated with business air travel.

Three proposed methodologies for contrail accounting with different levels of complexity and accuracy were assessed:

Baseline Approach: Standard Multiplier — The baseline approach uses a single, static 1.7x multiplier on the CO2 impact, to account for the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation, including contrails.

Differentiated Default Approach: Tiered Multiplier — A tiered multiplier offers a more nuanced method by sorting flights into low, medium, and high-impact categories based on key flight characteristics such as time of departure, season, region, etc.

Bottom-Up Approach: Flight Specific Modeling — The most granular and accurate method is the bottom-up approach, which models the specific climate impact of each individual flight. This technique uses detailed operational data to calculate climate impact.

These studies found that flight-by-flight, bottom-up accounting can significantly improve the accuracy of measured contrail and other non-CO2 effects as well as CO2 impact compared with current standard methods. Results revealed lower contrails and other non-CO2 effects averaging a 1.3x impact compared to the baseline 1.7x multiplier as well as lower CO2 emissions compared to standard emissions accounting practices. The pilot analysis also revealed 2% of flight bookings account for 80% of total contrail impact.

As a result of these findings, applying a uniform multiplier to all flight bookings may misrepresent the true climate impact of reporting companies.

Additionally, the results indicate the opportunity to significantly reduce corporate travel emissions by identifying key flight characteristics attributable to high warming impacts. Companies could use their air travel and transport data to make more informed decisions that help minimize travel on routes with higher contrail-formation potential, providing an additional lever to reduce climate impact.

Acting now to explore and pilot refined emissions accounting and reporting approaches can further support collective efforts to reduce the climate impact of contrails and unlock both environmental and economic benefits through lower aviation emissions.

Contrail management is a significant opportunity to tackle aviation’s full climate impact. According to ICCT’s September 2025 Aviation Vision 2050 outlook report, contrail avoidance is estimated to represent more than 40% of total avoidable warming from aviation by 2050. While critical decarbonization efforts such as increasing the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and improving operational efficiency must continue to be pursued, it is clear that the climate-warming impact of contrails demands action.

Increased research attention in recent years has enhanced understanding of contrails as a potent aviation non-CO2 effect , and the development and testing of technologies to predict and avoid contrail formation continue to advance. These contrail management activities have strongly improved the aviation industry’s opportunity to reduce contrail warming. However, contrail science and management is still nascent and requires continued collaboration across key groups, including corporates, airlines, standard setters, regulators, and other aviation and emissions accounting and reporting value chain stakeholders. Increased engagement across these stakeholders can help create the right data flows and incentives to more accurately measure and mitigate contrail warming impacts.

In tandem with continuing climate impact research and solutions development advancements, initiating demand-side aviation customer engagement today on the topic of contrail management can help raise awareness of contrail impact and advance exploration of comprehensive air travel climate impact accounting frameworks.

To initiate this engagement, RMI led a series of corporate aviation emissions accounting pilots, in collaboration with leading management consultancies BCG and Roland Berger, as well as flight analytics platform provider Estuaire. These studies found that flight-by-flight, bottom-up accounting can significantly improve the accuracy of measured contrail and other non-CO2 effects, as well as CO2 impact, compared with current standard methods. Current contrail and non-CO₂ accounting processes, while precise (as they are based on a fixed multiplier), are not necessarily accurate, as they lack the specificity derived from additional bottom-up data. Beyond refining report quality, the pilot results revealed data granularity can uncover opportunities to reduce air transport climate impacts.

Today, companies are likely to inaccurately report contrail climate impacts by applying broad, static multipliers to their CO2 emissions. Applying the flight-specific bottom-up approach, results revealed lower contrails and other non-CO2 effects averaging a 1.32x impact compared to the baseline 1.7x multiplier as well as lower CO2 emissions compared to standard emissions accounting practices. The pilot analysis revealed 2.14% of flight bookings account for 80% of total contrail impact. As a result, applying a uniform multiplier to all flight bookings would misrepresent their true climate impact. Additionally, the results indicate the opportunity to significantly reduce corporate travel emissions by identifying key flight characteristics attributable to high warming impacts. Companies could use their air travel and transport data to make more informed decisions that help minimize travel on routes with higher contrail-formation potential, providing an additional lever to reduce climate impact.

With data-driven and consistent contrail accounting and reporting methodologies in place, corporate customers of aviation have the opportunity to measure and disclose both the CO2 and non-CO2 climate impact of business air travel more accurately than reported under current processes. This could help enable companies to explore internal travel policy adjustments based on improved reporting processes that may limit contrail impacts associated with future business air travel. Additionally, with more granular data, companies can better ensure that climate impact compensation strategies reflect the emissions they actually generate. Refined emissions accounting approaches enable companies to align reported impacts more closely with actual flight-level conditions, improving accuracy and strengthening consistency with compensation mechanisms such as carbon credit purchases.

Strengthening corporate emissions accounting and reporting practices for contrail impacts can help air transport customers, such as corporate travelers and freight shippers, better understand aviation’s full climate impact. By piloting and applying refined emissions accounting methods, these customers can begin to account and report contrail impacts more accurately, while identifying practical actions to reduce them.

By engaging constructively with data providers, airlines, standard setters, and other aviation and emissions accounting value chain stakeholders, corporate customers can help shape emerging contrail management practices and contribute to more comprehensive aviation climate accountability. Acting now to explore and pilot refined emissions accounting and reporting approaches can further support collective efforts to reduce the climate impact of contrails and unlock both environmental and economic benefits through lower aviation emissions.

Additional contrail science and management research is needed to understand the scale of contrails’ climate impact and the feasibility of levers available to mitigate it. In the absence of certainty, best practice to date has been to apply a multiplier of 1.7x to CO2 emissions to account for non-CO2 impacts, including contrails. This multiplier was identified based on the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) analysis of the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation released in 2020. Although establishing this initial multiplier has been a positive step in the right direction, its application is far too broad considering the remaining uncertainty bands associated with contrail impact – despite tightening consensus among research conducted over the last five years — as well as significant climate impact variability from flight to flight based on factors such as region of travel, season, flight time of day, actual weather conditions at the time of flight, and aircraft performance characteristics. By using a singular multiplier in this way, companies may be significantly under- or over-reporting their emissions attributable to contrails. Moreover, using a flat multiplier does not provide any incentive to make more informed, sustainable flight choices with a lower likelihood of contrail warming.

Additionally, differences in emissions calculation methodologies set by regulatory agencies can make it difficult to compare emissions reported from one company to another. Depending on the emissions factor agency source, two or more companies, for example, may report significantly different results even if they theoretically were to have traveled on the exact same flights for the year.

Furthermore, even within the same regulatory agencies, emissions factors can change from year to year and are subject to global economic activity. This can make it difficult for companies to contextualize emissions from one year to the next. For example, UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) 2025 GHG emissions factors for business air travel were adjusted downward between 16% to 42% depending on seating class from 2024 emissions factors. Emissions factors used in 2023 and 2024 were still based on 2021 data, a year that was impacted by the COVID pandemic resulting in lower air travel demand. This inflated annual per passenger emissions factors for 2023 and 2024 reporting years, which saw air travel demand normalize during the post pandemic recovery. In this case, CO2 emissions (and non-CO2 emissions) were likely over reported in general during this period. Therefore, emissions factor update delays such as this can significantly impact the ability of companies to accurately report emissions and achieve their climate targets.

In collaboration with leading management consultancies BCG and Roland Berger and flight analytics platform provider Estuaire, RMI has led a series of corporate contrail accounting and reporting pilots to develop and compare methodologies for measuring contrail impacts associated with business air travel. Three proposed methodologies for contrail accounting with different levels of complexity and accuracy were assessed.

Baseline Approach: Standard Multiplier

The baseline approach uses a single, static multiplier to account for the non-CO2 climate impacts of aviation, including contrails. This method is straightforward, applying a universal multiplier value of 1.7x to a flight’s CO2 emissions and requiring no additional flight-level data for calculation. While this method is simple to implement for quick estimates, it fails to account for key factors that influence contrail formation, such as weather conditions, flight trajectory, aircraft characteristics, time of day, season, and region. As a result, in addition to having limited ability to accurately account for contrails as previously discussed, this approach fails to incentivize better operational practices. Without understanding and improved visibility of contributing contrail impact variables, businesses are limited in their ability to explore meaningful opportunities to reduce their Scope 3 emissions.

Differentiated Default Approach: Tiered Multiplier

A tiered multiplier offers a more nuanced method by sorting flights into low, medium, and high-impact categories based on key factors mentioned above. For example, known factors such as time of departure, season, region, etc. could apply contrail risk scores that are summed and then allocated into impact categories based on standard scoring thresholds. Average multipliers per category could then be applied per flight. This method encourages better business air travel policy opportunities when compared to the baseline approach. By grouping general flight characteristics and knowing the emissions multiplier to apply to the flight in advance of travel, companies may be able to manage emissions more effectively.

However, as an approximation of the potential contrail impact, this approach remains limited to inform accurate decision-making: flights with significantly different contrail risk may still fall into the same category, limiting the ability to target high-impact routes. This weakens both the accuracy of Scope 3 reporting and the effectiveness of corporate travel emissions strategies. Additionally, the forecast contrail impact from a selected flight may differ significantly from the actual impact once the flight has been completed, which again may limit emissions accounting and reporting accuracy.

Bottom-Up Approach: Flight-Specific Modeling

The most granular and accurate method is the bottom-up approach, which models the specific climate impact of each individual flight. This technique uses detailed operational data, including aircraft and engine type, flight trajectory, and altitude in combination with weather conditions, time of day, flight origin and destination, and flight booking class to calculate climate impact. This approach provides the highest accuracy impact calculation — for both contrails and other non-CO2 effects and CO2 emissions — and best incentivizes the implementation of targeted travel emissions reduction policies. Additionally, the bottom-up analysis is currently the most closely aligned approach to the EU non-CO2 MRV framework for airline reporting, which can result in greater transparency and consistency in emissions disclosures from both corporate travelers and airlines. This approach, however, may have higher costs associated with detailed data collection requirements and the need for specialized service providers to conduct analyses.

Exhibit 1

Pilot Key Findings and Insights

For this set of pilots, Estuaire conducted an analysis of the contrail impact associated with flight bookings over 2024. Applying the flight-specific bottom-up approach, results revealed lower contrails and other non-CO2 effects averaging a 1.3x impact compared to the baseline 1.7x multiplier as well as lower CO2 emissions compared to standard emissions accounting practices. The study revealed 2% of flight bookings account for 80% of the total contrail impact, as illustrated in Exhibit 2 below. This highlights the highly uneven distribution of contrail effects across flights, including flights that produced contrails with cooling effects. As a result, applying a uniform multiplier to all flight bookings would misrepresent its true climate impact. Additionally, analyses confirmed initial hypotheses such as higher radiative forcing impact during winter and cool spring and fall months, evening and nighttime flights, and along medium- and long-haul routes. Based on these results, each company is now better positioned to take additional steps toward more informed decisions on opportunities that can reduce the full climate impact of their business air travel.

Exhibit 2

Further analysis confirmed the non-linearity of contrail impact with respect to both seasonality and departure time. Specifically, Exhibit 3 below shows that flights departing in winter months exhibit a higher mean contrail impact per distance flown compared to those departing in summer.

Exhibit 3

Exhibit 4 below highlights that morning departures tend to have a lower mean contrail impact per distance than late afternoon flights.

Exhibit 4

It is well known that you can’t manage what you don’t measure. Companies that are able to leverage data to understand the complexity and feasibility of potential reduction levers have the opportunity to be better positioned to convert information into actionable context-sensitive travel policies. Tools and service providers are now available to conduct detailed flight-level emissions analysis. Additionally, resources such as the Travel Impact Model (TIM) can help companies estimate future air travel impacts associated with specific flights.

Although significant advancements have been made in recent years, it is important to note that accurate contrail forecasting remains a challenge, given contrail formation is highly dependent on real-time weather conditions, which are difficult to measure with accuracy in real time, and aircraft operating characteristics such as altitude. These challenges make the exercise of identifying specific flights that may reduce air travel climate impact more complex. Without certainty that contrail forecasts will result in contrail formation or understanding the aircraft operating characteristics, companies risk making well-intentioned decisions to reduce flight impacts that may not be realized for unforeseen reasons. Reducing this risk calls for companies to use detailed historic company-level air travel emissions analysis in combination with tools such as TIM to help make informed travel policy adjustments that may reduce their future business air travel climate impacts.

It is also important to acknowledge that business travel decisions are not made in a vacuum. Not only do businesses need to account for their air travel emissions footprint, but they must also take additional factors into consideration, such as client needs, cost of travel, as well as other Scope 3 emissions that impact business decisions. For example, a business may have the option to take a flight that is likely to have low contrail impact compared to another flight at a different time of day, but if this alternative doesn’t meet the needs of a client, then a higher potential impact flight may be necessary to meet project demands. Similarly, if a lower contrail impact flight is available but would require an additional night of lodging, for example, the additional cost and emissions associated with the trip extension could exceed the available travel budget and/or negate the avoided contrail impact.

Therefore, companies could benefit from exploring comprehensive, customized travel policy guidelines based on the relationship between contrail impact forecasts, flight time and availability, cost considerations, and regional/local emissions at the business destination, enabling more effective and targeted reductions in aviation-related climate impacts. To help generate employee buy-in, companies could explore embedding incentives within travel booking tools for employees to encourage the selection of low-emissions options. Companies could also consider developing educational and policy training materials that detail the importance of more accurate emissions accounting and the role company personnel can play in reducing emissions.

Key Stakeholders

The corporate emissions accounting and reporting chain is a complex ecosystem with a diverse range of stakeholders, each with a vested interest in the accuracy, transparency, and use of the reported data. Each plays a distinct role in defining, generating, managing and verifying the data that underpin credible corporate disclosures, and together they form the foundation on which future contrail and other non-CO2 accounting and reporting can build. As air travel contrail impact and non-CO2 emissions corporate accounting processes continue to develop, each stakeholder group will need to be engaged to raise awareness and ensure cohesion and practicality.

Reporting companies (i.e., air transport customers such as corporate travelers and freight shippers) compile air travel and freight transport data from internal systems and external partners to calculate aviation emissions. Within companies, ESG, finance, accounting, and air transport management teams coordinate disclosure and data governance, integrating both CO2 and non-CO2 effects into their business operations. Continued engagement in pilot projects could help to refine contrails and other non-CO2 emissions accounting methodologies and test their viability in real-world settings. By sharing learnings transparently, corporates could help to collectively strengthen the evidence base for refined accounting methods.

Travel management companies or freight forwarders act as intermediaries connecting corporate customers to airlines and carriers. They provide flight-level booking and activity data, such as routes, distances, and seating classes, that serve as key inputs for aviation emissions accounting. Coordination between data providers, reporting companies, and emissions accounting providers could help to develop data management processes that enable improved efficiency in data analysis.

Emissions accounting and analytics providers (including both internal corporate teams and external modeling partners) convert flight activity data into quantified CO2, contrail impact, and other non-CO2 outputs. Depending on data availability and other factors, they may apply standard emission factors or calculate results using actual flight-level information through bottom-up modeling approaches provided. Continued engagement in pilot projects to test accounting methodologies could help these service providers better understand existing challenges to data collection activities and support the development of solutions to address them in collaboration with data providers and reporting companies.

Verification and assurance providers review corporate emissions data for completeness, consistency, and credibility. As flight-level and contrail-related accounting practices mature, these actors could play an important role in developing corresponding verification criteria. Engaging them early could help identify what evidence and data transparency are necessary for acceptance within established assurance processes.

Voluntary standard setters and guidance providers, including GHG Protocol and SBTi provide voluntary frameworks for stakeholders across the aviation value chain to establish accounting boundaries, methodological consistency and disclosure expectations. These organizations play a foundational role in shaping how corporate emissions are measured and disclosed. GHG Protocol is currently revising its corporate, Scope 2, and 3 standards guidance with plans to finalize updates in 2027. In parallel, SBTi is undertaking a major update to its Corporate Net-Zero Standard (v2.0) and the initiative has indicated plans for a formal aviation sector update process. Together, these revision efforts create a key window for aviation and corporate stakeholders to contribute insights that reflect advances in refined accounting methodologies and the growing understanding of contrails and other non-CO2 effects.

Regulatory bodies such as the European Commission, the European Environment Agency (EEA), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the UK Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) design and implement compliance frameworks, such as the EU’s MRV regulation, that are beginning to include non-CO2 effects and may influence future corporate reporting. These bodies influence methodology and emissions factors development. Engaging in early dialogue with these regulators could potentially improve alignment across frameworks and avoid duplicative or inconsistent requirements as contrails and other non-CO2 effects accounting matures.

Aircraft operators (i.e., airlines, carriers) hold primary operational data, such as fuel use, aircraft type, flight trajectory, and increasingly contrail-related parameters. Their participation in research pilots and collaboration with data and modeling providers could significantly support improving the quality and accessibility of flight-level information that supports more accurate accounting. Additionally, industry associations and standardization bodies such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Association (ICAO) could potentially serve as critical conveners to align aviation accounting practices. Their collaboration could help ensure alignment with air travel provider emissions accounting developments.

Broader aviation value-chain participants, including SAF suppliers, airports, aircraft lessors, financial institutions, and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), all share accountability for the emissions generated through air transport. Each may also influence the accuracy and flow of emissions of data through their operations, financing, infrastructure and technology innovation.

Data platforms and registries serve as connective infrastructure for emissions information across the aviation value chain. The emerging Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificate (SAFc) book and claim system and SAFc Registry illustrate how verified GHG emissions information can move transparently along the value chain, providing a useful model for how shared data infrastructure might support future contrail and non-CO2 accounting.

At present, coordination among these stakeholders remains limited, with data and responsibility distributed across different parts of the value chain. Developing a cohesive and transparent accounting and reporting ecosystem capable of addressing aviation’s full climate impact calls for expanding collaborative pilots, improving data-sharing protocols, and engaging in explorative discussions with standard setters.

Envisioning a Future State

As we look forward to when accounting and reporting for contrails and other non-CO2 effects of aviation become standard practice, we can compare the existing process steps to a future state. For the most part, steps remain consistent. The primary difference lies in the increasing accuracy and consistency of data inputs and the tools used to analyze them.

In today’s process, corporates often rely on broad emissions factors and multipliers to estimate non-CO2 impacts including contrails. In the future, these generalized methods may be complemented by more differentiated, data-driven approaches that better capture variation across flights and conditions. Depending on the data access and analytical capability, corporates could use tiered multipliers or detailed flight-by-flight analyses to enhance accuracy and transparency. Companies can coordinate with their travel management or logistics service providers and emissions modeling and data providers to conduct analyses.

Exhibit 5 - Standard vs. bottom-up corporate emissions accounting process

To enable more consistent and verifiable data exchange, a minimum standard for flight-information reporting (e.g., flight number, date and time, aircraft type) could be established across airlines, travel or logistics service providers. Such alignment would improve data quality and interoperability, supporting high-fidelity inputs for both CO2 and emerging contrails and other non-CO2 effects accounting and reporting practices.

To achieve this future state, an illustrative phased framework is envisioned (see Exhibit 8). This preliminary framework could help guide organizations through incremental steps, beginning with the adoption of current best practices in emissions accounting and gradually integrating more advanced, differentiated default and bottom-up methodologies for greater accuracy and comprehensiveness.

This pilot initiative and report fall into Phase 1, focusing on the conceptualization and initial testing of refined accounting methodologies and processes that allow corporates to capture aviation’s full climate impact. The pilots have demonstrated how refined, flight-by-flight data can improve the accuracy of reported emissions.

Phase 2 could focus on enhancing awareness and building capacity by engaging key stakeholders, as previously discussed. Additional corporates could begin to explore, pilot, and refine emissions accounting approaches. These follow-on pilot projects could continue to provide valuable insights into the practical challenges and opportunities of detailed emissions measurement, informing future improvements and standardization efforts.

As experience and confidence in advanced emissions methodologies grows and sufficient data has been collected and analyzed, Phase 3 of the framework could support the development of customized low emissions travel policies and broader adoption across the corporate sector. Corporates could start to explore alignment opportunities with air service providers on contrails and other non-CO2 emissions accounting practices, deepening partnerships with travel management and emissions accounting providers, strengthening internal capacity through training and education for employees, and help build coalitions to accelerate alignment with revised, science-based emissions accounting standards.

Last, Phase 4 could recognize the adoption of refined emissions accounting approaches, enabling scaled application.

Ultimately, a phased approach could ensure that the transition to comprehensive, high-fidelity corporate emissions accounting is both practical and sustainable, enabling businesses to play a pivotal role in reducing aviation climate impacts and advancing industry wide best practices.

· Sky-High Connectivity: The successful launch of Air Peace’s Lagos-London route and the return of carriers like Emirates underscore Nigeria’s expanding global reach.
The current MRO announcement is the concrete realization of a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Nigerian government and Boeing.
That agreement, executed in Seattle by Aviation Minister Festus Keyamo, committed Boeing to providing Nigerian operators with comprehensive training, technical support, and operational assessments.
“This partnership marks a major step in modernising Nigerian airlines,” stated Minister Festus Keyamo at the time of the MoU.","In a transformative move for the continent’s aviation landscape, the Nigerian Federal Government has announced a strategic partnership with global aerospace leader Boeing and the UK’s renowned Cranfield University to develop internationally certified Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facilities on Nigerian soil. This landmark initiative, confirmed at the inaugural Nigerian International Airshow, directly targets the repatriation of an estimated $200 million annually spent by Nigerian airlines on overseas aircraft maintenance.

The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator George Akume, unveiled the partnership, naming leading Nigerian operators Aero Contractors and XEJet as the local drivers of the project. New MRO hubs are already planned for the nation’s key aviation nodes: Lagos and Abuja.

This ambitious infrastructure push is not occurring in isolation. It is strategically positioned atop a platform of robust sectoral growth and sweeping modernization:

· Traffic & Revenue Surge: Nigeria’s passenger traffic hit 15.89 million in 2023, with projections soaring to 25.7 million by 2029. Annual industry revenue is expected to reach $2.58 billion.

· GDP Contributor: Aviation contributes approximately 2.5% to national GDP, supported by 20 airports, 23 active airlines, and a deepening talent pool.

· Infrastructure Revolution: A monumental ₦712 billion overhaul of Lagos’s Murtala Muhammed Airport is underway, complemented by modernization projects at five other major airports and runways nationwide.

· Regulatory Leadership: Nigeria now ranks as Africa’s leading country for compliance with international aviation safety standards.

· Sky-High Connectivity: The successful launch of Air Peace’s Lagos-London route and the return of carriers like Emirates underscore Nigeria’s expanding global reach.

The current MRO announcement is the concrete realization of a 2024 Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Nigerian government and Boeing. That agreement, executed in Seattle by Aviation Minister Festus Keyamo, committed Boeing to providing Nigerian operators with comprehensive training, technical support, and operational assessments.

Crucially, Boeing’s Airport Engineering team was tasked with advising on airport expansion and the development of local maintenance facilities—laying the direct technical groundwork for the hubs now being established.

“This partnership marks a major step in modernising Nigerian airlines,” stated Minister Festus Keyamo at the time of the MoU.

Echoing this sentiment, Boeing’s Vice-President for Commercial Sales in Africa, Anbessie Yitbarek, emphasized the deal’s role in “building a sustainable civil aviation ecosystem in Nigeria.”

The shift from advisory support to physical infrastructure represents a pivotal moment. Nigeria is now poised to become a major MRO player in West Africa, though it enters a competitive field with established hubs in the Middle East and emerging centers across the continent.

Officials, however, are confident in Nigeria’s strategic advantages: its vast domestic market, geographic position as a natural West African gateway, and rapidly expanding airline network. The scale of local fleet growth alone creates a compelling business case for in-country MRO services.

Secretary Akume highlighted Nigeria’s proactive engagement on the global stage, noting, “At the Dubai Airshow, Nigeria showcased its readiness to collaborate on next-generation aviation and defence technologies.”",https://airspace-africa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Boeing-737-MAX-via-Boeing.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 15:58:34.079797

Speaking during a panel debate at Travel Weekly’s Sustainability Summit, Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade was confident the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RSM) – a UK government scheme to support investment in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – would come into law as planned by the end of 2026.
She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel.
The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.
“Everybody’s dragging their heels.","Aviation and cruise sustainability experts are hopeful of progress within the sectors next year but admit delays and increased emissions are also likely.

Speaking during a panel debate at Travel Weekly’s Sustainability Summit, Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade was confident the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RSM) – a UK government scheme to support investment in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – would come into law as planned by the end of 2026.

Progress would rely on “how quickly they can enrol contracts, depending upon the projects that come forward”, he said, but insisted: “There will be more momentum around RCM this time next year, and I think we’ll be much more developed in terms of our thinking and government’s thinking as well as the greenhouse gas removals market.”

Aviation Environment Federation policy manager Celeste Hicks agreed: “We’re not sure whether that means contracts being awarded at the end of next year, but that’s the idea. That will give us an indication of whether we’re going to hit the 2030 SAF targets.”

But she said she also expected to see “delay and increased international aviation emissions” over the next 12 months, and accused the industry as a whole of “dragging its heels” on the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel. The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.

“Everybody’s dragging their heels. It’s easy for everybody to blame each other, but we don’t see the progress.”

Carnival UK vice-president sustainability and strategy Sophie Portlock was hopeful of progress in 2026 towards an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) deal to reduce carbon emissions globally to reach net zero by 2050, despite talks falling apart earlier this year.

Referring to a one year delay to a vote on adopting a global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism for international shipping, she said: “It will be interesting to see what happens as a result of the IMO discussions around the net zero framework.”

She stressed the deal had not been “discarded”, adding: “It’s just been delayed by a year. That vote is now due to take place in October next year, and over the coming 12 months, there is work that is going to be done to look at some of these technical challenges and how we overcome some of those within that framework.”

While cruise only makes up 2% of the international shipping industry, ensuring alignment in the move to alternative fuels was “key” to provide confidence and clarity in the market, she stressed.

Carnival Corporation had already seen an 11% reduction in its total greenhouse gasses since a peak in 2011 following investment in energy efficiency measures and new technology, despite a 38% capacity increase over the same period of time, she said.

“That shows how these initiatives and these developments are leading to a reduction in our total carbon footprint,” she said, adding Carnival Corporation had 11 ships operating on liquefied natural gas (LNG), with 18 due to have LNG by 2033, covering around a third of total passenger capacity.

She added more than 70% of the group’s fleet had shore power capability but said the challenge in Europe was the number of available ports.

“There are about 16 ports that have shore power capability that can support cruise ships of our size,” she said, but noted: “We are expecting to see a further seven ports of a shore power capability next year. So it is increasing.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/384/Tim_Alderslade_sustainability_summit1_Main.webp,N,,2025-12-08 14:56:32.576862
