IATA’s CO2 Connect is one of many tools designed to measure emissions from flights. It provides operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, rather than the modelled averages used by some other calculation methodologies.

The latest improvement to CO2 Connect takes into account the use of alternative fuels, which the airline industry calls sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Initially, the per-passenger emissions reduction figure from the use of alternative fuel will be based on an airline’s total schedule, so every flight will “benefit from an equal percentage reduction based on total SAF purchases”.

Although, IATA plans further enhancements to allow the tool to allocate per-passenger emissions reductions on specific routes.

Frederic Leger, IATA’s senior vice president commercial products and services, said:“Corporations and individual travellers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is - particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having.

The company’s latest updates focus on improving safety, efficiency, and operational feasibility of the jet.

The BYA-1, initially unveiled in 2023, is an eight-passenger business aircraft designed to run on gaseous hydrogen without batteries. Its propulsion system has been updated to include two independent power channels, reducing the risk of failure while increasing redundancy.

The fuel cell stack has been upgraded to 2.4MW, while the 700-bar hydrogen tanks have been repositioned above the wing box structure to improve crashworthiness and remove high-pressure fuel lines from the cabin. The aircraft’s propulsion system has also been fine-tuned with electric ducted fans and a digital engine control system to optimise performance across all flight phases.

Beyond Aero estimates these refinements will significantly cut costs. Maintenance expenses are expected to be up to 55% lower than those of conventional turbine-powered aircraft due to fewer moving parts, while hydrogen fuel is projected to be 65% cheaper than synthetic sustainable aviation fuel by 2025.

The road to certification

Bringing a hydrogen-powered aircraft to market is not without regulatory challenges. Current certification frameworks are designed for conventional fuels, meaning new safety and operational standards must be developed.

“During discussions with EASA about certifying our hydrogen-electric aircraft, a key challenge emerged: existing regulations are designed for conventional fuels and do not fully address the specifics of hydrogen,” Walter Filho, Head of Certification at Beyond Aero, told Zag Daily.

“One of the biggest hurdles is establishing regulations that ensure the same safety level as conventional aircraft in the same category. To tackle this, Beyond Aero is collaborating with EASA to draft the certification basis for BYA-I and develop a ‘special condition’ tailored to this innovation,” he added.

Beyond Aero is also engaging with industry stakeholders through the Alliance for Zero-Emission Aviation to help define technical standards for hydrogen fuel cell applications and crashworthiness.

While aircraft certification is a major hurdle, the success of hydrogen-electric aviation also depends on fuel availability. The company has been working to secure hydrogen supply chains and airport partnerships to ensure operators can refuel efficiently.

“From the early stages of the project, we established a dedicated department focused on hydrogen airport infrastructure, working closely with airports and hydrogen providers to assess requirements such as hydrogen consumption, storage capacity, and refuelling solutions,” Irwin Kerboriou, Lead H2 Airport Operations Manager at Beyond Aero, told Zag Daily.

Kerboriou pointed to key partnerships, including a collaboration with ADP Group, announced two years ago, to ensure hydrogen availability at business aviation hubs in Europe. Beyond Aero is also working with the Alliance for Zero-Emission Aviation to help build a scalable hydrogen supply chain.

Strong market interest

The BYA-1 is designed for corporate clients and business jet operators looking for a low-carbon alternative. In a six-passenger configuration, the aircraft has a range of 800 nautical miles, covering over 80% of European business aviation routes. It is also optimised for constrained airports such as London City.

Market interest in Beyond Aero’s aircraft has been strong, with demand coming from business jet operators, corporate clients, and investors.

“The market response has been overwhelmingly positive,” Eloa Guillotin, Co-founder and CEO of Beyond Aero, told Zag Daily. “Many potential clients have turned into investors eager to participate and keen to know when the aircraft will be available. This direct connection has enabled us to validate demand and refine our offering based on genuine user feedback from high-net-worth individuals and corporate and fleet operators.”

To date, Beyond Aero has secured $914 million in Letters of Intent for 108 aircraft and has already started a waiting list for booking deposits.",https://zagdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BYA_Hangar.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 13:57:52.315448

Larry Rhoden recently signed off on legislation banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines in the state.
“South Dakota landowners feel strongly that the threat of involuntary easements for the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline infringes on their freedoms and their property rights,” Rhoden wrote.
Another option is rerouting through Minnesota, but state law does not allow eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.
An Iowa bill banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines on agricultural land recently passed out of committee.","A new law in South Dakota raises questions about the future of a $9 billion carbon dioxide pipeline project spanning five Midwestern states.

The Iowa-based company Summit Carbon Solutions wants to build a 2,500-mile pipeline network to transport carbon dioxide from dozens of ethanol plants and bury it deep underground in North Dakota. Summit and its supporters say sequestering the greenhouse gas will open the door to low-carbon fuel markets and bump up demand for corn.

But the project has faced strong pushback, largely over property rights, local zoning ordinances and safety after a carbon dioxide rupture in Satartia, Mississippi five years ago made national headlines.

South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden recently signed off on legislation banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines in the state. Shortly after, Summit Carbon Solutions asked South Dakota regulators to hit pause and extend the deadline for its application to build and operate its pipeline in the state.

According to Summit’s filing, South Dakota requires a company to have a permit application and the legal authority to use eminent domain to access private property for land surveys.

Rhoden said in a letter explaining his decision that he’s had hundreds of conversations with people on all sides of the proposed project. Banning the use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines does not kill Summit’s plan, he said, since the company could still move forward with voluntary easements.

“I encourage Summit and others to view [the new law] as an opportunity for a needed reset,” Rhoden stated.

Eminent domain is the legal right to use private property for projects that benefit the public. A court determines the landowners’ compensation. Many pipeline opponents argue Summit’s project is not a public benefit and that the possibility of eminent domain pressures landowners to sign easement agreements.

“South Dakota landowners feel strongly that the threat of involuntary easements for the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline infringes on their freedoms and their property rights,” Rhoden wrote. “I have said many times that Summit needs to earn back trust from South Dakota landowners.”

Emma Schmit is the director of Pipeline Fighters with Bold Alliance, a nonprofit that organizes against fossil fuel projects and eminent domain abuse. She said the new law is a “huge victory for landowners.”

“It’s going to be a long, hard road for [Summit] if they do continue,” Schmit said.

A large roadblock after several green lights last year

Iowa officials last year approved Summit’s phase one route permit and granted the right to use eminent domain. But they said construction in the state cannot begin until Summit files proof of agency approval from North Dakota and South Dakota.

North Dakota approved Summit’s route and sequestration permits last year. Commissioners for the route permit said the courts would decide whether the company has the right to eminent domain in the state.

Minnesota officials in December granted Summit a permit for a 28-mile pipeline that connects an ethanol plant to North Dakota.

Nebraska, the last state in the pipeline’s planned route, does not require state-wide approval, but Summit will need conditional use permits from each county with a zoning ordinance.

“It’s very unfortunate that, despite our approvals in Iowa, North Dakota and Minnesota, South Dakota changed the rules in the middle of the game,” a Summit spokesperson stated in an email.

“This kind of regulatory uncertainty creates real challenges—not just for our project, but for the ethanol plants in South Dakota that now face a competitive disadvantage compared to their counterparts in neighboring states,” the spokesperson wrote.

In a press release, Summit said all options, including legal action, are on the table to move the project forward.

What are Summit’s options?

But Summit has few choices, said Jess Mazour, conservation program associate for Sierra Club Iowa Chapter. The organization is one of the groups that has rallied landowners opposed to carbon dioxide pipelines.

Summit could sue the state of South Dakota to try to overturn the bill or find a route in the state without using eminent domain, said Mazour. Another option is rerouting through Minnesota, but state law does not allow eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.

“This is going to be a very tough path forward for Summit and likely require massive reroutes or massive lawsuits,” Mazour said.

Whether Summit pursues lawsuits or pipeline reroutes, Mazour said Iowa needs to move forward with its own legislation to protect landowner rights.

“We’re not changing the rules in the middle of the game, we’re protecting Iowans’ property rights,” Mazour said.

An Iowa bill banning eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines on agricultural land recently passed out of committee.

“It's similar to what South Dakota did, and it's fair,” Mazour said. “[Carbon dioxide pipelines] are not for the public good. These are privately owned projects, and we do not think eminent domain should be used for them.”

Similar legislation in the past has stalled in Iowa’s senate, but Mazour said the recent win in South Dakota adds wind to the sails of pipeline opponents.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said he views the new South Dakota law as a “de facto ban” on carbon dioxide pipelines in the state. Shaw said he, along with ethanol producers in the association, were disappointed by the decision, but he’s confident the project will move forward, even if it does not include South Dakota.

“There are lots of places you can sequester carbon in the United States, and there are lots of ways to get there that do not involve South Dakota,” Shaw said. “When you consider the massive opportunities that ultra low carbon ethanol has in markets, literally around the world, it's just so large that no one state's going to stop that from happening.”

One of these markets is aviation fuel, which Shaw said could drive demand for biofuels over the next two decades.

In 2021, the International Civil Aviation Organization set targets to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. That same year, the U.S. launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge with the goals of producing 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel in the U.S. by 2030 and meeting all domestic aviation fuel demand by 2050.

“Sustainable aviation fuel alone could be 100 billion gallons worldwide,” Shaw said. “To put that in reference, we use 14 billion gallons to supply E10 to the entire United States.”

While Summit’s project comes with a lot of question marks, Shaw pointed to another one that’s moving forward. Tallgrass Energy is converting a natural gas pipeline to carry carbon dioxide from industries in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming for underground storage in Wyoming.

An ethanol plant in southwest Iowa may connect, as well.

“We're a little bit jealous watching what's happening to the west of us where the Tallgrass pipeline is under construction,” Shaw said. “It'll be operational in the third quarter of this year, and the plants on that pipeline are going to reap huge financial benefits.”

Tallgrass and Bold Alliance signed a “first-of-its-kind” community benefits agreement last year, which established landowner protections throughout the pipeline’s life cycle.

Made from so-called renewable sources, the fuels are said to be a ‘gamechanger’ by the UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves, limiting the environmental damage of flying. Even though this has been challenged by some, alternative aviation fuels are here to stay, with a new mandate from Westminster.

From this year, 2% of all jet fuel used in the UK must be SAF, rising to 10% by 2030 and climbing again by 2040, and there’s a similar programme in Europe, ReFuelEU.

The British Government argues that SAF emits 70% less carbon emissions over its lifetime. Last year, production volumes globally reached one million tonnes, double that of the year before, according to IATA.

This sounds like a lot, but UK aviation consumes over 12 million tonnes of jet fuel each year. For travel buyers looking to drill down on their Scope 3 emissions, the big question is how to get hold of the stuff. There are a number of avenues (see next page), however there can be challenges.

“Making sense of this sector is like unravelling layers of an onion, working out who are the producers, suppliers and middlemen. With any scheme, I am always looking for the closest line of sight to the SAF producer,” explains John Harvey, founder of travel consultancy Globalyse and former Chief Marketing Officer of HRG.

Remember carbon offsets? Well, the market for SAF is reminiscent of this, with accusations of greenwashing and double counting. Integrity in reporting will therefore be essential going forwards, where claims are based on transparent and verifiable data, with a clear justification of their environmental impact.

This is where credible standards come in; the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) Book and Claim Standard is one and the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance’s (SABA) Sustainability Framework for SAF is another.

Then there’s the issue of whether it’s sustainable at all. A study commissioned by the European Consumer Organisation, BEUC thinks not. Currently a lot of SAF comes from used cooking oil, animal fats or agricultural waste. Although it contributes to reducing the harmful environmental aspects of flying, the term “sustainable here is too absolute and not concrete enough,” it says.

For instance, the amount of land needed to produce the required amount of fuel via agricultural means would be 68% of the total land under production in the UK, according to a Royal Society report.

These are still early days. The quality of current SAF used does matter. There’s only so much farm waste and residue oil available to fuel producers, while new raw materials such as algae and novel vegetable oils based on regenerative farming practices are underdeveloped. So are ‘power-to-liquids’, which use green hydrogen and carbon capture to generate a liquid jet fuel, often called an e-fuel.

But if travel buyers are getting in early with purchases, they’re helping to kickstart the industry of the future, in a similar way to investments in solar power decades ago. Solar is now cheap to install, ubiquitous and has lower generation costs than new fossil fuel projects. So, what are the options?

Buy it direct from producers

This is the best way to source SAF. You then have a clear line of sight on what you’re getting and from whom. Transparency and traceability matters. One of the world’s largest producers and the most prominent in Europe is the Finnish company Neste. Many buyers will not have the volumes to source directly. However, knowing who the producer is at the end of the supply chain is essential, and that they are reputable. World Energy, Alder Fuels and SkyNRG are also big players in this space.

Buy it from airlines

Air France-KLM is a standout, then there’s United Airlines and Norwegian. T&E’s SAF Observatory ranks airlines on their use of SAF and what it’s sourced from.

Airlines have subsequently partnered with energy companies to source the stuff, some of which are also fossil fuel firms. For instance, Air France-KLM has an agreement with TotalEnergies to produce SAF.

IATA plans to launch a SAF registry this quarter allowing any airline to source certified and compliant fuel.

In a recent development, easyJet has been trialling its own SAF scheme with customer Airbus and is now rolling it out to other corporates. Under the scheme, easyJet will work with corporate partners to determine a specific quantity of SAF to cover their travel requirements.

Once it has pooled demand, it will use its purchasing power to buy the SAF from a fuel supplier at a better price and deliver it to a chosen airport where the SAF will be used by all carriers operating there.

Corporates are provided with non-tradeable, verified SAF certificates which they can register as part of their Scope 3 reporting (see more on page 26).

Buy it from TMCs

Whether it’s ATPI, CWT, Reed & Mackay, American Express GBT or other travel management companies, SAF can be purchased through a ‘book and claim’ system, where SAF is ‘booked’ into a fuel system and the benefits are ‘claimed’ elsewhere.

A number of TMCs source their fuel direct from producers such as Neste. Again, travel managers must know where their SAF is coming from. Due diligence is essential.

Buy it from digital platforms

New digital and data-fed platforms are now available to travel buyers. A number are more widely active in the climate technology industry.

For instance, CWT and BCD Travel have adopted Berlin-based Squake. This allows corporate travel buyers to use an automated solution for procuring SAF on a trip-by-trip basis. Such platforms offer wider carbon budgeting, forecasting and reporting tools to clients. Squake again sources SAF from Neste directly.

Buy it using blockchain tools

Blockchain allows for a reputable digitised public ledger for SAF, so that purchases are efficient, traceable and transparent with environmental data on the fuel used.

It is why Amex GBT has adopted the technology through Avelia, a blockchain powered book-and-claim solution, which involves Shell Aviation and Accenture. Rolls-Royce, Google, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America are just some of the 20 or so firms signed up to Avelia.

Buy it from energy suppliers

Traditional fossil fuel companies are also getting in on the act, including BP, Chevron, Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Eni.

These six oil majors have 43 biofuel projects that are either already operational or are targeted to start up by 2030, according to Rystad Energy.

Many are creating their own biorefineries using ‘waste and residues from the circular economy.’ Some companies are doing direct location-based deals on SAF.

For instance, DHL buys from Shell at Brussels Airport. This is a carbon ‘insetting’ practice – as opposed to offsetting, since it addresses carbon emissions directly inside DHL’s own value chain.

The issues with investing in SAF

If air transport is to become more sustainable, rapid action is needed to boost production of sustainable aviation fuels.

The UK Government is betting airport expansion on the ability to ramp up SAF.

Fuel demand will also have to rise since air passenger numbers globally are projected to more than double by 2050, undermining the industry’s ability to cut carbon emissions.

According to green group, Transport and Environment, such growth means the airline sector could be burning as much fossil kerosene as it did in 2023, even when using SAF for 42% of its fuel, as mandated by EU legislation.

The issue at the moment is a lack of supply and high prices, which are up to five times that of traditional jet fuel. Investing in SAF is likely to bring prices down, but more capacity is needed.

It doesn’t help that there is a lack of biorefineries under construction. These require extensive capital expenditure.

Plants typically cost £600 million to £2 billion to reach economies of scale and tend to run at a loss during their first years of operation.

Shell has now paused SAF projects and in the U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to repeal Joe Biden’s green measures under the Inflation Reduction Act. This includes tax credits for SAF producers, so uncertainly plagues the sector, globally.

Who’s responsibility is it anyway?

IATA says oil majors, who supply jet fuel to the industry, should be responsibility for the ramp up of SAF, rather than airlines, who do not produce any fuel themselves directly.

It’s why the UK Government is now talking about a levy on traditional fuel suppliers. The levy would cover the cost of payments to SAF producers, so the country can meet its mandate for SAF production. This idea is out for consultation.

Ultimately, it will be the traveller that pays, but right now a stand-off could be looming between oil companies who may not want to produce SAF without long-term commitments, and airlines who won’t necessarily commit to SAF without lower prices.

In the UK, a levy would deal with this, providing a price guarantee and a so-called revenue certainty mechanism for SAF producers. Watch this space!",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SAF-1.png,N,,2025-03-18 13:58:10.653685

Japan Airlines (JAL) and Airbus are propelling the future of sustainable aviation by significantly advancing the MORISORA Project, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at producing bioethanol-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from domestic wood biomass. By joining forces with Nippon Paper Industries, Sumitomo Corporation, and Green Earth Institute (GEI), these industry giants are accelerating the development and large-scale production of SAF, setting the stage for a cleaner, greener aviation industry. Their collaboration marks a major step in Japan’s drive to reduce carbon emissions and foster innovation in aviation fuel, with the goal of transforming how aviation meets its sustainability targets while revitalizing local communities through circular economy practices.

Strategic Collaboration to Advance Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Japan Airlines (JAL), Airbus, Nippon Paper Industries, Sumitomo Corporation, and Green Earth Institute (GEI) have joined forces to accelerate the production and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) derived from bioethanol made from domestic wood. Through a newly signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), these companies will collaborate to transform the aviation industry with low-carbon fuel solutions.

MORISORA Project: Laying the Foundation for Domestic SAF

In February 2023, Nippon Paper, Sumitomo Corporation, and Green Earth Institute (GEI) initiated the “MORISORA Project” to investigate the viability of producing bioethanol from wood biomass. By February 2025, they solidified their commitment by agreeing to form a joint venture dedicated to the large-scale production and distribution of this renewable fuel. With Japan Airlines (JAL) and Airbus now joining the initiative, the project is set to accelerate the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and enhance the domestic supply network.

Commitment to Reducing Carbon Emissions

The five companies will harness their expertise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the entire SAF production process, from raw material procurement to final distribution. Their strategy centers on utilizing wood-based bioethanol with a low Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) score, ensuring compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). By integrating a circular economy model—”cutting, using, planting, and growing” trees—the initiative will drive regional economic revitalization, create jobs, and boost sustainable fuel availability in Japan.

JAL and Airbus Spearhead SAF Integration

JAL is committed to leading the shift toward domestic SAF, setting a bold target of replacing 10% of all onboard fuel with SAF by 2030. The airline will bridge the gap between SAF producers and industry stakeholders to develop a robust supply network. Meanwhile, Airbus will play a crucial role in securing CORSIA certification for the woody biomass used in this project, reinforcing the aviation sector’s commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Japan Airlines (JAL) and Airbus are driving unprecedented growth in sustainable aviation by advancing the MORISORA Project, focusing on large-scale production of bioethanol-based sustainable aviation fuel from domestic wood biomass, boosting innovation and carbon reduction in the industry.

A Sustainable Future Through Innovation

The move to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport is, to put it mildly, controversial. The angst and opposition over the cost, the time to build and the subsequent noise and air pollution, seemingly in defiance of the UK net-zero carbon emissions commitment, is understandable.

Yet, take a step back and you will see an aviation industry that is developing rapidly amid growing demand for travel and green transition. The latter includes growing usage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). There’s plenty to consider and, while there are valid concerns over carbon emissions, there are powerful mitigating factors that suggest the proposed long-term strategy for Heathrow may be the right one.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), aviation accounted for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions in 2023, rising back to above pre-pandemic levels. To give that some context, automotives account for around 12% and fast fashion about 10%. However, aviation as a sector is growing fast. The EU estimates that commercial flights could increase as much as 42% by 2040.

The commercial case for an extra runway is a powerful one, but public concerns about increased pollution and meeting net-zero-emission commitments need to be addressed. The UK, the European Union and several other countries have legally binding net-zero commitments, mostly by 2050. All have interim targets – stepping stones to net-zero – that are critical. Aviation has a big part to play and that’s where SAF comes in.

SAF is produced from sustainable feedstock that includes waste and residue fats, such as vegetable oil, used cooking oil, and animal fats, as well as purpose-grown crops like jatropha and camelina. These feedstocks are processed with hydrogen to remove oxygen and create hydrocarbon fuel components. SAF has the same energy intensity as jet fuel and can be safely blended with it. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 75%-90%, depending on the feedstock composition.

Regulation, SAF driving change in aviation

So, what factors support the airport expansion? Besides the economic benefits, there are two major factors.

The first is regulatory impetus. The EU has mandated the use of SAF in aviation fuel, rising in incremental amounts through to 2050. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which took effect at the start of 2024, requires aviation fuel to have a minimum 2% of SAF from 2025. This percentage rises to 20% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. Use of synthetic SAF is mandatory too with 5% in 2030 rising to 35% in 2050.

Yes, the UK is no longer in the EU, but it is surrounded by EU countries and will need to follow suit. Singapore has similar legislation and Hong Kong will do likewise, as will other airports with flights that go to Europe. The UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Mandate will see incremental increases in SAF usage, similar to the EU.

The second factor is the amount of SAF coming on stream, helping to meet current global demand of about two million tons – demand that is forecast to reach 10 million tons by 2030. Finland’s Neste Corporation is the world’s largest producer, but more manufacturers entering the market. One of the leading and most exciting producers is Hong Kong-based EcoCeres Inc., a company which received early funding from Full Vision Capital and is now 43% owned by Towngas.

Innovative startups supported by TERA Awards developing clean fuels

EcoCeres is a major producer of SAF and major feedstocks for SAF, hydro-treated vegetable oil (HVO) and cellulosic ethanol (CE). SAF and HVO are ISCC certified as offering emissions reductions of up to 95%. CE can offer reductions of up to 80%. With new plants in Suzhou, China, and Johor, Malaysia, that are scaling up output, EcoCeres is an example of the rapid growth in this sector.

It’s true that although SAF effectively eliminates CO2 emissions, there are still non-CO2 emissions, such as water vapor, sulphur dioxide (SO2), soot particles, and nitrogen oxides (NOx). However, SAF emits far fewer non-CO2 pollutants than jet fuel, and this can be reduced with high blends and quality feedstock.

In Hong Kong, where Towngas is based, a new third runway opened in 2022 after six years in construction. It was controversial. But air traffic has risen sharply since, albeit from low pandemic levels, and is set to continue upwards over next decade. Heathrow will see the same over the next decade and beyond – that’s inevitable. It makes sense to be ready.",https://149885598.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Alan-Chan-2023.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 13:00:05.838550

HVO Class II fob ARA trading activity on the Intercontinental Exchange (Ice) rose as European fuel suppliers increasingly seek renewable diesel made from used cooking oil (UCO) to meet higher mandates and overcome the 7pc restriction for blending conventional methyl ester biodiesel into diesel.

The total traded volume for the first two weeks of March (1-14) was 120,000t, close to the previous full-month high in January of 138,000t (see chart).

The Ice contract — a cash-settled future that settles based on Argus spot price assessments — launched in 2022 as both a differential to Ice low sulphur gasoil and outright, with the former most commonly traded.

Physical HVO interest has been more measured through the beginning of 2025, although spot trade rose year on year.

Changes to key biofuels policies in Germany and the Netherlands are expected to support overall demand and anticipation of this has supported HVO paper liquidity.

Germany has paused the carryover of surplus tickets that would otherwise go towards meeting its greenhouse gas (GHG) savings quota, meaning obligated parties will have to use more physical biofuels to meet mandates, while the Netherlands has limited the amount of tickets allowed to be carried from year to year, driving a similar dynamic.

The start of the year is often a slower physical trading period in northwest Europe as market participants look to finish off compliance submissions for the previous year. Anticipating changes to ticket carryover policies, some physical biofuels were stored in tank to be used at the start of the year, particularly in Germany, suppressing prompt demand. Class II HVO has also been affected by high feedstock prices, which have pressured production margins, and strong imports from east of Suez.

Ticket values in Germany and the Netherlands have been below the equivalent cost of blending physical Class II HVO, further limiting demand. In the Dutch market HBE-IXB prices have been pressured by supply of UCO-based sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends, which generate 2.4 HBEs per GJ as per the biofuel portion, while German ticket prices have been affected by lower diesel demand and a focus on finishing off 2024 balances.

The prompt/front-month price spread for Class II, which gives an indication of the prompt market's strength or weakness, has been volatile for the past month according to Argus assessments (see chart). The spread flipped into contango for the first week of March following a supply surge which weighed on European prices, then returned to backwardation as HVO prices tracked UCO and UCO-based biodiesel prices higher.

Prompt UCO prices have in turn been supported by tighter global supply following a protracted export ban from Indonesia, which is still expected to be temporary, contributing to the forward curve backwardation.

HVO paper trading on 14 March focused on the upcoming three months. An April/May spread traded at $10/t ($1,055/t, $1,045/t) for 5,000t/month, or 10,000t total, a May/June spread traded at $5/t ($1,045/t, $1,040/t) for 13,000t/month, or 26,000t total, and a second quarter contract traded at $1,065/t for 2,000t/month, or 6,000t total.

The agreement, effective from March 12, 2025, outlines a cooperative effort to convert used cooking oil into SAF feedstock, advancing environmental sustainability.

The ""Agreement on Collaboration and Cooperation in Promoting the Adoption of SAF"" aims to encourage the collection and recycling of used cooking oil into SAF. A signing ceremony was held on the same day at Cosmo Oil's Sakai Refinery, Japan's first major SAF production facility.

Suita City will supply around 27,000 liters of used cooking oil annually for this initiative—the largest contribution of its kind from a Japanese municipality. As part of Suita City's General Waste Management Plan, the city has actively supported accessible recycling systems. Since 2009, Suita has installed collection points for used cooking oil at public facilities, facilitating proper disposal and reuse. While this resource can become valuable SAF feedstock, many households still discard it as waste. Through this partnership, Suita City will expand collection efforts to convert waste oil into aviation fuel, empowering citizens to contribute to a carbon-free, resource-recycling society.

The five collaborating organizations will work together to build a sustainable and decarbonized society by:

Collecting household-generated used cooking oil.

Supporting production and continued SAF supply.

Raising public awareness about recycling used cooking oil into SAF.

Expanding oil collection points across Suita City.

Developing additional initiatives aligned with the Agreement's objectives.

Key Initiatives:

Used cooking oil collected from 15 public facilities, including city offices and libraries, will be transported by REVO International to the SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY plant located at Cosmo Oil's Sakai Refinery. This facility, completed in December 2024, will lead Japan's large-scale SAF production efforts by converting recycled cooking oil into sustainable fuel. Additionally, oil from 35 municipal elementary schools and 14 public daycare centers will be collected for SAF production, bringing the annual total to approximately 27,000 liters.

To further encourage participation, Cosmo Oil's service stations in Suita City may also become collection points. To promote awareness, citizens who donate used cooking oil will be entered into a lottery featuring prizes like ""Suitan Goods"" (the city's mascot-themed items) and SAF facility tour invitations. The initiative will also extend awareness campaigns to local businesses to boost engagement and promote sustainable practices.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-03-18 10:50:34.617704

The coalition is asking EPA to propose and finalize the 2026 biomass-based diesel volume at no less than 5.25 billion gal., with a corresponding increase in the advanced biofuel volume.

“We write today to ask that EPA without delay set 2026 RFS standards and adopt a robust step change in biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel volumes,” the letter states. “Setting these volumes for 2026 and establishing consistent growth for 2027 and beyond based on the industry’s investments and projections will ensure that American consumers can access affordable and clean transportation options. These volumes will support farm security, create jobs and economic opportunity and further President Trump’s goal for U.S. energy dominance.”

Over the past several years, significant investments in biofuel production capacity and feedstock supply have led to a doubling of domestic biodiesel and renewable diesel production. Currently, these fuels account for approximately 9% of U.S. on-road diesel demand, providing consumers with cost-effective, domestically produced clean fuel options, the coalition said.

Prices for B20 biodiesel blends have averaged 14 cents/gal. lower than conventional diesel since 2021, benefiting both consumers and the economy. The industry’s continued expansion supports U.S. energy security, farm prosperity and rural economic development by creating markets for agricultural byproducts and repurposing waste materials such as rendered fats and used cooking oil.

Despite these advances, the RFS volumes for 2023-2025 failed to reflect the industry's rapid growth, undermining market confidence and causing some producers to idle capacity.

According to a recent study by the management consultancy EY, investments in SAF production will need to increase dramatically in the coming years to meet rapidly changing requirements. The cost of building the necessary production capacity is expected to rise to between one and 1,5 trillion US dollars in the coming years—a sum nearly equivalent to the entire annual investment in oil and gas infrastructure worldwide.

The aviation industry has long faced the challenge of reducing its CO2 emissions and finding sustainable alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Sustainable jet fuel is considered a promising solution, as it offers a direct way to reduce aircraft CO2 emissions without requiring changes to the entire aviation industry infrastructure. However, significant hurdles remain, particularly with regard to production capacity, which is currently far from sufficient to meet future demand.

Global markets for sustainable jet fuel are in a growth phase driven by strict regulatory requirements and growing demand for climate-friendly fuels. Demand is forecast to increase dramatically, particularly in Europe. Estimates indicate that by 2050, more than half of Europe's total jet fuel demand will be met by SAF. This would equate to a demand of approximately 73,1 million tons of SAF in Europe alone. In North America, the second-largest market, demand is expected to be around 60 million tons.

The European market is further driven by the EU regulation on reducing CO2 emissions and the airlines' commitment to use sustainable fuels. Starting in 2023, all airlines operating in Europe must cover at least two percent of their kerosene consumption with SAF. By 2030, this share is expected to increase to at least six percent. However, the current share of SAF is only 0,2 percent of total kerosene consumption in Europe, highlighting the magnitude of the challenge.

Costs and investments

According to the EY study, the necessary investments to expand SAF production capacity are enormous. To meet the estimated demand in 2050, between 5.000 and 7.000 new production facilities will be needed worldwide. These facilities would require significant investments in infrastructure, research, and development. The total cost of expanding SAF production is estimated at up to $1,5 trillion. This corresponds to approximately six to ten percent of the annual investments currently flowing into the oil and gas industry's infrastructure.

Despite the high investment requirements, EY experts believe that these expenditures are not so high when viewed in relation to global investments in fossil fuels. According to EY, the oil industry could provide a significant portion of the required funds, as it already benefits from high oil and gas prices. The funds could be collected through various mechanisms, such as a central fund at the EU level, which would include revenues from the EU emissions trading system or fines for violations of climate protection regulations. These funds could then be invested in expanding SAF production.

Production and challenges

Despite the promising growth of the SAF market, production capacity currently remains limited. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global SAF production is expected to reach only 2023 million tons in 2,1, accounting for only approximately 0,7 percent of total jet fuel consumption. In Germany, SAF production is expected to reach a mere 2026 million tons by 0,08. This highlights the enormous discrepancy between current production volumes and future demand.

Currently, 264 new SAF production projects are planned worldwide, 103 of which are located in North America and 98 in Europe. Many airlines have already signed supply agreements with SAF producers to meet their own climate targets and meet the demand for sustainable fuel. Despite these numerous projects, however, the supply of SAF remains tight, forcing airlines to resort to alternative solutions or invest in research and development of their own SAF production capacities.

Potential solutions and future prospects

A key aspect addressed by the EY experts is the need to create a central fund at the EU level to expand the SAF industry. This fund could be funded by revenues from the EU emissions trading system and fines from climate protection violations. Additionally, the consultants propose introducing a levy on airline tickets and levying a tax on revenues from SAF production through waste recycling. These measures could help generate the necessary financial resources to significantly increase SAF production in the coming years.

The challenge of meeting the global demand for sustainable jet fuel is enormous and requires extensive investments in infrastructure and technology. Given the increasing demand for SAF and the political mandate for CO2 reduction, both the aviation industry and policymakers are called upon to find joint solutions to expand production capacities and ensure the supply of sustainable jet fuel.",https://i0.wp.com/aviation.direct/wp-content/uploads/1_Skytanking.jpg?fit=1200%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-03-18 13:58:17.403296

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has significantly upgraded its IATA CO2 Connect emissions calculator by incorporating reductions in carbon emissions associated with the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This enhancement aims to provide a more precise and transparent measurement of aviation-related emissions, reinforcing the industry’s commitment to sustainability.

Advancing SAF Accounting and Reporting

This development follows the recent release of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology, which establishes standardized accounting rules and best practices for including SAF in per-passenger CO2 data. In its initial phase, CO2 Connect will distribute emission reductions uniformly across an airline’s network, ensuring that all flights receive an equal percentage reduction based on the total SAF procured. Future updates will refine this approach, allowing SAF-related emission reductions to be assigned to specific routes, further enhancing accuracy and accountability.

Expanding Participation in CO2 Connect

IATA CO2 Connect leverages actual operational data, including aircraft type-specific fuel consumption figures directly supplied by airlines. This distinguishes it from other calculators that rely on generalized modeling and assumptions.

The tool’s credibility continues to grow as more airlines join the initiative. The latest additions—Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas, and Royal Air Maroc—bring the total number of contributing airlines to approximately 60. Each new participant enhances the precision and reliability of CO2 Connect’s emissions calculations, benefiting both individual travelers and corporate users seeking accurate sustainability metrics.

As IATA continues to refine its emissions calculation methodologies, CO2 Connect remains a crucial tool in fostering transparency and progress in sustainable aviation.

“Corporations and individual travelers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President Commercial Products and Services.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonization powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.

The following companies are producing SAF in the UK or have received funding from the government’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF) to pursue research: UK SAF production: 1.","As the UK government’s sustainable aviation fuel mandate begins to take effect, STEPHEN BRIDGEWATER FRAeS takes a deep dive into the UK SAF sector.

On 1 January, the UK Department for Transport (DfT) introduced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, meaning at least 2% of all jet fuel aboard flights taking off from UK airports must be SAF by law. This is set to expand to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 – delivering up to 6.3 mega tonnes of carbon savings per year according to government figures – but what exactly is SAF, how is it made, how much can be produced and is it really the answer to our collective net zero aspirations? Figures quoted by the DfT confirm that SAF production in Britain increased 188% from 2022 to 2023, rising from 48m to 138.1m litres. That accounted for less than 1% of the 14bn litres of conventional jet fuel consumed in the UK that year. Meanwhile, figures published by the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service’s Global Agricultural Information Network in December 2024 reveal that 287.5m litres of SAF will be needed this year alone to meet the 2% SAF mandate – meaning that 2023 figures would cover just 48% of the fuel needed.

Looking further ahead, the DfT estimates that 1.5bn litres of SAF will be needed each year in order to meet the mandated 10% level required in 2030. Put simply, in 2023 the UK produced 9.2% of the SAF that the industry will need in 2030. Can it upscale production to produce the missing 90.8% by the end of this decade? Or will the UK need to import fuel from overseas?

It should be noted at this point that although trials have been conducted using 100% SAF – and the 2025 UK mandate is just 2% - there are currently physical limits in terms of how much can be blended with conventional Jet A1 for commercial operations. Fossil fuels contain natural aromatics, which are absorbed by some types of elastomer-based engine components, helping them seal. SAF has lower levels of aromatics and, therefore, has the potential to cause leaks due to seal shrinkage. Researchers are developing ways to produce synthetic aromatics but currently SAF needs to be blended with conventional fuel for safe operation.

Incentives and enforcement

The government has chosen to enforce the mandate via a traceable certificate scheme for fuel suppliers. These suppliers will receive a certificate confirming the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction their fuels – either manufactured or imported – have achieved over the previous year and these can then be used to prove they have met their obligations. Fuel manufacturers and suppliers also have the option to sell excess certificates via a buyout mechanism to other suppliers who may need them because they have not been able to produce or import sufficient to meet their obligations. A maximum price of £4.70 each has been set for these certificates, which aims to prevent excessive costs being passed on to consumers, and the DfT says the buyout price has been designed to encourage the supply and trading of certificates rather than their sale for profit.

From 2027, the UK’s mandate also requires innovation in the feedstocks that can be used, imposing a cap on feedstocks derived from hydroprocessed esters (organic compounds that react with water to produce alcohols or acids) and fatty acids (HEFA) and, from 2028, including a separate power-to-liquid obligation. By way of incentivising companies to set up SAF production facilities in the UK, the government has also announced that it will introduce a ‘revenue certainty mechanism.’ It is hoped this will attract investment in new production plants in Britain and a new consultation on the mechanism is set to be launched in early 2025. The term SAF covers several basic pathways of producing a lower carbon-emitting jet fuel from, mostly, waste products.

The fatty answer

A light-hearted study (see Frequent Fryer Insight blog, 12 March 2024) discovered that it would take 357,143 portions of chips to fuel a transatlantic Dreamliner with 60 tonnes of neat, unblended SAF.

One of the most established and widely used forms of SAF production comes from the use of HEFA. This uses a feedstock made up from waste fats, oils and greases – notably used chip fat – as well as waste from food production, such as tallow (or beef dripping as it is better known in Britain). The supply of these by-products is finite and no matter how many portions of chips we eat the potential to produce SAF is limited (See ‘Frequent Fryer’ AEROSPACE Insight blog, 12 March 2024). As such, the recent SAF mandate includes a cap on the amount of HEFA that can be used to meet the obligations. HEFA can contribute a maximum amount (100%) of SAF demand in 2025 and 2026, decreasing to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

Pros: Mature technology already widely deployed. Cheapest among current SAF types.

Cons: Feedstock availability and vulnerability to supply chain shocks. Linked to high feedstock food costs.

The corny answer

Some biofuels use agriculture crops to produce SAF. These cellulosic substances, which can come from specifically grown crops or waste products, like corn stalks or branches of chopped trees, can be processed into synthetic fuel through the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. FT is a set of chemical reactions that convert CO2 and hydrogen into liquid hydrocarbons.

Pros: Relatively higher blend rates possible (+/–50%).

Cons: Feedstock availability and vulnerability to supply chain shocks.

The alcohol answer

Plant-based feedstocks, including corn and sugarcane, can be converted into renewable ethanol and then into jet fuel through the ‘alcohol-to-jet’ (AtJ) pathway. AtJ removes the oxygen molecules from the ethanol and uses a variety of chemistry steps to remove the water, add hydrogen and string together other molecules into longer chains (via oligomerisation). Following further processing, these chains can then be burned as jet fuel.

However, there are questions surrounding the feedstocks used in both the FT and AtJ processes, with the population already outstripping the supply of food in many parts of the world. Alternatives include the use of plants, such as camelina, carinata and pennycress, which produce oil seeds and often grow in poor quality farmland. Other non-food feedstocks being explored include jatropha, which produces toxic inedible seeds that contain oil suitable for SAF production. It too can be grown in degraded soil in poor climates but the crop yield requires improvement before it becomes commercially viable.

Pros: Mature technology. Relatively cheap capital investment.

Cons: Also suitable for transport fuel uses, so demand is likely to increase sale price. Concerns over using land better utilised for food crop production.

The salty answer

Other options for FT feedstocks come from salty environments, such as coastal areas. Here, salt marsh grasses, such as halophytes – which can grow in salt water or in areas affected by sea spray – can provide biomass either via their seeds or their cellulosic biomass. Trials have also been conducted growing microscopic algae in salt water environments. These fast-growing plants can rapidly produce a feedstock and tests show they can provide up to 15 times more oil per square mile than other feedstocks. Some types of CO2 absorbing algae also make them ideal for carbon sequestration.

Pros: Abundant feedstock. High production ratio.

Cons: Relatively immature technology.

The rubbish answer

According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), UK households combined produce around 27.7m tonnes of domestic waste each year (around 400kg per person) with just 45% of it currently being recycled.

Gasification converts carbon-based material, like waste packaging, clothing, bottles, newspapers and even food into syngas, which can then be turned into SAF. There is a large feedstock and a key advantage of this method is that it will reduce the amount of waste being disposed of in landfill sites, thus reducing the damaging methane gas produced as it rots.

Pros: Relatively higher blend rates possible (+/–50%).

Cons: Feedstock availability in high demand. Vulnerability to supply chain shocks.

The liquid answer

OXCCU’s OX1 demonstration plant opened in Oxford in August 2024. It converts CO2 and hydrogen directly into long-chain hydrocarbons for use as SAF. A larger plan is scheduled to open in Hull in 2026. (OXCCU)

So-called Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels are created synthetically from CO2, water and renewable electricity. The three-step process begins with ‘green’ electricity sources being used to produce hydrogen. It is then synthesised with climate-neutral CO2 (for example, CO2 captured via a Direct Air Carbon Capture system) and converted into carbon feedstock via the FT process to create liquid hydrocarbons. These are then converted into a synthetic kerosene equivalent. Unlike other SAFs, some PtL fuels essentially use the CO2 released during combustion of carbon fuels in their creation, thus ‘closing the CO2 loop’ and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 90% compared to fossil fuels. Research is also being undertaken into converting solar power into jet fuel (using the sunlight to break up water and CO2 molecules). However, it is important to note that experts warn against green electricity being diverted from the grid to produce SAF and proffer that such power is better used to service sectors such as road vehicles and heating.

Pros: Abundant feedstocks. Likely the cleanest fuel possible.

Cons: Energy-intensive and expensive to produce. Dependent on clean electricity and captured carbon availability.

UK production

Average price of SAF - Fig 1. Average price of aviation fuel, per gallon, as of February 2025.

There is huge potential for the UK to lead the world in SAF production, and research carried out for the DfT indicates that by 2040 the sector could generate up to £1.66bn a year for the UK economy. Potentially, half of that figure could come from the export of intellectual property and the provision of engineering services alone. Producing its own fuel would also help the UK increase its fuel security and be less reliant on volatile supply chains, and the government also projects that up to 11,000 ‘green jobs’ could also be created across the UK. As of early 2025, the UK only has one industrial-scale SAF refinery facility. Owned by Phillips 66 and located in Humberside since 2017, the facility produces fuel from sustainable waste feedstocks. Meanwhile, through the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), the government has issued grants to several aspiring SAF producers [see map below] and, in January 2025, a further £63m of funding was announced.

The price of sustainability

Life cycle analysis Fig 2. The well-to-wake GHG emissions (grammes of CO2 eq/MJ of trisobutane) resulting from Jet A-1compared to SAFs.

The projected price of SAF fluctuates wildly, depending on sources and agendas. Investigation by KPMG in 2022 suggested that, when compared to Jet A-1, the end user price varied from just a few percentage points (in nations where government incentives were in place) to up to a 500% increase. As of February 2025, the average price for SAF in the US was $9.02 per gallon – some 282% higher than the average price of $2.36 per gallon of Jet A-1 at the time. The adoption of SAF will most likely result in an increase in airline ticket prices but, as more passengers become conscious of the ‘greenness’ of the fuel their journey burns, airlines must also be increasingly transparent regarding their true life cycle well-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions. This considers how a feedstock is cultivated, where and how it is transported, and its ultimate conversion to fuel (see Figure 2). Understanding this helps fend off claims of ‘greenwashing’, which have beset the industry over the last few years.

While many European countries are trying to restrict the manufacture of crop-based biofuels, the resultant shift in demand for waste oil is outpacing supply, and waste products are now being imported from overseas (itself adding to the carbon life cycle of the fuel). In 2023, a report by Brussels-based NGO Transport & Environment claimed to have uncovered cases of fraudulent transactions where palm oil products were mislabelled as waste in order to circumvent regulations. With palm oil contributing to global deforestation, its use in SAF could have a far more detrimental effect on the climate than the Jet A-1 it is supposed to replace.

UK as a SAF superpower

Green Fuels Research, Petrofac and Cranfield University have collaborated to create FIREFLY, which aims to convert the approximately 53m tonnes of raw sewage sludge created in the UK each year into SAF. (Severn Trent Water).

As production is scaled up, and economies of scale come into effect, the cost of SAF will undoubtedly reduce but this requires incentivisation of fuel companies to invest in production facilities and new technologies and airlines to increase the amount of SAF it acquires. In its 2022 study SAF – Ready for lift-off?, KPMG emphasised that “while it remains cheaper for airlines to offset carbon emissions through trading schemes than through the use of SAF in place of Jet A-1, we do not expect SAF supply to meaningfully exceed government-mandated levels.”

In the Autumn Budget, the UK government pledged to support UK SAF development and committed to deliver £975m in R&D support. This support of the sector is reassuring for many. However, the UK is competing more than ever for private investment in the global market. Under the Biden administration, the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included trillions of dollars in incentives for low-carbon technologies, including tax credits to the worth of $1.25 per gallon of SAF produced. While the future of that policy remains unconfirmed, the EU is also issuing billions of euros in carbon allowances to help reduce the unit price of SAF.

The cost and complexity of testing is often cited as a significant barrier to new fuels entering the market. To help overcome this and, thus, make the UK more attractive to overseas investors, the UK DfT has provided £700,000 for the establishment of a SAF Clearing House. Opened in April 2024 as a central hub providing cross-industry support for SAF development, testing, certification and production, the facility aims to co-ordinate the approval process.

Through its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Innovation Programme, Innovate UK (IUK) is among the groups aiming to advance the UK SAF supply chain. Analysis by IUK shows that, by June 2024, £14.7bn had been invested in SAF development around the world. The UK ranks fourth in the world for SAF investment, with nine companies receiving overseas private investment from financiers. The road to net zero was never going to be quick or easy, but aerospace sector experts say one of the biggest hurdles to the production of sufficient SAF to meet demand is actually a lack of low-carbon power. The production of hydrogen is incredibly power intensive and the manufacture of sustainable fuel is equally hungry. In its Net Zero Carbon Road Map, experts at the Sustainable Aviation group estimate that the sector will require an additional 147TWh of additional renewable energy to achieve its contribution to net zero by 2050 (that is roughly half the entire UK’s current electricity consumption). It suggests that future hydrogen/electric aircraft will require 63TWh, SAF manufacture will require 50TWh and carbon removal technologies will need a further 34TWh.

Britain has the potential to be a major player in the global SAF market. If all of the projects funded by AFF grants come to fruition, the UK would have the capability to produce more than 1bn litres of sustainable fuel each year. Around 65% of the carbon reductions necessary to meet net zero 2050 targets are estimated to come from using SAF. The opportunities are many – let’s not waste them.

However, the hydrogen economy remains far from mature.

The economic feasibility and sustainable production of hydrogen fuel have yet to be ironed out, meaning the energy source is taking far longer to scale than was initially anticipated.

Business leaders and industry experts are being forced recalibrate their expectations, with much work to be done on actual implementation as the market edges from theory into application.

The decarbonising power of hydrogen

The trajectory of the hydrogen production industry has evolved in recent years.

The sector saw a sharp decrease in new project announcements in 2024, dropping by over 80% worldwide.

This pull-back represents a moderation from earlier ambitious projections as industry players refocus on effectively advancing existing projects and capital commitments.

""Decarbonising refinery fuel is essential and low-carbon hydrogen provides a clear pathway,"" said Eugenia Belloni Pocorob, bp's Lead H2 and CC(U)S for the Netherlands, during her speech at StocExpo 2025.

""The technical and financial challenges remain substantial, but the opportunity for emissions reduction is undeniable.""

The transport sector sees hydrogen's promise too.

Amit Rao, Principal Consultant at S&P Global, highlights hydrogen's long-established industrial uses and its burgeoning appeal in the aviation sector.

""We are seeing airline manufacturers investigating pure hydrogen solutions beyond sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),"" he notes.

""It may seem far-fetched now, but technological advances happen rapidly.""

However, the substantial cost linked with hydrogen projects, including Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), is particularly challenging.

""The scale of capital required for CCS projects is enormous,"" Amit explains.

""We have already seen major industry players reconsider their green commitments. The question is: where will the funding come from, and who will drive the transition?""

Traditional investment frameworks are also under scrutiny as investors typically favour shorter payback periods.

""The appetite for quick returns does not align with the realities of hydrogen investment,"" says Eugenia. ""We need a different type of investor - one willing to take a long-term view.""

Government policy has crucially bolstered early-stage projects in the UK, setting up competition frameworks that enhance the entire value chain's alignment.

""By aligning the entire value chain, these initiatives have made projects more viable,"" explains Matt Wilson, Head of New Energy Markets at Navigator Terminals.

""Future developments will build on this foundation.""

How geopolitics is impacting hydrogen strategies worldwide

Worldwide political landscapes significantly shape the course of hydrogen investment and project advancement.

Potential adjustments in US policy and increased trade conflicts could profoundly influence the sector.

""We need to wait out the Trump presidency to gain clarity on the long-term outlook,"" Amit says.

""Over the next four years, we are likely to see renewed trade conflicts—not just with China but across the board.""

In Europe, the redirection of funds towards defence could reshape priorities within the energy transition, potentially sidelining budgets meant for hydrogen projects.

""If governments allocate 3% or more of GDP to defence, other sectors will inevitably face budgetary constraints,"" says Amit.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/05a8f5757f43b72be62524f8b54cdaa0:4b36d662d01525769cdc0790d6a48110/gettyimages-2152072696.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 08:51:20.556897

A significant step forward is the agreement between the European Union (EU) and the South African government to initiate talks on establishing a 'Clean Trade and Investment Partnership.' This partnership aims to advance South Africa's energy transition by supporting sustainable aviation fuel development at Sasol's Secunda Operations, with the EU as a key export market.

This collaboration underscores the immense potential of Sasol’s South African assets to deliver sustainable energy and chemical products worldwide. The joint declaration emphasizes the urgency of advancing this partnership, stating: “This partnership must deliver short- and long-term solutions without delay to enable Sasol to export sustainable fuel, particularly aviation fuel, to the EU. This includes addressing compliance and regulatory issues. The EU further commits to supporting Sasol’s long-term decarbonisation efforts, especially at Secunda, thereby contributing to a Just Energy Transition.”

Sasol has also expressed optimism regarding South Africa's 2025 Budget Review, published by National Treasury on 12 March 2025. The budget outlines promising policy changes, particularly regarding the carbon tax framework, which aligns with South Africa's broader energy transition objectives. While these updates are subject to parliamentary approval, the adjustments indicate positive momentum for sustainable growth.

Key highlights of the carbon tax revisions include:

Retaining the basic tax-free allowance at 60% until at least 2030. This change deviates from the previously planned annual reductions starting in 2026 outlined in the Phase 2 Carbon Tax discussion paper.

Increasing the allowance for carbon offsets.

Extending energy efficiency incentives under the 12L rebate until 2030.

Maintaining the basic tax-free allowance for hard-to-abate sectors offers crucial flexibility for businesses to invest in their energy transition efforts. The expanded credit for carbon offsets is also seen as a vital step to foster growth in this emerging market within South Africa. Together, these policy measures are designed to stimulate substantial investments in South Africa’s energy transition, ultimately strengthening energy security, economic growth, and job creation.

“While we continue advancing our strategic goals, I am encouraged by these recent policy developments from the South African government and the EU,” said Simon Baloyi, President and CEO of Sasol. “This progress highlights the strong relationship between the two regions and represents a significant milestone in securing South Africa's sustainable, low-carbon energy future.

Although optimism about hydrogen’s role in driving decarbonisation continues to soar, the sector grapples with formidable obstacles in scaling operations and attaining cost-effectiveness.

Key stakeholders and thought leaders are recalibrating their outlooks, prioritising practical implementation as the market transitions from ambition to tangible progress.

Hydrogen's role in the green transition

The hydrogen industry is moving from an era of heightened enthusiasm to a more grounded approach.

Throughout 2024, announcements of new initiatives plummeted by more than 80% worldwide, with manufacturers retracting previous pledges.

Nevertheless, the outlook for the future suggests a pivot towards implementation and concrete advancements on current ventures and capital allocations.“Decarbonising refinery fuel is essential and low-carbon hydrogen provides a clear pathway,” Eugenia Belloni Pocorob, Lead H2 and CC(U)S for the Netherlands at bp, said at StocExpo 2025.

“The technical and financial challenges remain substantial, but the opportunity for emissions reduction is undeniable.”

Moreover, the transport sector is taking strides in incorporating hydrogen.

With its established role in industrial applications and budding interest from the aviation sector, hydrogen's breadth of impact continues to expand.

""We are seeing airline manufacturers investigating pure hydrogen solutions beyond sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),"" says Amit Rao, Principal Consultant at S&P Global.

“It may seem far-fetched now, but technological advances happen rapidly.”

Despite the benefits it can bring, the high cost of hydrogen projects, as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is a weighty challenge.

“The scale of capital required for CCS projects is enormous,” Rao says.

“We have already seen major industry players reconsider their green commitments. The question is: where will the funding come from, and who will drive the transition?”

Funding these ventures remains a considerable challenge.

The mismatch between the demand for swift financial returns and the long-term nature of hydrogen investments is pivotal.

Eugenia says: “The appetite for quick returns does not align with the realities of hydrogen investment. We need a different type of investor — one willing to take a long-term view.”

As well as this, government interventions in places like the UK have also been instrumental, providing competition frameworks that help align stakeholders and de-risk investments, making projects more feasible.

“By aligning the entire value chain, these initiatives have made projects more viable,” shares Matt Wilson, Head of New Energy Markets at Navigator Terminals.

“Future developments will build on this foundation.”

The impact of global politics and economic shifts

The play of geopolitical forces looms large over hydrogen’s future.

Shifts in US policy and potential trade conflicts could ripple through the sector, influencing investment directions and international cooperation.

Meanwhile, Europe faces its challenges with potential increases in defence spending which could pivot financial priorities away from energy initiatives.Amit warns that shifts in US policy could have far-reaching consequences.

“We need to wait out the Trump presidency to gain clarity on the long-term outlook,” he says.

“Over the next four years, we are likely to see renewed trade conflicts — not just with China, but across the board.

“The US is moving towards decoupling from global markets, which will have profound implications for European industry.”

The European commitment to defence spending, may change energy transition priorities.

Amit continues: “If governments allocate 3% or more of GDP to defence, other sectors will inevitably face budgetary constraints.”

Navigating the future

Despite the obstacles, there lies a guarded optimism within the hydrogen industry.

The number of projects may have diminished, but the maturing market and ongoing construction of previous commitments mark significant progress.

“We may have gone from 30 projects to fewer than five, but the fact that some are now moving into construction is significant,” Eugenia says.

“The energy transition is not just theoretical — we are starting to see real implementation.”Matt adds: “The projects we have in place are gaining traction.

By automating cooking oil management, operators can create a safer workplace for employees who can continue to work without having to worry about managing hot cooking oil—one of the most dangerous jobs in commercial kitchens.
“By reducing risks that come with manual cooking oil management, foodservice operators can further protect their bottom line by potentially reducing insurance premiums,” Cheng explained.
According to Trinity’s Director of Operations Mike Dole, they have had zero workers’ compensation claims since implementing the automated cooking oil management solution.
Total Oil Management’s customer portal also helps manage cooking oil to ensure efficient use of the system.","As owner and operator of 60 Zaxby’s restaurant locations across eight states, 1788 Chicken knows an important secret that is key to the taste of the restaurant’s famous fried chicken fingers.

“Having good quality oil in our fryers at all times is imperative,” said J. Cody Neal, vice president of operations for 1788 Chicken. “Otherwise, the chicken fingers that we put out just don’t taste like our chicken fingers.”

Despite the company’s standard operating procedures, Neal and his team had trouble determining whether all employees across the 60 locations were properly filtering and changing each restaurant’s oil. On top of that, changing out the oil was a difficult process that involved manually emptying hot oil into caddies, which were then carried through the back of the restaurants to a dumpster where it was poured into a grease trap. Then, the fryers had to be manually refilled with fresh oil poured from large jugs. The entire process opened the door to the industry’s two top safety risks: slip-and-fall accidents and burns.

After searching for a solution to the problem, Neal came across Restaurant Technologies‘ automated Total Oil Management solution, which allows employees to fill fryers with oil with just the push of a button, eliminating the need for manual handling. Additionally, oil is delivered in bulk to external holding tanks, reducing costs, improving maintenance and eliminating safety risks.

“Being able to simplify operations for the back-of-house was the biggest reason I wanted to make the switch,” Neal said. “It would be a relief to no longer worry about our people hauling oil across our kitchens or the risk of a caddy spilling and creating an unsafe and unsanitary mess.”

The move has also helped 1788 Chicken reduce its oil costs by .3% which, across 60 restaurant locations, resulted in annual savings of more than $500,000.

“With all of the moving parts in restaurants, the Total Oil Management solution can offer peace of mind during meal rushes that can sometimes be chaotic,” said David Cheng, public relations manager for Restaurant Technologies.

According to OSHA and various leading food safety organizations, two of the top safety concerns for foodservice operators are slip-and-fall accidents, along with burns–oil-related or otherwise, Cheng said.

The Total Oil Management solution addresses these concerns by significantly reducing oil spills that can lead to slip-and-fall accidents, and it can also significantly reduce oil burns by automating one of the dirtiest jobs in the kitchen.

By automating cooking oil management, operators can create a safer workplace for employees who can continue to work without having to worry about managing hot cooking oil—one of the most dangerous jobs in commercial kitchens. In turn, managers are given the peace of mind that employees will be available to work and can focus on more important tasks such as customer service.

“By reducing risks that come with manual cooking oil management, foodservice operators can further protect their bottom line by potentially reducing insurance premiums,” Cheng explained. “In short, it creates a more efficient kitchen and can also reduce costs long term.”

Trinity Corporation has also employed the technology at the seven Burger King locations it operates across Southeast Kentucky. According to Trinity’s Director of Operations Mike Dole, they have had zero workers’ compensation claims since implementing the automated cooking oil management solution.

Total Oil Management’s customer portal also helps manage cooking oil to ensure efficient use of the system.

“Instead of having to set a schedule every week, the portal provides valuable insights to help operators understand when the best time to filter and replace oil is,” Cheng explained. “Then, you’re not getting rid of fresh oil in case it’s a slower week or overusing oil that could hurt food quality in case it’s busier. It’s simply more efficient.”

As a result of those insights, since switching to the solution, Trinity Corp. has increased profits by 8% and reduced its cost of goods by 6%, saving about $300 each month on oil at each location.

“With improved visibility and better adherence to the filtration schedule, we’re easily getting an extra two days out of our oil, per fryer,” Dole said. “Getting notifications for issues like oil usage and being able to review how long employees filter the oil in the fryers helps us pinpoint where we can provide more training and development.”

This follows the recent publication of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology which includes specific accounting rules and practices on how to include SAF in per-passenger CO2 data. Initially, CO2 Connect will apply equal per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. In future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added.

“Corporations and individual travelers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they have invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President Commercial Products and Services.

Growing Number of CO2 Connect Participants

IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, directly contributed by airlines. This approach contrasts with other calculators that primarily rely on modeled averages. With the recent inclusion of Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas and Royal Air Maroc, some 60 airlines are now contributing data to CO2 Connect. With each new airline participant, the accuracy and transparency of IATA CO2 Connect’s calculations improves—for individual travelers and corporates.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonization powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.

I’ll start by pointing out four ways that Canada’s Aviation Plan keeps fossil jet fuel both cheap and dirty.
Canada’s Aviation Plan exempts all jet fuel from federal Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR).
It’s hard for me to imagine how a government could greenlight fossil jet fuel burning more than this.","Shooting up

Let’s start by looking at the dizzying rise in jet emissions.

My first chart shows jet fuel burning since 1990. To illustrate the long-term trend, I've focused on the decade waypoints of 2005, 2015 and 2025.

That soaring black line is the amount of fossil jet fuel burned each year. The CO2 emitted is listed below in brown text. The amount of “sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF) used is shown by blue frosting sitting on top of that fossil fuel line. It's so little that it is essentially invisible at this scale.

Way back in 1990, governments knew that fossil fuel CO2 was overheating our planet. Many nations, including Canada, were promising to emit less. Back then, the global aviation industry emitted nearly half a billion tonnes of CO2 each year from burning 190 billion litres of fossil jet fuel.

Instead of reducing their climate damage, the industry ramped it up. Last year, airlines burned more than a billion liters of fossil jet fuel per day for the first time ever. That record fossil fuel burn dumped 970 MtCO2 into our atmosphere – double the industry’s rate in 1990.

This year, the aviation industry expects airlines to burn much more – in excess of 400 billion litres. That will break another aviation record by emitting more than one billion tonnes of CO2 in a single year.

What will stop this industry’s climate damage from soaring ever higher?

Certainly not a global recession like the one in 2009. And not even a worldwide pandemic lockdown, like humanity went through in 2020. Both caused jet fuel burning to dip temporarily. But I’ve left these speedbumps off my chart because the long-term trend blew right past them, full throttle. This relentlessly rising CO2 trend is driven by the industry’s multi-decade push to maximize growth in flights – which requires burning ever more jet fuel at the lowest possible cost.

SAF to the rescue?

The aviation industry says the only viable way to lower their climate pollution is by switching to “sustainable aviation fuels” (SAF). And they have a plan to switch. Or more accurately, a series of plans. My next chart shows how it started, and how it’s going.

The industry’s “Plan A” rolled out back in 2007. They set a target of ten percent SAF use in ten years.

You can see what success would have looked like on this next chart. The SAF goal is shown by that blue triangle labeled “Plan A”. But also look at the dotted line below it. That’s the amount of fossil jet fuel burning under the plan. Even if successful, the CO2 from fossil jet fuel burning would have kept rising at the same rate it had been – increasing by another three billion litres each year.

“Plan A” failed spectacularly because airlines ended up buying trivial amounts of SAF – one hundredth of one percent of their fuel use in 2017. Meanwhile, airlines increased their fossil jet fuel purchases a thousand times more.

“Plan B” rolled out the next year. Industry trimmed its target to just two percent SAF, and not until 2025. That’s shown on the chart as well, but this time the goal -- shown by a blue SAF triangle -- is so tiny that it’s hard to see. And notice in particular the dotted black line below it. This shows that Plan B allows the CO2 from fossil jet fuel burning to surge twice as fast as under Plan A.

In the end, airlines haven’t even been able to clear Plan B's low bar. The industry now forecasts SAF purchases this year will remain well below one percent of jet fuel purchases.

Actual SAF purchases are insignificant at the scale of these charts. While that is a problem, it is important to remember that climate progress isn’t measured by SAF use. It’s measured by how much CO2 is being added to the atmosphere.

As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states clearly: ""every tonne of CO₂ emissions adds to global warming.""

And these charts show that airlines now emit one and a half times as much CO2 each year as they did back in 2007 -- at the start of their SAF “Plan A”. That's rocketing away from climate safety.

Why are airlines bingeing on fossil fuels, instead of SAF?

Because bingeing on climate-damaging fuel is cheaper and no one is stopping them. In fact, most governments are greenlighting it through fossil fuel subsidies and exemptions.

Canada’s Action Plan

For a down home example of how governments are green lighting fossil jet fuel burning, let’s look at Canada’s Aviation Climate Action Plan 2022-2030.

I’ll start by pointing out four ways that Canada’s Aviation Plan keeps fossil jet fuel both cheap and dirty.

Pollution pricing. Canada’s Aviation Plan exempts most jet fuel from our national climate pollution fee (aka carbon tax). Earthbound travelers are charged $80 to emit each tonne of CO2 while jet-setters are allowed to pollute for free.

Carbon intensity. Canada’s Aviation Plan exempts all jet fuel from federal Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR). These regulations require other fuels to reduce their life-cycle carbon intensity over time. But Canada allows airlines to buy jet fuel that keeps getting dirtier over time. In fact, jet fuel in Canada is among the most carbon intensive in the world.

Most warming is ignored. Canada’s Aviation Plan acknowledges the science showing that two-thirds of the global warming to date that is caused by jet fuel comes from non-CO2 emissions.

These emissions include nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter and water vapor. The biggest warming impact from these comes when they combine to form contrails and cirrus clouds.

Canada’s policies, however, ignore 90 per cent of this warming. Only the CO2 emitted by domestic flights gets listed on Canada’s books or covered by Canada’s climate targets. That’s just ten percent of the total as shown on my chart above.

No limits on CO2. Canada’s Aviation Plan places no limit, or “cap”, on fossil jet fuel burning nor on the amount of CO2 the aviation industry can emit.

Cheap, dirty and unlimited. It’s hard for me to imagine how a government could greenlight fossil jet fuel burning more than this. Well … unless they were actively subsidizing fossil fuel production as well.

What about the solution – switching to SAF?

No SAF mandates. Canada’s Aviation Plan says SAF is “the only feasible alternative to using fossil-based jet fuel … the key pathway to achieving meaningful emissions reductions by 2050.” Clearly, getting SAF sales off the ground is important. To nudge that along, some nations now mandate minimum amounts of SAF. Canada does not. Instead, Canada’s Aviation Plan proposes an “aspirational goal” of 10 percent SAF by 2030.

No SAF production. Canada’s Aviation Plan says there is no meaningful amount of SAF produced in our nation because SAF currently costs airlines two to five times what they pay for fossil jet fuel. Airlines can buy all the cheaper fossil jet fuel they want. So they aren’t racing to pay more: “Canadian air carriers will signal SAF demand with offtake agreements, as appropriate and financially sound.”

The failure to build SAF refineries isn’t just a Canadian problem. A recent report, 2025 Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Report, says globally “the next 2-3 years will be crucial for scaling up SAF production, with approximately €1 trillion (CDN$1.5 trillion) in capital expenditure needed to establish 450-950 new production sites by 2030.” However, “the reluctance of infrastructure investors to commit to SAF projects stems from uncertainty regarding the business case.” That’s biz-speak for nobody in their right mind will spend a trillion dollars to make a product they can’t sell.

If SAF is the only solution, then someone needs to pay for it.

Paying for SAF with higher ticket prices.

Can jet travelers afford to pay for SAF?

Remember “Plan A” above that aimed for ten percent SAF? Or Canada’s current goal of ten percent SAF by 2030? Well, the World Economic Forum (WEF) calculated what this would cost jet travelers, and it turns out to be not very much: “a SAF premium of 2-3x and a blend of 10% SAF would see the price of a ticket increase by ~3-6%.”

My next chart illustrates this scenario.

The bar on the left of the chart shows the baseline ticket price for a typical flight today that burns fossil jet fuel only.

The non-fuel component of ticket pricing is shown by gold coins, while the cost of fossil jet fuel is shown by the silver coins.

Currently, fossil jet fuel accounts for between one sixth and one third of ticket prices. The WEF scenario assumes 30 percent, which is what I use on my chart.

The blue coins show the cost to replace ten percent of jet fuel with SAF. For example, in the middle scenario, SAF costs three times (3x) as much as fossil jet fuel. That would increase ticket prices by around six percent.

That's apparently too high a price to pay.

What do you think?

The richest one percent.

Studies show that the richest one percent of humanity is responsible for half the world’s aviation emissions. Recently, these wealthy jet-setters have been opening their wallets to fund a surge in expensive flight luxuries, from premium class seating, to private jets and ultra-exclusive airport clubs.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) recommends adding a CO2 tax to jet fuel is ""critical to more equitably reflect the climate impacts of air travel"". And argues: ""since frequent flyers likely account for half of all aviation emissions, progressive tax rates that increase with flight frequency, as well as higher taxes on premium class tickets, could discourage excessive flying or raise funding for investments in SAF production.""

Can the frequent fliers afford it? To illustrate how much wealthy flyers are spending on pure luxury jet fuel today, take a look at my next chart. It shows the fuel costs for seats in premium class.

According to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), the average premium class seat requires around four times more jet fuel than flying economy.

That luxury requires paying four times more for fuel – while also emitting four times more CO2.

First-class luxury can burn nine times more jet fuel – and emit nine times more CO2. That can rise to 14 times more per person for the ultra-luxury of a high-end suite.

By offering these luxury classes, airlines are actively encouraging their customers to burn many times more fossil jet fuel and emit many times more CO2. In fact, the more you end up burning and emitting the more royally they treat you. Pollute enough and you might be handed a glass of champagne as a thank-you.

But there is one luxury I’ve never seen airlines offer – flying without dumping fossil fuel CO2 in your wake. Airlines could easily do this by offering customers SAF certificates that cover 100 percent of that person's fuel. And it would likely cost passengers a lot less than it does to stretch their legs in premium class.

I would certainly pay for fossil-free luxury.

Then again, I’ve been boycotting fossil-fueled jet travel for two decades now. And, sadly, my expectations of this industry keep falling lower as its emissions keep soaring higher. So, I have net-zero faith that airlines will enable climate-safe solutions for their customers in time -- unless they are forced to.

In the meantime, the climate damage from the commercial airline industry will keep taking off...",https://www.nationalobserver.com/sites/default/files/img/2019/12/18/flightradar24.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 06:50:19.140706

Sustainable Aviation Survey

The World Economic Forum conducts a survey of 30 aviation industry executives worldwide to understand their attitudes towards sustainable aviation development. More than two-thirds of the respondents believe that decarbonization in the aviation industry will continue, with the development of sustainable aviation fuel being the main driving factor. The global production of sustainable aviation fuel has doubled in the past two years and is expected to continue doubling this year. The European Union, the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions have developed roadmaps for the application of sustainable aviation fuel.

More than 70% of respondents are optimistic about the decarbonization targets set by the International Civil Aviation Organization for 2030. The COP29 conference held many activities related to the aviation industry, clarifying the rules for the application of carbon credits in the aviation industry to avoid double counting in Nationally Determined Contributions. Some respondents believe that jurisdictions can add mid-term targets on top of the 2030 and 2050 goals to measure carbon reduction effectiveness.

Sustainable Risks in Aviation Industry

Respondents rank the risks facing decarbonization in the aviation industry and identify the following three types of sustainable risks:

Technical risk

Availability and cost of SAF: Ranks first. The price and availability of fuel are the most concerning factors for respondents, and since 2022, the number of fuel related agreements has been decreasing. Due to limited current fuel production technology, although future production continues to increase, fuel costs will put pressure on operations in the short term.

Availability and cost of green electricity, hydrogen and infrastructure: Ranks sixth. Green hydrogen energy is an important factor in decarbonizing aviation, a raw material for sustainable aviation fuel, and may provide power for infrastructure. The respondents believe that the uncertainty of regulatory policies may lead to lower-than-expected levels of hydrogen production, and the cost-effectiveness of deploying hydrogen energy still needs to be considered.

Availability of hydrogen and battery-electric aircraft: Ranks seventh. Zero carbon aircraft powered by hydrogen energy are currently under development, but many aircraft manufacturers have encountered difficulties in funding preparation and technological research, which has slowed down the pace of this research.

Availability of carbon dioxide removals and out-of-sector carbon offsets: Ranks tenth. Carbon removal and carbon offset technologies compete with sustainable aviation fuels, and the cost of dealing with additional carbon emissions is usually higher than the cost of reducing carbon emissions at the source.

Policy risk

Alignment of SAF policy across regions and longevity of subsidies: Ranks second. Multiple jurisdictions around the world have developed sustainable aviation fuel policies, but there are differences in their standards and goals. Insufficient supply of raw materials in the short term may result in some jurisdictions being unable to achieve their goals.

Implementation of CORSIA and Effectiveness of carbon pricing and emissions trading schemes: Ranks third and fifth. 129 jurisdictions have joined the carbon offset plan, but airlines have limited ability to purchase carbon credits and are also required to comply with the carbon offset plan and local carbon emission trading system, which may slow down the implementation of the plan.

Geographical concentration of resources: Ranks eighth. The production of sustainable aviation fuel is highly dependent on biological raw materials, and developed economies typically import raw materials from developing economies. These trade activities may be influenced by factors such as policies and markets.

Sustainable risk

Traceability of sustainability criteria for SAF feedstocks: Ranks fourth. The raw material audit for sustainable aviation fuel will continue to strengthen, and the cost of using biological raw materials will increase, leading to an increase in fuel costs.

Greenwashing and consumer skepticism: Ranks ninth. Some jurisdictions believe that the use and promotion of sustainable aviation fuels may lead to greenwashing.

While enthusiasm for hydrogen’s potential in decarbonisation remains high, the industry faces significant challenges in scaling up and achieving economic viability.

Industry leaders and experts are reassessing expectations and focusing on execution as the market shifts from hype to reality.

What is hydrogen’s role in decarbonisation?

The hydrogen sector is transitioning from a period of peak optimism to a more pragmatic phase.

In 2024, new project announcements declined by more than 80% globally, with producers scaling back earlier commitments.

Looking ahead however, the focus is expected to shift towards execution and tangible progress on existing projects and investments.

“Decarbonising refinery fuel is essential and low-carbon hydrogen provides a clear pathway,” Eugenia Belloni Pocorob, Lead H2 and CC(U)S for the Netherlands at bp, said at StocExpo 2025.

“We are seeing airline manufacturers investigating pure hydrogen solutions beyond sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” he says.

“It may seem far-fetched now, but technological advances happen rapidly.”

Despite the benefits it can bring, the high cost of hydrogen projects, as well as carbon capture and storage (CCS), is a weighty challenge.

“The scale of capital required for CCS projects is enormous,” Amit says.

“We have already seen major industry players reconsider their green commitments. The question is: where will the funding come from, and who will drive the transition?”

Traditional investors are also hesitant to engage in projects with long payback periods, creating a need for investors willing to take a long-term view.

Eugenia says: “The appetite for quick returns does not align with the realities of hydrogen investment. We need a different type of investor — one willing to take a long-term view.”

On top of this, intervention from governments has played a decisive role in advancing early-stage projects.

In the UK, government-backed competition frameworks have helped de-risk investments by aligning the entire value chain.

“By aligning the entire value chain, these initiatives have made projects more viable,” shares Matt Wilson, Head of New Energy Markets at Navigator Terminals.

“We need to wait out the Trump presidency to gain clarity on the long-term outlook,” he says.

“Over the next four years, we are likely to see renewed trade conflicts — not just with China, but across the board.

“The US is moving towards decoupling from global markets, which will have profound implications for European industry.”

Rising defence spending in Europe could also reshape energy transition priorities.

Amit continues: “If governments allocate 3% or more of GDP to defence, other sectors will inevitably face budgetary constraints.”

Market adjustments and cautious optimism

Despite challenges, there's cautious optimism in the industry.

While the number of hydrogen projects has declined, awareness and momentum have grown, Eugenia points out.

“We may have gone from 30 projects to fewer than five, but the fact that some are now moving into construction is significant,” she says.

“The energy transition is not just theoretical — we are starting to see real implementation.”

Matt adds: “The projects we have in place are gaining traction. The policy framework is set, and the risk profile has improved.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/05a8f5757f43b72be62524f8b54cdaa0:4b36d662d01525769cdc0790d6a48110/gettyimages-2152072696.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 06:50:22.712516

As global pressure mounts to cut emissions, Asia is ramping up its SAF production—often outpacing local demand. With new projects coming online and exports on the horizon, this surplus could ultimately drive down prices, offering much-needed relief to airlines struggling with the high costs of greener fuel.

Rising Production: A Surplus on the Horizon

Expanding Capacity

Recent forecasts from Argus Consulting suggest that the Asia-Pacific region's SAF production capacity is set to hit 3.5 million metric tons per year by the end of 2025—a significant jump from 1.24 million tons in 2024. This dramatic expansion is fueled by at least five projects outside China that are scheduled to start production this year, targeting markets both regionally and in Europe.

A Production Boom Meets Tepid Demand

While production is surging, regional demand remains relatively weak. Unlike Europe—with its stringent mandate requiring 2% SAF for flights departing from EU and UK airports—Asia’s policy-driven demand is still in its infancy. In many Asian markets, mandated use of SAF will not come into effect until later this decade, allowing production capacity to build up faster than domestic consumption.

Export Opportunities and Price Implications

Fueling the Global Market

The current scenario could turn into a golden opportunity for airlines worldwide. As Asia's SAF production outpaces local demand, surplus fuel is expected to be exported, particularly to markets with higher mandated usage. Increased competition and higher volumes could potentially lower prices—a welcome change for airlines that have long decried SAF's cost and accessibility.

Price Pressure and Profitability Concerns

Despite the promise of lower prices, the situation isn’t entirely rosy. Industry insiders warn that if prices drop below production costs, some planned SAF projects might face financial difficulties. “Asian airlines are still more focused on ramping up flights, and SAF is not a top priority given it is still costlier than jet fuel,” noted Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.

Policy Mandates and Market Dynamics

A Patchwork of Regulations

In Asia, policy guidance on SAF is far from uniform. For instance, while Singapore and Thailand are set to enforce a 1% SAF mandate by 2026—potentially lifting demand to about 14% of production capacity—the rest of the region lags behind. South Korea will start its 1% mandate in 2027, and Japan aims for a 10% target by 2030. Meanwhile, China’s SAF projects have seen delays due to low consumption and the absence of clear regulatory directives.

The Tug-of-War Between Sustainability and Profit

Globally, aviation accounted for 2.5% of carbon emissions in 2023, and SAF (derived from waste oil and biomass) holds promise for a greener future. However, with only 0.3% of global jet fuel production coming from SAF last year—and global output reaching just 1 million tons against forecasts of 1.5 million—it's clear that the industry is still struggling to balance sustainability with economic viability.

Looking Ahead: Greener Skies or a Price Plunge?

Balancing Act for the Industry

Asia’s SAF journey is at a crossroads. On one side lies the potential for a greener aviation future, with expanded production capacity and competitive export opportunities. On the other, a mismatch between production and domestic demand—and the risk of prices falling below profitable levels—could stall some projects. With airlines like Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific already integrating SAF into their operations and others like Air New Zealand recalibrating their targets, the coming years will be pivotal in shaping the industry's trajectory.

Engage and Share Your Thoughts

The unfolding story of Asia’s SAF boom invites questions and sparks debate. Will the surplus production drive a global shift toward greener skies, or will economic pressures force a recalibration of ambitions? Share your thoughts and join the conversation as we track this dynamic evolution in sustainable aviation fuel.

With production capacity set to soar and policy mandates gradually coming into play, Asia’s SAF market is one to watch—where soaring ambitions meet the realities of economic and regulatory challenges, all under the quest for a greener future.

With Inputs from Reuters

In an era marked by shifting economic winds and mounting uncertainty, U.S. airlines are dramatically revising their forecasts and strategies. Recent announcements—from Delta to United, American to Southwest—highlight a notable retreat in earnings estimates as the industry braces for a challenging journey ahead.

Economic Headwinds and Corporate Caution

Economic indicators have recently taken a hit. With consumer and business confidence weakened by the fallout from tariffs and rising prices, airlines are preparing for the worst. The Atlanta Federal Reserve’s closely watched GDPNow tracker even suggests that the U.S. economy could shrink in the first quarter. This broader economic slowdown has led companies to cut back on corporate travel, while consumers are tightening their belts—factors that directly impact travel spending.

""Economic uncertainty is a big deal,"" remarked American Airlines CEO Robert Isom during a recent JPMorgan industry conference.

Strategic Shifts in an Uncertain Market

Airlines are not standing still. Each carrier is taking proactive measures to navigate these choppy skies:

Capacity Reduction: To avoid a wave of discounting and preserve margins, carriers plan to reduce capacity after the summer travel peak. For instance, American Airlines is trimming its presence in the lucrative Washington market due to a decline in government-related bookings.

Booking Strategy Overhaul: Delta has revamped its booking approach to better manage the softer domestic demand, while United Airlines is reducing capacity on government and transborder routes, even canceling overnight flights.

Cost-Cutting Measures: United is accelerating the retirement of 21 aircraft to save on maintenance costs—an aggressive move to streamline operations in a tough market.

A Contrast to Recent Optimism

Just a month ago, limited capacity and robust consumer demand had sparked talk of a multi-year profit boom. Today, the narrative has reversed. The ripple effects of diminished government spending and the cautious approach by corporate and leisure travelers have forced carriers like Southwest and United to downgrade their first-quarter revenue forecasts, citing challenges from reduced government travel to the lingering effects of regional disruptions like the California wildfires.

Navigating Through Stormy Skies

While premium and long-haul international travel still show resilience—and falling fuel prices offer some relief—the domestic market continues to falter. Recent air crashes and unpredictable weather events have further dented travel demand, intensifying the sense of urgency among industry leaders.

""We're going to accelerate [our focus on comparative advantage] as we go through what looks like a tougher economic time ahead,"" stated United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.

Looking Ahead: Can Innovation Outpace the Downturn?

The coming months will be crucial. As airlines adjust their strategies, investors and analysts are closely watching whether these measures will safeguard profitability amid headwinds. Will strategic capacity cuts and a refined focus on high-value travel segments be enough to weather this economic storm? Or are we on the brink of a broader industry transformation?

In these uncertain times, one thing is clear: the U.S. airline industry is reconfiguring its flight path. With dynamic changes in strategy and operations, the sector is determined to navigate through the turbulence—and perhaps, emerge more resilient on the other side.

What do you think? Is this the beginning of a new era for air travel, or just a temporary bout of turbulence?

Air India Express is making headlines with a bold step in its evolution, igniting curiosity and excitement in the aviation world. In just over three years since privatization, the airline has not only doubled its fleet but also redefined its service offerings and market reach. Let’s dive into the vibrant story behind this transformative journey.

The 100th Aircraft Milestone

Air India Express has reached a landmark achievement by inducting its 100th aircraft—a modern, fuel-efficient Boeing 737-8 adorned with stunning ‘Chittara’ tail art. Inspired by Karnataka’s traditional mural painting, the design isn’t just an aesthetic marvel; it symbolizes a blend of heritage and modernity. Flagged off by Managing Director Aloke Singh at Bengaluru’s bustling Kempegowda International Airport, this milestone flight took off on the Bengaluru–Hindon route, marking another feather in the airline’s cap.

Sky-High Growth: Doubling the Fleet in Two Years

The pace of expansion is nothing short of remarkable. Since joining the Tata group in January 2022, Air India Express has grown from a modest fleet of 26 Boeing 737 NGs and 28 A320 aircraft to an impressive lineup of 100 aircraft. With plans to operate over 500 daily flights across 54 destinations in India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia by month-end, the airline is scaling new heights with an unmatched frequency and reach.

Innovative Routes and Expanding Horizons

Air India Express isn’t just increasing the number of flights—it’s revolutionizing its route network. By adding vibrant new destinations such as Bangkok, Dibrugarh, Dimapur, Hindon, Jammu, Patna, Phuket, and Port Blair (Sri Vijaya Puram), the airline is catering to an ever-growing and diverse traveler base. Notably, Hindon (Ghaziabad, Delhi NCR) now joins Bengaluru as a hub, making Air India Express the first and only airline to serve two airports in the National Capital Region. This strategic move is paving the way for more robust regional connectivity and catering to the emerging markets in tier 2 and tier 3 cities.

SpiceJet, one of India’s longstanding budget carriers with 19 years in the skies, is now facing a storm of legal and financial challenges. The airline finds itself at the center of multiple insolvency petitions, threatening to ground its ambitions amid mounting debts and disputes with creditors.

A Fresh Wave of Insolvency Petitions

The Legal Showdown Begins

Three Ireland-based aircraft lessors—NGF Alpha, NGF Genesis, and NGF Charlie—have stepped into the legal arena by filing insolvency pleas under Section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). These lessors claim dues totaling USD 12.68 million (approximately Rs 110 crore). The filings, now slated for a hearing on April 7, 2025, are a stark indicator of the mounting pressures on SpiceJet.

A Former Pilot Joins the Fray

Adding to the complexity, a former pilot has also filed an insolvency plea. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has taken notice and scheduled a separate hearing for this petition on April 15, 2025. The tribunal is currently examining whether the pilot’s claim might be barred by Section 10A of the IBC, a clause that restricts certain insolvency applications for defaults arising on or after March 25, 2020.

The Claims and Controversies

Allegations from the Lessors

The lessors allege that SpiceJet defaulted on payments related to the lease of five Boeing 737 aircraft. They have even raised serious claims involving the alleged theft of aircraft parts, including engines that were reportedly used in other planes. These allegations have only deepened the legal dispute, putting SpiceJet’s operational integrity under scrutiny.

Understanding Section 10A

Section 10A was introduced as a special provision to help companies navigate the post-lockdown economic revival. It prevents the initiation of a corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) for defaults incurred after March 25, 2020, for a period of one year. The ongoing discussions at the NCLT regarding the applicability of this section add another layer of complexity to SpiceJet’s predicament.

The Broader Implications for SpiceJet

A History of Legal Challenges

This is not the first time SpiceJet has found itself embroiled in legal disputes. The airline is already entangled in multiple insolvency cases involving other creditors such as vendors and additional lessors like Willis Lease, Aircastle Ireland Ltd, Wilmington, and Celestial Aviation. Despite these challenges, no final orders have been passed yet, leaving the airline in a state of limbo.

Financial Strains and the Road Ahead

The wave of insolvency petitions comes at a time when SpiceJet is already grappling with significant financial difficulties. With creditors turning to legal avenues to recover dues, the airline must navigate through these choppy waters. Settlement talks are reportedly underway, offering a glimmer of hope that a resolution might be on the horizon. However, the coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether SpiceJet can recalibrate its strategy and emerge stronger, or if the legal challenges will ground its journey permanently.

Conclusion: Turbulence or a Temporary Dip?

As SpiceJet faces an unprecedented legal storm, industry watchers and passengers alike are left wondering about the airline’s future. Will the carrier manage to resolve these disputes and regain its financial footing, or are these insolvency petitions the harbinger of a more troubled future? The upcoming NCLT hearings and ongoing settlement discussions will be critical in charting the next chapter in SpiceJet’s long flight history. One thing is certain—the coming weeks promise drama, legal intrigue, and high-stakes negotiations in the world of aviation finance.

SpiceJet’s story is a vivid reminder of how even long-established carriers are not immune to the complexities of modern financial and legal challenges. The outcome of these proceedings will not only impact the airline but could also set important precedents in the interpretation of insolvency laws in the aviation sector.",https://www.100knots.com/airlines_dashboard/uploads/blog/1742276999.webp,N,,2025-03-18 08:51:54.859767

(Chuo City, Tokyo Prefecture) succeeded in producing 100% biomass-derived sustainable aviation fuel (neat SAF). J-Oil produced this fuel by pressing and refining oils and fats from seeds of Calophyllum inophyllum and Pongamia pinnata, which are wild subtropical plants found in Okinawa Prefecture and other areas and are not suitable for food use, under the ""Demonstration Research for the Establishment and Expansion of a SAF Supply Chain Model Using Plant Oils and Fats without Competing with Food"" project. The neat SAF produced meets the international quality standard ""ASTM D7566 Annex A2.""

SAF is a sustainable jet fuel made from waste materials, and its use helps reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than the use of fossil fuels. There is a growing demand for a stable supply of SAF as a concrete measure to reduce CO2 emissions in the aviation industry. Japan has set a goal of replacing 10% (or 1.72 million kiloliters equivalent) of its jet fuel consumption with SAF by 2030. Currently, SAF made from waste cooking oil is expected to be the fastest to achieve successful large-scale production. However, NEDO estimates that the maximum amount of Japanese waste cooking oil available for fuel purposes is only 130,000 tons (about 140,000 kiloliters) per year, indicating the need to develop new oil and fat sources by 2030.

In this project, J-Oil used C. inophyllum and P. pinnata seeds that fell from roadside trees along Okinawa Prefecture-managed roads and developed an oil pressing and refining process suitable for them. Additionally, J-Oil commissioned Environment Energy (Fukuyama City, Hiroshima Prefecture) to perform hydrogenation, isomerization and distillation processes, and succeeded in producing neat SAF (100% pure jet fuel produced from biomass and other raw materials). The produced neat SAF was confirmed to meet the international quality standard ""ASTM D7566 Annex A2"" set by ASTM International, a private, non-profit organization in the United States that develops and certifies international standards.

In this NEDO project (August 2023 to March 2025), J-Oil focused on C. inophyllum and P. pinnata, which grow wild in Okinawa Prefecture. Leveraging the knowledge and techniques of oil extraction and refining developed through edible vegetable oil production, J-Oil has been working on a demonstration project to use these inedible plants as raw materials for SAF. Calophyllum inophyllum and P. pinnata are subtropical plants distributed across Southeast Asia and Okinawa Prefecture in Japan. In Okinawa, they are mainly used as roadside trees and windbreaks. Ovules of C. inophyllum and P. pinnata have high oil contents of 40%-50% and 30%-40%, respectively. These plants can be cultivated even on land unsuitable for farming, such as arid or high-salinity environments. In particular, these plants are expected to serve as new SAF feedstocks that do not compete with food production, as they have minimal competition with agricultural land and are generally not suitable for consumption.

Going forward, NEDO and J-Oil will collaborate with oil refiners and other companies with SAF conversion technology to achieve the goal of obtaining both fuel quality certification and environmental certification by registering as a CORSIA-eligible fuel under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

With the European Union’s Refuel Aviation Regulation and the UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Mandate taking effect, alongside a new administration in the United States, the global aviation sector faces evolving sustainability expectations.

Understanding the latest developments in aviation taxation, sustainable finance, emissions trading, and SAF mandates is essential for businesses navigating regulatory shifts. This article explores key updates and their potential implications for the aviation industry.

EU Taxonomy and Its Role in Aviation

The EU Taxonomy Regulation is a classification system that defines environmentally sustainable activities. Since January 2024, aviation-related activities—such as aircraft manufacturing, leasing, passenger and freight transport, and ground handling—have been included in the taxonomy.

However, the technical screening criteria determining compliance remain complex. In 2024, the EU clarified some of these criteria, particularly regarding:

Interpretation of sustainability criteria: The European Commission responded to legal challenges, confirming the validity of aviation’s inclusion in the taxonomy.

Global Replacement Ratio: A key metric introduced to ensure fleet expansion does not counter sustainability gains. As of November 2024, the EU Commission and EASA will publish this ratio annually.

The EU Taxonomy also interacts with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which mandates companies to disclose the percentage of their revenue aligned with sustainable activities. In February 2025, the EU introduced an Omnibus simplification package to streamline compliance, potentially delaying some reporting requirements.

These changes influence how aviation businesses demonstrate compliance with sustainability frameworks and access funding aligned with green finance initiatives.

Exploring a UK Green Taxonomy

The UK is considering developing its green taxonomy, with a consultation launched by the UK Treasury in November 2024. This follows a broader movement to channel finance into sustainable industries and ensure alignment with global frameworks, including the EU Taxonomy.

The outcome of this consultation will shape how aviation investments and sustainability-linked financing evolve in the UK. A clear and interoperable taxonomy for the aviation sector could unlock new transition financing mechanisms to support emissions reductions.

Transition Finance and Its Impact on Aviation

Transition finance is a critical factor in enabling aviation’s shift to lower-carbon operations. However, concerns around greenwashing have made financial institutions hesitant to invest in high-emitting industries.

The UK Transition Finance Market Review, published in October 2024, outlines best practices for financing sustainability-linked projects. Key recommendations include:

Principles-based transition finance: A structured approach to ensure financial products align with genuine emissions reduction goals.

New sustainability labels: The Loan Market Association (LMA) is exploring a “use of proceeds” label for financing projects with a sustainability focus.

Reporting obligations: Large corporations may need to publish transition plans detailing their decarbonization strategies.

While aviation remains a hard-to-abate industry, improving access to sustainability-linked financing could accelerate investment in low-emission aircraft, fuel alternatives, and operational efficiencies.

UK Consultation on CORSIA Implementation

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) continues to be adopted by participating countries, including the UK, EU, and the US. Under CORSIA, airlines must offset emissions that exceed baseline levels by purchasing Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) or using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The UK launched a consultation in December 2024 on implementing the second phase of CORSIA. Key discussion points include:

Aligning UK compliance with CORSIA standards to minimize regulatory discrepancies.

Incorporating non-CO2 emissions into future aviation emissions trading schemes.

Defining penalties for non-compliance, with potential fines of £100 per unmet EEU obligation.

One major debate is whether the UK should fully implement CORSIA or adopt a hybrid model that integrates it with the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS). A UK ETS-only approach would mirror the EU strategy, avoiding double compliance costs for airlines operating between Europe and the UK.

The final decision will impact airline operational costs, emissions offsetting strategies, and future regulatory alignments between the UK and international aviation standards.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Mandates and Compliance

SAF mandates are becoming a global regulatory tool for reducing aviation emissions. Different regions adopt varied approaches, from financial incentives to compulsory fuel blending targets.

EU SAF Regulations

The EU Refuel Aviation Regulation, effective January 2025, imposes minimum SAF blending requirements for fuel suppliers:

2% SAF blending from 2025-2029

6% SAF by 2030, with incremental increases thereafter

The regulation also includes:

A refueling obligation: Airlines must uplift at least 90% of their fuel needs at EU airports to prevent tankering practices.

A reporting requirement: Airlines and fuel suppliers must submit annual data on fuel purchases and blending ratios.

Additionally, the EU rejected a “book-and-claim” SAF trading system, meaning fuel must be physically supplied at EU airports rather than traded as credits.

UK SAF Mandate

The UK SAF Mandate, also effective January 2025, is even more ambitious than the EU standard, requiring:

2% SAF blending by 2025

10% SAF blending by 2030

Unlike the EU system, the UK mandate includes:

A buy-out mechanism: Fuel suppliers unable to meet SAF targets can pay a penalty per liter instead of purchasing SAF.

Tradeable SAF certificates: Fuel suppliers can trade SAF credits to meet compliance targets.

To support SAF adoption, the UK has also introduced a Guaranteed Strike Price scheme, which provides financial stability to SAF producers by ensuring a minimum price per liter. This scheme is expected to be implemented by the end of 2026.

While the US relies on tax incentives for SAF development, the UK and EU have taken a regulatory approach, which may influence global SAF policy trends.

Conclusion

The aviation sector is at a turning point, with new regulations and sustainability mandates reshaping how airlines operate and comply with environmental standards.

The EU and UK SAF mandates will drive significant shifts in fuel procurement and emissions reduction strategies.

Transition finance and green taxonomies will influence investment in sustainable aviation.

CORSIA and emissions trading adjustments will create new compliance challenges for airlines.

As the industry navigates these changes, collaboration between airlines, regulators, and sustainability consultants will be essential. With strategic adaptation and investment in cleaner aviation solutions, airlines can stay ahead in an increasingly sustainability-driven regulatory landscape.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-45-6-1024x576-1.png,N,,2025-03-18 07:50:26.861144

Responses to the March 2025 industry funding consultation process will be considered when drafting the provisions of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill to implement a revenue certainty mechanism and any subsequent regulations.","In January 2025 the UK government published its response to last year's consultation on the possible forms of a SAF revenue certainty mechanism, which confirmed the government's decision to implement a Guaranteed Strike Price (GSP) model to help attract the necessary long-term funding to support the SAF industry meet the demand generated by the UK SAF Mandate.

As anticipated in the government's January response, in March 2025, the UK government initiated a consultation to seek the views of stakeholders on how the revenue certainty mechanism will be funded. The government has proposed for the revenue certainty mechanism to be funded by industry, preferably by introducing a levy on jet fuel suppliers. In addition to reducing risk for SAF producers, the revenue certainty scheme aims to limit costs and protect consumers from significant cost increases.

This article explores how the GSP model works, why it was selected, the key considerations for its implementation, and how it is proposed that the revenue certainty mechanism will be funded.

How GSP works and why it was chosen

The GSP model provides revenue stability by ensuring SAF producers receive a fixed price per unit of fuel through private law contracts with a government-backed counterparty.

If the market price falls below the agreed strike price, the counterparty compensates the SAF producer for the difference.

If the market price rises above the strike price, the SAF producer repays the difference to the counterparty.

The GSP model was chosen as the preferred revenue certainty mechanism because, when compared to the possible alternatives, it was seen to provide the highest level of investor confidence with the private law contract with a government-backed counterparty protecting against potential policy changes and legislative uncertainty.

To implement the GSP model, the government aims to leverage the experience of contracts for difference (CfD) used in the renewable power sector which were first introduced over a decade ago. Although the existing CfD model will need to be adapted to cater for the differences between energy and fuels (such as the absence of a national grid), the government believes that the precedent set by CfD in the low-carbon energy sector demonstrates that the GSP model can (i) effectively attract investment, (ii) offer a clear and predictable claim process, and (iii) ensure fair risk-sharing, making it the most viable option for scaling UK SAF production.

GSP contract considerations

While the response identified the GSP as the government's preferred revenue certainty mechanism, key elements of how the mechanism will operate remain unclear.

Scope: In their response to the consultation stakeholders raised concerns about the scope of the GSP mechanism, including whether it should cover: (i) SAF produced in the UK but exported, (ii) hydrogen from the Hydrogen Production Business Model, and (iii) all production costs, including electricity and feedstocks.

Duration: Responses also questioned the appropriateness of the proposed 10-15 year contract length, suggesting that different durations based on technology type (such as nuclear-derived power-to-liquid (PtL) SAF) or dividing contracts into stages to support varying SAF volumes. Other concerns included contract flexibility, differential treatment for SAF technologies, feedstock supply, and incentives for competitive pricing.

Allocation Method: While the government sought feedback on the preferred method of allocating GSP contracts (such as through market-led proposals, tendering processes, competitive auctions), no strong preference was expressed in the responses to the consultation. However, many respondents suggested bilateral negotiations or a tendering process for early rounds, transitioning to competitive auctions as more projects enter the market. Some recommended grouping SAF technologies into separate categories based on costs and emissions. Concerns were raised about ineffective selection criteria allowing underdeveloped projects to bid. Standardised pricing received little support due to varying SAF production challenges.

The government acknowledged these complexities and said it will work with stakeholders to ensure a balanced approach that supports investment, affordability, and sustainability, while refining key policy details.

The consultation also considered which entity should act as the counterparty to manage GSP contracts. While some respondents suggested alternative bodies such as the Civil Aviation Authority, the Low Carbon Contracts Company (LCCC) emerged as the preferred choice, backed by most respondents due to its credibility, financial strength, and experience with CfD scheme. The government has confirmed that it will work with LCCC to integrate best practices from CfD into the GSP scheme.

Industry funding for the revenue certainty mechanism

Consistent with the ""polluter pays"" principle, the government has confirmed its position that the revenue certainty mechanism should be funded by the aviation industry. Industry funding would need to cover the cost of payments issued under a GSP mechanism and the costs incurred by the counterparty to administer the scheme.

The government's proposed approach is for the GSP mechanism to be funded through a variable levy on aviation fuel suppliers that would cover the cost of payments to SAF producers and the cost of administering the scheme. The consultation notes that the proposed approach is similar to that taken for other schemes where industry provides funding support for low carbon technologies (such as the Electricity Supplier Obligation where a levy is imposed on licensed electricity suppliers to fund the CfD scheme for renewable energy projects).

The aviation fuel suppliers that would be subject to the levy would be consistent with those suppliers that are subject to the SAF Mandate (ie suppliers owning 15.9 terajoules or more of aviation turbine fuel at the duty point for use in the UK, during a calendar year). Individual contributions for each obligated supplier would be determined by market share, with the period for calculating market share and scheme costs to be determined.

It is envisaged that a forecast will predict the expected scheme costs over a specified period and determine each supplier's contribution in advance of payment. The levy will include a 'reserve payment' to cover any minor divergences from the forecast. The levy amount can adapt and change between collection periods and where an interim levy is collected based on forecasts, there would be a reconciliation based on actual data.

Ahead of any scheme introduction, the government intends to further consult and engage with industry regarding the detail of how the levy will work in practice.

Costs associated with the revenue certainty mechanism

Under the proposed levy on suppliers of jet fuel, UK fuel suppliers' costs include the difference between the agreed strike price and the market price of SAF when the SAF price is lower than the agreed strike price. This cost is additional to the price of purchasing SAF under the SAF Mandate.

The reality of the GSP mechanism is that fuel suppliers will see the effective price of the SAF volumes that are covered under the revenue certainty mechanism fixed at the strike price. Low SAF prices will result in higher revenue certainty mechanism payments for UK fuel suppliers.

To limit the cost impacts of the revenue certainty mechanism, the scheme's liability can be managed by agreeing the strike price within contracts and limiting the support to a pre-determined volume of SAF. The GSP mechanism is only intended to provide interim support to help establish inaugural plants in the UK and deliver the UK SAF mandate targets. The government has indicated that it will continuously monitor the impacts of the scheme to ensure that they are not disproportionate.

Next steps

The government has decided that the initial tranche of GSP contracts will be awarded to UK SAF projects utilising non-hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technologies. This is due to the comparative maturity of HEFA-based SAF and the current supply and availability of HEFA fuel. By focusing on non-HEFA technologies, the government aims to encourage the development of advanced SAF production methods.

The eligibility criteria and the quantity of available contracts will be published by the government as soon as possible for business planning and viability.

The Government has reiterated its commitment to working closely with industry and other stakeholders to finalise details of the GSP contracts, the allocation method, and scheme administration. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Revenue Support Bill was announced during the King's Speech on 17 July 2024 and the government has confirmed that its aim is to have all required legislation for the revenue certainty mechanism in place by the end of 2026, allowing GSP-backed contracts to be awarded as soon as possible.

Responses to the March 2025 industry funding consultation process will be considered when drafting the provisions of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Revenue Support Mechanism) Bill to implement a revenue certainty mechanism and any subsequent regulations.",https://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/dam/jcr:66ca68ca-cd63-4268-b26d-9f0e68bd86a9/aviation-AdobeStock_207351535.jpg,N,,2025-03-18 04:50:17.273110

Hybrid plants are a crossing between two selected parent plants achieved via controlled pollination (see how are plants propagated). The seeds produced by this process are called F1 or F1 Hybrids. These hybrids will exhibit very specific qualities. Hybrids have quickly come to dominate the seed market. However, in spite of their increased market presence…

After successfully guiding the Company through the transition from a master limited partnership (MLP) to a C-Corporation, Jim Carter and Dan Sheets have informed the Board of their decision not to seek re-election and to retire at the end of their terms following the Annual Meeting.

Additionally, these directors have provided valuable input to the revamping of our Specialties business, positioning us for strong, resilient cash flow generation. Together with the entire Board, their efforts have laid the foundation for the next phase of Calumet's transformation, focusing on deleveraging, cash flow growth, accretive asset monetization, and the expansion of Montana Renewables into a leading global producer of sustainable aviation fuel, also sometimes referred to as synthetic aviation fuel.""

Julio and Karen bring decades of experience as executives and public energy and chemical company board members. As Chair of the Board, I aim to continue to enhance our governance and engage with our shareholders regarding Calumet's strategic priorities. To this end, I am encouraged by the support and contributions of our shareholders.""

Rajay Bagaria, President and Chief Investment Officer of WDO, commented, ""WDO has confidence in Calumet's management team and commends the Board for its ability to navigate complex challenges while supporting management in executing the Company's transformation and delivering the Department of Energy loan. The Board's proactive engagement with its shareholders highlights the continued evolution of Calumet's governance under its new C-Corp structure. We believe Julio and Karen will bring complementary skill sets to the Board as Calumet executes on deleveraging transactions, participates in the industry margin recovery, and works towards the successful monetization of MRL.""

Become a Daily Caller Patriot today.","Readers,

Instead of sucking up to the political and corporate powers that dominate America, The Daily Caller is fighting for you — our readers. We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.

Now that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate media and joining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes to marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; senators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want to limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our independence.

We don't complain -- we can't stand complainers -- but we do call it how we see it. We have a fight on our hands, and it's intense. We need your help to smash through the big tech, big media and big government blockade.

We're the insurgent outsiders for a reason: our deep-dive investigations hold the powerful to account. Our original videos undermine their narratives on a daily basis. Even our insistence on having fun infuriates them -- because we won’t bend the knee to political correctness.

One reason we stand apart is because we are not afraid to say we love America. We love her with every fiber of our being, and we think she's worth saving from today’s craziness.

Help us save her.

A second reason we stand out is the sheer number of honest responsible reporters we have helped train. We have trained so many solid reporters that they now hold prominent positions at publications across the political spectrum. Hear a rare reasonable voice at a place like CNN? There’s a good chance they were trained at Daily Caller. Same goes for the numerous Daily Caller alumni dominating the news coverage at outlets such as Fox News, Newsmax, Daily Wire and many others.

Simply put, America needs solid reporters fighting to tell the truth or we will never have honest elections or a fair system. We are working tirelessly to make that happen and we are making a difference.

Since 2010, The Daily Caller has grown immensely. We're in the halls of Congress. We're in the Oval Office. And we're in up to 20 million homes every single month. That's 20 million Americans like you who are impossible to ignore.

We can overcome the forces lined up against all of us. This is an important mission but we can’t do it unless you — the everyday Americans forgotten by the establishment — have our back.

Please consider becoming a Daily Caller Patriot today, and help us keep doing work that holds politicians, corporations and other leaders accountable. Help us thumb our noses at political correctness. Help us train a new generation of news reporters who will actually tell the truth. And help us remind Americans everywhere that there are millions of us who remain clear-eyed about our country's greatness.

In return for membership, Daily Caller Patriots will be able to read The Daily Caller without any of the ads that we have long used to support our mission. We know the ads drive you crazy. They drive us crazy too. But we need revenue to keep the fight going. If you join us, we will cut out the ads for you and put every Lincoln-headed cent we earn into amplifying our voice, training even more solid reporters, and giving you the ad-free experience and lightning fast website you deserve.

Patriots will also be eligible for Patriots Only content, newsletters, chats and live events with our reporters and editors. It's simple: welcome us into your lives, and we'll welcome you into ours.

The Asia-Pacific region's SAF production capacity is set to reach 3.5 million metric tons per year (77,671 barrels per day) by end-2025, forecasts from Argus Consulting showed, versus 1.24 million metric tons in 2024.
These requirements are expected to lift SAF demand from these countries to about 14 percent of their production capacity by 2026, Reuters calculations based on trade data showed.
IATA said one million metric tons of SAF was produced globally in 2024, below forecasts of 1.5 million metric tons, and described production as disappointingly slow.
But Neste, which expects global demand to hit at least seven million metric tons in 2030, and newcomer Bain Capital-backed EcoCeres remain upbeat about growth prospects.","SINGAPORE -- Asia's ability to supply sustainable aviation fuel will outpace regional demand this year and next as more production comes online, increasing exports and potentially lowering prices for the fuel, oil executives and analysts said.

Planned SAF production could take a hit if regional demand remains tepid and prices fall below production costs, industry sources say, though Asia's increased capacity is good news for airlines that have been complaining SAF is too expensive and hard to source.

At least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have started up or are earmarked to start production this year, targeting exports regionally and to Europe.

Unlike in Europe, where flights departing EU and UK airports must now use two percent SAF in their tanks, Asia's mandated demand remains low with compulsory use of the renewable fuel in some nations to start only later this decade.

Low consumption and a lack of policy guidance have led to delays of some SAF projects in China.

""Asian airlines are still more focused on ramping up flights and SAF is not a top priority given it is still costlier than jet fuel and airlines will make less profit,"" said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.

Aviation accounted for 2.5 percent of global carbon emissions in 2023. SAF, made from waste oil and biomass, is key toward reducing those emissions, but is costlier than conventional fuel and only accounted for 0.3 percent of global jet fuel production, global airlines body IATA said.

The Asia-Pacific region's SAF production capacity is set to reach 3.5 million metric tons per year (77,671 barrels per day) by end-2025, forecasts from Argus Consulting showed, versus 1.24 million metric tons in 2024.

However, the first compulsory use of SAF in Asia will not begin until 2026 when Singapore and Thailand enforce a one-percent mandate. These requirements are expected to lift SAF demand from these countries to about 14 percent of their production capacity by 2026, Reuters calculations based on trade data showed.

Anticipated production capacity does not mean that much SAF will actually be produced given an industry focus on profitability and actual demand.

IATA said one million metric tons of SAF was produced globally in 2024, below forecasts of 1.5 million metric tons, and described production as disappointingly slow.

Recent project delays point to a very real risk that SAF penetration may actually begin to fall even as demand grows, said Ellis Taylor of aviation analytics firm Cirium.

South Korea's one-percent SAF use will start in 2027, and Japan has a 10-percent mandate by 2030.

""Demand in Asia is expected to lag behind supply due to the absence of uniform policies and mandates across the region,"" said Lamberto Gaggiotti, the head of biofuels firm Apical's green energy business.

Voluntary use

Outside of government mandates, some Asian airlines are voluntarily using SAF to boost their green credentials among customers and as part of industry sustainability commitments.

The Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, which counts many Asian flag carriers as members, has a target of five-percent SAF usage by 2030.

Many Asian airlines do not disclose SAF consumption.

Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) said it used more than 6,800 metric tons of SAF in 2024, but did not provide a forecast for 2025.

Air New Zealand (AIR.NZ) expects to use 1.6 percent SAF in the financial year ending in June, up from 0.4 percent a year earlier, but last year halved its SAF target to 10 percent by 2030 from 20 percent, citing its affordability and availability.

Export plans

Japanese refiner Cosmo Energy (5021.T) will produce SAF from April. Investments in Southeast Asia this year have totalled more than $500 million, with Thailand's PTT Global Chemical (PTTGC.BK) having started its plant and Bangchak Petroleum (BCP.BK) to follow in the second quarter.

Asia exported more than 370,000 metric tons of SAF in 2024, ship tracking data from Kpler showed, mostly from Neste's (NESTE.HE) Singapore plant, the world's largest.

""As the SAF market develops, it is to be expected that there will be gaps between where it is produced and where there is demand,"" IATA's director of energy transition Hemant Mistry said.

Taiwan's Formosa Petrochemical (6505.TW) plans to produce up to 6,000 metric tons SAF for local airlines this year, its spokesperson KY Lin said, down from an earlier target of up to 10,000 metric tons in 2025.

The cost of producing SAF from used cooking oil is estimated at $500 to $600 per ton, including pre-treatment costs, he said, compared with SAF spot prices at around $1,700 per ton in Asia, according to industry sources.

With slower demand, Lauren Moffitt, head of Asia biofuels pricing at Argus, said Asia is likely to remain a net SAF exporter through 2026 with oversupply to pressure prices.

The price gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel narrowed from nearly three times last year to 2.4 times this year on a free on board (FOB) Singapore basis, Argus data showed.

But Neste, which expects global demand to hit at least seven million metric tons in 2030, and newcomer Bain Capital-backed EcoCeres remain upbeat about growth prospects.

EcoCeres will bring online its 420,000 metric tons per year (tpy) SAF and biodiesel production unit in Johor, Malaysia, by the fourth quarter, CEO Matti Lievonen said, bringing the firm's total capacity to 770,000 tpy along with an existing plant in Jiangsu, China, as it eyes exports.

""While this new production further strengthens our supply to Europe, we are also exploring global opportunities such as Japan, Korea, Australia, China, and North America, all of which represent significant potential for growth.""",https://static.tuoitrenews.vn/ttnew/r/2025/03/17/rd2z34vrbzlddjwcviigv33jsy-1742194853.jpg,N,,2025-03-17 04:50:37.169067

Deutsche Airline startet City-Verbindungen ab Flughafen Frankfurt

Von: Thomas Peters

Condor fliegt vom Flughafen Frankfurt aus wieder Berlin und Hamburg an. Mit modernsten Fliegern soll dabei ordentlich Kraftstoff gespart werden.

Frankfurt – Von Frankfurt nach Berlin in einer Stunde. Die Condor City-Verbindung soll es möglich machen. Die Airline startet ab März mit Flügen vom Flughafen Frankfurt aus zum Flughafen Berlin-Brandenburg (BER) und auch zum Flughafen Hamburg (HAM). Dabei sollen modernste Flugzeuge zum Einsatz kommen.

In einer Pressemitteilung spricht Condor von einem kleinen Stück Firmengeschichte. Nach vielen Jahren bietet die Airline wieder Inlandsflüge in Deutschland an. Mit den sogenannten City-Verbindungen will das Luftfahrtunternehmen Frankfurt mit Berlin und Hamburg per Flieger verbinden. Condor hat kürzlich zudem eine Erweiterung des Streckennetzes für den Sommer 2025 angekündigt.

Erste Flüge von Flughafen Frankfurt nach Berlin und Hamburg gestartet

Der erste Linienflug seit langem zwischen Frankfurt und Berlin startete am 1. März um 10.30 Uhr mit der Flugnummer DE409. Eine Viertelstunde später hob der Flug DE4179 nach Hamburg ab. Seit dem 2. März verbindet Condor die Städte Hamburg und Berlin mit Frankfurt zweimal täglich, jeweils morgens und abends.

„Mit unseren City-Verbindungen passen wir unseren Flugplan an die Bedürfnisse unserer Gäste an“, sagt Peter Gerber, CEO Condor. Berlin und Hamburg seien sowohl privat als auch geschäftlich für viele Passagiere von Interesse und beliebte Reiseziele. Die Flüge werden mit einer Zwei-Klassen-Konfiguration angeboten: Economy und Business-Class.

Moderne Flugzeuge von Frankfurt nach Berlin und Hamburg sollen Treibstoff sparen

Laut Condor kommen bei den Flügen die werksneuen Flugzeugtypen Airbus A320neo und A321neo zum Einsatz. Diese sollen über modernste Triebwerke vom Hersteller Pratt & Whitney verfügen und 20 Prozent weniger Treibstoff verbrauchen. Sie werden mit Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) betrieben, ein nachhaltig hergestellter Treibstoff aus nichtfossilen Rohstoffen.

Die neuen Flugzeuge sparen laut Condor 20 Prozent CO₂-Emissionen ein und sollen außerdem 50 Prozent leiser sein. Der Kerosinverbrauch pro Passagier liege an Bord einer A320neo bei umgerechnet 1,9 Litern auf 100 Kilometern.",https://www.fnp.de/assets/images/36/376/36376835-ein-condor-airbus-im-landeanflug-am-flughafen-frankfurt-3bfe.jpg,N,,2025-03-17 04:50:58.337207

“JFK has been JetBlue’s home for 25 years, and our operations here should set the standard we envision for our entire network,” said Ursula Hurley, Chief Financial Officer, JetBlue. “Thank you to the many teams and partners who have helped make this possible. Incorporating SAF into our flights is an important lever in decarbonising the aviation industry and expanding its availability to our Northeast airports is a big step.”

To ensure a consistent supply of SAF, Diamond Green Diesel – a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and Darling Ingredients affiliate – produces the fuel and Valero then blends it with conventional jet fuel to create blended SAF. The blended SAF is then delivered by World Fuel via existing jet fuel distribution infrastructure where it is claimed by JetBlue for use in their fleet at JFK Airport. Blended SAF is a drop-in product for existing aircraft and infrastructure and can lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to approximately 80%, when compared to current conventional jet fuel.

“Working with JetBlue and Valero to bring blended SAF to one of our largest airport locations supports our ambition at World Fuel to grow a consistent supply network for SAF on the U.S. East Coast,” said Brad Hurwitz, Senior Vice President, Supply and Trading, World Fuel Services. “This collaboration enhances our ability to provide regular Sustainable Aviation Fuel and improves access to lower carbon fuels for our aviation customers.”

The delivery of SAF to the New York region was first explored in a 2021 study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the National Renewable Energy Lab, evaluating the ways in which SAF could be transported to Port Authority airports using existing fuelling infrastructure. The study found that SAF could be successfully delivered to Port Authority airports, paving the way for airline partners to fuel an aircraft with SAF at LaGuardia Airport successfully in June 2022 and for JFK Airport to welcome the world’s first transatlantic flight fuelled by SAF in November 2023.

“We are proud to collaborate with JetBlue on the use of SAF at John F. Kennedy International Airport,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “As the international gateway to the US, JFK is leading by example through our work on safe SAF delivery to our regional airports and promoting sustainable air travel. We look forward to facilitating more SAF operations across our airport system.”

Rick Cotton, Port Authority Executive Director, commented: “The Port Authority looks forward to continue working with our partners as we all strive toward more environmentally friendly air travel. Our work testing the safe delivery of SAF to our airports was a key first step demonstrating the possibility of more sustainable airport operations. As our agency works to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, we hope more business partners like JetBlue will want to work together to advance our mutual sustainability goals while delivering a world-class air travel experience.”

The world is on the brink of a green refining boom, similar to the telecom boom.
Pakistani political leadership and policymakers should seriously explore all possibilities to facilitate the development of an indigenous green refining industry.","MELBOURNE:

Pakistan's oil and chemical sectors are at a critical juncture. With increasing imports of petroleum products and petrochemicals and the global shift towards green fuels and chemicals, the country, though confronted with enormous challenges, has a unique opportunity to capitalise on.

By adopting a green refinery industrial base, Pakistan could not only meet its national demand but also build the capacity to export green oil and chemicals, turning a challenging situation into a strategic advantage.

Pakistan does not have an extensive petrochemical industry compared to many developed countries. This presents a unique opportunity to bypass traditional petrochemical infrastructure, similar to how mobile phone technology leapfrogged landlines. Transitioning to green refineries also promises to align with global environmental standards, ensuring a cleaner and more efficient energy future.

Green refineries are facilities that use green energy to process crops, wastes, air, and water to produce a diverse array of oils, chemicals and fertiliser products. Much like traditional petroleum refineries, green refineries integrate various processes and technologies. Bioethanol plants are the most well-known example of green refineries, albeit now considered the older generation of such facilities.

Many green refinery projects are currently at various stages of development, with a strong global focus on producing ammonia, methanol, aviation fuel, and diesel. Numerous refineries are expected to become operational by the end of the decade, with some larger projects anticipated to have an annual production capacity of up to one million tonnes.

Recent advancements in green refining technologies in Australia have shown the production of plastics from carbon dioxide using microbes, which not only mitigates climate change but also has the potential to reverse it. This technology also produces dimethyl ether, a viable replacement for natural gas. Various trials of dimethyl ether usage have already been conducted worldwide, from powering natural gas grids to vehicles.

As the world grapples with the urgent need to combat climate change, carbon dioxide utilisation technology is expected to emerge as a pivotal solution, effectively removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and reducing greenhouse gas concentrations.

These developments demonstrate a global focus on establishing green refineries, with continuous research advancing the technology. In this context, there is already a list of ideal candidates for Pakistan, including aviation fuel, ammonia, dimethyl ether, methanol, acetic acid, diesel, and even plastics.

A sustainable aviation fuel refinery requires water and crops or crop waste as inputs. The land supplying these inputs should be fertile enough to yield two or three crops a year or provide a continuous waste supply to ensure the refinery's smooth operation.

The energy requirements are met within the refinery itself. For a green ammonia refinery, the input feeds are water and air, providing hydrogen and nitrogen, respectively, and are powered by green energy sources such as solar or wind. Therefore, a green ammonia refinery requires land suitable for solar or wind energy, or it should be powered by a hydropower station.

While green ammonia and sustainable aviation fuel refineries can be scaled up to produce a million tonnes or more, newer technologies like green plastics are currently suitable for smaller-scale production. However, as commercial plants come into operation worldwide, these technologies are expected to become suitable for large-scale production in the future.

To embark on this journey, policymakers in Pakistan need to pay attention to two critical issues: machinery and the availability of qualified and competent human resources. The country lacks not only the capacity to produce the machinery needed for green refineries but also the HR base.

Therefore, foreign partnerships will be essential, at least for the initial projects. Europe, China, and North America are the leading technology providers for the current generation of green refineries.

Regarding developing a skilled workforce, the existing local workforce with relevant experience can upgrade their expertise to support the initial green refineries. Simultaneously, universities, in collaboration with overseas institutions, can develop courses and training programmes to educate the next generation of the workforce locally. Given the continuous technological advancements in this field, partnering with countries leading in research and development to utilise the best technologies would be highly beneficial. Building research collaborations between local and foreign research institutions will be essential.

Financing green refinery projects is generally more accessible than financing traditional fossil fuel projects. This is due to several factors, including global interest, investment trends, governmental incentives, private sector interests, green bonds, international grants and aid, and carbon credits.

Ideally, Pakistan needs a dedicated apex body solely focused on the ""green refining industry."" Such an autonomous but accountable body should then, in consultation with multiple stakeholders, develop a 10-year roadmap for the adoption and development of green refining infrastructure in the country.

With coordinated efforts under the guidance of such an apex body, Pakistan can successfully develop a nascent green refining industry.

The world is on the brink of a green refining boom, similar to the telecom boom. Pakistani political leadership and policymakers should seriously explore all possibilities to facilitate the development of an indigenous green refining industry.

This would be one of the most significant achievements in the goal of producing critical products indigenously, ensuring energy security, employment-oriented economic growth, and environmental sustainability for Pakistan.

The report, produced by ‘Airports of Tomorrow’, a WEF initiative bringing together leaders from across the aviation industry, says industry stakeholders are increasingly looking to advance aviation decarbonisation activity in tandem with boosting growth post-Covid-19, posing challenges to progress on sustainability.

The actions that industry and governments across the world take this year will be vital to ensure the aviation sector remains on the right flight path to meet internationally agreed targets, including reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5 per cent by 2030 and attaining net-zero international aviation by 2050, according to the report.

Alignment of SAF policies across regions and longevity of subsidies are crucial for encouraging investment and ensuring consistent SAF adoption across regions. In 2024, Asia Pacific emerged as a key market: several countries introduced supportive policies, while China is expected to unveil detailed SAF policies this year.

In Pakistan, the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank group is providing up to $35 million in equity and debt financing to SAFCO Venture Holdings Ltd (SAFCO Ventures) to help establish Pakistan’s first greenfield sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility, which will convert thousands of tonnes of used cooking oil and other waste oils into aviation fuel, helping to reduce global emissions.

The WEF report says the availability and cost of SAF are the biggest challenges for aviation decarbonisation in 2025. Airlines need to commit to long-term SAF offtake agreements, but de-risking mechanisms are vital as the risks of advanced SAF production technologies and varying regional policies pose significant hurdles.

More corporate involvement and favourable policies are essential to attract capital and support SAF projects globally.

Geopolitics is the top non-sustainability challenge affecting progress on decarbonising aviation. The withdrawal of the US from the Paris Agreement in early 2025 and the “America First” trade policy are being closely monitored by the aviation community, as increasing protectionism and tariffs pose significant risks.

Geopolitical tensions are destabilising feedstock exports and fuelling domestic energy security concerns. International scrutiny on fairness and competitiveness adds to the complex dynamics at play, report fears.

As aviation’s reliance on SAF increases, scrutiny of the sustainability credentials of feedstocks will intensify.

Concerns around land-use change, deforestation, poor agricultural practices, food security and biodiversity impacts have led to regulatory restrictions and bans on certain biofuels.

Improved transparency, research, and consistent sustainability standards are essential to address these risks and support the development of alternative SAF production pathways.

The report says despite easing inflationary pressures and encouraging profitability figures, the global economic outlook remains a concern for aviation executives, particularly in emerging markets. Rising costs in labour, supply chain bottlenecks and regulatory uncertainty are impacting profitability and affecting the sector’s focus on the net-zero agenda.

Fostering a circular economy can help Pakistan cope with economic, environmental, and social crises, economic nationalists said.

Speaking to The Express Tribune, they highlighted the need to create a climate in which businesses can prosper and the national economy can grow by leaps and bounds.

Developed and many developing countries are shifting from a linear to a circular economy for better opportunities.

They said the circular economy presents a tremendous opportunity for large-scale manufacturing job creation in Pakistan through waste valorisation. For instance, the widespread burning of crop residues, which annually poses severe environmental hazards, can be transformed into an asset by converting this waste into high-value fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel or into valuable chemicals like acids. Establishing new facilities for this purpose would generate numerous onsite jobs, including skilled roles for technicians, process engineers, and logistics specialists to manage biomass collection. Indirect job creation would span supply chain management, transport logistics, storage solutions, and distribution networks, alongside the development of supportive industries like equipment manufacturing, maintenance, and renewable energy.

Moreover, additional roles in research, development, and innovation would further expand employment opportunities.

They said the concept of a circular economy represents a transformative shift from traditional linear economic systems, which are characterised by the extraction of raw materials, production of goods, and disposal of waste.

In a circular economy, raw materials such as metals and oil are utilised to manufacture products like steel, car engines, and plastic bottles. At the end of their lifecycle, these products are recycled into new ones, thereby minimising the need for the continuous extraction of new resources and significantly reducing waste. This sustainable approach not only mitigates environmental impact but also enhances resource efficiency.

In contrast, the prevailing linear economic model, widely implemented across global economies, perpetuates a cycle of resource extraction, production, and disposal, leading to increased waste and the continuous need for new material extraction. The transition to a circular economy is imperative to address growing environmental challenges and foster a more sustainable and resilient economic system.

Eminent energy scientist and expert in a circular economy, Dr Adeel Ghayur, said, ""Pakistan can strategically leverage the circular economy to address pressing environmental, economic, and social challenges through a multi-sectoral, policy-driven approach spearheaded by experts and technocrats. A key focus should be on sector-specific initiatives that deliver the greatest value for sustainable development, particularly in agriculture, textiles, construction, petrochemicals, and renewable energy.""

He said that by integrating Industry 4.0 technologies and accessing global green financing mechanisms, Pakistan can accelerate its transition to a circular economy and maximise its potential benefits.

Industry 4.0 technologies refer to the fourth industrial revolution, characterised by the integration of advanced technologies such as 3D printing, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, robotics, and big data analytics, aimed at creating smart, automated, and interconnected manufacturing systems.

Additionally, establishing university degrees in a circular economy and a centre of excellence can meet the global demand for experts, positioning Pakistan as a leader.

He said the circular economy will address Pakistan's waste management challenges, reduce import dependency, and foster manufacturing job creation while bolstering energy and food security. By prioritising import-intensive products, Pakistan can gradually achieve self-sufficiency in these areas. Focusing on specific industries has the potential to establish Pakistan at the forefront of key sectors, such as solar panel recycling. Furthermore, Pakistan can unlock revenue generation from waste streams that currently pose significant environmental threats, such as crop residues. These residues can be converted into fuels like sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel, exemplifying the core principle of a circular economytransforming waste into value.

He said the transition to a circular economy begins with the formulation of a comprehensive national strategy, integrating incentives, standards, regulatory frameworks, and public-private partnerships. Priority initiatives should include waste management systems, tax incentives, and support for innovation hubs that drive recycling and remanufacturing. Significant sectors in this transition include petrochemicals, plastics, water, renewable energy, and construction materials.

He said to fully realise this potential, it is essential to streamline policies and channel investments into renewable and green technologies, which are crucial for achieving economic self-reliance. These efforts, combined with consistent monitoring and evaluation, will promote long-term economic and environmental resilience for Pakistan's economy.

Climate Action Centre (CAC) Director Yasir Hussain said the circular economy is part of the emerging green economy. The circular economy is the circulation of materials as they move from industry to industry and product to product, minimising the production of waste, pollution, and carbon emissions while protecting and regenerating nature.

He said that in Pakistan, on the one hand, environmental laws restricting the dumping or release of harmful materials are not being implemented. On the other hand, there is circulation and reuse of material waste in industrial processes and society, but generally at a low-value level.

He said value addition requires the recovery of high-value molecules and substances, which necessitates recent technologies, redesigning, and eliminating materials beyond the lifecycle of products in society.",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/circular-economy1742087588-0/circular-economy1742087588-0.jpeg,N,,2025-03-16 03:51:26.722509

Yael Katzwer How have you seen the attitude towards sustainability and saf change in the aviation industry in recent years?
Yael Katzwer Yeah, so IATA has set a goal for the aviation industry to reach net zero by 2050 based on where we are now.
So in developing a mandate, you need to develop it in such a way that it doesn’t interfere with a voluntary market, that it coexist with the voluntary market.
Yael Katzwer All right.","Jeff Lee

Hello and welcome to this episode of cargo facts connect, the podcast of cargo facts, the newsletter of record for the air cargo and freighter aircraft industries for over 40 years. I’m Jeff Lee, editor of cargo facts and it’s Friday, the 14th of March. Over the past two years, we’ve seen SAF initiatives gaining momentum as companies continue to try and make aviation more sustainable. My colleague, deputy editor Yael Katzwer, recently spoke with Jeroen van Heiningen, founder and managing director of carbon insetting company 123Carbon, to discuss how 123Carbon works with IATA to make its platform interoperable with the IATA SAF registry that will launch next month..

Yael Katzwer

Tell me about 123, carbon and what you do.

Jeroen van Heiningen

So I have a background in sustainable transportation for over about 18 years after my career at Accenture, and we noticed that book and claim as a methodology was one of the most efficient ways to decarbonize transportation. So we developed into that, and it’s especially in aviation, is required that we have book and claim in place to correctly allocate saf. So in 2019 I initiated the development of a new platform that allows the creation, the allocation and the verification of among saf but also other types of low carbon transportation, so that fuel suppliers and carriers could create certificates that they could allocate to their cargo owners and forwarders to in order to basically share the costs of decarbonization and also share the the benefits, the carbon reductions. So we are, we are an independent platform that operates across all modalities, and that has transparency and integrity as a key and they we basically offer a registry for everyone, but also a branded platform for airlines and other carriers to interact directly with their customer with so we’re very much focused and specialized in in book and claim.

Yael Katzwer

And what are environmental attribute certificates and how exactly do they work?

Jeroen van Heiningen

So in principle, environmental attribute certificates are the carbon reductions that have been realized, or the carbon equivalent reductions that have been realized through the use of a low carbon technology, which could be saf, it could be bio methanol, it could be electrification, it could be hydrogen, anything that provides a, let’s say, a discount or an advantage compared to a certain baseline. We have that verified by external parties, we log all the data surrounding that project. So where was it uplifted? What were the emission factors used? Was it? What kind of data was it? How was it verified, and that in an entire data package is through a certificate sent to a customer so that he fully understands what he is procuring. As you might be aware in book and claim, we separate the physical stuff from the environmental attributes. So the physical stuff goes into an airport, for instance, and then the carbon reductions are allocated to airlines and to freight forwarders and cargo owner. So you need a water tight system to make sure that there’s no double issuance, double claiming or double selling. And that’s what we that’s what we provide as an independent platform.

Yael Katzwer

And I know you guys are working on interoperability with I add a staff registry partially to, you know, reduce redundancies and things like that. As you were just saying, you don’t want someone double claiming, even accidentally. So do you have interoperability with any other registries at the moment?

Jeroen van Heiningen

I think this is a first in the market. There’s we are part of an ecosystem of of book and claim specialist government or organized by NGOs, like like RSB or especially smart freight center. We have, we’re in part of the committee, committees that deal with registry interoperability. However, we also agreed that at some point you just need to start doing it. And and we were spending quite some time on discussing how we want to do it, how we want to pick it up. As an industry, everyone has their own innovative motivation, so together with IATA, who said, Well, I think we’re advanced enough. Let’s just make this happen. And then also invites, because the publication was also an invitation to other industries to join that and take a pragmatic, bilateral approach to to registry interoperability. And this is just the first step, but obviously we expect to to announce more of these partnerships, not only in in aviation, but as we said, we are a multi modal player. So for us, it makes sense to to be aware of the environment of registries out there. There’s not, not a whole lot, apart from aviation, but potentially they will come.

Yael Katzwer

You said, this is a first step. What are some of the other steps that you foresee down the line?

Jeroen van Heiningen

Yes, so registry interoperability can be quite a few things. It’s the way that registries communicate, and they can communicate about a lot of things. The first step we do with within IATA, and that’s the scope, what we’re doing now is, as you said, to avoid the redundancies and the double issuance, so to make sure that fuel is not registered on a registry twice with that immediately would lead to double counting. Now the. Also means that we are aligning the data models that we are using. We’re using the same taxonomy and using the same wording. So we’re also standardizing the data structure that we are dealing with in the second phase, and then we’re also developing a protocol. If we find these redundancies, what do we do? Who gets priority? Who needs to back off? Things like that are being mentioned there. However, you can also argue that in a later phase that some people are transacting on one registry and the other ones are transacting on another, so that it would make sense also to create some kind of transfer between the registries, where maybe a fuel supplier would use registry A, but an airline would look at it from registry B, and then they would ask, please, can you transfer from register one to registry B so that I can continue to do to to proceed with, with my customers. That’s not the part of the scope of this first phase with IATA. But you can imagine that that that is where potentially they they will go. Another element is also obviously that book and claim is primarily for the voluntary market. You can also imagine that in technical interactions with the mandated market systems that are there are also that to avoid that things are correctly divided between a voluntary and a mandated market. So I think there are different ways that registries or systems need to be integrated, but also standardized. So integration is one, but also standardization in the interpretation. There’s a lot of work to be done on that space as well. And then over seeding that all, if I this is, allow me over seeding that all is also a movement from where you see airlines now all having individual book and claim methodologies, which all differ a little bit and all have different, slightly different certificate than a slightly different approach, and also deliver different levels of transparency. That this the standardization of the registries is also a pulling mechanism to move the airlines from using their own methodologies or Excel based and on board onto a registry, because obviously we can check between the registries. But there are also airlines, obviously out there, the majority that run their own programs on Excel and have them verified by their own auditors. And this is what we’re hoping to achieve with this movement.

Yael Katzwer

How have you seen the attitude towards sustainability and saf change in the aviation industry in recent years?

Jeroen van Heiningen

I think what you do see happening is that there are shifts in interpretation on sustainability, and there will always be When, when, let me give you an example, maybe beyond soft, but when, when biofuels was first introduced, we were very happy, and this was first gen bio fuels. Now, at the moment, everyone’s looking at advanced bio fuels, and in a few years time, there’s even, especially a marine we’re looking to go beyond bio fuels, and we need to move into E fuels or even zero emission and hydrogen electrification. So we will, I think the society as a whole has always demonstrated that it keeps raising the bar on what it perceives as sustainable, and that definition there will become a time where maybe some of electricity will not be seen as sustainable because we keep on shifting, shifting that, raising that bar. And therefore where I think as soon as long as those differentiations are there and people want to be more sustainable than someone else, then I would imagine that that systems like book and claim will be there to allocate the most greenest of molecules, to those customers that are willing to pay. If that, if that answers your question.

Yael Katzwer

Yeah, so IATA has set a goal for the aviation industry to reach net zero by 2050 based on where we are now. Do you believe we can reach that goal by 2050?

Jeroen van Heiningen

We must say that as a whole, we have not been very well positioned to achieve the tar any targets on this purpose that we’ve set and and as you are well also, geopolitical movements are infecting, affecting The whether or not we can use these targets, but it’s not on the political side. It also has to do with the companies that are willing to invest in this. So I don’t think we ever should say the the politics should make this happen, or should we whatever? No, it’s also society as a whole that needs to move. It’s not just the mandates or whatever that needs to bring this together is is to come. Communicating barrels of the voluntary market and the mandated market, and if they can work together, there’s a lot we can do. Unfortunately, we also see that, if you look at saf a lot of production has been announced, and not all of that production is, in the end, also hitting the market, which is obviously unfortunate. But there’s for us as a registry. Obviously, we are not involved basically in the discussion on the type of fuels or whatever. We take the reductions that the fuel bring and create our certificates based on that through a globally approved methodology, and we are not, let’s say, a body that sets the targets or sets the methodology that should be done through stakeholder dialog. We’re here to facilitate the process, but either I think, I think there, there, it will flow up and down, as will the pricing. But if you look at the general trend, I think it’s non reversible and and we also come into that a little bit. We also need institutes like sbti that set the science base target, if that set the targets for these corporates, and they make the fortune 500 move, and they need to start moving them towards investing in their supply chain, so moving them a little bit away from maybe the planting trees, but investing in their own supply chains, paying the actual abatement costs that it takes to decarbonize supply chain, because that’s what it’s all about. If I can plant a tree for one euro, why would I spend 300 euro on soft if it has the same value? So it needs to make be made clear that if you want to achieve certain targets, and we want those companies to invest in supply chains, we need to facilitate that process. Because you can imagine, corporates will always try to find the most cost efficient way to achieve their targets while still maintaining the approval from the sbti. So there’s also, there’s also major role there, where, where do we put the bar?

Yael Katzwer

And you mentioned there’s obviously the voluntary component and then the regulatory component. What more do you think should be done or could be done in terms of regulations to move this along? What are you hoping to see?

Jeroen van Heiningen

Yeah, no, this is, this is the most fundamental question. I think under under SAF, we need to be aware that you don’t solve everything with mandates. Mandates and the voluntary markets are communicating barrels that need to coexist. So the way I see it is that mandate is for basically, for the laggers is to make sure that the entire industry is moving, and then the voluntary part is so that corporates, or anyone that wants to achieve their target faster, or want to do more that they can do that. So if, if all the market was a mandate, then why would companies like like Microsoft still invest they wouldn’t, because it would only regulate it for them. So we need them. We need the mandated market to shift up and raise the bar. And then there will be companies like the Amazon or the Microsoft that want to do more, and they need food access to the voluntary markets to make that to make that happen. So in developing a mandate, you need to develop it in such a way that it doesn’t interfere with a voluntary market, that it coexist with the voluntary market. And and a lot of players are not that aware. The mandated markets are just looking at the mandates to solve everything. The voluntary markets look at the voluntary markets do everything, and we need to look more at that cross field, where they do Where did the two meet, and how can they, how can they coexist? That will be my goal going forward, to see that improving. For us as a positioning we position yourself multi modal, which is not typically the discussion of book and claim, but if you look obviously at the cargo owners or the freight forwarders, they are dealing with multi modality. So that’s why we position this as a multi modal play, to make sure that a big freight forwarder or a cargo owner can absorb certificates from air, road, marine and rail in a constant, standardized approach, and then introduce them into their infantry. So for us, it’s also important that we standardize across the modalities, so that’s something that fits in aviation. Also works in Marine, and that’s at the moment, not the case. The two have a different view on mandates, which is strange, because as an end user, if I’m buying a certificate, there will be other rules. For air, then it will be for real, whereas the company would say, these are all my emissions. So we are also a strong advocate of that multi modal view to solve it, and not just the silo view of within within saf.

PetroVietnam Power Corporation has also established an MoU with GE Vernova for the procurement of equipment and services for gas-fired power plants.

Vietnam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex) has formalized an MoU with three leading U.S. ethanol suppliers – U.S. Grains Council, Renewable Fuels Association, and Growth Energy – to enhance biofuel cooperation.

Additionally, Petrolimex has partnered with Marquis Energy through another MoU to facilitate transactions and imports of biofuels. This collaboration holds particular significance as Vietnam accelerates efforts to expand biofuel adoption.

Beyond these agreements, negotiations are ongoing for additional deals, with an estimated total value of $36 billion in the near future.

Speaking at the signing ceremony, Minister Dien emphasized the strong and growing relationship between Vietnam and the U.S. Over the past 30 years of diplomatic ties, a decade of comprehensive partnership, and two years of comprehensive strategic partnership, bilateral relations have expanded across multiple sectors.

Economic, trade, and investment ties remain central to this relationship. In 2024, bilateral trade reached nearly $150 billion, marking a 20.5 percent increase from the previous year.

The U.S. has become Vietnam’s second-largest trading partner and a key export market while also emerging as a major supplier of machinery, technology, and energy products.

In terms of investment, the U.S. remains one of Vietnam’s leading investment partners, with most major American corporations having established a presence and successfully conducted business in Vietnam.

At the same time, Vietnamese enterprises are increasing their presence in the U.S. market. As of early 2025, more than 100 Vietnamese companies have registered for the Select USA 2025 event to explore investment opportunities in the U.S..

Minister Dien highlighted the immense potential for further cooperation, particularly in science and technology, innovation, research and development, semiconductor and artificial intelligence (AI) industries, renewable energy, financial services, biotechnology, and healthcare.

Vietnam seeks continued U.S. support in facilitating business cooperation and investment, particularly in high-tech and innovation-driven sectors, the official stated.

According to the ministry, from this year onward, Vietnam and the U.S. plan to implement a series of economic and trade agreements valued at approximately $90.3 billion. These agreements are expected to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in both countries.
