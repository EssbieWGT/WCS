The Massachusetts Port Authority has been working for years to expand Lawrence G. Hanscom Field with 17 new hangars. Opponents have decried the atmospheric pollution caused by private jet travel, while the Authority has claimed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would help cut emissions.

""SAF won't help the Commonwealth reduce emissions. Period. It will not scale at the pace of climate change,"" said Chuck Collins of the Institute for Policy Studies, per the CommonWealth Beacon. ""It is a diversion of money and attention in this moment.""

Airlines have been eager to tout sustainable aviation fuel innovation as a solution to growing emissions, though the credibility of some of their claims has been called into question.

Luxury air travel generates a massive amount of pollution, given how many people use it. One study suggested it would take 207 years for the average Amazon employee to emit as much as CEO Jeff Bezos' two private jets. Emissions like these exacerbate destructive floods, droughts, and heatwaves. The aftermath of these patterns, in turn, incurs agricultural, housing, ecological, and other costs.

While governments need to hold the elite accountable for their damaging travel habits, individuals can choose low-impact travel options, such as commuter rail. These can help mitigate the worst impacts of climate shifts.

Many Massachusetts politicians see the inherent hypocrisy of supporting private jet travel in their own backyard and have openly opposed it.

""There is no way you can put in a whole bunch of essentially garages for private jets and still claim ever again, at least in the living memory of those of us in the room, to be concerned about climate. This is it. This is the inflection point for [the Port Authority],"" said Sen. Michael Barrett during a State House briefing, per the CommonWealth Beacon.

""It's a matter of political will,"" said Rep. Carmine Gentile. ""Massachusetts has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

While it would be ideal for this funding to go toward the development of solar-powered phones, the company's investment in energy offsetting is quite impactful.

Apple has signed contracts with multiple solar farms across Europe, totaling 650 megawatts of renewable power, according to TechCrunch. This power offsets more energy use of 1.5 billion iPhone users worldwide, as well as Mac Pros and Apple Watches, which together account for almost one-third of Apple's carbon footprint.

The solar farms will be spread out across Europe in Greece, Latvia, Spain, Poland, Romania, and Italy. Currently, more than 90% of Apple's manufacturing in China is powered by renewable energy, and it will also invest $150 million to raise that percentage further.

A notable fact about this news is that Apple has announced it on all of its international websites but not on its U.S. press site, potentially to avoid drawing attention or backlash from the Trump Administration, which has ended multiple clean energy projects and removed incentives.

Apple earned almost $400 billion in revenue from iPhones alone in 2024, according to Business of Apps. As one of the most profitable businesses in the world and one with a high carbon footprint, its energy offset is an incredible step toward reducing that.

Apple's goal is to power 100% of its products with clean energy by 2030. This sets a stellar example for other companies around the world to do the same. Its investment also helps lower the overall cost of solar and wind power, as their prevalence increases, making it more affordable for everyone.

Fossil fuels, also known as dirty energy, are non-renewable and expected to deplete over the next 30 to 60 years, according to Investopedia. Exposure to these fuels in our air can also cause respiratory issues, such as asthma and lung cancer, and stroke.

When Apple products finally become solar-powered, solar panels are the ultimate home energy upgrade, as they can reduce your electricity bill to as little as $0. TCD-vetted service EnergySage makes it easy to compare quotes in your area, potentially saving homeowners up to $10,000 per installation.

Supply chain recovery undermined by tariffs AAPA says in opening speech

AAPA Director General’s industry presentation

VIEWPOINT: Trump & tariffs — and you thought COVID was bad

The Assembly brought together airline leaders, manufacturers, and industry partners to address key industry priorities, including supply chain resilience, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) deployment, and enhancing manpower resilience. “Stakeholders across the aviation ecosystem must work together to navigate the evolving challenges of the external environment. The Assembly reaffirmed the industry’s unity and determination to navigate global uncertainty, much as it did during the pandemic,” Menon added.

The Assembly of Presidents unanimously passed a number of resolutions on several key industry priorities.

Aviation Sustainability: The Assembly affirmed a collective target of 5% SAF utilisation by 2030, called on Governments to support fuel suppliers by establishing policy and regulations to accelerate SAF production, and adopt ICAO CORSIA-eligible fuel criteria. The resolution further urged States to implement ICAO-approved SAF accounting and registry systems, and support cost-effective production pathways such as co-processing.

Supply Chain Strengthening: The Assembly called for targeted investment incentives and regulatory harmonisation to enhance regional MRO and manufacturing capabilities. It also supported the adoption of circular economy principles, including recycling and reuse of serviceable aircraft materials.

Aviation Safety: A resolution focused on lithium batteries was passed, calling on regulators to align practices with ICAO guidance for the safe carriage of spare lithium batteries, and to enhance data sharing and public outreach materials on the carriage and usage of lithium batteries by passengers.

Taxes and Charges: The Assembly called on regulators to refrain from imposing taxes or charges on international air transport that are not cost-related or consistent with ICAO guidance, cautioning against measures that add an unnecessary financial burden on airlines, or which impede sustainable air transport growth.

AAPA expects international passenger traffic to continue expanding in line with long-term trends, supported by a growing services sector and rising regional connectivity. The outlook for air cargo demand remains broadly positive, but subject to uncertainties from global trade policies and elevated costs, including those from new U.S. tariffs and limited SAF availability. “AAPA airlines are optimistic,” said Menon. “Our focus in 2026 will be to advance aviation safety and sustainability across the Asia Pacific region, strengthen supply resilience in collaboration with regulators and suppliers, and promote air transport connectivity.”

The program highlights Thailand’s strategic role in fostering environmental leadership within the aviation sector while enhancing its global tourism appeal.

Strategic Partnership Advancing Regional Green Aviation

The Green Route initiative is a collaboration involving the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), VietJet Thailand, and PTT Oil and Retail Business Public Company Limited (PTT OR). The historic inaugural flight on November 6, 2025, from Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok demonstrates the region’s commitment to reducing aviation’s carbon footprint through technological innovation and cross-sectoral partnerships.

This collaboration links Thailand’s tourism aspirations with energy sector expertise to accelerate the deployment of cleaner aviation fuel resources, setting an example for integrated sustainable tourism growth.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Critical to Low-Carbon Tourism

Sustainable aviation fuel, produced from renewable and waste-based feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and biogas, adheres to stringent international standards (ASTM D7566) and performs comparably to conventional Jet A-1 fuels. The adoption of SAF on the Bangkok–Phu Quoc route marks a tangible reduction in carbon emissions, cutting approximately two hundred fifty kilograms of CO₂ per flight and achieving up to eighty percent emissions reduction on a lifecycle basis.

VietJet Thailand’s goal is to blend SAF at a five-percent level across its fleet by 2030, contributing to a cumulative reduction of more than one hundred fifty-three thousand tonnes of CO₂ within six years. This transition supports Thailand’s overarching national goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, reflecting global trends toward environmental accountability in tourism infrastructure.

Enhancing Tourism Through Environmental Leadership

TAT’s strong endorsement of VietJet’s Green Route reflects Thailand’s evolving approach to responsible tourism, promoting travel experiences that minimize environmental impacts while sustaining economic benefits.

This jet is the first of eight aircraft on order by the carrier. The widebody marks a major step in modernizing the flag carrier's long-haul fleet and deepening its relationship with Airbus, with the aircraft configured with around 308 seats across three cabins.

The jet introduces Air Algerie's most competitive onboard product to date, and it is powered by fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. The new aircraft type will support growth from Algiers on longer-haul markets, including additional transatlantic and Asian routes, all while positioning the carrier as the largest African operator of the Airbus A330neo once all deliveries have been fully completed.

What Are The Key Developments In This Story?

The first Airbus A330-900neo, which was delivered from Toulouse and bears registration 7T-VTA, inaugurates an eight-strong order that is set to reach complete fulfillment by 2027. The aircraft features 18 full-flat business-class seats in a 1-2-1 layout, alongside 24 premium-economy seats and 266 in the economy cabin, combining for a total of 308 passengers. This is an upgrade in both capacity and comfort over the airline's Airbus A330-200s.

Airbus' Airspace cabin adds larger bins, updated lighting, and next-generation in-flight entertainment and overall connectivity. The jet is powered by a pair of Trent 7000 engines, and it is certified for use of up to 50% sustainable aviation fuel, with manufacturer Airbus targeting 100% SAF usage by 2030. Air Algérie plans to deploy the type on routes such as Algiers to Montreal and future services to Beijing and Guangzhou, as well as other long-haul markets. In its statement regarding the delivery, Airbus had the following words to share:

""Air Algérie will position itself as a center of excellence for the A330neo, supported by the development of its maintenance and repair capabilities and the establishment of a maintenance training center.""

What Are The Financial Benefits The A330neo Offers?

From a financial perspective, the Airbus A330neo fleet helps Air Algérie reshape its long-haul cost base. The Trent 7000-powered Airbus A330-900 offers a roughly 25% lower fuel burn and lower carbon emissions per seat over older-generation widebodies. This is ultimately a critical lever at a time when fuel prices are elevated, and environmental regulations only continue to tighten.

With 308 seats in comparison to 263 on existing Airbus A330-200s, the aircraft can help lower unit costs as fixed cockpit and maintenance costs are spread out across more passengers, provided the airline is able to maintain its load factors. As a state-owned airline, Air Algérie is in the process of making a long, multi-year capital investment in the renewal of its long-haul fleet.

The eight Airbus A330neos the airline will be ordering are set to join additional purchase orders for the Airbus A350-1000, which have already been announced by the carrier, a move that allows the airline to lock in a modern, homogenous fleet for the next decade. In the near-term, depreciation costs as well as financing costs for the acquisition will rise, and the airline is ultimately betting that the improved operating economics of the A330neo, alongside higher-yield potential in premium cabins, will help enhance profitability on key trunk routes and support sustainable growth in long-haul revenue.

What Are The Strategic Benefits The A330neo Brings To The Table?

From a strategic perspective, the Airbus A330neo gives Air Algérie a more compelling platform to pursue its ambition of ultimately turning Algiers into a North African hub that will link Europe, Africa, the Americas, and Asia. The aircraft's comfortable range of around 7,200 nautical miles (13,334 km) covers current endpoints of the airline's network, including Montreal and Beijing, while offering additional flexibility to serve these kinds of markets.

The aircraft will offer a competitive three-cabin product with true long-haul business-class seating that will help win over some higher-yielding travelers.

A wide range of bacteria ordinarily convert glucose into fibers of cellulose to lend structural support and defend against other microbes.
Lee and his team have now simplified this process by growing cellulose-producing bacteria alongside microbes that produce natural colorants.
Subsequently adding the violacein-producing E. coli to the reaction vessel resulted in purple-, blue- and green-dyed fabric.
Further altering the way bacteria produce the cellulose could open up other uses of the material, such as biodegradable packaging, he said.","When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.

Scientists have used genetically engineered bacteria to simultaneously create and color fabrics in a one-pot method. Compared with current methods that rely on fossil fuels, the new technique offers a simpler and more sustainable way to produce colored textiles.

In a new study described Nov. 12 in the journal Trends in Biotechnology, the researchers created cellulose-based fabrics spanning the colors of the rainbow by altering the conditions used to grow the bacteria.

Synthetic fibers rely ""heavily on chemical synthesis and post-treatment steps that are energy-intensive, laborious, and environmentally harmful,"" said study lead author Sang Yup Lee, a professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. Such processes can generate large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and contaminate water and soil with heavy metals and carcinogens, Lee told Live Science in an email.

Therefore, in recent years, there has been a growing trend to use an alternative method of producing natural fibers from the fermentation of bacteria. Cellulose is a promising target, as this material mimics the natural fibers found in fabrics such as cotton. A wide range of bacteria ordinarily convert glucose into fibers of cellulose to lend structural support and defend against other microbes. However, cellulose produced by bacteria is naturally white, which means it often needs to be dyed after processing.

Lee and his team have now simplified this process by growing cellulose-producing bacteria alongside microbes that produce natural colorants. The team used strains of color-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli) to create two classes of dyes: darker violaceins (which produced colors such as purple, blue and green) and warmer carotenoids (which produced colors such as red, orange and yellow).

Initially, the researchers genetically modified the metabolic pathway of a strain of Komagataeibacter xylinus bacteria to increase cellulose production during fermentation. Subsequently adding the violacein-producing E. coli to the reaction vessel resulted in purple-, blue- and green-dyed fabric.

However, the team was not able to use the same method to achieve the warmer tones, because the bacteria did not produce enough dye to stain the cellulose fabric, likely due to poor bacterial growth. To overcome this issue, they added pregrown and treated cellulose to a culture of carotenoid-producing E. coli. This co-culture method successfully led to red-, orange- and yellow-dyed fabrics, thereby completing the team's rainbow palette.

Overall, this method ""eliminates the need for separate dying and washing processes,"" Lee said, adding that this helps to reduce chemical waste and water consumption.

The colored bacterial cellulose showed an overall strong stability against acids, bases, heat treatments, and washing. However, the team noted that further work is needed to fully test these materials — notably, to check their durability against industrial detergents and mechanical wear and tear.

Moving forward, Lee wants to ""extend the current seven color platform to a broader spectrum"" and scale up the process to an industrial level while maintaining consistent quality. Further altering the way bacteria produce the cellulose could open up other uses of the material, such as biodegradable packaging, he said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0aGhjNSeDuXikd5PqJg7lQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/live_science_953/63f121f608eb79eab6201fa9a30a8440,N,,2025-11-15 13:56:09.758705

Energy access and clean cooking A major push on energy access rounded out the day.","The 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on November 14 delivered one of the most consequential accelerations of the summit so far, with governments, industries, financiers and civil society converging around a shared message: the transition away from fossil fuels is underway, systemic, and increasingly irreversible. What had long been framed as ambition took shape as concrete platforms, financing mechanisms, industrial agreements and cross-sector coalitions aimed squarely at implementation.

From the launch of the Clean Energy Ministerial’s Future Fuels Action Plan to a new global transport declaration, green industrialisation commitments, and strengthened coal and oil and gas transition efforts, Day 5 offered the clearest sign yet that COP30 is attempting to turn political pledges into coordinated global action.

“Momentum has shifted,” said Dan Ioschpe, COP30 High-Level Champion. “The energy transition is no longer a niche conversation among specialists. It is a systems challenge that requires governments, private capital and industry to move in lockstep — and we are finally seeing that alignment.”

Future fuels take centre stage

The day opened with the formal launch of the Future Fuels Action Plan, the implementation backbone of the rapidly expanding Belém 4X Pledge, which aims to quadruple global sustainable fuel use by 2035. The coalition has grown from four countries at pre-COP to 23 endorsers, spanning Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe and small island states.

The plan outlines 20 actions — from transparent carbon accounting to trade corridors — and establishes annual tracking by the International Energy Agency.

In the private sector, Maersk intensified the decarbonisation push in shipping with a major scale-up of methanol-enabled vessels. The company will operate 41 dual-fuel ships by 2027 and has signed offtake agreements for 500,000 tonnes of green methanol annually from 2026.

A second regional milestone came from Latin America, where six organisations representing farmers, biofuel producers, airlines, aviation regulators and energy institutions signed a Joint Declaration to scale Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) across the region. The agreement sets out unified fuel standards, farm-to-flight supply chains, and a regional roadmap — a move observers described as potentially transformative for a region with vast biomass and feedstock potential.

“There is enormous opportunity for this region to lead,” said Lucía Andrade, a senior official involved in the SAF coalition. “For the first time, producers and airlines are designing a market together rather than waiting for one to emerge.”

Meanwhile, the Global Environment Facility confirmed $15.8 million for UNIDO, unlocking $213.5 million in co-financing across nine countries to accelerate clean hydrogen production and use. The multilateral 10 GW Lighthouse Initiative also announced that 1 GW of electrolyser capacity has been enabled at early stages, with 68 hydrogen projects assessed for financial structuring support.

Green industrialisation breakthroughs

A second major pillar of the day was industrial decarbonisation. Ministers adopted the Belém Declaration on Global Green Industrialization, committing to scale low-carbon manufacturing, strengthen standards, and accelerate technology transfer along global supply chains.

In a landmark step, interoperability agreements among steel standards initiatives — now covering 70 per cent of global production — were finalised. Experts say this could unlock a credible global market for near-zero steel by lowering transaction costs and harmonising carbon accounting.

“This is what systemic change looks like,” said Marina Kovács, an industrial standards specialist advising the negotiations. “You cannot decarbonise steel mill by mill. You need markets that reward near-zero production, and today we built the foundations of that market.”

Transitioning away from fossil fuels: From concept to roadmap

The momentum behind transitioning away from fossil fuels — a headline outcome from Dubai’s COP28 — accelerated meaningfully.

The Powering Past Coal Alliance unveiled a Plan to Accelerate Solutions, offering technical, financial and policy support to countries preparing coal phase-out strategies. The Beyond Oil & Gas Alliance (BOGA) presented a new mechanism for a managed decline in oil and gas production, including illustrative pathways to be developed with major producing countries.

Financial signals emerged as a powerful theme. Since 2021, members of the Clean Energy Transition Partnership (CETP) have reduced international public finance for fossil fuel projects by up to 75 per cent, redirecting nearly $31 billion away from carbon-intensive systems. Over the same period, CETP members increased clean-energy finance abroad by 77 per cent.

New IMF data underscored the scale of current fossil incentives: $7.63 trillion globally, with only 9 cents of every dollar reaching the poorest quintile — a statistic that drew sharp responses throughout the plenary.

“This is not just inefficient — it is regressive,” said Mireille Diop, an economist from Senegal. “Subsidy reform is climate policy, social policy and fiscal policy rolled into one.”

The non-governmental consortium EFFECT also announced a cooperation framework for real-world pilot partnerships between fossil fuel exporting and importing countries.

Together, the initiatives showed that transitioning away is no longer an abstract aspiration but an increasingly structured process. As negotiators noted, countries are beginning to assemble the first pieces of a global roadmap built on shared learning and shared responsibility — a spirit many referred to using the Amazonian term mutirão.

Transport declaration sets a global 2035 benchmark

Transport — responsible for 23 per cent of CO2 emissions — took a major step toward alignment with 1.5°C pathways. Led by Chile, 10 countries endorsed a Declaration for a Global Transport Effort, committing to:

· 25 per cent reduction in transport energy demand by 2035

· One-third of transport energy from renewables and sustainable biofuels

Chile’s Transport Minister Juan Carlos Muñoz called it “a turning point,” adding: “We have proved that clean transport improves cities, boosts innovation and lowers pollution. The next decade is about scaling this transformation globally.”

The declaration emphasises differentiated national circumstances and highlights electromobility, sustainable biofuels, and modal shifts as complementary solutions.

Energy access and clean cooking

A major push on energy access rounded out the day. The Clean Cooking Fund has allocated $86 million in grants to 28 countries, leveraging an additional $102 million from IDA/IBRD, $10.81 million from carbon finance and $279 million from private capital. Together, the financing has supported access to clean cooking solutions for more than 37 million people and 2,772 public institutions.

A new Platform for Clean Cooking in Schools will launch tomorrow, aiming to expand programs from 10 countries to 20 by 2026, with the objective of global coverage by 2030.

Delivery, not dialogue

If earlier COP30 sessions focused on negotiations and positioning, Day 5 stood out for its emphasis on coordinated delivery — the clearest signal yet that COP30 is shaping itself as an implementation COP.

As Katie White of the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office put it: “Momentum is on our side. If we can clear the traffic ahead with this roadmap, we can — and must — accelerate.”

With system-wide actions across fuels, industry, finance, transport and energy access, Day 5 cemented COP30’s emerging identity: a summit determined not only to raise ambition, but to construct the machinery to achieve it.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-11-15%2F1tklaes3%2FDay-5.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-11-15 10:57:26.829951

We were told that nothing could be done without a formal diagnosis and, once the diagnosis was provided, very little changed.

Because she masked so effectively at school, our repeated and urgent concerns, raised almost daily, about the emotional crises she experienced at home were dismissed.

We were told the issue must be at home, and that the school was already doing all it could.

Despite her diagnosis, she was not offered a place in the ASD (autism spectrum disorder) class, and we were told no further support would be provided.

We applied for a year to other schools with an ASD class and we are still on waiting lists.

She was also not accepted by the children’s disability network team, and primary care psychology services informed us that her needs were too complex for them to meet.

We also underwent an assessment of needs, which was likewise not accepted on the grounds that “the definition of disability as defined in the Act has not been met in this case”.

When her emotional wellbeing seriously deteriorated, she was referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) but her case was initially not accepted.

Only after contacting government ministers was she taken on but even then, with a nine-month waiting list.

As we could not access therapy through the public system, we attempted to go private but found that the waiting lists were either closed or years long.

After exhausting every local avenue and watching our daughter’s wellbeing decline, we made the heartbreaking decision to relocate to Spain, where her needs were recognised almost immediately.

She was granted the highest level of dependency and a disability.

She now attends a school where she has her own classroom, a dedicated teacher, and regular support from a speech and language therapist and occupational therapist.

We are grateful she is finally receiving the help she needs but the damage from years of inaction has already been done.

This is not just about the toll on our family though it has been significant.

My husband has remained working in Ireland for a year, only able to visit once a month while I have been alone with our daughter in Spain, rebuilding her life, her mental health, and education.

But, most importantly, this is about the long-term impact on a 10-year-old child.

She now faces an educational delay of approximately five years, which is extremely difficult to reverse.

She lives with the psychological impact of having spent years in a system that did not provide her with a safe or supportive environment.

She was a child with visible needs who was repeatedly overlooked, misunderstood, and effectively denied her rights, simply because she masked.

This experience has left her not only behind in her education, but with emotional wounds from being dismissed by the very structures that should have protected and supported her. And sadly, her story is not unique.

It should not take moving abroad or escalating to ministers for a child to be seen. No child should have to reach a breaking point before support is offered. And no parent should have to fight for years, every single day, for their child to receive even the most basic help.

I share this not just for my daughter, but for every other child in Ireland still waiting still unheard, still unseen, and still fighting for the support they deserve.

Is EU plan for aviation fuel just greenwashing?

John Whelan’s article — ‘EU’s €2bn plan to fix shortage of sustainable aviation fuel’, Irish Examiner, November 10 relating to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — seems a bit optimistic.

The EU will solve the problem of the shortage of SAF by spending €2bn.

This miracle SAF is defined as that made from agricultural waste or used cooking oil.

These products are already used in road transport fuels and some of these will also be in demand for the much heralded production of bio-methane from anaerobic digestion.

Thus the supply of these waste materials is not assured for the voracious needs of the aviation industry.

There are also reports that many existing biofuels in Europe are produced from imported palm oil rather than indigenous waste sources.

The only solution I have seen to produce clean aviation fuel is to use carbon capture from flue gases and to combine this with hydrogen generated from hydrolysis/wind power to produce a sustainable synthetic fuel.

This could be something like methanol but would likely cost six times the cost of the conventional fuel. Michael O’Leary has rightly scoffed at the idea of any form of SAF.

He knows that the customer does want to pay the real cost for sustainable aviation. Thus, is this EU initiative just another form of ‘greenwashing’?

Defence Forces role in President’s inauguration

For someone who, in the past, stridently declared that Ireland does not need an army, Catherine Connolly’s inauguration as Uachtarán na hÉireann would have greatly lacked a sense of solemnity, an aura of dignity, and the observance of ceremonial occasion befitting the appointment of our head of State, had the Irish Defence Forces not been present.

Irish language act may be discriminatory

I have always been a lover of the Irish language but I struggle with the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 which says that 20% of recruits to the public sector will be competent in the Irish language by the end of 2030.

That means that when you go into your nursing home and a Filipino or Indian nurse is taking care of you, you can exercise your constitutional right to have your healthcare delivered through Irish.

I find this to be really discriminatory against people when it comes to jobs.

This is akin to saying that if you can do your job through Irish, then your application goes into one pile.

That certainly doesn’t sit easy with me.

The new deliveries began in October, marking FedEx’s second and third major U.S. SAF deployments within six months. The company made its first large-scale U.S. SAF purchase at Los Angeles International Airport earlier this year.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by early signs of increased production globally.”

At Chicago-O’Hare, FedEx will receive one million gallons of neat SAF, blended at a minimum 30% ratio, supplied by Air bp. The company is now the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and use SAF at the airport.

“Existing fuel infrastructure and supportive state policies made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel strategy,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx.

In Miami, FedEx has begun receiving about three million gallons of blended SAF at a 30% minimum blend from AEG Fuels.

“With FedEx flights from Miami heading all over Latin America and the Caribbean every day, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, President, FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and shows our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it’s a regional priority.”

FedEx said the expansion supports its goal of carbon-neutral operations by 2040, alongside ongoing investments in cleaner aircraft, electric vehicles, and renewable energy.

The Long-Term Vision For Hydrogen So, could Rolls-Royce’s hydrogen engine concept redefine jet power?","The aviation industry stands at a critical juncture, facing immense pressure to decarbonize by 2050. While Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers an immediate ""drop-in"" solution, its long-term scalability and total emissions reduction potential remain subjects of debate.

Enter hydrogen, a fuel source with the potential for true zero-carbon emissions at the point of use. British engine maker Rolls-Royce, in partnership with airline easyJet and various research institutions, has embarked on a pioneering journey to develop and test hydrogen-powered gas turbine engines. But could today's hydrogen engine concept tests truly redefine the future of jet power?

The Rationale Behind Hydrogen Power

Testing of hydrogen for jet engines began as early as the mid-1950s by the US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a precursor to NASA. Ground tests of a liquid hydrogen fuel system with a modified J65 engine were conducted at NACA's Lewis Field laboratories in 1955. This led to the world's first experimental flights of a hydrogen-powered aircraft, a modified Martin B-57 Canberra bomber, in early 1957.

Back then, interest in hydrogen-powered flight was primarily focused on performance. But hydrogen’s appeal today lies in its clean-burning properties, producing only water vapor as a byproduct. Specifically, the environmental advantages of hydrogen as a jet fuel are:

Zero CO₂ Emissions: When hydrogen is burned in a jet engine, the only direct byproduct is water vapor. This eliminates carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, a major contributor to global warming, making it an attractive solution for decarbonizing the aviation industry, especially if the hydrogen is produced using renewable energy (""green hydrogen"").

Reduced Other Pollutants: Hydrogen combustion produces up to 90% less nitrogen oxides than conventional jet fuel and eliminates the formation of particulate matter, improving local air quality around airports.

Potential to Reduce Climate Impact: While water vapor creates contrails, studies suggest that hydrogen combustion could lead to a 30–50% reduction in overall climate impact compared to kerosene aircraft, a figure that could reach 75–90% with fuel cell technology.

Hydrogen also has significant operational advantages. It possesses nearly three times the energy per kilogram as kerosene, so less fuel by weight is needed to achieve the same amount of energy. Theoretically, it can be generated anywhere there is water and electricity, reducing the reliance on complex oil extraction and refinement supply chains and potentially allowing airports to produce their own fuel. Thinking even more broadly, using liquid hydrogen's cryogenic properties as a heat sink could also open up new design possibilities for improved engine and system performance.

A Landmark Ground Test

All that theory started being put into practice on November 28, 2022. At an outdoor test facility at Boscombe Down in the UK, engineers from Rolls-Royce and easyJet gathered to run a converted Rolls-Royce AE 2100-A test engine on 100% green hydrogen. Years of research and development had led to that day, and the hydrogen produced using renewable wind and tidal power by the European Marine Energy Center (EMEC) in the Orkney Islands, was ready. When the day was out, the partners had set a new aviation milestone with the world’s first run of a modern aero engine on hydrogen.

This initial test was more of a proof of concept than a test of the actual power of the engine. It demonstrated that a modern turboprop engine could combust hydrogen without immediately encountering show-stopping issues. The engine technology itself remained largely the same, a crucial point for future certification and integration, but the fuel system was radically altered to handle the unique properties of hydrogen. The success of this ground test injected a new wave of optimism into the sector, showing that the zero-carbon potential of hydrogen was an achievable goal, not just a theoretical aspiration.

Overcoming The Thermal Challenge

Following the initial low-power test, the engineers moved to tackle a more significant hurdle: achieving maximum takeoff thrust. This is where hydrogen's properties pose their greatest challenge. Hydrogen burns far hotter and more rapidly than traditional kerosene, making flame control a significant engineering feat.

The team, collaborating with the German aerospace research agency DLR and Loughborough University, focused their efforts on redesigning the fuel spray nozzles within the combustor of a Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engine, the exclusive engine for the Gulfstream G700 and G800. The result was a novel system that progressively mixes air with the hydrogen to manage its high reactivity and control the flame position. The tests, conducted at DLR's facilities in Cologne, proved that hydrogen could indeed be combusted at conditions representing maximum takeoff thrust.

The results were precisely in line with expectations, confirming the viability of Rolls-Royce's advanced fuel system design. Grazia Vittadini, former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Airbus and now the CTO at Rolls-Royce, had the following to say:

""This is an incredible achievement in a short space of time. Controlling the combustion process is one of the key technology challenges the industry faces in making hydrogen a real aviation fuel of the future. We have achieved that, and it makes us eager to keep moving forward.""

This milestone was crucial because it went beyond the initial proof of concept. Via intermediate and full pressure testing, it addressed a major technical unknown in hydrogen combustion, proving that it could be used in real-world conditions. In doing so, it moved the conversation from ""if"" hydrogen could power an engine to ""how"" it could be safely and efficiently integrated into existing engine architectures.

Major Infrastructure Hurdles Remain

The engineering breakthroughs in the lab were significant, but the path to commercial aviation involves more than just engine technology. A massive obstacle looms large: the lack of infrastructure. For hydrogen to be a viable aviation fuel, a global ecosystem for its production, storage, and distribution at airports needs to be built from scratch.

The current production of ""green"" hydrogen—created using renewable energy sources like wind and tidal power—is minimal and expensive. Most hydrogen produced today relies on fossil fuels, which negates the carbon-neutral benefit. Rolls-Royce is actively advocating for government support and cross-industry collaboration to scale up production and drive down costs, but the investment required is substantial, representing many billions of dollars.

Airports and energy companies are hesitant to invest such sums without guaranteed demand, creating a classic ""chicken and egg"" scenario. As a result, Rolls-Royce and partners like easyJet are working with airports, such as AGS Airports (Aberdeen, Glasgow, Southampton), to plan for on-site hydrogen generation and storage, a crucial step in preparing for zero-emission flights. The success of this concept is intrinsically linked to overcoming this monumental infrastructure hurdle.

A Redesigned Future For Aircraft

The challenges aren't limited to the ground or the engine itself. Aircraft running on liquid hydrogen will require fundamental design changes. Hydrogen, even in liquid form, has a much lower energy density by volume than kerosene. This means operators would have to sacrifice either passenger capacity or range to accommodate the bulky, insulated cryogenic fuel tanks needed to store hydrogen at -253°C.

The consensus in the industry is that hydrogen will likely be limited to smaller, shorter-haul segments initially. Rolls-Royce is targeting small to mid-sized aircraft (30–40 seats) from the mid-2030s. This focus on regional aviation makes sense, as shorter flights require less fuel, making the volume/weight trade-off more manageable. While radical aircraft redesigns are necessary, the path is clearer for smaller platforms, allowing the technology to mature before potentially scaling up.

The Long-Term Vision For Hydrogen

So, could Rolls-Royce’s hydrogen engine concept redefine jet power? The answer is nuanced. The current consensus within Rolls-Royce and the broader industry is that while hydrogen has immense potential, especially for zero-emission flight at the point of use, it will likely start as a complement to other solutions like SAFs, rather than an immediate replacement for all aviation.

SAFs remain the only viable option for decarbonizing existing long-haul fleets in the near to medium term. Hydrogen's role is expected to blossom first in the regional and short-haul sectors. The technology needs years of rigorous development and certification, with commercial availability likely only by the mid-2030s for smaller planes.

However, the groundbreaking tests have fundamentally altered the landscape, proving the viability of hydrogen combustion in a modern engine. By pushing the boundaries of engineering and design, Rolls-Royce has demonstrated that a future of zero-carbon aviation is possible, even if it requires a radical rethink of aircraft design and global infrastructure. As such, the redefinition of jet power will be a phased evolution, led by the pioneering work of companies willing to take a leap into the cryogenic future of flight.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-new-generation-could-rolls-royce-s-hydrogen-engine-concept-redefine-jet-power.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-15 10:58:37.459796

A Texas refinery that supplies green fuel to U.S. airlines has been purchasing animal fat from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest, according to a Reuters review of government tracking data, interviews and eyewitness accounts.

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuels producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas that turns cattle fat – called tallow – into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the U.S. sustainable fuels market. It has collected over $3 billion in U.S. tax credits for producing biofuels since 2022, according to filings.

But interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue JBLU.O and Southwest Airlines LUV.N, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9 billion in 2025 according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239 billion global market for conventional aviation fuel. But government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law. “Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation, are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data, and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally-cleared land in the Amazon.

TAINTED CATTLE

In 2022 Darling Ingredients CEO Randall Stuewe announced the $557 million acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meatpackers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4 million worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been cooperating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 square miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama. Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle was moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency said it lifted a commercial ban on Vale do Paraiso last year because its owner Antonio Lucena Barros presented a plan to restore the deforested area. Barros also obtained a court injunction suspending a fine of over $3 million, which the agency said it will appeal.

Barros’ lawyer Calebe Rocha said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer Vinicius Segatto said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

FAT TO FUEL

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to grow their pastures because of its economic value – less than 3% of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

Diamonds’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a “byproduct” of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to grow their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organization declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third-parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation.

I just recently took a trip to Iceland, and then tagged on a fun review trip from there. Now I’m heading back out on the road (or in the skies, I guess!). So you can expect some live updates, and then upon returning home, I’ll publish the full review series from all of these trips.

Given the upcoming holidays, I feel like this is the second to last trip of the year that I’ll manage to squeeze in (with one more between Thanksgiving and Christmas). Let me explain what I have booked so far, in chronological order.

I’m first flying PorterReserve on the Embraer E195-E2

I’m kicking off the trip with a product I’ve been curious about for some time. Canada’s Porter Airlines has massively expanded in recent years, including operating Embraer E195-E2s on transborder flights. So I’m starting the trip by flying PorterReserve, the carrier’s premium product, from Fort Lauderdale (FLL) to Montreal (YUL).

This is the carrier’s premium product, and think of it as basically being an extra legroom seating option with improved service (even though Porter has very high service standards already). I can’t wait to give the airline a try, as I last flew with Porter when it was an all-turboprop operator.

By the way, this is such a spectacular use of Alaska Atmos Rewards points — we’re talking just 10,000 points for a one-way premium cabin ticket!

Then I’m flying Air France’s Boeing 787-9 business class

From Montreal, I’ll by flying Air France’s Boeing 787-9 business class to Paris (CDG). Okay, I’ve flown Air France business class many times before (on the Airbus A350-900, Boeing 777-300ER, etc.), so why am I flying the airline again? Well, several reasons.

For one, I haven’t flown the Air France Dreamliner in many years, so I think it’s time to see how that product is holding up, since it’s a different seat than on Air France’s other planes. Second, I’m curious to check out Air France’s new business class bedding, which was recently rolled out. Third, it gets me where I need to go, with interesting segments on both ends. Fourth, there was actually saver award availability!

Lastly (and perhaps most importantly, at least to me), I have Flying Blue Platinum status, and my status qualification period ends in a couple of weeks, and I’m a small number of XPs short of requlaifying for status. So by purchasing sustainable aviation fuel for the flight, I’ll get the XPs required to get me over the edge, and to keep the status.

Next I’m flying Aircalin’s Airbus A330-900neo business class

Okay, here’s a really fun one. From Paris, I’ll be flying Aircalin’s Airbus A330-900neo business class to Bangkok (BKK). How fun is that?! For those not familiar, Aircalin is the airline of New Caledonia, and the airline has greatly adjusted its route network in recent times, now flying between Paris and Noumea with a stop in Bangkok.

So I’m taking the first segment of the journey, which I managed to book in business class with Flying Blue miles. I’ve been wanting to fly Aircalin for so long, so I can’t wait to finally check this out!!

I’m returning in Thai Airways’ Boeing 787-9 business class

From Bangkok, I’ll make my way back to the United States, but via Europe. I’ll be flying Thai Airways’ Boeing 787-9 business class to Milan (MXP), as that’s the only European route operated by that specific plane, which has what I’d argue is Thai’s best business class product.

I haven’t flown Thai’s long haul business class in a long time, and I managed to book this as part of a larger itinerary, where I’m paying just 87,500 Air Canada Aeroplan points to fly from Asia to the United States via Europe. You can’t beat that value, eh?! These redemptions used to be so common for me back in the day, but with how award availability has evolved, it’s tougher than in the past, so this got me downright giddy.

I’m finishing with SWISS’ Airbus A350-900 business class

For the final portion of my trip, I’ll be flying SWISS’ brand new Airbus A350-900 business class from Zurich (ZRH) to Boston (BOS). This plane recently entered commercial service, and I’m looking forward to being among the first people to experience this on a long haul flight. It features the new SWISS Senses experience, based on the Lufthansa Allegris concept.

Quite honestly, this segment is what motivated the entire trip. When I saw award availability on this sector, I figured “okay, I have to review this.” And then I worked backwards. “Well, if I’m redeeming Aeroplan points from Europe to the United States, I might as well originate in Asia, since it’s a better value.” And that’s how the whole trip planning started.

The hotels I’m staying at on this trip

I do have a few hotel stays on this trip, so what do I have planned? Truth be told, I have so many of these Amex Platinum $300 hotel credits to burn through, which are ideal for one night stays, so I’m more focused on luxury properties than anything, given the good value available on short stays:

In Montreal, I’ll be spending a night at the Four Seasons, which I’ve heard great things about, and which is regarded as the best hotel in the city

In Paris, I actually potentially have a couple of nights (but maybe not — more on that in a separate post); should I review the Park Hyatt again, check out Hyatt’s Hotel du Louvre, stay at Hilton LXR’s SAX Paris, or check out one of Marriott’s Luxury Collection options (Hotel de Berri or Prince de Galles)?

In Bangkok, I’m leaning toward staying at the Ritz-Carlton, though I’m open to other ideas for points properties (I’ve reviewed the Park Hyatt and Waldorf Astoria in the past); I’d like to return to Bangkok again soon for a proper visit, so I’m saving the Aman, Capella, and Four Seasons, for when I go with Ford

Bottom line

I just planned another review trip, where I’ll be flying a variety of products that have been on my list. I’ll be experiencing Porter’s E195-E2 PorterReserve, Air France’s 787-9 business class, Aircalin’s A330-900neo business class, Thai Airways’ 787-9 business class, and SWISS’ A350-900 business class.

The aim of the bill is to utilise strategies to meet the supply demand with SAF mandate of 2% blending in 2025 to 22% by 2040. Therefore, the mandate creates demand for SAF but the struggle for supply continues.

Proposed strategies to meet the mandate

On Jan. 1, 2025, the government imposed a SAF mandate on the aviation industry to blend a minimum and increasing percentage of SAF into the total fuel mix for flights departing the UK. The rise is targeted from 2% in 2025 to 22% in 2040.

To meet these targets and support the commercial production of SAF in the UK, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill was introduced on May 14, 2025 in the House of Commons.

One of the main targets of the bill is to introduce a Revenue Certainty Mechanism. The Secretary of State may instruct a government-owned counterparty to enter contracts with SAF producers while reducing investment risks. A fixed “strike price” for SAF will be guaranteed over a defined period.

If the market price falls below the strike price, the counterparty pays the producer the difference.

If the market price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays the counterparty the surplus.

Such resolutions will ensure that the mechanism mirrors the UK’s Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme used in low-carbon electricity and hydrogen. It will also aim to lower financing costs, boost investor confidence, and accelerate final investment decisions for SAF plants.

The bill also specifies the counterparty which must be a company wholly owned by the government. This is to ensure responsibility for issuing and managing contracts with SAF producers, handling payments under the strike price mechanism, and administering the overall scheme.

Were certain targets missed?

During the Report stage of the bill, on Oct. 15, 2025, Olly Glover, Liberal Democrat Spokesperson (Transport), introduced new clauses and at the same time highlighted a few missed targets,

In 2010, Boeing announced the target that 1% of aviation fuel globally should come from SAF by 2015, and in 2019, the International Air Transport Association set out hopes of reaching 2% by 2025, but today, globally, the figure is just 0.3%.

He observes the continued talks of using SAF over the years yet notices a poor track record of unambitious targets. He says,

The Conservative Government promised back in 2022 to have five commercial UK SAF plants operational by 2025, but there is still only one. It is therefore right of the Government to have introduced legislation to make sure that the latest set of SAF targets move from fantasy to realistic, credible and deliverable plans.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/l_bailey_of_paddington_hol070325-71.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-15 10:59:12.266134

Global airlines are bracing for another cost squeeze as the industry warns that tariff-linked price hikes by aircraft and engine suppliers could derail the fragile recovery in aviation manufacturing.
“Tariffs will impact the nascent recovery of the supply chain and also increase non-fuel cost for the airlines,” he said.
He pointed out that while aircraft and engines are exempt, many of the raw materials and components sourced globally are not.
“Supply chain recovery is now undermined by tariffs which increase supplier costs.","Synopsis

Speaking at the 69th Assembly of Presidents of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) here, IATA Director General Willie Walsh said there was huge frustration that the supply chain issues are not getting much better. While airlines are a low margin industry, he said the margins of OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) are high.

Global airlines are bracing for another cost squeeze as the industry warns that tariff-linked price hikes by aircraft and engine suppliers could derail the fragile recovery in aviation manufacturing. IATA Director General Willie Walsh on Saturday said supply-chain disruptions continue to delay aircraft deliveries and increase operating costs — and expressed concern that some OEMs are now talking about raising prices.

Speaking at the 69th Assembly of Presidents of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA), Walsh said “there was huge frustration that the supply chain issues are not getting much better,” even as airlines continue to operate with thin margins. In contrast, he noted that OEMs enjoy much stronger profitability.

Taking examples, he said engine makers “are actually improving their financial performance during a period of massive disruption which has added massive costs to the airline industry.”

Walsh added that “it is bothering when he hears suppliers talking about that they want to increase prices because of tariffs and other supply chain issues.”

“There's got to be a correction to this. Airlines need to be properly rewarded. I don't object to anybody making profits....

Live Events

But we've got to see a greater balance and we need to see these critical suppliers raising their game and raising their game significantly to ensure that they're serving the industry in the way that we need to be served,” he said.

The global aviation sector continues to struggle with prolonged supply-chain bottlenecks since the pandemic, leaving airlines waiting for new aircraft even as passenger demand rebounds sharply. The worldwide commercial aircraft backlog exceeded 17,000 units last year — significantly higher than the 2010–2019 annual average of 13,000 — according to an IATA–Oliver Wyman study.

AAPA Director General Subhas Menon warned that tariffs now threaten to slow the already fragile recovery. “Tariffs will impact the nascent recovery of the supply chain and also increase non-fuel cost for the airlines,” he said.

He pointed out that while aircraft and engines are exempt, many of the raw materials and components sourced globally are not. “Supply chain recovery is now undermined by tariffs which increase supplier costs. While aircraft and engines are exempt, their raw materials, and components which come from many parts of the world, are not.

“Tariffs also affect demand through inflation. It is a double whammy as both supply, and demand sides of the market are affected,” Menon said, even as he reiterated that air transport demand remains strong.

On sustainability, Menon said that taxing airlines “directly or indirectly through mandates has not worked” and noted that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production remains low.

The IATA–Oliver Wyman study estimates that supply-chain challenges will cost airlines more than USD 11 billion in 2025, driven by excess fuel burn, additional maintenance, increased engine leasing and higher inventory-holding expenses.

""Turning everyday waste into jet fuel could be an innovative but significant near-term step toward cleaner aviation,"" Zhang argues.","A walk through any busy airport makes it clear that flying remains a central part of modern life. Yet every plane that lifts off depends on fuel that adds to a warming climate. Aviation is responsible for roughly 2.5 percent of the world’s carbon emissions, and demand for air travel is expected to keep rising.

Unlike cars or buses, long flights cannot easily switch to batteries or hydrogen because they need far more energy. That reality has pushed scientists and policymakers to search for fuels that can power jets without heating the planet.

One possible option is gaining traction. Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is already compatible with the jet fuel formulated today and in use across the globe, and it could reduce aviation emissions by over 65 percent through mid-century. However, SAF currently accounts for less than 1 percent of global jet fuel use due to high costs, tight supplies, and limited experience.

A recent article published in Nature Sustainability highlights an unexpected way forward. The researchers investigated a new source of low-carbon jet fuel, not from crops, cooking oil, or forestry waste, but from everyday municipal solid waste. The results provided a potential pathway to reducing waste and emissions that also alleviates the pressure on landfills.

Waste to Winged Flight

Municipal solid waste is the mix of food scraps, paper, plastics, metals, and other materials found in trash cans and on the curb each week (see image below). The considerable accumulation of waste is diverted to landfills nearing saturation or incinerators that must undergo costly pollution reduction procedures. Converting this waste into jet fuel could help cities handle rising trash while giving airlines a cleaner energy supply.

Researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Program utilized real operational data from a commercial gasification facility and Fischer-Tropsch operation facility to further evaluate this concept at the industrial scale. Their study analyzed each part of the process from the waste collection point to the loading of the finished fuel product into the aircraft.

Trash is first sorted, crushed, dried, and shaped into pellets that combust more evenly. Gasification, gas cleaning, and reactor processes convert feedstock pellets into liquid hydrocarbons, which have been upgraded through further refining in order to meet jet fuel specifications.

With the full life-cycle evaluation, the biogenic fraction of municipal solid waste generated an intensity of emissions of 14.1 grams CO2 equivalent per MJ of fuel energy produced. Conventional jet fuel has an intensity of emissions in the range of 89 grams CO2 equivalent per MJ of fuel energy produced, indicative of at least an 84% emissions reduction that could be realized via waste-derived sustainable aviation fuel when all systems are operating properly.

Where Emissions Are Added or Reduced

Not all aspects of the system are the same. The most carbon-intensive step is the gas cleaning process, due in part to the water gas shift reaction that consumes carbon monoxide (CO) and produces CO2 as a product that is released (and not captured or used). Additionally, the drying process of shredding waste adds a large energy burden to the total emissions reduction assessment, as much of the waste in many countries has a high amount of moisture.

The most uncertain aspect of the overall gasification process is gasification performance. Municipal waste may contain varied sizes, moisture, or composition, making it difficult to gasify consistently. When the hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio drifts far from the preferred amounts for reactors, additional energy is needed to maintain the fuel output. Even modestly reducing the effective gas composition can result in life cycle emissions increasing by more than half and the amount of fuel yield being reduced by nearly one-third.

The energy source also matters. Running the system on clean power can reduce carbon emissions by more than 75 percent. The waste composition plays an additional role. Plastics can support improved gasification by increasing the overall heating value, but as a fossil-based material, they can nearly double life cycle emissions if not carefully managed.

Improvements can take place through sorting or shifting to lower-energy drying processes, like biodrying, to reduce the environmental impact of gasification. Such improvements are most beneficial when food waste makes up a large portion of the trash stream, making heating for drying more energy-intensive.

Closing the Carbon Loop

Even gasification, with very low carbon emissions, operates at only about 1/3 of the carbon in the waste to fuel output conversion. This is the case because the fuel gas coming from the waste does not match the preferred reactant or gas mixture the reactor wants.

Researchers looked at two alternatives. In one example, nearly pure carbon dioxide is extracted from the gasifier during the cleaning process. This carbon dioxide can be stored underground, resulting in a net negative carbon intensity for the system runs. However, this means that some of the carbon that could become fuel is locked below ground.

The carbon dioxide can also be reacted with “green” hydrogen as a way to produce fuel. This method, referred to as a power-to-liquid route, has the potential to elevate carbon conversion efficiencies above 60 percent; however, it requires substantial use of renewable hydrogen and energy.

An alternative method can also add renewable hydrogen directly into the gas mix rather than converting the carbon monoxide. This has already had preliminary trials in industrial processes. This process increases the carbon conversion amount by 1.5 times the amount of emissions, reducing the emissions to around 7 grams per megajoule.

Emissions could also potentially go down below 4 grams per megajoule with an excellent gasification process and lower energy drying methods. For example, with one ton of municipal waste, this could displace over 170 kg of carbon dioxide while using a fraction of the hydrogen required by the power-to-liquid processes.

Global Scale and Policy Momentum

Researchers have mapped the potential production of jet fuel from municipal waste worldwide under different assumptions. Under one scenario, reflecting current practices, the potential was up to 50 million tons of fuel per year. In that scenario, we would have reduced the global amount of aviation emissions by about 16 percent in 2019.

If you add renewable hydrogen to the conversion, the potential jet fuel is estimated to be 80 million tons per year, which would satisfy greater than 25 percent of the global demand for jet fuel and reduce annual emissions by way of avoiding around 270 million tons of carbon dioxide.

Different geographic regions are more suited than others. China is estimated to produce over 11 million tons of waste-derived SAF, representing the potential for roughly 30 percent of its jet fuel. The European Union, the United States, and India are anticipated to contribute around 5 million tons each. In those regions where food- and feed-based fuels are banned, such as Europe, some type of waste-derived fuel is likely to be necessary in order to meet long-term fuel blending regulations.

Governments are providing impetus to this industry now. The United States anticipates getting to 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year by 2030, and 35 billion gallons a year by 2050. European regulations require increasing SAF fractions to be implemented on all flights leaving EU airports starting at 2 percent next year. And, under the International Civil Aviation Organization framework, airlines are expected to offset growth in emissions, making waste-based SAF increasingly financially attractive as carbon prices increase.

Can Airlines Afford Waste-Derived Fuel?

Costs are still a factor. Initial commercial plants may produce waste-derived SAF at 0.89 to 1.70 dollars per liter. If plants ramp up production and improve technology, these costs may fall to between 0.60 and 1.08 dollars per liter. This is still above fossil jet fuel and almost consistent with current SAF prices for sale in today’s market.

The bulk of costs will be capital outlay. Gasification and Fischer-Tropsch units spend the most money for the total implementation. Any pretreatment adds to operating costs and significant investments as well. Even small charges for the waste itself could raise fuel prices quite a lot.

In the end, though, waste-derived SAF starts to become a better deal versus purchasing offsets under CORSIA prices around the year 2030. A more salient switch occurs in countries where offset prices rise quickly or public subsidies decrease the price of SAF production. In China, using waste-derived SAF instead of offsets from 2027 to 2035 could save over 2 billion dollars, and in the United States, the savings would be around 1 billion dollars. In high offset price scenarios, savings are even larger.

A New Way of Thinking About Flight

Flying will persist as part of everyday life, but the way the world powers those flights is beginning to change. While waste-derived SAF will never mitigate the entire climate impact of aviation, the thought that household garbage could help fuel global travel hints (at the very least) at a surprising new addition to both waste management and clean energy.

The sentiments of the study from Tsinghua University and Harvard University note that this pathway could significantly mitigate emissions through their findings, as long as the technology improves and policy persists and solidifies.

Jingran Zhang, the first author of the study, argues that the switch could occur quickly in time. ""Turning everyday waste into jet fuel could be an innovative but significant near-term step toward cleaner aviation,"" Zhang argues. Michael B. McElroy, a senior researcher at Harvard and co-author, stated that broad cooperation across government, airlines, and manufacturers would be required to make this efficient on a larger scale.

The plane that carries you across the world one day could, in part, run on the waste you left at the curb. At first thought, the idea is surprising, but the associated science suggests it could make a significant difference if the world chooses to invest in it.

Research findings are available online in the journal Nature Sustainability.

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry is projected to require 450 billion liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) annually by 2050 to meet net-zero carbon emissions targets. That’s a staggering increase from the mere 300 million liters produced in 2023. In my work with global aviation leaders, I’ve seen firsthand how this single statistic is reshaping everything from fleet planning to corporate strategy. We’re witnessing an industry at a critical inflection point, where the traditional paradigms of aviation are being completely reimagined. The current state reminds me of the early days of digital transformation I observed in other sectors – there’s both tremendous pressure and unprecedented opportunity. What fascinates me most is how quickly SAF has moved from a niche environmental initiative to a central business imperative that will define which airlines survive and thrive in the coming decades. The transformation ahead isn’t just about fuel; it’s about reinventing an entire global industry.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Scale-Up Dilemma

The most immediate challenge I see in my consulting work with aviation executives is the sheer scale of production required. As Deloitte research highlights, current SAF production meets less than 0.1% of global jet fuel demand, creating what I call the “scale-up dilemma.” This isn’t just about building more refineries; it’s about creating entirely new supply chains, securing sustainable feedstocks, and managing complex logistics. I recently advised a major European airline that had committed to 10% SAF usage by 2030, only to discover they would need to secure nearly their entire region’s projected SAF output to meet this target. The financial implications are equally daunting – McKinsey estimates that achieving aviation’s net-zero ambitions will require $175 billion in annual capital investment by 2050. What many leaders don’t realize is that this challenge extends far beyond their own organizations to encompass agricultural systems, energy infrastructure, and global trade patterns.

Challenge 2: The Cost Competitiveness Gap

The second critical challenge is what industry experts call the “green premium.” Current SAF production costs are typically 2-4 times higher than conventional jet fuel, creating a massive competitive disadvantage for early adopters. In my experience working with airline CFOs, this isn’t just an accounting problem – it’s a fundamental business model challenge. As Harvard Business Review recently noted, “The economics of sustainable aviation remain the single greatest barrier to widespread adoption.” I’ve seen airlines struggle with how to absorb these costs without pricing themselves out of the market. The situation creates what I call the “first-mover disadvantage paradox” – where the companies taking the boldest steps toward sustainability face the greatest financial pressure. This challenge is particularly acute in emerging markets, where I’ve observed that price sensitivity among consumers makes cost recovery even more difficult.

Challenge 3: Regulatory and Certification Complexity

The third challenge that consistently emerges in my discussions with aviation leaders is the fragmented and evolving regulatory landscape. Different regions are implementing varying standards, incentives, and mandates for SAF adoption, creating a compliance nightmare for global airlines. According to World Economic Forum analysis, “The lack of harmonized global standards for SAF represents a significant barrier to efficient market development.” I’ve worked with airlines that operate across multiple jurisdictions, and the administrative burden alone is substantial. Certification processes for new SAF pathways can take years, delaying implementation and increasing costs. What many executives underestimate is how regulatory uncertainty impacts investment decisions throughout the value chain. From feedstock producers to fuel distributors, the absence of clear, stable policy frameworks creates hesitation that slows the entire ecosystem’s development.

Solutions and Innovations

The good news is that innovative solutions are emerging faster than many realize. In my research and consulting, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that are already showing promise.

First, advanced biofuel pathways using novel feedstocks like agricultural waste, algae, and even carbon captured from industrial processes are dramatically expanding production potential. Companies like LanzaJet are demonstrating that commercial-scale production is achievable today.

Second, power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies represent what I believe will be the ultimate game-changer. By combining captured carbon with green hydrogen, these processes can create carbon-neutral fuels without agricultural constraints. As Accenture’s latest energy transition report notes, “Electrofuels could eventually supply up to 85% of aviation’s energy needs without land use concerns.”

Third, digital fuel management systems are optimizing SAF blending and distribution. I’ve seen airlines using AI-powered platforms to maximize the environmental impact of every liter of SAF while minimizing costs. These systems enable what I call “precision sustainability” – ensuring that limited SAF supplies are deployed where they create the greatest value.

Fourth, corporate sustainability programs are creating new funding models. Major corporations are increasingly purchasing SAF to decarbonize their business travel and supply chains, creating guaranteed demand that helps de-risk production investments. Microsoft’s recent multi-year SAF commitment demonstrates how corporate procurement can accelerate market development.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Looking ahead, the data paints a picture of rapid transformation.

According to BloombergNEF projections, SAF production capacity will grow from less than 1 billion liters today to over 30 billion liters by 2030. By 2040, I predict we’ll see SAF account for at least 25% of aviation fuel consumption in developed markets. The financial implications are equally significant – PwC estimates the global SAF market will reach $15 billion annually by 2030 and could exceed $80 billion by 2050.

In my foresight exercises with industry leaders, we’ve explored several “what if” scenarios that could accelerate this transition. What if carbon taxes become universal, making conventional jet fuel increasingly expensive? What if synthetic biology breakthroughs enable cost-competitive SAF production from non-food biomass? What if major aircraft manufacturers mandate SAF compatibility for all new aircraft?

The technological breakthroughs I’m most excited about include bio-engineered microorganisms that efficiently convert CO2 to fuel, advanced catalytic processes that reduce production costs by 60% or more, and digital twins that optimize entire SAF value chains in real-time. By 2035, I expect we’ll see the first fully SAF-powered long-haul flights becoming routine.

The industry transformation timeline suggests that 2025-2030 will be the critical scaling period, 2030-2040 will see SAF become cost-competitive, and by 2040-2050, we’ll witness the emergence of entirely new aviation ecosystems built around sustainable energy sources.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, I believe we’ll witness the most dramatic transformation in aviation since the jet engine. SAF will evolve from a niche product to a mainstream commodity, fundamentally reshaping airline operations, aircraft design, and global energy markets. The airlines that thrive will be those that treat sustainability not as a compliance requirement but as a core competitive advantage. We’ll see new business models emerge, including SAF-as-a-service offerings and integrated mobility solutions. The risks remain substantial – particularly around feedstock availability and geopolitical factors – but the opportunities for innovation and value creation are even greater. The coming decade will separate the aviation leaders from the laggards, with SAF capability becoming the new differentiator in a carbon-constrained world.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The future of aviation isn’t just about reaching destinations faster or more comfortably – it’s about reaching them smarter and more sustainably. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The most sustainable mile is the one we never have to fly, but for the miles we must fly, let’s make them count toward a better future.” The transition to sustainable aviation represents one of the greatest innovation opportunities of our generation. It requires bold vision, collaborative spirit, and relentless execution. The question isn’t whether SAF will transform aviation, but how quickly and how wisely we’ll navigate this transformation together.

The levy will apply to passengers departing from Singapore starting October 1, 2026, for tickets sold from April 1, 2026, according to Travel + Leisure Asia.

Citing the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) via The Straits Times, passengers will be charged between 1 and 41.60 Singapore dollars, approximately Rp13,000 to Rp535,000, depending on cabin class and flight distance. For short-haul routes within Southeast Asia, economy passengers will pay S$1 (Rp13,000).

For medium-haul destinations such as East Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea, the levy ranges from S$2.80 (Rp36,000) for economy to S$11.20 (Rp144,000) for premium cabins.

Flights to Africa, West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific will incur charges of S$2.80 (Rp36,000) for economy and S$25.60 (Rp329,000) for premium seats.

The highest fees apply to flights to the Americas: S$10.40 (Rp134,000) for economy and S$41.60 (Rp535,000) for business and first class.

CAAS noted that premium cabins and long-haul flights face higher levies due to greater fuel consumption. The levy will not apply to transit passengers, training flights, or humanitarian operations.

Emission Reduction Targets and Funding Mechanism

Revenue from the SAF levy will be used to purchase sustainable aviation fuel through a newly established company, Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo), which will manage SAF procurement for Singapore’s airport hubs.

The initiative supports Singapore’s goal of having SAF account for 1 percent of total jet fuel consumption at Changi and Seletar airports in 2026, rising to 3-5 percent by 2030. Updated price estimates for SAF have also allowed the government to set the levy lower than initially projected.

Inclusion of Cargo and Private Jet Flights

The SAF levy will also apply to cargo operations, calculated based on shipment weight and distance. For private jets and charter flights, the charges will be determined by aircraft wingspan and flight distance, following the same distance-band categories used for commercial flights.

This policy forms part of Singapore’s long-term roadmap to achieve net-zero emissions in both domestic and international aviation by 2050.

SAF, which is produced from used cooking oil, municipal waste, and captured carbon, is considered the most viable near-term solution for reducing aviation emissions without requiring major changes to existing aircraft technology.

Airlines are burning vast quantities of fuel before they ever leave the ground. For an industry locked in arguments over sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen and long-term aircraft programmes, electric taxiing might quietly be the fastest way to cut emissions this decade.

The hidden emissions problem: Why taxiing is aviation’s blind spot

Taxiing has long been treated as an operational footnote rather than a climate problem. Yet multiple studies suggest it is anything but marginal.

Speaking on the sidelines of the World Aviation Festival, David Valaer, CEO of Green Taxi, explained to AGN why this is such a problem.

“We did a detailed analysis with Cirium, which shows that 7% to 20% of the fuel for the whole flight is burned on the ground,” he said.

That tallies with broader research. An OAG analysis found that anywhere between 2% and 17% of total fuel burn can be consumed in taxi out and taxi in, with the highest shares on the shortest sectors.

Consultancy Roland Berger goes further, estimating that around 10–15% of aviation’s CO₂ emissions are attributable to airport platforms, including taxiing, ground handling and auxiliary power.

And a 2022 academic study notes that taxi phases run at low thrust settings where combustion is comparatively inefficient, producing disproportionately high local emissions around airports.

Against that backdrop, Green Taxi’s focus on ground operations does not look like tinkering at the edges. It looks like a direct shot at a double-digit share of the sector’s emissions.

How electric taxiing works, and why it is suddenly viable

Green Taxi’s system avoids batteries altogether. Instead, it uses the aircraft’s existing auxiliary power unit (APU) to drive an electric motor on the main landing gear.

“We take the three-phase, 400 hertz power from the APU,” the CEO explains. “That comes forward to our motor controller, called an inverter. And then that provides the speed control for [an] axial flow permanent magnet motor that’s mounted on the main landing gear.”

The design uses a single main gear leg to save weight, and targets a certified maximum taxi speed of 25 knots, with a steady state of around 16 knots determined by APU power limits. Crucially, the main engines stay off throughout taxi, cutting both fuel burn and local noise.

Safran, L-3 and Honeywell demonstrated an electric aircraft taxi system on an A320 in 2012, proving the concept but never bringing it to market. The stumbling block was mass and packaging.

“Safran’s system in 2012, their motor electronics were on a pallet. It weighed 500 pounds,” Valaer recalls.

The difference today is the maturity of high-performance electric drive tech, much of it inherited from motorsport.

“With all the billions of dollars in hybrid vehicle technology, our motor inverter is 30 pounds and is one foot by one foot,” David says. “Motor technology has rapidly advanced, and our technology is benefiting.”

The emissions and fuel-saving potential: What airlines could gain

The economics are what turned Delta from a curious observer into an active partner. Green Taxi has been working with the airline’s Sustainable Skies Lab to model the impact of its Zero Engine Taxi™ on a typical regional jet operation.

“Their average taxi out time is 18 minutes,” the CEO says. “You put all that together with the ground fuel flow, and you come up with about 100,000 gallons of fuel per year per aircraft.”

He does not soften the point: “That’s a hell of a lot.” In financial terms, “It’s equivalent to around $300,000 of fuel savings” per aircraft per year, he continues, “and it’s equivalent to around 250 cars of CO₂ for the whole year.”

He offers a provocative comparison: “If you electrify the whole airport, you would not save as much as one aircraft taxi for one year.”

In other words, focusing on aircraft ground emissions may move the needle far more than cleaning up ground support equipment alone.

There is, of course, a weight penalty. Green Taxi expects the system to come in at around 300 lbs. But the company has modelled this carefully.

“Carrying that extra mass is going to use about 8,000 gallons of fuel each year,” he explains. “That’s around 8% of the 100,000 gallons we’re going to be saving that aircraft.”

He argues that once airlines trust the system, they can simply offload that fuel. “We’re going to save them 400 pounds of fuel for burn,” he says, making the net weight effect close to zero once flight planning adapts.

Why electric taxiing could outpace SAF in the short term

The timing matters. SAF is central to every net-zero roadmap, but the volumes are not there yet. According to IATA and other recent analyses, SAF represented only around 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024, and even with rapid growth, is expected to reach just 0.7% of airline fuel consumption in 2025.

Individual airlines frequently report SAF costing two to three times more than conventional jet fuel.

By contrast, Green Taxi’s system bolts onto existing aircraft. “Our system will be a two-day installation time,” the CEO says, carried out during scheduled B or C checks lasting 8–20 days. “This is not invasive. This will not take them away from their operation.”

Critically, it is non-flight-critical. “If, for some reason the system doesn’t work, you can still fly the aeroplane normally,” he says. In that case, crews revert to standard single-engine or two-engine taxi, with no hit to dispatch reliability.

That combination of retrofit speed, operational simplicity and high fuel savings is why he calls electric taxiing “the lowest hanging fruit that you can find for emissions and fuel reduction” over the next decade, while airlines wait for SAF, hydrogen and full-electric aircraft to scale.

Airline operations: what changes and what stays the same?

The cockpit changes are deliberately modest. Green Taxi has been working with Delta, SkyWest and others to ensure pilot flows are intuitive and that the system respects union and safety sensitivities.

Some ideas that crop up repeatedly in industry debates will not fly.

“Other people said, well, put reverse cameras on this,” he notes, to allow aircraft to back themselves off stands. “It’s never going to be embraced by the industry because the pilot union is not going to let the pilot back up an aeroplane and be responsible for crunching the tail. There’s always going to be wing-walkers.”

Likewise, the notion of pre-spinning wheels before landing to reduce tyre wear is a non-starter. “Everyone’s thought of that,” he says. “It’s a great theory.” But adding a motor that has to instantly spin up to touchdown speed introduces more problems than it solves.

Maintenance integration is also being designed to fit neatly into existing cycles. On one airline’s Embraer fleet, for example, tyres are replaced every 400 cycles. The company plans to swap the sprocket on the driven wheel at the same interval, treating it as a normal wear part.

The fleet-scale impact: How electric taxiing reshapes airline fuel and emissions

If the per-aircraft numbers hold, the aggregate impact is hard to ignore. A 100-strong regional fleet could theoretically save 10 million gallons of fuel per year. For a major carrier with several hundred suitable aircraft, the savings quickly reach into the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars annually, alongside a measurable cut in both global and local emissions.

Industry bodies estimate aviation accounts for roughly 2.5–3% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions today.

Within that, airport ground operations are a small but fast-actionable slice. With SAF still representing less than 1% of fuel use worldwide, there is a growing recognition that “boring” efficiency measures will have to do more of the heavy lifting in the 2025–2035 window.

The path to certification: When electric aircraft taxiing could enter service

Technical promise is one thing, certification another.

“We touch the APU, we touch the landing gear, we touch the pilot control system,” the CEO says. “It’s a very complicated project,” involving around 10 designated engineering representatives across structures, electrical, software and flight operations.

Green Taxi plans to certify the system first for the Embraer E170/175 family, where high daily utilisation and short sectors produce strong economics. CRJs, 737s, A220s and A320-family aircraft are all on the long-term target list, with forward-fit options for OEMs also in play.

The company is currently finalising its certification plan with the FAA. The aim is to have a conforming prototype ready for tests in the second half of this decade, with a supplemental type certificate to follow.

Synhelion has now delivered its first solar aviation fuel to SWISS World’s first solar jet fuel plant inaugurated by Synhelion","Collaborating with Synhelion engineers, a solar research team at the Solar-Institute Jülich (SIJ) of FH Aachen presented two papers at SolarPACES 2025 assessing the accuracy and reliability of dynamic process models for a solar fuel production system. They used operating data from Synhelion’s DAWN pilot plant.

In Synhelion’s solar fuel plant, DAWN, concentrated solar power drives endothermic chemical reactions to convert biogenic methane, carbon dioxide, and steam into synthesis gas (syngas), which can then be processed into liquid hydrocarbon fuels, such as kerosene for aviation or gasoline.

Because the methane and carbon is derived from bio-waste rather than fossil fuels, and heat is generated from concentrated solar heat instead of burning fossil fuels, Synhelion is pioneering a sustainable drop-in replacement for today’s liquid fuels.

Synhelion’s DAWN pilot plant in Jülich (which can be toured at the next SolarPACES conference in the Fall of 2026) uses RED-certified sustainable biogenic waste as the methane and carbon source and has demonstrated the complete production chain under real solar operation conditions.

Synhelion’s solar-absorbing gas receiver is a unique design that is capable of extremely efficient conversion of solar irradiance from the heliostats to temperatures as high as 1500°C.

How can Synhelion’s solar receiver achieve such high temperatures?

Speed matters for real-time simulation

Now that Synhelion is beginning its first commercial production of solar fuels, plant operators will need to adapt to changing information in real time. Traditional physics-based models can be fast, but that usually comes at the cost of lower accuracy. So the team took a new approach.

“We needed a system where we can offer simulation results in real time to aid the operators who run the plant and make the decisions,” explained lead author Falko Schneider in a call from SIJ in Germany.

“For example, when to switch operation modes, what kind of mass flows or compositions of the reactants to set. To achieve this, we need models that can deliver both high accuracy and high computational speed. You can also use the process model offline to test potential operating and control strategies, of course, where speed doesn’t matter as much. The physics-based model takes a bit longer, but still, it’s very fast. It’s not like it needs days to simulate a week of operation.

The studies are to validate physics-based and machine-learning-based models for simulating DAWN’s solar fuel plant operation. The idea is to replace the more computationally expensive physics-based simulations with machine-learning models and validating an efficient alternative. The team first created a machine-learning model of the thermal energy storage with synthetic data from the physics-based model and successfully validated it.

In the overall system study, Validation of a Dynamic Process Model of a Thermochemical System for Solar Fuel Production, all three key components are validated against real-time operation. The key components are the solar receiver, the reforming reactor where the thermochemistry happens, and the thermal energy storage, which is crucial in solar fuels production, as the thermochemistry must operate continuously.

Synhelion’s high-temperature solid thermal energy storage system uses ceramic refractory bricks with internal channels to carry the heat transfer fluid.

The thermal energy storage had the most comprehensive study

The second study, A Validated Machine Learning Approach to Efficient Thermal Energy Storage Simulation Using Synthetic Data, focused on this component, the thermal energy storage. Of the three aspects studied, the thermal storage was most fully modeled.

The thermal energy storage model successfully reproduced charge-discharge transients over 8 cycles across 10 days, achieving errors of less than 3% of the temperature swing in the upper storage layers, although deviations increased toward the bottom due to potential material property variations and mass flow measurement uncertainties.

The team’s surrogate model yielded results in milliseconds on the synthetic validation data, compared with on average over five seconds for a physics-based model—making it roughly 100 to 1000 times faster. On operational validiation data from DAWN, it is even up to 50.000 times faster. Its run times were also much more consistent, allowing the system to run many simulations very quickly, making it practical for optimization tasks or real-time control.

Since solar flux onto the receiver wasn’t directly measured during operation, the researchers developed a simplified data-driven surrogate solar field model using a 4th-degree polynomial with ridge regression.

“We used experimental data as input and compared the output to the experimental data,” Falko explained. “ The coupled surrogate-receiver simulation achieved outlet gas temperatures of approximately 1000°C, showing good agreement with experimental data, although it slightly overestimated temperatures due to a minor systematic bias in the surrogate model. And since then, the receiver has been operated at output temperatures of over 1200°C.

The model validation for the reforming reactor revealed major discrepancies, though. Especially under partial-load conditions, the model overestimated the reaction rate and heat consumption, with residual methane present, contrary to equilibrium predictions, and lower CO₂ conversion than expected.

“We still have some work to do there,” Schneider noted.

“Usually you have these physical models, and then you fit them with operational data. There are components that work very well, right out of the box, without a fitting. The thermal storage model worked quite well already without any fitting. But regarding the chemistry, we need to do some more work. We assumed that a thermochemical equilibrium had been reached within the reactor. That was the statement we got from an industrial manufacturer. However, in the end, it did not align with reality, probably due to the relatively small reactor size.”

So the team needed to implement some kinetics:

“For example, we could implement some factors that allow us to say, ‘Okay, depending on how fast the reactants flow through the catalyst, it will get that close to a thermal chemical equilibrium.’ If it reaches or not, or how close it gets, and what the composition would look like are factors that can be fitted with operational data from DAWN. So this is about the reactor kinetics,” he said.

Work continues on the solar receiver and the reforming reactor

“For the solar receiver, the problem is that we do not have the operational measurements of the concentrated flux hitting it,” he said. “So we are missing an input variable, and we don’t have a detailed model of the heliostat field because a lot of factors go into this. You usually use ray tracing tools to create these kind of models which are not applicable in the process model. So I created this approximation of the heliostat field model, and used that to validate the receiver model. That’s not a strict validation, but at least it’s a successful plausibility check.”

And the reforming reactor model still needs major improvements. It may be necessary to replace the current equilibrium method with a kinetic model or utilize effectiveness factors to more accurately capture how the system behaves under partial loads. However, both provide a solid base for building a digital twin of the solar fuel process.

“Since we are already creating some component models based on machine-learning, we are checking as well if this would be suitable to accurately reproduce the chemistry,” Scheider pointed out.

“This was a publicly funded project between Synhelion, SIJ and Germany’s Institute of Future Fuels at DLR as partners, within which DAWN was built. DLR also created a small lab setup to evaluate different kinds of catalysts. They developed more detailed chemical models with that data. So we are working with them to see whether we can implement it in our model.”

The team’s machine-learning models have been developed within the TwinSF project in the EU, which combines tested physical models with data-driven approaches to help guide operations in alternative fuel production plants using concentrated solar energy to produce sustainable fuels.

The long-term goal is to develop a functioning digital twin that enables real-time plant monitoring, predictive control, and virtual testing of control strategies before they get implemented on an actual solar fuels plant’s system.

The humid weather and air conditioning are blowing hot and cold, depending on which corner of the venue you are in, which one delegate quipped was “a bit like the carbon markets” at the moment. Nature and carbon are firmly on Friday’s agenda across side events at the summit, and negotiators on Article 6 were also said to have enjoyed calmer talks on Thursday, though after a new text on crediting Paris projects landed overnight, it now seems reopening adopted work on the new crediting mechanism may be back on the table at the conference.

Timestamps are in local time (GMT-3).

0800 – New texts, new drama: But just when parties were saying they did not intend to create fresh drama at COP30 on Article 6, a new text concerning the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM) dropped. Heavily bracketed, containing provisions around an extended transition of Kyoto-era projects to the new Article 6.4 system, and a proposed extension of current Supervisory Body members’ term limits, one observers said it was “looking really bad”, with some of provisions in the text calling for adopted standards on the PACM, such as on baselines and additionality to possibly to be tweaked. Carbon Pulse will look to analyse in full and publish an update later on Friday.

0900 – You shall not pass: A peaceful protest by Indigenous groups blocked the main entrance to COP30 this morning, with demonstrators calling for a meeting with President Lula and highlighting that major projects – including those related to soy, waterways, and carbon markets – are moving ahead without their free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC). Delegates were redirected to a side entrance, with officials stressing there was no security risk. Commenting from the scene, Cool Earth’s Natalie Klepacova said the action reflected longstanding exclusion and broken promises, adding that Indigenous peoples are rights-holders and frontline defenders whose voices must be central to climate decision-making.

1000 – To Tulio, with love: Building on the Brazilian presidency’s description of negotiations as therapy sessions, where parties should feel encouraged to share their true feelings in a safe space, Brazil’s top COP strategist Tulio Andrade asked delegates on Thursday to send him private “love letters” expressing how they felt the conversations were proceeding – and encouraging those that hadn’t to write soon, according to one negotiator in the room. The presidency extended talks on the four main issues – around the ambition gap, trade, finance, and reporting on progress – until another plenary on Saturday. The plenary is likely to be in the morning, to give the SB chairs time to take stock of talks, but not set yet.

1000 – Whitehouse in the house: US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) is arriving in Belem as the sole representative of the US federal government. The top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee plans to participate in discussions on Friday on the future of offshore wind, clean shipping, and non-CO2 GHG emissions and hold meetings with international leaders and the private sector.

1030 – Total investment: French oil and gas major TotalEnergies is putting $100 mln into a fund that backs technologies to cut emissions from the oil and gas value chain. Climate Investment’s venture strategy fund has had a portfolio impact of 133 MtCO2e since 2019, particularly in the detection and abatement of methane, carbon capture, and energy efficiency, TotalEnergies said. Climate Investment was launched in 2015 by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, of which Total is a member.

1130 – Document development: The Mexican state of Jalisco has submitted its registration document to J-REDD+ standard ART TREES. The document will now undergo a completeness check, and if accepted, will be posted for a public comment period.

1200 – Virtual hugs from US Democrats: US Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) joined the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition as the former Speaker of the House to critique the absence of the Trump administration from the international climate negotiations. Pelosi and other members had planned to attend in Belem but were delayed by the federal shutdown, which ended on Thursday. The House Democrats reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement.

1330 – Utility upgrades: Utilities around the world plan to up their annual investment in the energy transition to $148 bln per year, from $117 bln, IRENA announced on Friday. The plan, by the members of the Utilities for Net Zero Alliance, will see the companies mobilise over $1 trillion towards the energy investment up to 2030, since the group was established in 2023. Investments will go towards power grids and networks, including $1.24 spent on grids and storage for every $1 spent on renewable generation. It also includes delivering tends of thousands of kilometres of new and upgraded grid infrastructure.

1430 – France and Italy’s red carpet for fossil fuels: While European Commissioner Hoekstra kept his promise and did not bring fossil fuel lobbyists to COP30 as part of his entourage, France and Italy didn’t get the memo, according to NGO Friends of the Earth. Research by Fossil Free Politics shows that France, Sweden and Italy had the largest EU fossil fuel delegations out of the other 27 member states. France brought along five TotalEnergies lobbyists, including CEO Patrick Pouyanne, and sizeable delegations from EDF and ENGIE, for a total of 22 lobbyists. Italy brought along 12 lobbyists, and Sweden 18. In total nine EU governments brought 84 fossil fuel lobbyists into COP30 on their official government delegations, out of the 1600 fossil fuel lobbyists present at Belem’s conference.

1430 – Badgering the State Department: US Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) told reporters in Belem that federal representatives of the US are missing from the international conference as much due to the federal shutdown, as due to complicated logistics. Without the cooperation of the US State Department, the senator said it has been challenging to access the Blue Zone at COP30. In previous years, Whitehouse and other member of Congress have asked the State Department for “party overflow” badges to the US delegation. The State Department denied the request, according to a Whitehouse staffer, as the country had not applied to attend, leaving Whitehouse and others to scramble for spare “observer” badges through NGOs. Whitehouse is attending as an observer with international association Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment (GLOBE).

1530 – Concrete jungle: C40 Cities urged on Friday national governments at COP30 to advance a credible global plan to end dependence on fossil fuels, echoing Brazil’s call and responding to climate impacts already hitting cities. Building on COP28 commitments to transition away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, and double energy efficiency by 2030, mayors stressed the need to turn ambition into concrete action through a just and equitable phaseout supported by stronger local-national collaboration. C40 cities have pledged to halve fossil fuel use by 2030, with the highest-emitting countries moving fastest. They are already cutting emissions five times faster than national targets, demonstrating that a fossil-free future is achievable.

1630 – Plans for action: New action plans for the African Union, Caribbean, Chile, Colombia and Mozambique, under the Global Clean Power Alliance (GCPA), have been published on Friday on the UK government website. They aim to identify priority needs and outline targeted support for clean energy transitions, in the countries, including transmission infrastructure and project readiness. These demand-led plans guide collaboration with local partners, the UK government, which co-launched the GCPA, said. Complementing them is a private-finance-endorsed High-Quality Energy Investment Planning Roadmap, designed to help countries mobilise private capital at scale and accelerate global clean energy deployment. At COP30, the UK and Brazil also unveiled new deliverables for the GCPA finance mission, backed by a broad coalition of NGOs, private investors, international organisations, MDBs and other partners committed to advancing energy transitions in developing economies. The alliance was first launched at the G20 Summit in Nov. 2024 by the UK and Brazil, with an initial mission to scale clean energy finance.

1700 – Cheaper SAF agreement – Latin American Airline Abra Group and Japanese company Sumitomo Corporation announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to scale up sustainable aviation fuel. Abra, which owns companies like Brazilian Gol Linhas Aereas, and Sumitomo will establish a Brazil-Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement to ensure supply of SAF between Abra and Sumitomo. Brazil wants to become a leading global SAF producer via the production of ethanol and biodiesel.

1730 – I want to live by Common Principles: The 10 multilateral development banks in the MDB Nature Working Group have launched an update to the Common Principles for Tracking Nature Finance, which were first released in 2023. They were created in response to the 2021 MDB Joint Statement on Nature, People and Planet, which highlighted the deep connections between poverty reduction, climate action and addressing the drivers of nature loss. The new Joint Statement, published Friday, committed MDBs to embedding nature more fully across their policies, analyses, advice, investments and operations. It also pledged to scale up nature-positive finance and to create stronger methods for tracking such investments across MDB portfolios.

1800 – Big figs: A new Oxford Smith School report shows that a rapid shift to renewables could double energy-sector productivity in low- and middle-income countries within 25 years, delivering GDP gains of around 10% by mid-century. Solar-rich nations such as Burundi, DR Congo, and Mozambique could see particularly strong economic benefits, the researchers said. Renewables raise productivity by generating more electricity per dollar invested and by providing cheaper power, allowing households and industries to operate longer at lower cost. The study found these gains are greatest in the Global South and could help narrow global income disparities. It also shows renewable investment has already boosted GDP in developing countries far more than fossil fuels, adding $1.2 trillion between 2017 and 2022. In Brazil alone, renewables contributed $128 billion. However, the authors stressed that communities benefit only when intentional mechanisms – such as local ownership and community funds – are in place. They also highlighted the importance of distributed renewables to expand access and ensure an inclusive transition.

1800 – BB carbon desk: Banco do Brasil (BB) formally launched its carbon credit desk on Friday, becoming the first Brazilian bank to do so. The bank’s carbon business will rely on three prongs: project origination, commercialisation of credits, and decarbonisation advisory. Currently, BB already has more than 30 projects under development, with the capacity to generate up to 3 mln carbon credits per year, it said.

LanzaJet, the alternative fuels technology company that is marked as a significant player, has achieved a major breakthrough in Soperton, Georgia, which can be regarded as a monumental step for the aviation industry. The firm has made history by being the first-ever to produce jet fuel out of ethanol at the scale of a commercial operation. This new method is not simply a technical success but rather a major leap that will greatly affect the use of eco-friendly travel in the future.

A New Era for Aviation Fuel in Georgia

LanzaJet’s new facility in Georgia, known as LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels, marks the first-ever commercial production of jet fuel derived from ethanol. This facility, strategically located in Treutlen County, has successfully achieved ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) certification for on-spec jet fuel. The plant’s operations have now reached full capacity, positioning LanzaJet at the forefront of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

This development has been years in the making. After 15 years of research, development, and collaboration, LanzaJet’s ethanol-to-jet (ATJ) technology is now fully operational, offering the aviation industry a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-based jet fuels. With the aviation sector under increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, this new fuel offers a viable, eco-friendly solution.

LanzaJet’s Alcohol-to-Jet Technology

LanzaJet’s innovative Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology is a game-changer for sustainable aviation. Unlike traditional fossil fuels, which rely on limited oil reserves, LanzaJet’s fuel is derived from widely available ethanol feedstocks. These feedstocks can come from a range of sources, including agricultural residues and recycled carbon from waste. The versatility of this technology means that nations worldwide can tap into their local agricultural resources to produce jet fuel, promoting energy security and reducing reliance on imported fuels.

By using ethanol as a feedstock, LanzaJet’s fuel solution offers substantial greenhouse gas emissions reductions over traditional jet fuel. When blended with conventional Jet A-1 fuel, it creates a fully certified sustainable aviation fuel that is compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. This means airlines can start using this cleaner fuel without making costly adjustments to their fleets or operations, further enhancing its appeal.

Impact on Travel and Tourism

This breakthrough will undoubtedly influence the future of air travel. As the aviation industry grapples with its carbon emissions, sustainable aviation fuels like those produced by LanzaJet offer a promising pathway towards more eco-conscious travel. With the aviation industry contributing a significant portion of global CO2 emissions, LanzaJet’s innovation could help reduce the environmental impact of air travel, making it more sustainable for future generations.

For the tourism industry, this means a future where travellers can feel better about the environmental impact of their flights. As more airlines adopt SAF, air travel will become greener, supporting tourism in a more sustainable way. This could encourage eco-minded travellers to choose more environmentally friendly options and contribute to the overall sustainability of the tourism sector.

Georgia’s Role in Leading the Way

LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility is a model for future sustainable aviation fuel production worldwide. With the plant’s successful integration of cutting-edge technologies, it sets a blueprint for other regions to follow suit. This project also highlights the growing importance of regional investments in sustainable technologies and infrastructure, boosting local economies and creating new job opportunities.

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility was developed with an investment of over 300 million USD, employing over 300 people during construction and creating additional long-term jobs. These efforts are not only advancing global aviation but also contributing to the local community in Georgia, which benefits from economic development and energy security brought about by the new facility.

A Bright Future for Sustainable Aviation

LanzaJet’s groundbreaking achievement in Georgia represents a significant milestone in the aviation industry’s shift toward sustainability. With its ethanol-based jet fuel, the company has unlocked a new chapter in aviation, where travel is not only convenient but also more sustainable. As LanzaJet continues to scale its operations, the future of air travel looks greener and more promising than ever.

By providing a scalable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional aviation fuel, LanzaJet is setting a new standard for the aviation industry, inspiring other countries and companies to follow suit. This development not only benefits the global aviation sector but also paves the way for a more sustainable and responsible travel experience for all.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sus-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 18:57:53.861365

Illinois is a critical contributor to the efforts of biofuel production.
Currently, soy and corn crops are major contributors to the input of biofuel production.
The SAF project poses a major challenge to the health of Illinois soil, indirectly encouraging monoculture cultivation.","Since Dec. 3, 1818, the sun has set and risen across the state of Illinois. From the urban center of Chicago, to the agricultural cores of Peoria, Champaign and Decatur, to the fields of the southern counties, generations have seen the same sun mark the passing of every day.

Today, Illinois no longer shares the same mark of a new day. In the north, the day ends with the light of opportunity. In the south, the sun sets into the darkness of poverty.

In 2025, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced a joint collaborative investment with Avina Clean Hydrogen Inc. to develop a $820 million biofuel aviation fueling plant in southwestern Illinois. Both parties announced the investment in huge advancements to promote clean energy economies and lead a national industry.

Illinois’ investment comes at a time of increasing climate vulnerability across the United States and the globe. As calls for environmental stability and justice increase, calls for change arise across the U.S.

What is critical about the investment is the location: the agricultural heart of Illinois, home to acres of farmland, the national leader of soy crops and a dominant producer of field corn. Illinois is a critical contributor to the efforts of biofuel production. Yet Pritzker’s policy lacks long-term solvency to protect the true heart of Illinois: our farmers.

The issue with the investment in the sustainable aviation fuel plant, in its simplest form, exists within the goals of the Pritzker administration and actions for environmental sustainability. Nowhere have the interests and environmental justice of Illinois communities been attempted to be protected.

In the status quo, Illinois is home to over 71,000 farms — over 95% of them being family operated. Even when disregarding the scale of operations, family farms are crucial in preserving local ecosystem health. Family farms use less intensive farming practices, leading to less nutrient and soil degradation.

The importance of soil health extends far beyond simply growing crops; a healthy soil holds more organic carbon. When we boost soil health, we reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere through carbon being held in the soil, strengthening photosynthesis alongside increased water retention and soil nutrients.

Currently, soy and corn crops are major contributors to the input of biofuel production. When investment in biofuels expands, more operations are going to grow soy — due to easier management and lower production costs — in larger quantities to maximize profits. The issue with this is that when soy is grown more frequently, Soil Organic Carbon decreases, causing soil health to decline and emissions to rise.

The SAF project poses a major challenge to the health of Illinois soil, indirectly encouraging monoculture cultivation. This is critical as operations attempt to invest in a growing industry, projected to be worth $257.61 billion by 2034.

Solvency in the long term is limited for Illinois farmers due to distance decay. One of the premises of the project is entirely designed to benefit large-scale corn and soy monopolies over Illinois farmers, through the dominance of agricultural monopolies and their control of the entire supply chain.

What we see here is a shifted reliance on monopolies to meet higher demands for corn and soy through higher production methods, streamlined through unsustainable and soil-degrading cultivation.

Even if we argue that Illinois farms will be able to keep up with production demands and not be outcompeted by large-scale operations, they will still be placed at an economic disadvantage. As the distance from the market increases, the interaction between the two places decreases, due to local operations remaining more cost-efficient to run.

As infrastructure increases in southwest Illinois, to maximize profit and minimize costs, large operations inherently want to be near the plant. Large-scale operations are further outcompeting Illinois farmers through control of the supply chain and placing localized pressure.

To acknowledge the impacts of wide-scale climate change, the transportation sector is a heavy producer of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the only impacts you see from the Avina plant are the depreciation of Illinoisans’ livelihoods and the sustainability of poverty, not the climate.

One critical factor is true: the biofuel plant is for aviation, a factor that does not justify the impacts on local communities. Major airports are marginal within southern Illinois, making the positive benefits of aviation biofuels not relevant to southern Illinois, nor would they justify the lack of protective policy.

I am not saying that we should avoid investment in clean energy because it has no direct impact on Illinois. We should avoid investments that exacerbate existing inequalities placed on rural constituents, paired with no direct benefits for the community.

Holding Pritzker at his highest ground, you see job growth of roughly 150 permanent positions, critical in any rural economy, temporary or long-term. What you also see is that the lack of skill sets needed for working in the biofuel sector is not transferred over from local rural populations, but instead outsourced to people outside of rural communities.

This is essential as the soy industry is already facing pressures amid the Trump administration tariffs and China’s boycott. Investing in a facility with no protections for rural Illinoisans whose very livelihoods rely on the next harvest exposes them to unemployment and poverty.

What I am not doing is disagreeing with Pritzker’s policy and the SAF project’s long-term goals. I am, however, disagreeing with the implementation and the decimation of the backbone of the State of Illinois: multi-generational family farms.

While sustainability, energy and fuel investment are essential for our state and nation in the long term, the SAF project, today, does not provide the change that all can benefit from.

To encourage proper sustainability, Pritzker needs to change his priorities from profit to his people. Constituents who are further isolated from opportunity to advance the goals of wealthy agricultural conglomerates.

For once, the emphasis of environmental action and justice needs to prioritize the sustainability of our current generation, not the future. To create true change and solvency, our farmers need to be protected rather than threatened.

The group has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sumitomo Corporation do Brasil, a key subsidiary of Japan’s global trading giant Sumitomo Corporation, to accelerate the creation and deployment of industry-ready decarbonization solutions for aviation.

The agreement marks a strategic alliance between two regions with increasingly aligned climate ambitions. It also signals a new phase in the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Brazil, a country widely regarded as one of the world’s most capable future producers.

A Partnership Designed to Fast-Track Emissions Reductions

The MoU establishes a joint framework for Abra – represented in Brazil through Gol Linhas Aéreas – and Sumitomo to coordinate deeply with government bodies, regulators and private-sector stakeholders in both Brazil and Japan. Their primary goal is to advance the implementation of a Brazil–Japan Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), developed under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement.

The JCM is a bilateral carbon-offset system introduced by Japan in 2011 to support low-carbon projects in developing regions. In exchange, Japan receives a portion of the generated emission-reduction credits, helping the country meet its domestic climate targets while accelerating climate-positive investments abroad.

For Abra and Sumitomo, establishing the JCM in Brazil represents the essential step toward enabling a long-term offtake agreement for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. By aligning both nations’ climate policy frameworks, the two companies aim to remove one of the most significant barriers to SAF expansion: the need for reliable long-term financing and guaranteed market demand.

Meeting Soaring Global Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry is entering a crucial era. Global demand for SAF is projected to reach nearly 400 million tons by 2050, driven by international decarbonization commitments, emerging regulatory pressure and the aviation sector’s urgent need to reduce its footprint.

Developed economies with minimal access to feedstock – including Japan, Singapore and several European nations – are already bracing for severe supply constraints. SAF production requires large quantities of biomass or renewable feed materials, making resource-rich countries like Brazil pivotal to the global energy transition.

Brazil has long been recognized as an agricultural and biofuel leader, with decades of experience in ethanol, biodiesel and renewable energy technologies. This positions the country uniquely well to become a central hub for SAF production. Yet, despite having the natural and industrial advantages, large-scale SAF development faces persistent financial challenges. High production costs, investment risks, and the need to preserve affordable domestic air travel for Brazilian consumers remain critical concerns.

The introduction of the Brazil–Japan JCM could provide the missing bridge. The framework would unlock new financial flows, lower market-entry risks for producers and create a stable foundation for long-term SAF supply agreements. Airlines in both countries would benefit, while Brazil would expand a new renewable-energy export market without compromising its domestic aviation accessibility.

Mutual Gains for Governments, Producers and Passengers

The Abra–Sumitomo collaboration generates unique benefits for both countries. Japan gains access to competitively priced SAF sourced from a reliable partner with vast renewable potential. Brazil secures investment, technology and market guarantees that support local producers and job creation, while reinforcing its leadership role in the global renewable-energy landscape.

Brazilian airlines, including Gol, stand to benefit from increased SAF availability within their domestic market—an essential advantage as global regulations tighten and consumer pressure for sustainable travel intensifies. Passengers across both nations ultimately gain from a cleaner, more responsible aviation ecosystem with long-term safeguards for affordability and operational continuity.

Strengthening Latin America’s Sustainability Voice Ahead of COP30

The signing of this MoU comes at a critical moment. With the world turning its attention to Latin America as Brazil prepares to host COP30, sustainability partnerships of this scale signal the region’s growing influence in shaping global climate solutions.

For Abra Group, the agreement reinforces its commitment to responsible aviation policies that safeguard connectivity, economic opportunity, environmental responsibility and social progress across Latin America. By championing innovation and aligning with global partners, the group aims not only to transform its own operations but also to set a benchmark for regional and international airlines.

As the aviation sector moves into a defining decade, the Abra–Sumitomo partnership stands out as a forward-looking blueprint for cross-border cooperation, climate-aligned investment and large-scale deployment of sustainable aviation technologies. Through collaboration, innovation and strategic policy alignment, the two organizations are helping shape a future where growth in air travel can coexist with meaningful climate action.

Maria Del Mar Whittaker, Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer, Abra Group, said: “At a time

when financing for SAF projects is particularly challenging due to market uncertainties, demand

constraints and evolving regulations, creative solutions that leverage the strengths of different global

regions are the best path forward. This joint initiative represents an important step towards global

climate alignment, connecting Japan’s commitment to decarbonization with Brazil’s unique capacity

Dr. Ronald R Campbell, PhD, Senior Technical Advisor, Greene Tweed

Becky Petry, Applications Engineer, Greene Tweed

Andrew Clarke, CEng, Applications Engineer — Sealing Systems, Greene Tweed

What are the differences in various types of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and how do these variants affect common elastomers?

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) are renewable alternatives to traditional jet fuels, intended to reduce carbon emissions. SAFs are produced from a variety of renewable feedstocks, including biomass, algae, animal fats, vegetable oils, and agricultural residues like corn stalks. The ASTM D7566 standard outlines eight approved SAF pathways, enabling the production of sustainable fuels tailored to both environmental goals and fuel performance requirements.

Within SAF, there are different formulations, including Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK) and Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK). These variants differ primarily in their aromatic content [benzene (ring) hydrocarbons], which plays a vital role in determining their compatibility with elastomers commonly used in aerospace fuel systems:

SAK contains a high level of aromatics, which are essential for maintaining the performance of certain elastomers, such as those used in seals and gaskets. Aromatics help elastomers retain their flexibility and prevent excessive swelling or weakening.

SPK has no aromatic content, making it a cleaner-burning fuel. However, its lack of aromatics can lead to challenges with elastomer compatibility, such as swelling or reduced sealing performance.

Both SAK and SPK formulations play a critical role in the adoption of SAF. While SAK’s high aromatic content supports compatibility with traditional elastomers, SPK offers a cleaner-burning alternative with fewer emissions but requires careful consideration of elastomer performance. Advanced materials like FKM seals provide a reliable solution across SAF blends, ensuring safety and performance without compromising sustainability goals. As the aviation industry continues its transition toward greener fuels, understanding the nuances of SAF formulations and their impact on materials will be key to a seamless shift toward more sustainable skies.

Which form of SAF – SAK or SPK – is more in use or likely to come into use?

Currently, SPK is more widely adopted and is set to play a key role in the future of aviation. The diversity of feedstocks approved under ASTM D7566 highlights the broad range of sources available for SPK production. Aircraft manufacturers are also making strides toward sustainability, with plans to design aircraft capable of operating on 100% SPK by 2030. Certain SPK feedstocks are already proving to be the dominant choice for SAF.

We worked with Virant to source and test SAK (which is 97% aromatic) – a material with a high aromatic content (97%) derived from algae. This product was specifically developed to blend with approximately 80% SPK, ensuring the correct aromatic balance needed for a drop-in fuel compatible with nitrile seals exposed to jet fuel. While SAK is not intended to be used as a standalone fuel, it serves as a critical blending component. A mixture of 80% SPK and 20% SAK creates a 100% sustainable fuel option, eliminating the need for petroleum-based jet fuel while maintaining performance and reliability.

Where are elastomer seals used and for what purpose?

In aerospace applications, elastomer seals are critical components used in fuel systems, hydraulic systems, and engines to prevent leaks and ensure safety. Their primary purpose is to create a reliable barrier that prevents leaks, withstands elevated temperatures, and resists chemical degradation.

What material used in commercial applications underperforms with SAF and in what ways (swelling, weakening) and under what conditions?

Fluorosilicone elastomers (FVMQ), such as Greene Tweed’s 409 compound, showed underperformance in certain conditions:

Hardness Change: FVMQ materials exhibited greater and/or inconsistent hardness reduction when exposed to SAF fluids.

Weakening: Prolonged exposure to dry-out conditions or fuel switching (e.g., from conventional jet fuel to SAF) led to reduced sealing performance and dimensional instability.

Based on the variance in results between the different types of SAFs used, we recommend further application testing of any FVMQ compound in the specific SAF fluid intended for use. In contrast, under the same test conditions Greene Tweed’s fluorine-based elastomers (FKM compounds 665, 731, and 772) demonstrated good compatibility and consistent performance.

How widespread is the use of seals that use this material?

FVMQ (the material which underperformed during testing) represents a choice for static fuel applications that require good sealing performance over a broad temperature range. Few material options were historically available that could offer excellent levels of sealing performance at very cold temperatures (i.e. below -54°C or -65°F). However, newer grades of FKM material are also capable of performing well at these cold temperatures.

Are substitute materials available (and approved by the FAA, EASA, etc.) to replace the underperforming seal materials?

As mentioned above, newer grades of FKM material (notably those compliant against AMS7379 and AMS7410 industry specifications) can perform well at very cold temperatures. As such, they can meet the operating temperature envelope that only an FVMQ material can offer. In addition, FKM materials also typically cost somewhat less than FVMQs. FKM materials can therefore represent an attractive alternative to an FVMQ material.

It should be noted that if a type of sealing product is replaced within an aircraft system, it is the responsibility of aircraft system manufacturers to qualify the replacement and demonstrate an equivalent level of performance.

Do FKM seals cost more?

The cost impact would be from having to replace nitrile seals with the FKM seals due to the higher cost of FKM material. As mentioned earlier nitrile seals require some aromatic content, so the blending of aromatics or switching to FKM seals would be a cost consideration.

Is the supply chain for the substitute material challenged?

The supply chain for advanced elastomer materials like FKM is currently stable, however, fluctuations are always possible depending on factors like increased demand. Greene Tweed’s global manufacturing and distribution network ensures a reliable supply of high-performance elastomers to meet industry needs.

What is Greene Tweed’s expertise in supplying elastomers for SAF (can cover research, testing, verification, manufacturing or distribution strengths).

As a global leader in advanced materials and high-performance solutions, with decades of experience in elastomer technology, our expertise spans multiple areas, including advanced material science capabilities in research and development.

We follow this with comprehensive testing and verification protocols to ensure our materials meet or exceed industry standards. For this particular application, we conducted a comprehensive study to evaluate the compatibility of fluorine-based elastomer seals with various SAF blends, including SPK and SAK. The seals were tested under accelerated aerospace conditions, such as temperatures up to 120°C and prolonged SAF exposure, to ensure their reliability in real-world applications.

Our manufacturing facilities also enable us to produce high-quality elastomers at scale, while our robust global distribution network ensures efficient delivery to customers worldwide.

Proving seal compatibility with SAFs through rigorous testing ensures that existing aircraft and systems can safely transition to these fuels without costly overhauls, paving the way for a more sustainable future in aviation while maintaining safety and reliability standards.",https://www.aerospacemanufacturinganddesign.com/fileuploads/image/2025/11/14/pav-greene-tweed-fusion-665-image-ko-szd.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 12:56:26.662438

Global potential of trash jet fuel Policy ambition for SAF is rising fast.","Aviation accounts for roughly 2.5 percent of global CO₂ emissions today, and demand for flights is on track to double by 2040. Unlike cars, planes can’t simply switch to batteries at scale, which is why sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has become the industry’s main decarbonization lever.

The hitch is supply. SAF still represents less than one percent of jet fuel use worldwide because it’s expensive to make and limited by feedstocks such as used cooking oil and energy crops. A new study points to an overlooked, highly scalable input: municipal solid waste (MSW).

By converting everyday trash into drop-in jet fuel through industrial gasification and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project found a powerful emissions lever. Their analysis shows that airlines could slash lifecycle emissions using this pathway.

The researchers found that aviation has surprisingly few practical, near-term tools to cut emissions in a meaningful way.

“Unlike road transport, which is shifting toward electrification, there’s no silver-bullet for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,” said Jingran Zhang, the study’s first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-China Project.

“Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today’s engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.”

Turning trash into jet fuel

The pathway the team evaluated is well-established chemistry at industrial scale. Mixed municipal waste – including organic scraps, paper and cardboard, a portion of plastics, and other combustibles – is sorted and then gasified into a synthesis gas of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

After cleanup to remove contaminants, that “syngas” is fed into a Fischer–Tropsch reactor to build longer hydrocarbon chains.

The resulting liquids are upgraded into a kerosene-range blend that meets existing jet fuel specifications. Airlines can use it now without modifying engines or fueling infrastructure.

The headline is the life-cycle assessment: depending on configuration, MSW-derived jet fuel could cut greenhouse gas emissions by about 80 to 90 percent compared with conventional fossil jet.

Savings stem from diverting waste, preventing methane, and substituting petroleum with a far lower-carbon fuel. But a real bottleneck is scaling gasification systems that can reliably process mixed waste with consistent quality and uptime.

Boosting efficiency with hydrogen

Trash isn’t a uniform feedstock, and syngas composition doesn’t always perfectly match what Fischer–Tropsch reactors prefer.

In the scenarios the authors analyzed, only about one-third of the input carbon became fuel without additional process adjustments. This is good enough for big emissions gains, but is definitely improvable.

The analysis shows two levers to push efficiency higher: capture and recycle CO₂ within the plant, and blend in green hydrogen produced with renewable electricity.

Both tactics raise carbon utilization and fuel yield. They strengthen climate benefits and economics, especially in regions with supportive power and carbon policies.

Trash problem to jet fuel solution

MSW is a municipal headache nearly everywhere. Landfills consume land, leak methane, and are increasingly constrained. Incineration reduces volume but brings air quality challenges.

Routing appropriate fractions of that waste to fuel production offers cities a credible “zero-waste” pathway that also displaces fossil fuels.

The researchers emphasize that plastics must be handled carefully to meet sustainability criteria. However, with proper sorting and modern gas cleanup, a large fraction of urban trash becomes a reliable SAF feedstock rather than an environmental liability.

Global potential of trash jet fuel

Policy ambition for SAF is rising fast. The United States aims for up to 35 billion gallons per year by 2050, backed by tax credits.

The European Union is mandating rising SAF blends on all departing flights, from two percent in 2025 to 70 percent by mid-century.

Against that backdrop, the MSW potential is striking. In the study’s “practical” case, existing waste could produce about 50 million tons (roughly 62 billion liters) of jet fuel annually. That is enough to cut aviation’s lifecycle CO₂ by about 16 percent.

With green hydrogen integration and optimized plants, output could climb to 80 million tons per year. That would supply up to 28 percent of global jet fuel demand and avoid as much as 270 million tons of CO₂ annually.

Regionally, Europe’s potential from MSW alone would exceed near-term EU blending mandates while staying within sustainability guardrails.

Under carbon pricing and offset programs such as ICAO’s CORSIA, lower-carbon fuel also carries an economic edge: airlines reduce their compliance costs by burning fewer fossil tons, and incentives help close the price gap with conventional jet.

Scaling depends on policy

Despite strong climate performance, MSW-to-jet won’t scale on chemistry alone. Siting and financing large gasification plants, upgrading waste collection and sorting, securing long-term feedstock contracts with cities, and aligning utility-scale green hydrogen supply all require durable policy.

Production-side tax credits, contracts for difference that guarantee a stable SAF premium, and clear sustainability standards can unlock private capital.

On the demand side, blend mandates that ratchet up predictably give airlines and fuel producers the certainty to invest.

Trash and the future of jet fuel

“This study presents a blueprint for converting urban waste into sustainable aviation fuel, offering future environmental benefits,” said lead author Michael McElroy, a professor of environmental studies at Harvard.

“Broad collaboration among governments, fuel producers, airlines, and aircraft manufacturers will be essential to lower costs, and accelerate aviation’s path to net-zero emissions.”

The big picture is pragmatic. There’s no single fix for aviation. But MSW-derived SAF is one of the few options that can scale this decade using existing airplanes and pipelines. It also helps solve a waste problem that cities already pay to manage.

Pair it with efficiency gains, smarter operations, other certified SAF pathways, and hydrogen or electric aircraft where they make sense, and the sector’s path to deep decarbonization looks a lot more achievable.

The company marked the operational start of a new carbon-capture and storage (CCS) project, now labeled the world’s largest bioethanol carbon-capture facility.

What makes this milestone even more compelling isn’t just its scale. It was how their CCS project was achieved.

The project harnesses an existing 400-mile natural-gas transmission line formerly used for fossil fuel transport. It has been retrofitted and retooled to carry captured CO₂ from multiple ethanol plants to underground sequestration deep in Wyoming.

By repurposing infrastructure rather than building completely new pipelines and systems, the companies involved drastically reduced costs, expedited timelines, and reframed what a “new” facility can look like in the sustainability era.

The Project at a Glance

The pipeline in question is the Tallgrass Energy “Trailblazer” system. Formerly a natural-gas transmission line running through Wyoming, Colorado, and Nebraska, it has been converted to transport CO₂ from an array of ethanol plants, including ADM’s Columbus facility and plants operated by POET in Nebraska and Iowa.

The operation is designed to transport over ten million tons of CO₂ per year. The scale is equivalent to removing more than two million passenger vehicles from the road.

Reuse of Legacy Infrastructure

What sets this project apart is that the pipeline didn’t start as a CCS project. It was a natural-gas facility that found new life converted for a new purpose.

Adapting old infrastructure in this way carries several benefits. For one, the operation required fewer new rights-of-way, reduced need for entirely new construction, and faster integration. Smaller, lateral lines were constructed using voluntary easements from landowners, simplifying permitting and community engagement. Together, this meant far less disruption for ADM to accomplish their goals.

This adaptation underscores the theme: “old infrastructure, new purpose.” Rather than laying entirely new conduits across vast terrain, the project leveraged what was already in place. Doing so reduced cost, decreased logistical friction, and hastened its time-to-market.

Logistics, Community and Operational Detail

Capturing CO₂ at a bioethanol plant is itself complex. Fermentation processes release CO₂, which must be collected, compressed, and transported safely.

In this case, multiple ethanol plants now feed into the pipeline, creating a shared logistics infrastructure that benefits from economies of scale. Once transported, the CO₂ is injected deep underground in rock formations roughly 9,000 feet beneath the surface in southeast Wyoming.

Community engagement also played a significant role. Tallgrass worked with landowners and citizens’ groups, creating a community investment fund tied to the pipeline’s throughput (10 cents per metric ton of CO₂ sent).

Initial contributions toward local services such as early childhood development, senior care, and food pantries were given. This is a critical element of the project as repurposing infrastructure isn’t just a technical exercise—it has to fit socially and politically, too.

Reinforcing the Theme: Beyond the Pipeline

While the retrofitted pipeline is the highlight of this development, the project’s broader strategy reinforces the theme of transformation.

The ethanol plants themselves are evolving. By capturing their CO₂, they lower their carbon-intensity scores and position themselves for new markets such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

These plants were originally built for one purpose: fuel production. Now they’re adapting to serve a net-zero future. That second layer of reuse speaks to the broader mindset shift of legacy assets repurposed for modern climate goals.

From Old to New: Progress in the Carbon Transition

The transition to sustainable operations is no easy feat. New technology, shifting regulations, massive capital costs, and intricate logistics all stand as formidable barriers. Many decarbonization projects stall not because the science is impossible, but because the infrastructure and business-model challenges are real and steep.

Yet in this case, the company behind this facility demonstrated how a measure of ingenuity can go a long way. Choosing to repurpose an existing natural-gas line, building lateral connections via voluntary easements, and aligning community interests all unlocked what might otherwise have been prohibitively slow or expensive.

Their story serves as a beacon. It shows that while the challenges are steep, a path forward to a more sustainable future is very much possible.

Repurposing yesterday’s infrastructure for today’s climate challenge isn’t just clever… it’s necessary. And as we scale the next generation of decarbonization efforts, the “old-infrastructure, new-purpose” mindset may be one of our most effective tools.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Growth Factors

Aviation's climate strategy pivots on fuels with verifiable lifecycle cuts. CORSIA (ICAO) moved into wider implementation in 2024-2026, tightening accepted sustainability criteria and methodologies for SAF.

This compliance-grade carbon value is monetized. Airlines' decreasing reported emissions exposure can trim ETS-CORSIA liabilities. At the same time, producers earn higher credits in LCFS if they drive CI lower (for instance, via renewable power, green hydrogen, or CCUS on ethanol feedstocks). The global sustainable aviation fuel market is hence rewarding projects that can document traceability and additionally, increasing investment into digital MRV and lower-CI feedstocks.

The price delta remains the central brake, but it's easing at the margin. Based on the region and feedstock, SAF premiums have commonly ranged $2 to $4/gal above Jet-A. With IRA + LCFS, specific United States lanes can compress this to sub-$1-$2/gal efficient premiums for qualifying low-CI volumes, mainly for HEFA and some ATJ routes tied to low-CI ethanol.

In a project funded by the Minnesota corn checkoff, Dauenhauer is testing a series of metal catalysts, to see which could produce the highest yield at the greatest economic efficiency.
“Using existing technology you can make methanol into jet fuel.
“In 2022, the USA produced about 14 billion bushels of corn (~360 million tonnes of corn, source: USDA),” Dauenhauer wrote in his research proposal.
“(That same year), the USA consumed about 145 million tonnes of diesel fuel (source: EIA).","With support from Minnesota Corn, Professor Paul Dauenhauer is exploring the corn-to-methanol pathway for biofuels.

Modern corn ethanol is a marvel of clean fuel production, harnessing the energy of the sun to make a single seed into 600 or more kernels, and then rendering the glucose polymers in the grain into an alcohol fuel. Modern production efficiency renders nearly three gallons of fuel from every bushel.

Making alcohol is a biological catalytic process as old as civilization, but, even with the latest refinements, the biology in the process requires the sacrifice of about a third of the glucose molecules in the lifecycle of the yeast catalyst, producing CO2 along with the alcohol.

Paul Dauenhauer, a University of Minnesota Professor of Chemical Engineering, asks, what if there were a process that could utilize 100% of the corn glucose polymers to make fuel? He believes an inorganic catalyst could turn all those molecules into another form of alcohol, called methanol.

In a project funded by the Minnesota corn checkoff, Dauenhauer is testing a series of metal catalysts, to see which could produce the highest yield at the greatest economic efficiency.

“Methanol has a universality to it,” Dauenhauer said. “Using existing technology you can make methanol into jet fuel. You can also make clean burning diesel fuel, and you can make polyethylene polymers—plastics.”

The jet fuel made this way achieves a major reduction of carbon emissions, and so qualifies as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—corn-based methanol could potentially supply that entire American SAF market, he said.

He believes this new process will yield 50% more fuel, while still leaving the corn fiber, protein and oil for coproducts like distillers grains animal feed.

“In 2022, the USA produced about 14 billion bushels of corn (~360 million tonnes of corn, source: USDA),” Dauenhauer wrote in his research proposal. “(That same year), the USA consumed about 145 million tonnes of diesel fuel (source: EIA). Using about half of the annually produced corn would provide the renewable carbon required to manufacture all of the country’s current jet fuel consumption.”

The “universality” of the methanol molecule will allow biorefineries to respond to the various markets and direct production into different amounts of jet fuel, diesel, or plastic, depending on demand, Dauenhauer said.

Methanol-based diesel also offers a huge environmental benefit.

Dauenhauer said, “You manufacture a molecule called dimethyl ether…People have been talking about it for a long time. The benefit of using dimethyl ether in a diesel engine versus conventional diesel is it burns really cleanly. All the problems you have with exhaust with a conventional diesel engine, you would not have with methanol-based diesel.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Minnesota_Corn_Nov25_6f013edadd.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:57:43.986467

“[Trump] may be skipping COP30, but his fossil fuel allies aren’t,” Collin Rees, U.S. campaign manager at Oil Change International told DeSmog.
The IETA is a business lobby group made of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers and greenhouse gas emitters.
He also defunded renewable energies and accelerated drilling for planet-heating oil and gas, while branding the climate crisis a “con job”.
Fossil fuel executives are the arsonists of the climate crisis.","Top American oil and gas producers are using trade groups to gain access to this year’s COP30 climate summit in the absence of an official U.S. delegation, DeSmog can report.

ExxonMobil and Chevron — which are among the fossil fuel industry’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters — have sent a combined total of 13 executives to the talks, while both companies have either sponsored events or pavilions at the conference.

In addition, Exxon CEO Darren Woods spoke at a number of COP30 side events, including one in Sao Paolo on November 3, where he noted in an interview with Reuters that crude oil and hydrocarbons were “going to play a critical role in everybody’s life for a long time to come”.

U.S. President Donald Trump took the unprecedented step of deciding against sending an official U.S. delegation to the COP30 climate summit, where over 50,000 delegates are gathered in the Amazon city of Bélem, Brazil.

“[Trump] may be skipping COP30, but his fossil fuel allies aren’t,” Collin Rees, U.S. campaign manager at Oil Change International told DeSmog. “This is proof that Big Oil still holds a dangerous sway over the climate process.”

The 13 executives identified by DeSmog are among the more than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists attending this year’s summit. This is the largest ever proportion recorded at a climate conference, according to a new analysis published today (Friday) by the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition, a coalition calling to remove fossil fuel companies and lobbyists from influencing climate negotiations.

Fossil fuels are the biggest contributors to the climate crisis, and Exxon and Chevron are among the 57 polluters directly linked to 80 percent of the world’s global fossil CO2 emissions since the 2016 Paris Agreement. Two years ago, the COP28 summit in Dubai ended with a historic call to “transition away” from fossil fuels to meet climate targets, but emissions from polluting fuels are on track to hit a record high this year.

Exxon and Chevron also have a history of delaying action on climate change through lobbying and false advertising. Earlier this month, DeSmog and The Guardian revealed how Exxon funded think tanks to spread climate denial in Latin America and across the Global South during the 1990s and early 2000s.

Both companies say they are committed to climate action, but neither has committed to a 2050 net zero target that includes Scope 3 emissions from the burning of their fuel, which make up the vast bulk of their polluting gases.

Exxon and Chevron did not respond to DeSmog’s request for comment.

This was the first year in COP history when attendees have been able to voluntarily disclose which organisation or individual paid for their attendance.

Analysis of the delegates list reveal that the Geneva-based International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), which counts ExxonMobil as a member, paid for two Exxon executives to attend, as well as delegates from BP and TotalEnergies. Meanwhile Washington D.C.-based Thaddeus Segal from ExxonMobil, senior director of Exxon’s global energy transition in public and government affairs, accessed the talks as part of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) delegation.

The IETA is a business lobby group made of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers and greenhouse gas emitters. This year, the group’s pavilion was sponsored for a second year running by Chevron, among other polluters, including BP. As DeSmog reported last year, the group’s COP29 pavilion in Baku, Azerbaijan, was also sponsored by ExxonMobil.

DeSmog also found that ExxonMobil is sponsoring a “high-level” side-event on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) on November 15, hosted by the U.S. and Brazilian Chamber of Commerce and pesticides giant Bayer. Here, Exxon “leaders” will speak alongside members of Congress on the “economics and policy support to scale sustainable aviation fuel [SAF]”.

Experts have warned that the widespread production of SAF without sustainable practices could lead to deforestation, loss of biodiversity and competition for land with food crops.

Chevron, meanwhile, has gained access to the talks through industry groups IPIECA, a London-headquartered global oil and gas group which focuses on providing an industry channel into official UN proceedings. The group sent just three delegates: two of its own employees, and a third from Chevron.

This year, the American Petroleum Institute (API)sent just one delegate — also an executive from Chevron. The Washington D.C.-based API is the world’s biggest oil and gas industry group, with a history of undermining the global consensus on climate change.

A third Chevron executive attended as the sole delegate of the European Roundtable on Climate Change and Sustainable Transition, an independent Brussels-based think tank.

Exxon’s Woods also headlined a COP30 launch event on November 7 in Brasilia, hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Amcham Brasil to “discuss business solutions for carbon accounting and emission reductions”. Exxon has joined an industry effort to create a new carbon accounting system to create more accurate calculations of emissions-intensity, which critics have described as a “new climate delay tactic”.

Speaking on Bloomberg’s Zero podcast on the sidelines of COP, Woods praised Trump for changing the “paradigms” of the energy transition, but insisted Exxon still has a role to play in lowering emissions. Since his inauguration in January, Trump has quit the Paris Agreement, the legally-binding international treaty to limit catastrophic temperature rise. He also defunded renewable energies and accelerated drilling for planet-heating oil and gas, while branding the climate crisis a “con job”.

Meanwhile, away from COP, Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said on Wednesday that revival of international oil and gas exploration could be at least partly attributed to the President’s energy policies.

“The Trump administration has played a critical role in opening doors and creating an environment where people are looking to do these kinds of deals,” he told Bloomberg TV.

Rees of Oil Change International said: “Trump is the fossil fuel industry’s best investment and the world is paying the price.”

He called for fossil fuel companies to be denied access to the talks.

“No Big Oil executive can claim their objectives align with the UN’s multilateral climate treaty,” Rees said.

“These companies continue to drill, pollute, and profit from the destruction of our planet and communities. Fossil fuel executives are the arsonists of the climate crisis. They cannot be trusted to help extinguish the fire.”",https://www.desmog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3D4E3TE-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 11:57:49.642033

CEO

Hajj and Umrah Airport – Jeddah – KSA

Adnan Saggaf continues to demonstrate strong leadership skills throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and brought out of the box ideas in attracting traffic and to support his team during this difficult time. With new innovative ideas in balancing cash flow, the facilities were kept maintained and the personal were kept employed.

Saggaf has protected the financial stability of his staff income, ensured valuable cost cutting management, shown excellent performance of crisis management, and exceptional negotiation skills shown with authority regarding agreement restructuring and receivable payments.

To handle the loss of Umrah traffic to the airport, Saggaf chose to attract new airlines, mainly LCCs, to use the terminal with attractive offers and more reliable services. He built a new strategy by diversifying the airport offers. He prepared the facilities by deploying new technology and working on enhancing passenger experience. Saggaf also initiated a capacity building programme for the airside team by drafting SOPS, training and coaching, as well as initiating dedicated workshops to discuss ideas and to deploy new initiatives.

Leaders show strength in difficult times, and this is exactly what Saggaf showed and why he deserves to be awarded as the Person of the year 2021.

Head of Operations, Safety and Emergency

Belo Horizonte International Airport

Robson Freitas has developed and led the BH Airport plan for the resumption of airport operations post-COVID-19, as well as being responsible for leading the group of Directors and Managers at the airport, defining the three main pillars of recovery: Health and Safety of People, Institutional and Integrated Communication and Institutional Partners. These central pillars include ensuring hygiene and health and social distances measures for passengers, users, and the airport community, in addition to participating in strategic committees involving the public sectors to comply with regulatory rules. Freitas developed the COVID guardians programme, who were responsible in monitoring and following up on the measures already implemented for COVID-19 and advising users, employees and other people on compliance with distancing, hygiene and health measures recommended by health authorities. He also developed a COVID booklet with information and guidance for the airport community regarding good hygiene and health practices and led the beginning of the publication of a monthly newsletter with passenger curve information, allowing the planning of reopening and rehiring by commercial stores. Freitas also supported the reduction of OPEX by planning the temporary closure of areas, toilets and equipment in common use and internalising some activities.

Chief Strategy Development Officer

Bangalore International Airport Limited

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Raghunath worked closely with all the aero concessionaires and cargo operators to minimise disruption and provide financial relief to them. The airline marketing team helped launch a historic first route to the U.S. West Coast and the cargo team at BIAL also achieved record numbers over this period, with the airport becoming India’s leading airport for the export of perishables. Despite the impact of COVID-19, Raghunath has led a digital transformation and expansion at BIAL airport, with new initiatives and the deployment of the fully biometric-based self-boarding solution for seamless passenger flow and travel experiences and a process automation and analytics platform. These initiatives amongst many others, meant that the airport won ACI World’s ‘Voice of the Customer’ initiative, which recognised BIAL airports efforts to prioritise their customers during COVID-19. Raghunath has remained a staunch and resilient leader during such an uncertain time and is very much appreciated by his team.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

Airport General Manager

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport

Balram Bheodari leads Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as North America’s most efficient airport, due to his vast knowledge of and astute attention to efficiency in aviation, which has allowed the airport to thrive in the most difficult of markets. Bheodari combines operational expertise, integrity, and selflessness to provide a quality of leadership throughout Atlanta Airport. He oversees all facets of airport governance, including operations and a multi-billion-dollar capital improvement programme, ATLNext, designed to pave the way for Atlanta’s growth over the next 20 years. During COVID-19, Bheodari developed a comprehensive resumption of operations playbook that served to support ATL’s recovery efforts. With guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) amid evolving health and safety guidelines, Bheodari steadfastly encouraged collaboration among stakeholders, team-building among aviation employees, and adaptability in uncertain times. Throughout the pandemic, he participated in daily calls with Airports Council International and other large-hub airports to share best practices as well as information from Washington, D.C. federal offices and the CDC.

He aimed to restore customer confidence and ensure the airport was a healthy facility using COVID-19 safe protocols. Since, the airport achieved Airport of the Year by the Airport Minority Advisory Council (AMAC).

During the height of the pandemic, Bheodari was the most ardent supporter of our mission-critical employees. Having worked his way up through the ranks, he fully appreciates the oftentimes thankless jobs these employees perform that keep the Airport safe and running optimally at all times. Morale never flagged because Bheodari made sure those employees felt valued through hazard pay, special meals, social media posts, intranet spotlight features, and other incentives.

His actions and his directives all reflect his commitment to the three key focus areas of our organisation’s strategic plan: people, purpose and performance.

CEO

Swedavia Airports

Jonas Abrahamsson has shown the strength to steer the company towards its long-term sustainable goals, despite the challenges of COVID-19. Abrahamsson has ensured that Swedavia achieved its net zero target for all ten of the airports in 2020 and has continued to support strategic development and innovation to further the cause of sustainable air travel. During 2020, when passenger numbers where down over 90 per cent and a lot of investments were paused, he decided that investments in the company’s net zero target should proceed, allowing Swedavia to become the first net zero airport group by the end of 2020.

Chief Executive Officer

Budapest Airport

Chris Dinsdale has worked at Budapest Airport since 2015, originally as CFO until March 2021, where he was nominated for the position as CEO. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dinsdale, as CFO of the airport at the time, fought relentlessly to make sure that the company survived the crisis and worked with great commitment to secure the funding of the airport. For example, a voluntary salary cut for the executives and the founding of the Budapest Airport Foundation, which supports blue collar workers who lost their job during the COVID-19 pandemic.

After being nominated to CEO position in March 2021, Dinsdale continues to work closely with the executive team to create a clear COVID-19 recovery strategy for Budapest Airport. This will also mean that we come out stronger of the pandemic and have a clear focus. Dinsdale is an inspiring true leader who helped us all to cope with the very difficult times of the pandemic and I am convinced that he truly deserves this award.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/IAS25-Register-Now-Banners-2_1200x628-BYG-e1755764536394.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 10:56:25.625650

Multiple levers, working in parallel Industry bodies like ATAG recognise the complexity of decarbonising aviation in their Waypoint 2050 report (2nd edition, 2021).
For this specific flight, Airbus has selected CDRs from reforestation projects in Mexico which are certified by the Climate Action Reserve (vintage 2022-2023).
When it comes to Book and Claim, Airbus has launched its own Demonstrator in collaboration with RSB.","When it comes to decarbonising the aviation industry, there’s no single solution that can magically cut emissions. Instead, it’s a layered task: multiple levers need to be put to work together, each one reducing and addressing emissions in its own way. Airbus is putting this idea into practice, combining four levers in a single flight.

Between 17-21 November 2025, Dubai Airshow will open its doors to the public. With the tagline ‘The Future is Here’, this 19th edition of the show has a focus on technological advancements, innovative products and technologies. Where better for Airbus to bring together four key complementary levers in a single flight – latest generation aircraft, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Book and Claim (B&C) and carbon dioxide removals (CDR) – to showcase how each of these levers can play a part in reducing the emissions gap.

Today, around 30% of the world’s in-service aircraft fleet are of the latest generation, which deliver a 20-30% fuel saving compared to their predecessors. Replacing older aircraft with more modern ones – like the Airbus A350-1000, which first entered into service in 2018, and requires on average 25% less fuel than previous generation aircraft – is a key way for the aviation industry to make progress towards decarbonisation.

In fact, it is an Airbus A350-1000, flying from Toulouse to Dubai, which will provide an opportunity to showcase the various decarbonisation levers in a single flight. While the use of all these levers in routine operations is still rare and challenging for airlines to implement, this showcase aims to emphasise the point that no single technology in isolation can help the aviation industry reach its decarbonisation targets.

Multiple levers, working in parallel

Industry bodies like ATAG recognise the complexity of decarbonising aviation in their Waypoint 2050 report (2nd edition, 2021). In their three scenarios which depart from a continuation of current trends, SAF remains the lever with the capacity to make the greatest difference, accounting for between 53-71% of emissions reduction contributions in 2050. This depends on the level of ambition and commitment with which the industry embraces decarbonisation and the particular levers that gain the most focus and support.

Alongside SAF, market-based measures such as carbon dioxide removals will be needed to close the emissions gap by 2050. This combination of SAF and carbon removals or other emission mitigation options presents the industry with a practical solution to many of the challenges that put pressure on the wider adoption of SAF.

Inspired by these scenarios, Airbus is deploying the following levers to address each tranche of emissions created during the flight:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

The A350 is travelling from Airbus’ operational headquarters in Toulouse, France, to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to participate in the Dubai Airshow flying display. For this flight the A350 will benefit from a 35% blend of physical SAF. The remaining 65% will be conventional aviation fuel (CAF).

Toulouse is well-served to supply SAF, as it benefits from not only the infrastructure at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport but also Airbus’ own dedicated fuelling facilities, but this is not the case for all cities. So what options are there when SAF is not readily available or where an airline or operator may wish to have a greater percentage of SAF than is physically available on site?

Book and Claim (B&C)

An airport or airline may be enthusiastic about using SAF, and willing to pay the additional cost to acquire it – SAF costs between 2-7x conventional aviation fuel, depending on the feedstock – but there may be logistical challenges that make it complex to have SAF delivered where they operate, for example, being located in a part of the world without easy access to SAF producers or suppliers.

For this reason, there exists an accounting mechanism called ‘Book and Claim’ that enables airlines and airports to be able to take advantage of SAF without needing to physically take delivery of it. We can use this to virtually replace the CAF on the flight. By using Book and Claim, Airbus purchases SAF emissions reduction certificates from an independent registry, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), an NGO that defines sustainability standards for SAF.

In simple terms, the Book and Claim mechanism allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Book and Claim could be a key lever in the scaling of SAF, connecting supply and demand and improving SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those located far from supply points or production facilities. In practice, this means the physical SAF is delivered to another operator, which then consumes the amount of SAF as indicated by the certificate.

Carbon dioxide removals (CDR)

Even by effectively replacing all of the fuel with SAF (through a mixture of physical SAF and through SAF Book and Claim certificates), emissions remain. Airbus will use carbon dioxide removal (CDR) units to neutralise the residual emissions of this flight. CDR is a credible measure for addressing residual remaining emissions by physically removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it. For this specific flight, Airbus has selected CDRs from reforestation projects in Mexico which are certified by the Climate Action Reserve (vintage 2022-2023).

What does this showcase reveal about aviation’s path to decarbonisation?

The whole industry needs to come together to tackle decarbonisation, from airlines to airports, and fuel producers to OEMs like Airbus, as well as regulatory bodies. We are playing our part: increasing the use of SAF in our own operations with fuel providers like TotalEnergies, participating in the SAFFA Fund alongside AirFrance-KLM Group and Qantas, amongst others, and investing directly in SAF producers like LanzaJet.

When it comes to Book and Claim, Airbus has launched its own Demonstrator in collaboration with RSB. The demonstrator has the ambition to facilitate demand from some of its smaller-scale customers and connect it with supply, making it easier for these clients to access SAF. Airbus has also been working to raise the profile and credibility of Book and Claim as a mechanism. As yet, Book and Claim is not recognised by the regulated markets – neither by the EU Renewable Energy Directive nor by CORSIA – however Airbus believes this could be a powerful lever to make SAF more accessible and is advocating for the recognition of this lever.

The aviation industry will not reach its long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions overnight. To achieve this by 2050 will take hard work, investment, regulatory support, and the willingness of all industry participants to drive progress. The industry agrees that multiple levers are the way to go. This flight takes that idea, and puts it in the air.",https://mediaassets.airbus.com/medias/domain38/media102142/642843-6f5j6v2vyc-preview.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 09:58:23.596283

The UK Government is mandating Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blending as a requirement for all suppliers of Aviation fuel – starting at 2% in 2025 and rising to 22% by 2040 – and backing industry with price guarantees to accelerate production, reduce costs, and support net-zero goals. SAF is key to greener air travel, economic growth, and circular energy innovation.1

Key purpose of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill introduces a statutory Revenue Certainty Mechanism to support the commercial production of SAF in the UK. It aims to reduce investment risk and enable the construction of first-of-a-kind commercial SAF plants, while directly contributing to the UK's aviation decarbonisation targets.

The first reading in the Lords took place on 20 October 2025, with the date for the second reading yet to be announced, but Royal Assent expected by the end of 2026.2

How the SAF Bill works: key features explained

Revenue certainty contracts To support investment in UK SAF Production, the Bill introduces a Revenue Certainty Mechanism. The Secretary of State may instruct a government-owned counterparty to enter contracts with SAF producers, guaranteeing a fixed ""strike price"" for SAF over a defined period.

If the market price falls below the strike price, the counterparty pays the producer the difference.

If the market price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays the counterparty the surplus.

This mechanism mirrors the UK's Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme used in low-carbon electricity and hydrogen, in which the mechanism aims to lower financing costs, boost investor confidence, and accelerate final investment decisions for SAF plants.

The mechanism is intended to be a time-limited measure to stimulate an early market for SAF and will become obsolete once investor confidence is proven on a commercial scale.

Designated counterparty The counterparty must be a company wholly owned by the government. It is responsible for issuing and managing contracts with SAF producers, handling payments under the strike price mechanism, and administering the overall scheme.

Levy funding The mechanism is funded through a variable levy imposed on UK aviation fuel suppliers, calculated according to each supplier's market share of aviation turbine fuel. This approach reflects the ""Polluter Pays"" principle under the Environmental Act 2021. This levy covers:

Payments under strike price contracts

Administrative costs of the scheme

The levy adjusts to market fluctuations through recurring charging periods, with potential redistribution of surplus funds to levy payers when market prices exceed strike price. Suppliers may need to provide financial collateral to ensure payment security.

Placing the levy on fuel suppliers distributes costs across the supply chain, targets those with SAF Mandate obligations and minimises administrative burden.

Administration and enforcement The counterparty (a government-owned company) is responsible for administering both the levy and the contractual framework, with oversight and support from the Secretary of State. To ensure compliance with levy regulations, the Secretary of State is empowered to impose financial penalties of up to £100,000 or 10% of a supplier's turnover.

Oversight and flexibility The Secretary of State retains powers to direct the government-owned counterparty, request relevant information, and provide financial assistance to support the scheme. Key regulations underpinning the mechanism are subject to parliamentary approval, ensuring appropriate oversight. The Bill applies across the UK, with consultation requirements in place for devolved administrations to ensure coordinated implementation.

Policy rationale The mechanism is designed to address key investment barriers – including technology readiness, feedstock availability, construction risk, and revenue uncertainty. It complements the UK's SAF Mandate, which requires fuel suppliers to blend a minimum proportion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, by offering long-term price certainty. Together, these measures aim to unlock private investment and accelerate the commercial-scale production of SAF in the UK.

By Craig Langford

Rolls-Royce is leading a new UK research initiative aimed at finding more effective ways to use sustainable aviation fuel to reduce both carbon and non-carbon emissions, the company stated.

The two-year project, known as Quantifying Reduction in Thermal Contrails by Optimising SAF (QRITOS), is co-funded through the Non-CO2 Programme under the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI). It brings together Rolls-Royce, British Airways, Imperial College London, and Heathrow Airport to study how smarter deployment of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, could reduce the climate impact of contrails.

While SAF is already recognised for its potential to cut carbon emissions compared with fossil jet fuel, studies have shown that it can also reduce the number of ice crystals that form in aircraft contrails. According to Rolls-Royce, fewer and thinner contrails could lessen aviation’s wider climate impact.

Alan Newby, Director of Research and Technology at Rolls-Royce, said “SAF will not only play a vital role in decarbonising aviation, but has also been shown to reduce certain non-CO2 emissions. This project will demonstrate smarter ways of using SAF which could unlock additional value through reducing non-CO2 climate effects as well.”

Because contrails are only formed under specific weather conditions, most of the climate effect is caused by a relatively small number of flights. The QRITOS project aims to determine whether SAF can be prioritised for those flights most likely to produce persistent contrails, using flight trials, atmospheric modelling, and satellite data collected at Heathrow.

Marcin Dutka, Environmental Sustainability Technologist at Rolls-Royce and project manager for QRITOS, said “Measurements have already shown that fuel composition can influence contrail properties. This project aims to demonstrate how contrail climate impact might be reduced by targeting SAF at flights predicted to form persistent contrails.”

British Airways is contributing operational data from its fleet. “At British Airways, we believe sustainable aviation fuel is central to the future of flying,” said Tom Byrne, the airline’s Head of Net Zero and Environment. “Through the QRITOS project, we’re exploring how SAF can go beyond reducing carbon emissions to also help minimise the climate impact of contrails.”

Heathrow Airport is also participating. Matt Gorman, Director of Carbon Strategy, said “As SAF continues to scale it is important to take a closer look at how we can use it to deliver the greatest climate benefit. As one of the world’s busiest airports we’re proud to participate in this project to demonstrate how targeted SAF use could help to address non-CO2 emissions.”

The research team at Imperial College London will develop new computational models and satellite imaging tools to monitor contrail formation. Associate Professor Sebastian Eastham said “We will develop and trial advanced computational contrail modelling and satellite image analysis techniques, with the goal of performing both prediction and near real-time assessment of the effectiveness of targeted SAF deployment for contrail warming reduction.”

Industry Minister Chris McDonald described the project as an example of collaboration between government and business. “This is government and business working together at its best, and I look forward to seeing how this Rolls-Royce project can help keep UK industry at the forefront of the race for sustainable aviation,” he said.

According to the ATI, QRITOS will conclude in April 2027 and aims to improve forecasting methods, advance understanding of contrail formation, and develop new ways to verify environmental outcomes using satellite data.",https://ifairworthy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Blue-IFA-Logo-Graphic.png,N,,2025-11-14 09:58:42.517114

On November 13, 2025, Airbus formally handed over the first A330-900neo to Air Algérie at its Toulouse delivery center. This event immediately launched the Algerian flag carrier into a new phase of long-haul operations. The aircraft, registered 7T-VTA and named “Novembre 54” in homage to the date that sparked the Algerian Revolution in 1954, completed its ferry flight the same day and touched down at Algiers Houari Boumediene International Airport to an official welcome ceremony. Exclusively powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, this delivery marks the opening chapter of a firm commitment for 10 A330-900neo aircraft, with deliveries expected to be completed by mid-2027.

Omar Ali Adib, Senior Vice President, Customers at Rolls-Royce, underlined the strategic importance of the partnership during the handover: “It is an honour to power Air Algérie’s new-generation widebodies with our Trent 7000 engines. For over 70 years, the airline has proudly served Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. Today, it is extending its global reach towards Asia and beyond. The arrival of the A330neo opens a new chapter of efficiency, sustainability, and ambition. Rolls-Royce is proud to stand alongside Air Algérie as it positions Algiers as a bridge between continents.”

The journey to this ten-aircraft contract began in June 2023 when Air Algérie originally signed for seven widebodies: five A330-900neo and two A350-1000s. Early in 2025, the carrier made the pragmatic decision to convert both A350-1000 positions into additional A330-900neo, prioritizing complete fleet commonality on the long-haul side to minimize training, spare parts, and maintenance costs. Subsequent option exercises and production-slot agreements subsequently increased the firm order to ten aircraft. The updated delivery schedule calls for four examples (including the one just received) before the end of 2025, with the remaining six arriving at a steady pace throughout 2026 and the first half of 2027. Temporary leases of both A330neo and older A330ceo aircraft are ensuring uninterrupted capacity during the transition period.

Air Algérie’s choice of the A330-900neo is rooted in a combination of operational efficiency and environmental performance that is particularly well-suited to its network profile. The Rolls-Royce Trent 7000, the sole powerplant available on the A330neo family, delivers a 14 % reduction in fuel burn per seat compared with the Trent 700 that equips the airline’s current eight A330-200s, while cutting perceived noise by half (6 dB) and offering full compatibility with 100 % Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Those improvements translate directly into lower operating costs at a time of persistently high fuel prices and ever-stricter carbon regulations on the carrier’s core European routes. With a range of 13,300 km in typical configuration, the aircraft comfortably enables non-stop operations from Algiers to Beijing, Guangzhou, Johannesburg, or even the North American East Coast without payload restrictions.

Inside, the cabin benefits from Airbus’s latest Airspace design: larger overhead bins, advanced LED mood lighting, higher humidity levels, and the quietest environment in its class. Air Algérie has opted for a three-class layout that places particular emphasis on long-haul comfort, featuring fully-flat beds in business class, a dedicated premium-economy section, and significantly improved economy seating with the newest generation of in-flight entertainment and connectivity options. Exact seat counts have not yet been disclosed publicly. Still, the configuration is understood to be in the 300–320-seat range, balancing premium offerings for diaspora traffic with the higher density required on high-demand leisure routes.

Operationally, the ten new A330-900neo will first replace the ageing A330-200 fleet, whose average age now approaches 18 years, and then fuel an ambitious expansion program. The very first aircraft is expected to enter commercial service before the end of November 2025, initially reinforcing frequencies to Paris, Montreal, Istanbul, and Dubai before inaugurating the long-awaited Beijing route. Guangzhou is scheduled to follow in 2026, while sub-Saharan Africa will see rapid growth: Ndjamena was relaunched in October 2025, and Addis Ababa, Libreville, Luanda, and several additional points are confirmed for the coming months, with a stated objective of doubling the airline’s African network by 2028.

This long-haul renewal forms only one pillar of a much broader modernization effort validated at the presidential level. Eight Boeing 737 MAX 9 will modernize medium-haul operations from 2027 onward, while fifteen ATR 72-600 will strengthen domestic and regional connectivity through a forthcoming dedicated subsidiary. By 2030, Air Algérie targets a fleet of 75–80 aircraft, with an average age reduced by more than half, restoring sustained profitability after the heavy losses incurred during the pandemic and enabling consistent double-digit annual growth.

For Algeria’s national carrier, the arrival of “Novembre 54” is far more than the simple addition of a new aircraft type. It represents the concrete manifestation of a strategic pivot designed to recapture market share lost to Royal Air Maroc, EgyptAir, Ethiopian Airlines, and the major Gulf carriers on key Europe–Africa corridors, while capitalizing on the country’s geographic position and the purchasing power of its large diaspora in France and Canada. With quieter, cleaner, and dramatically more efficient Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines powering its wings, Air Algérie has equipped itself to compete aggressively in an aviation landscape where sustainability and cost control are non-negotiable. The new era of growth promised by this first A330-900neo is now officially underway.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/75f19d50bbd7f16ccf14d26f9dfc6127_S.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 09:58:55.376372
,,2025-11-14 10:15:00+00:00,IEA,Unlocking investment opportunities in Latin America's energy transition – Analysis - IEA,Not Available,,,,,https://www.iea.org/commentaries/unlocking-investment-opportunities-in-latin-america-s-energy-transition,"It examines energy investment trends in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) since 2015, highlighting investment opportunities for the region as countries look to support economic growth, enhance energy security and accelerate clean energy transitions while ensuring energy affordability and access.
Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago.
However, in the IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario (APS), annual clean energy investment in Latin America would exceed USD 200 billion, more than triple anticipated investment levels in 2025.
Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources.
Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services.","Globally, energy-related investments are set to reach USD 3.3 trillion in 2025, according to the IEA’s latest World Energy Investment 2025 report. Around USD 2.2 trillion is expected to go collectively towards renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, efficiency and the electrification of end-use sectors, with USD 1.1 trillion going to oil, gas and coal.

This analysis, prepared jointly by the IEA and the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), dives further into the latest data. It examines energy investment trends in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) since 2015, highlighting investment opportunities for the region as countries look to support economic growth, enhance energy security and accelerate clean energy transitions while ensuring energy affordability and access.

Latin America has some of the world’s best solar, wind and hydro resources, and it is a pioneer in the development of biofuels and renewable power. Leveraging these assets, the region has seen clean energy investment grow by 25% since 2015. Spending on renewables, grids, energy efficiency and electrification are on course to increase to about USD 70 billion in 2025.

Fossil fuel resources are unevenly distributed across the region; some countries are heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, while others are major exporters. Today, fossil fuel spending accounts for just over 55% of total energy investments, compared with nearly 65% a decade ago. This year’s fossil fuel investment is expected to be about 20% lower than in 2015.

Overall, energy investment in the region is projected to reach USD 160 billion in 2025. This would be around 7% lower than a decade earlier, though this can be explained in part by cost declines over this period, both for both for upstream oil and gas activities as well as for key clean energy technologies.

Fifteen countries1 in the region have pledged to reach net zero emissions by mid-century. Meanwhile, a slightly different group of 15 LAC countries2 have put forward new Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement with targets for 2035. Across the region, meeting announced energy and climate targets would require a significant acceleration in investment in low-emissions power generation, grids and storage, low-emissions fuels, energy efficiency and the electrification of end-uses. Based on today’s policy settings, annual clean energy investments would exceed USD 110 billion by 2035, rising by 60% from current levels. However, in the IEA’s Announced Policies Scenario (APS), annual clean energy investment in Latin America would exceed USD 200 billion, more than triple anticipated investment levels in 2025. Investments in EVs would need the largest amounts of additional capital, with investment needs for energy efficiency and electrification nearly quadrupling and accounting for about 45% of end-use investments in 2035.

Grids in particular will need a boost in spending; as with many other regions, spending on distribution and transmission have not kept up with the rapid growth in solar and wind capacity. Today, for each dollar spent on new power generation in the region, less than USD 0.50 is spent on grids and storage. By 2035, this needs to reach about USD 0.85, with total spending on grids and storage reaching nearly USD 50 billion under the APS.

As energy transitions in LAC accelerate under the APS, investments in fossil fuels decline, reaching about 50% of 2015 levels by 2035. Total spending on fossil fuels drops by over USD 30 billion by then, with much of this reduction offset by a sharp increase in investments in low-emissions fuels, which rise to nearly five times current levels.

Policymakers in Latin America and the Caribbean have major opportunities to expand energy investment, especially due to the region’s vast renewable resources. Northern Chile and Western Argentina have high-quality solar radiation, while the “Southern Cone”3 and Northern Colombia offer highly productive wind corridors. Brazil has well-established bioenergy and sustainable fuel industries, along with most of the continent’s installed capacity in distributed solar, utility-scale solar and wind generation. Capacity across these categories is also expanding in Argentina, Colombia and Paraguay. In the Caribbean, countries are exploring solar, storage and hybrid projects to reduce fossil fuel dependence and increase energy security. These are very much in line with the ambitious targets adopted in the region: Barbados seeks to establish a 100% renewable power mix by 2035, and Antigua and Barbuda aims to source one-third of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. And many other countries, including Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia and Dominica, have policies in place to support significant decarbonisation efforts in the coming decade.

For the moment, the region receives only 5% of global private investment in clean energy, compared with 8% of private sector spending on fossil fuels. There are, however, multiple examples from across LAC that show how a clear vision for energy transitions and a willingness to engage with the private sector can produce results.

Across two auctions in 2024, Brazil raised nearly USD 4 billion to build almost 7 300 kilometres (km) of new transmission lines. In October 2025, another auction was successfully held for the construction and operation of more than 1 000 km of new lines. These investments, which aim to strengthen the grid, integrate more renewable energy and improve system reliability, show how competitive auctions can attract private capital for major infrastructure projects.

In Argentina, the first large-scale auction (AlmaGBA) for a battery energy storage system (BESS) targeted the installation of 500 megawatts (MW) of capacity in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. The market responded strongly, with over 1 300 MW in bids and a final allocation of around 660 MW. The programme focused on congested areas and enabled greater renewable integration.

In Honduras, energy storage is being used to stabilise the electricity system in regions where renewable expansion is limited by transmission capacity and variability, showing that flexibility solutions are spreading across the region beyond large electricity markets. The National Electricity Company (ENEE) launched an international tender in 2025 to contract 1 500 MW of firm capacity to secure electricity supply through 2030. At least 65% of capacity must come from renewables with storage under a multi-round reverse auction and a Build-Operate-Transfer scheme with contracts of about 15 years.

This year, the Dominican Republic, through its National Energy Commission (CNE) and the Dominican Hydroelectric Generation Company (EGEHID), also launched an international tender for up to 600 MW of new renewable capacity with mandatory storage, with the aim of diversifying the country’s energy mix, reducing fossil fuel dependence and achieving 30% renewable generation by 2030 under long-term power purchase agreements spanning from 15 to 20 years.

In Chile, a strong regulatory framework is in place that encourages battery integration and transmission improvements as renewable penetration grows.

Overall, these initiatives show that countries across the region are actively fostering conditions for further growth in energy investment, particularly amid their shift toward more resilient, flexible and renewable energy-focused power systems.

Regional energy integration is a key tool to harmonise planning, facilitate decision-making and enable the development of larger-scale projects. In line with this objective, OLADE created in 2024 a Regional Energy Planning Council, whose goal is to act as a regional coordination platform that identifies opportunities for integration and promotes a common energy agenda by helping energy ministers share information, reach agreements and align national planning efforts. The broader aim is to speed up the energy transition in Latin America and the Caribbean by exchanging best practices and creating better conditions through coordinated sustainable energy policies and market integration across the region.

Another critical element is the implementation of stable frameworks for renewable energy auctions and contracts. Recent experiences in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic and Honduras show that competitive auctions and long-term contracts provide certainty to developers and reduce financial costs for investors. OLADE’s Regional Regulatory Convergence initiative reinforces this principle by promoting the harmonization of criteria and contracting practices that encourage cross-border and regional investment.

National incentives and regulations have an important role to play. For example, Brazil’s Fuel of the Future Law, passed in late 2024, could unlock around USD 4 billion per year in investments for sustainable fuels, including green diesel, biogas and sustainable aviation fuel. The law sets mandatory blending targets, carbon intensity mandates and incentives to expand biofuels, supporting the country’s energy transition and attracting private capital to the sector.

The availability of instruments to mitigate currency risk and public guarantees is another key factor in attracting foreign investment, while the expansion and digitalisation of electricity grids also serves as an essential enabler to unlock investments in distributed generation and large-scale renewables. Additionally, the development of regulations for energy storage and flexibility allows renewable energy to be fully integrated into the system, providing firming, reserve and rapid demand-response services. As elsewhere in the world, robust energy planning in LAC remains central to creating a strong enabling environment for investments in a secure, affordable and sustainable energy future.

The G20 Roadmap to Increase Investment in Clean Energy in Developing Countries, developed by the IEA for Brazil’s G20 Presidency in 2024, identifies opportunities and actions to help achieve a rapid scaling up of clean energy investments. The roadmap outlines specific, timebound steps for increasing private financing in order to mobilise the investments required across different regions and sectors to build modern, clean energy systems.

Technical specifications for E20 fuel – containing 20% ethanol versus the current E10 standard – are nearing completion and could create substantial new demand.","Strict EU policies on sustainable aviation fuel feedstocks may hinder decarbonization targets, while both facing trade pressures and pursuing growth in higher ethanol blends, according to an official from European renewable ethanol group ePURE.

The European Commission's DG ENER decision to, for the moment, exclude crop-based fuels from aviation decarbonization quotas under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation is problematic, David Carpintero, director general of ePURE, an industry body for European renewable ethanol, told Platts Nov. 13.

The approach makes compliance after 2030 nearly impossible for airlines while jeopardizing climate goals, he said.

""With the current version of ReFuel, you are making the life of airlines very dependent on some limited feedstocks,"" Carpintero said, referring to the EU's restrictive stance on crop-based feedstocks for SAF production. He argued that focusing on feedstock type rather than reducing greenhouse gas emissions misses the point of effective climate policy.

The comments highlight growing industry frustration with EU biofuel policy that prioritizes advanced biofuels made from waste and residues over conventional crop-based alternatives.

More than half of liquid biofuels currently in use are based on bioethanol produced from food crops, but this can be produced from a range of feedstocks, the International Energy Agency said Nov. 12.

Fuel ethanol demand is projected to grow to over 2.2 million b/d in 2027, with growth driven mostly by the US and Brazil, from around 2.15 million b/d in 2025, analysts at S&P Global Commodity Insights said. European consumption will rise 5% from 153,799 b/d in 2025 to 161,174 b/d, while production will dip 2% from 106,255 b/d in 2025 to 103,670 b/d, Commodity Insights data showed.

Trade liberalization

Regulatory uncertainty comes as the European ethanol sector faces additional pressure from trade liberalization. The pending trade agreement between EU and the South American trade bloc Mercosur could boost low-duty ethanol imports, with Carpintero warning of ""a very negative impact on European ethanol producers"" from the cumulative effect of these multiple free trade agreements, Carpintero said.

Brazilian energy company Raizen sees potential for its waste-based ethanol — currently overwhelmingly earmarked for European road users — to grow its share in other transport applications as it ramps up capacity of the second-generation fuel over the next few years, a company official told Platts in October 2024.

Platts, part of Commodity Insights, assessed ethanol barges on an FOB basis in Rotterdam that had cleared EU customs at $826.15/cu m Nov. 12, slightly below its five-year average of $843.46/mt.

European ethanol prices surged to $987.86 in October, the highest level since April 2023, driven by several factors. Chief among these were the Dutch decision to no longer allow undenatured ethanol imports to count against the 2026 RED III targets, the lower corn crop in Southeast Europe, the slow pace of imports, and the downturn in deliveries from the UK plants to Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp. None of them are transient and therefore prices will remain well-supported in the months ahead, analysts at Commodity Insights said. Prices will remain volatile until the market has found a new equilibrium, they said.

Market opportunities

The renewable ethanol industry is identifying new growth opportunities in higher ethanol blends for gasoline. Technical specifications for E20 fuel – containing 20% ethanol versus the current E10 standard – are nearing completion and could create substantial new demand.

""There is a significant fleet of cars in Europe that will benefit from E20,"" Carpintero said, describing the development as ""a big step to continue the decarbonization of road transport.""

The higher blend could also open maritime applications, with marine engine developers testing ethanol-powered systems.

Bioethanol plays an important role in decarbonizing road transport, but growth opportunities are limited because of the widespread electrification of vehicles, the IEA said Nov. 12.

Ethanol as a marine fuel can ride on the increasing popularity of methanol in the shipping industry, Mikael Wideskog, Wartsila's director for sustainable fuels and decarbonization, told Platts in March 2023.

This growth potential could align well with the International Maritime Organization's net-zero frameworks, and it could be further fueled by global regulatory convergence, Carpintero said.

Bioethanol does not currently meet the requirements for consideration as a sustainable fuel by the FuelEU Maritime regulation if produced from a food crop, and, as a result, its future use depends to a considerable extent on whether it can be produced affordably using waste material, the IEA said.

Despite technical challenges, including the appearance of elastomers in fuel, the expansion into E20 and maritime applications represents the industry's strategy to offset regulatory and trade pressures while maintaining its role in European decarbonization efforts.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-14 09:59:34.755361

By charging passengers based on travel distance and class, the levy is designed to promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is essential for achieving Singapore’s goal of a 3 to 5 percent SAF adoption rate by 2030. This initiative not only supports global sustainability efforts but also positions Singapore as a leader in eco-friendly air travel, driving both awareness and action within the aviation industry.

As global environmental concerns intensify, the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Singapore is taking a bold step in addressing this challenge with the introduction of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) levy. Starting in 2026, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will impose a green aviation fuel levy on air travelers departing from Singapore. This move is hailed as a groundbreaking initiative to help reduce aviation emissions and accelerate the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is a key part of the nation’s long-term sustainability goals.

The Green Aviation Fuel Levy: A Closer Look

The green aviation fuel levy is designed to promote the use of SAF and help reduce carbon emissions within the aviation sector. This levy will apply to air tickets sold from April 1, 2026, for flights departing Singapore starting October 1, 2026. The initiative is seen as a major stride toward achieving Singapore’s goal of adopting a 3 to 5 percent SAF adoption rate by 2030, a target that aligns with global efforts to reduce aviation’s impact on the environment.

According to CAAS, the revenue generated from this levy will be used to support sustainable aviation fuel initiatives and further strengthen Singapore’s position as a leader in green aviation. As the aviation sector grapples with rising emissions, SAF has emerged as one of the most promising solutions. SAF is produced from renewable sources and has a significantly lower carbon footprint compared to traditional jet fuel, making it a key enabler of the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

How the Green Fuel Levy Will Impact Passengers

The green fuel levy will be imposed on all passengers flying out of Singapore, with the amount varying depending on the travel class and distance traveled. This tiered structure aims to make the levy fair and proportionate to the distance flown and the class of travel. Here’s a breakdown of the levy charges for different passenger categories:

Southeast Asia: Economy and premium economy passengers traveling to Southeast Asia will pay SGD 1 for their flights.

Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea: For economy cabin travelers, the levy will be SGD 2.80, while passengers in premium cabins will pay SGD 11.20.

Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, and New Zealand: Economy cabin passengers will be charged SGD 2.80, while those flying in premium cabins will pay SGD 25.60.

The Americas: Economy class passengers will pay SGD 10.40, and premium class passengers will be charged SGD 41.60.

Additionally, passengers who are merely transiting through Singapore will not be required to pay the levy. For those traveling on flights with multiple stops, the levy will be based on the immediate next destination after departing Singapore.

Cargo Flights and the Levy

Cargo flights departing from Singapore will also be subject to the green aviation fuel levy, though the charge will be calculated on a per-kilogram basis. This move extends the levy beyond passenger flights, ensuring that all sectors of aviation contribute to Singapore’s sustainability efforts.

The Broader Vision for Sustainable Aviation

The green aviation fuel levy is part of a larger strategy by Singapore to become a global leader in green aviation. The levy is designed to complement Singapore’s other sustainability initiatives, including the establishment of the GCC (Green Corridor for Connectivity) to ensure efficient and environmentally friendly air travel between key regions.

This levy is not just about collecting funds but also about raising awareness within the aviation sector and among passengers about the importance of adopting sustainable practices. It highlights Singapore’s commitment to being at the forefront of efforts to combat climate change, particularly in sectors that have traditionally been difficult to decarbonize, such as aviation.

In line with its broader sustainability goals, Singapore has set ambitious targets to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon emissions, with SAF being the cornerstone of these efforts. By incentivizing airlines to adopt SAF through this levy, Singapore is positioning itself as a leader in the global movement toward decarbonizing the aviation industry.

The Impact on Airlines and the Industry

Airlines operating in Singapore will also be impacted by the introduction of this green aviation fuel levy. While the levy directly affects passengers, it will also indirectly influence airlines’ decisions regarding the types of fuel they use. Airlines will be encouraged to adopt more sustainable practices and use SAF to offset the financial impact of the levy.

This development is expected to drive further investments into SAF production and innovation. The aviation industry has already made significant strides in this area, with various global airlines and fuel suppliers collaborating to scale up SAF production. The green fuel levy is a step toward incentivizing further research and development in the production of SAF, making it more accessible and affordable for airlines worldwide.

Global Reactions and Support for SAF

The move by Singapore is part of a growing global trend to adopt sustainable aviation fuel and reduce emissions across the aviation sector. Several countries, including the United States, the European Union, and Australia, have already implemented policies and incentives to encourage SAF adoption. By introducing the green aviation fuel levy, Singapore is positioning itself as a key player in this global shift toward greener air travel.

Singapore’s green aviation fuel levy also sets a strong example for other nations looking to adopt similar policies. As more countries consider introducing their own levies or incentives for SAF adoption, the aviation sector will be better positioned to meet its emissions reduction targets. In the long run, this will help create a global market for SAF, driving down costs and making sustainable aviation fuel more widely available.

Preparing for the Transition

The introduction of the green aviation fuel levy will require airlines, travelers, and industry stakeholders to adapt to the new system. Airlines will need to assess their fuel sourcing strategies and determine how to incorporate SAF into their operations to mitigate the impact of the levy. Passengers, on the other hand, will need to be educated about the levy’s purpose and how it contributes to Singapore’s sustainability efforts.

The government has also committed to providing resources to help travelers understand the levy and its benefits. Public awareness campaigns will be rolled out to ensure that passengers are informed about the purpose of the levy and how their contributions will help drive the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

What’s Next for Green Aviation in Singapore?

Looking ahead, Singapore’s green aviation fuel levy is just the beginning of a larger, long-term effort to decarbonize the aviation industry. In the coming years, Singapore is expected to expand its initiatives to include more fuel-related levies, incentives, and policies that further encourage the adoption of SAF.

The move to implement the green fuel levy will likely serve as a model for other nations considering similar steps to reduce emissions in the aviation sector. By working together with global partners, Singapore hopes to set the stage for a future where sustainable aviation fuel is the norm, and the aviation sector contributes significantly to global efforts to combat climate change.

As more airlines and nations adopt SAF and invest in cleaner, greener technologies, the aviation industry can look forward to a more sustainable future. The green aviation fuel levy is an important milestone in this journey, signaling Singapore’s unwavering commitment to driving positive change in the global aviation sector.

Singapore’s introduction of the green aviation fuel levy marks a significant milestone in the country’s efforts to reduce emissions from air travel and promote sustainable practices within the aviation sector. By applying the levy to both passengers and cargo flights, Singapore is taking a comprehensive approach to tackling emissions and ensuring that the aviation sector contributes to the nation’s broader sustainability goals.

Singapore’s green aviation fuel levy, set to take effect in 2026, aims to reduce emissions by promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This levy encourages eco-friendly travel while supporting the country’s goal of achieving 3 to 5 percent SAF adoption by 2030.

As airlines and travelers adjust to this new system, the green fuel levy will help raise awareness about the importance of sustainable aviation fuel and the role it will play in reducing global aviation emissions. With Singapore leading the way, it is hoped that more nations will follow suit and work together to create a greener, more sustainable future for air travel.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-11-14T105632366.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 04:56:48.476837

Ambition Meets Implementation The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan represents a definitive commitment by the European Commission to unlock investment and regulatory stability for the challenging decarbonization of aviation and waterborne transport.","On November 5, the European Commission recognized its communication on the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), setting out a strategic roadmap aimed at accelerating the energy transition for the aviation and waterborne transport sectors. Positioned as a key element of the EU’s Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal, the STIP provides a unified approach to enhancing investments in renewable and low-carbon fuels (RLCFs).

While aviation industry alliances, such as DESTINATION 2050 and the International Air and Transport Association (IATA), welcomed the STIP as a constructive and significant step forward, noting it addresses long-standing weaknesses in the EU’s decarbonization strategy, major concerns remain over the scale of funding and implementation timelines.

What the STIP Promises

The STIP is structured around three main pillars – Strategic Framework, Financing Action, and External Dimension – and focuses on unlocking investments to meet the ambitious fuel targets established in the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime Regulations. By 2035, the EU expects to need approximately 20 million tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

To stimulate the market, the STIP outlines plans to mobilize at least €2.9 billion in EU support for sustainable fuels through 2027. Key short-term funding measures include:

InvestEU is expected to mobilize at least €2 billion for sustainable alternative fuels to help bridge financial gaps.

The Commission will allocate €300 million by the end of 2025 through the European Hydrogen Bank to support the production of hydrogen for SAF and sustainable maritime fuels (SMF).

The Innovation Fund will mobilize €153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects.

Critically, the STIP signals movement on key market mechanisms, including launching preparations for an intermediary mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers.

The Commission is set to launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project by the end of 2025, aiming to mobilize at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects through the organization of the first pooled double auction pilot. This double-sided auction system is commended by DESTINATION 2050 partners as showing growing recognition of the need for market-based incentives to scale up SAF production.

Aviation Implications

For the aviation sector, the STIP provides a long-awaited signal to tackle the “teething problems” of the SAF market. IATA welcomed the steps to assess extending SAF support under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) post-2030, exploring tradable SAF, and simplifying operator reporting.

The plan also refers to assessing the feasibility and design of a Book & Claim mechanism, which is one of the most effective tools cited by industry to ensure SAF accessibility across all EU airports, regardless of local fuel availability. IATA stressed that such a system is urgently required to promote regional cohesion and act as a key enabler for investments in SAF production facilities.

However, the industry requires certainty and commitment from the Commission that the Book & Claim mechanism will be developed and implemented as soon as possible, fearing delays. Furthermore, the commitment regarding the extension of SAF allowances under the EU ETS is seen as falling short of providing the necessary commitment, as the Commission only states it will “assess” such a possibility.

Funding Shortcomings and Biofuel Debate

The primary critique of the STIP centers on its financial scope. Driving the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels alone requires an estimated investment of €100 billion by 2035. In this context, aviation partners noted that the announced funding support of at least €2.9 billion until 2027 appears “disappointingly low and not commensurate with the scale of investment required.”

There are also deep concerns regarding the technologies being prioritized for support:

Biofuels vs. E-Fuels: Transport & Environment (T&E) warned that the plan “leaves the door open for biofuels being included in double-sided auctions.” T&E argues that auctions should be strictly limited to e-fuels (synthetic fuels like e-kerosene), which are the most sustainable and scalable alternative for long-term decarbonization but are currently struggling to reach final investment decisions (FID) due to high costs. Conversely, IATA advocates for a technology-neutral approach that supports both biofuels and e-SAF, arguing that limiting support risks undermining the scalability and cost-effectiveness of overall SAF deployment.

Neglected Technologies: In a letter organized by the SASHA Coalition, the STIP has been criticized for the absence of targeted support for hydrogen and electric technologies (zero carbon emission aircraft and vessels). Industry leaders urged the Commission to designate these solutions – which offer the most sustainable paths for short- and medium-haul routes – as strategic, priority technologies for investment.

ETS Revenues: The plan only “encourages” member states to use existing carbon market (ETS) revenues to decarbonize shipping and aviation. Critics argue the 2026 ETS revision should incorporate a requirement to earmark these revenues for e-fuels investments. Furthermore, extending the ETS scope to cover extra-EEA flights could have generated over €7 billion in extra revenues last year alone, funds that are currently being lost.

Connecting to Non-CO2 Impacts

The central measures of the STIP, including the financial support mechanisms and the focus on SAF, primarily address CO2 emissions through fuel mandates and investments in lower-carbon alternatives. While the ultimate impact of shifting fuel supply towards sustainable options may influence aviation’s total climate impact, the current STIP communication and funding allocations, as presented by the Commission, do not explicitly reference specific strategies or targeted support for mitigating aviation non-CO2 effects (such as contrails or nitrogen oxides).

Ambition Meets Implementation

The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan represents a definitive commitment by the European Commission to unlock investment and regulatory stability for the challenging decarbonization of aviation and waterborne transport. It takes critical steps by acknowledging the investment barrier and prioritizing solutions like the double-sided auction and the Book & Claim mechanism necessary to de-risk e-fuel production.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I_S5!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff2a6371-6b8a-4b60-b4dc-e812be446f33_1376x892.png",N,,2025-11-14 09:59:38.324223

The levy applies to passengers travelling in either the Economy Cabin, which includes Economy and Premium Economy, or the Premium Cabin, which covers Business Class and First Class.
In line with established industry methodologies for calculating cabin-specific carbon emissions, the levy for Premium Cabin passengers is set at four times the rate applied to Economy Cabin passengers within the same geographical band.
Economy passengers on these routes will pay S$10.40, while Premium Cabin passengers will pay S$41.60.
All SAF Levy collections will be channelled into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS.","The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) has announced the introduction of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Levy applicable to all passengers departing Singapore, cargo shipments, and general and business aviation flights from October 1, 2026. The levy will apply to tickets and services sold from April 1, 2026, marking a significant step forward in Singapore’s strategy to accelerate aviation sustainability.

CAAS said the levy has been calculated based on the volume of SAF required to meet Singapore’s 1 per cent SAF target for 2026, as well as the projected price premium of SAF over conventional jet fuel, including associated costs for certification, blending, and delivery. To reflect fuel consumption differences by distance, the levy is structured into four geographical bands covering Southeast Asia, Northeast and South Asia, Australia, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, and more.

The SAF Levy for passengers will be charged on a per-passenger basis and will vary according to both distance travelled and cabin of travel, based on four geographical bands established by CAAS. The levy applies to passengers travelling in either the Economy Cabin, which includes Economy and Premium Economy, or the Premium Cabin, which covers Business Class and First Class. In line with established industry methodologies for calculating cabin-specific carbon emissions, the levy for Premium Cabin passengers is set at four times the rate applied to Economy Cabin passengers within the same geographical band. Airlines are required to collect the levy directly and display it as a distinct line item on tickets. The charge applies exclusively to passengers departing from Singapore to another country, and excludes all transit passengers.

For flights within Southeast Asia, passengers in the Economy Cabin will pay a levy of S$1.00, while those in the Premium Cabin will pay S$4.00.

Travellers heading to Northeast Asia, South Asia, Australia, and Papua New Guinea will incur a levy of S$2.80 in Economy and S$11.20 in Premium.

For longer-haul destinations such as Africa, Central and West Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Pacific Islands, and New Zealand, the levy increases to S$6.40 for Economy passengers and S$25.60 for Premium Cabin travellers.

The highest levy applies to flights to the Americas, reflecting the significant fuel consumption on these ultra-long-haul routes. Economy passengers on these routes will pay S$10.40, while Premium Cabin passengers will pay S$41.60.

Cargo shipments will incur a per-kilogramme levy ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15, depending on the geographical band. Airlines or cargo operators must list the levy as a distinct charge on contracts and documentation.

For general and business aviation, the levy is charged per aircraft and varies by geographical band and the aircraft’s ICAO wingspan code (A–F). Charges range from S$40 for small aircraft operating in Southeast Asia to S$6,500 for large aircraft flying to the Americas. Exemptions apply for humanitarian, charitable, and training flights.

All SAF Levy collections will be channelled into a statutory SAF Fund managed by CAAS. This fund will finance the purchase of SAF and SAF environmental attributes (EAs) and cover administrative costs. The newly formed Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (SAFCo) will oversee procurement and allocation to ensure transparency, cost-efficiency, and accountability.

The introduction of the SAF Levy forms part of Singapore’s commitment to the ICAO 2050 Long-Term Aspirational Goal of net-zero international aviation emissions. Under the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint launched in 2024, CAAS aims to reduce domestic aviation emissions by 20 per cent by 2030 and achieve net zero across domestic and international aviation by 2050.

To meet these goals, CAAS will roll out 12 decarbonisation initiatives across airport operations, airlines, and air traffic management, supported by enablers such as infrastructure planning, workforce transformation, and international partnerships. SAF adoption is a key pillar, with Singapore targeting an SAF blend of 1 per cent in 2026 and aiming to increase this to 3–5 per cent by 2030, subject to global supply and cost developments.

Han Kok Juan, Director-General of CAAS said, “The introduction of the SAF Levy marks a major step forward in Singapore’s effort to build a more sustainable and competitive air hub. It provides a mechanism for all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub. We need to make a start. We have done so in a measured way, and we are giving industry, businesses and the public time to adjust.”",https://traveltradejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Singapore-Changi-Airport.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 04:57:29.316051

Themed “Bolstering Supply Chains and Manpower Resilience for a Sustainable Future,” the Assembly provides a critical platform for airline leaders across the Asia Pacific region to review industry performance, exchange insights, and address key operational and strategic challenges shaping the sector’s trajectory.

Industry outlook

Since 2022, air travel demand in the Asia Pacific region has demonstrated continued resilience, with international passenger traffic expanding by 10 percent during the first nine months of 2025. While the outlook for 2026 remains positive, growth is expected to align more closely with long-term historical trends. Passenger load factors remain elevated due to constrained capacity growth, as the industry continues to face an estimated global shortfall of more than 5,200 aircraft deliveries in 2025.

Maintenance and repair operations also face significant bottlenecks, with extended turnaround times driven by shortages of components and skilled manpower. Meanwhile, the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains nascent, with production volumes far below the levels required to support the industry’s decarbonisation targets.

Global trade and supply chain pressures

For the second consecutive year, supply chain constraints and workforce resilience remain dominant themes at the Assembly, compounded by renewed trade tensions and tariff measures that threaten to increase operational costs and disrupt the free flow of aviation goods and services.

Commenting ahead of the event, Mr. Subhas Menon, Director General of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines, said, “The introduction of new tariffs at a time when global supply chains are still in recovery represents a setback for the aviation sector. Tariffs elevate supplier costs and undermine the principles of free trade on which global aviation supply chains are built. While passenger and cargo demand remains strong, persistent supply challenges could restrict airlines’ ability to meet the expectations of travellers and businesses alike. The air freight market, in particular, stands to be directly affected by escalating trade tensions in the months ahead.”

Sustainability and Fleet Modernisation

Mr. Menon further noted that supply chain disruptions also hinder the industry’s sustainability transition, as ongoing delays in new aircraft deliveries slow fleet renewal and extend the operational life of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft – potentially increasing the industry’s overall carbon emissions footprint.

“The Assembly serves as a vital forum for the region’s aviation leaders to discuss the current state of the industry and to chart a sustainable and resilient path forward,” Mr. Menon added. “Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the robust demand for air services, combined with the region’s strong economies and favourable demographics, continues to underpin optimism for the Asia Pacific aviation sector in the year ahead.”",https://payloadasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/favicon.png,N,,2025-11-14 04:57:36.911198

The biennial show’s choreography will be familiar: fighter jets in elegant formation, wide-body aircraft snarling down the runway and helicopters slicing the air. But the real spectacle isn’t confined to the sky. It’s in the closed-door rooms where deals, partnerships and future routes are hammered out. The star attraction remains flying taxis – eVTOLs (electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft) will take pride of place with test demonstrations, mock-ups and operational briefings. Companies such as Joby Aviation and Archer are still pushing for a 2026 launch of eVTOL passenger services between Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Such optimism invites scrutiny. Certification is complicated, battery density still falls short of commercial requirements and early users will probably only be those able to afford premium pricing. Still, few places can match the UAE’s capacity to build infrastructure at speed and holding the event at DWC only reinforces that momentum. The airshow functions as the sector’s deal-making furnace. Previous editions have seen tens of billions of dollars committed on the tarmac, wide-body orders, defence packages and long-term service agreements.

The full cast of aviation powerbrokers will be in attendance: Boeing and Airbus with their supply-chain headaches and stretched delivery schedules; Gulf carriers Emirates, Etihad and new player Riyadh Air pushing expansion and next-generation fleets; defence giants looking to secure long-horizon programmes; and aerospace companies breaking ground in the Middle East. It’s a gathering where strategy chiefs, government delegations, manufacturers and financiers mix with an unusual ease. Everyone understands that this is the room where tomorrow’s aviation map is drawn.

And for all the deals and strategy sessions behind the scenes, the airshow extends a hand to the public. The Skyview grandstand will again offer families a vantage point from which to observe the aerial acrobatics, a reminder that aviation can still enchant, even as the sector wrestles with its heaviest challenges.

Sustainability is likely to dominate corporate conversations – and the industry finally appears to be moving beyond platitudes and towards climate action instead. Dubai Airports is preparing a sustainability showcase for the event, highlighting operational innovations, energy-efficiency systems, waste-reduction measures and emerging propulsion options. Still, the broader sector is in a bind: sustainable aviation-fuel production is nowhere near scale, hydrogen is promising but distant and electrification is only beginning to consider short-haul mobility. The airshow will present glimpses of a greener future but also lay bare just how far from that horizon the commercial fleet remains.

Dubai Airshow 2025 arrives at a moment of flux in which technology is advancing faster than regulation can catch up. Ambition is everywhere. Scepticism is warranted. But the aviation industry should ready itself to witness the winds of change next week.

Ian Khan’s Closing The sustainable aviation fuel revolution represents one of the most exciting and necessary transformations of our time.","The Future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel: A 10-Year Strategic Outlook and Digital Transformation Forecast

Opening Summary

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, with projections showing this could triple by 2050 if left unchecked. What I find particularly striking is that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) currently represents less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption globally. In my work with major airlines and energy companies, I’ve witnessed firsthand the immense pressure building for meaningful change. The aviation industry stands at a critical inflection point, much like the automotive industry did with electric vehicles a decade ago. We’re seeing unprecedented alignment between regulatory pressure, consumer demand, and technological innovation that’s creating the perfect storm for transformation. The current state reminds me of early conversations I had with automotive executives about EVs – there’s recognition of the inevitable shift, but genuine uncertainty about the path forward. What’s different this time is the urgency; climate commitments and public scrutiny have accelerated the timeline dramatically.

Main Content: Top Three Business Challenges

Challenge 1: The Cost and Scale Dilemma

The most immediate barrier I consistently encounter in my consulting work is the fundamental economics of SAF production. According to McKinsey & Company analysis, sustainable aviation fuel currently costs two to four times more than conventional jet fuel. This creates an impossible equation for airlines already operating on razor-thin margins. I recently consulted with a major European carrier that calculated switching to 50% SAF blend would increase their annual fuel costs by over $1.2 billion – essentially wiping out their entire profit margin. The scale challenge is equally daunting. As Deloitte research highlights, global SAF production would need to increase by approximately 3,000 times current levels to meet 10% of aviation fuel demand by 2030. What many executives don’t realize is that this isn’t just a production problem – it’s an entire ecosystem challenge involving feedstock availability, refining capacity, and distribution infrastructure.

Challenge 2: Technological Uncertainty and Investment Risk

The second major challenge I see paralyzing decision-makers is the technological pathway uncertainty. There are at least seven viable SAF production pathways being developed simultaneously – from hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) to alcohol-to-jet and power-to-liquid technologies. Each requires massive capital investment with uncertain returns. In my strategic foresight workshops with energy companies, I often use the analogy of betting on VHS versus Betamax in the early days of video recording. The World Economic Forum notes that the aviation industry needs to invest approximately $175 billion in SAF production capacity by 2050 to meet climate targets. The risk isn’t just choosing the wrong technology – it’s the timing. Companies that move too early risk stranded assets, while those who wait too long face regulatory penalties and competitive disadvantage.

Challenge 3: Regulatory Fragmentation and Policy Gaps

The third challenge that keeps coming up in my discussions with global aviation leaders is the patchwork of regulatory frameworks and policy incentives. Unlike the automotive industry where emissions standards are relatively harmonized globally, aviation faces a complex web of national and regional regulations. The Harvard Business Review recently analyzed how this regulatory fragmentation creates compliance nightmares for international carriers. I’ve seen airlines struggling to navigate conflicting mandates from the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, the US Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, and various national carbon pricing mechanisms. What’s particularly concerning is the policy uncertainty around long-term incentives. Many of the current tax credits and subsidies have sunset clauses that create investment hesitation. As PwC’s aviation practice notes, without stable, long-term policy frameworks, the business case for large-scale SAF investments remains precarious.

Solutions and Innovations

Despite these challenges, I’m incredibly optimistic about the innovative solutions emerging. In my research and consulting, I’ve identified several breakthrough approaches that are gaining traction.

First, the partnership model between airlines, energy companies, and technology providers is proving remarkably effective. United Airlines’ investment in Fulcrum BioEnergy represents a template I’m seeing replicated globally – airlines taking equity positions in SAF producers to secure supply and share in the upside. This aligns incentives in ways that traditional supplier relationships cannot.

Second, advanced feedstock development is addressing the scale challenge. Companies like LanzaJet are pioneering waste-to-fuel technologies that can utilize municipal solid waste and agricultural residues. According to Accenture analysis, these second-generation feedstocks could potentially supply up to 20% of global aviation fuel demand without competing with food production.

Third, digital twin technology is revolutionizing SAF plant design and optimization. I recently visited a facility where engineers are using AI-powered simulation to optimize production processes before physical construction begins. This reduces capital risk and accelerates time-to-market significantly.

Fourth, blockchain-enabled sustainability certification is creating much-needed transparency and trust in the SAF value chain. By providing immutable records of fuel origin, production methods, and carbon intensity, these systems are addressing the greenwashing concerns that have plagued early adoption efforts.

The Future: Projections and Forecasts

Based on my analysis of current trajectories and technological readiness, I project that sustainable aviation fuel will reach cost parity with conventional jet fuel between 2030 and 2035. The International Energy Agency forecasts that SAF could account for nearly 30% of aviation fuel consumption by 2040 under ambitious policy scenarios.

What many business leaders underestimate is the exponential nature of this transition. We’re likely to see a tipping point around 2027-2028 where SAF adoption accelerates dramatically. My foresight exercises with airline executives suggest that early movers will capture significant competitive advantage through fuel hedging strategies and premium brand positioning.

The market size projections are staggering. According to BloombergNEF analysis, the global SAF market could grow from approximately $500 million today to over $30 billion by 2035. This represents one of the largest energy transition opportunities I’ve seen in my career.

Technologically, I expect several breakthroughs in the coming decade. Advanced biofuels using engineered microorganisms could dramatically increase production efficiency. Synthetic fuels produced using direct air capture and renewable electricity may become commercially viable by the late 2030s. The integration of AI and machine learning will optimize entire SAF value chains, from feedstock sourcing to distribution.

Final Take: 10-Year Outlook

Over the next decade, sustainable aviation fuel will transform from a niche product to a mainstream energy source. Airlines that fail to develop comprehensive SAF strategies risk regulatory penalties, consumer backlash, and competitive irrelevance. The transition will create winners and losers not just among airlines, but across the entire aviation ecosystem. Fuel suppliers, aircraft manufacturers, and airport operators all face fundamental business model disruption. The companies that thrive will be those viewing SAF not as a compliance burden, but as a strategic opportunity to build resilience and capture new value streams.

Ian Khan’s Closing

The sustainable aviation fuel revolution represents one of the most exciting and necessary transformations of our time. As I often tell the leaders I work with, “The future belongs not to those who wait for change, but to those who have the courage to build it.” We stand at the threshold of reinventing one of humanity’s greatest achievements – air travel – for a sustainable future.

The EU Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), launched last week, aims to tackle this challenge head-on with a proposed intermediary mechanism that bridges producers and buyers, shares risks, and helps make e-SAF projects bankable. 💶 At Member State level: A first e-SAF pilot is expected to be launched with support from participating Member States through an intermediary that runs double-sided auctions - securing long-term contracts with e-SAF producers and shorter-term agreements with airlines. The funding gap would be covered via ETS auction revenues or national contributions, helping early projects reach final investment decision (FID). The Commission aims to mobilise at least EUR 500 million in Member State contributions - with Germany already signaling interest. At EU level: A follow-up intermediary mechanism at EU-level is foreseen to pool resources, coordinate auctions across Member States, and align with instruments such as the Innovation Fund, the Competitiveness Fund, and EIB loans and grants. The Commission proposes an indicative envelope of EUR 3 billion to deliver scale, efficiency, and cross-border coherence. Together, these mechanisms could be key in meeting the 1.2% sub-target for e-SAF by 2030 , increasing to 35% by 2050 in ReFuelEU Aviation. 🚀 Read more about our Sustainable Aviation Fuel solutions: https://lnkd.in/dWHGUs93",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQE9futOUgDHjw/feedshare-shrink_800/B4DZp8aM7WHsAk-/0/1763023835503?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Z2X5oeFB2RY_A_bibaC78oknUJtuR64gjtnZLmzM0pM,N,,2025-11-13 20:57:12.200244

However, researchers believe it could be transformed into a key ingredient for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). A new report from researchers at the University of Michigan explores pathways to recycle the existing carbon source into a climate solution for the aviation industry.

CO2 from ethanol fermentation is uniquely valuable. The fermentation process yields pure streams containing 85% CO2 by volume or higher, unlike gas streams from industrial processes. This makes it easier and less energy-intensive to capture. Because the CO2 was originally separated from the air by corn plants, capturing and reusing it for fuel creates a carbon-recycling loop that does not add new CO2 to the atmosphere.

Defossilizing Aviation Fuel

Aviation produces over a gigaton of fossil CO2 emissions annually. Researchers believe it is essential to find scalable, non-carbon stocks. The U.S. ethanol industry’s 2023 output of 15.6 billion gallons released 48 megatons of CO2. This presents a huge, ready-to-scale resource.

U-M research scientist Stephen McCord said, “It is exciting to explore whether this ‘waste’ stream can actually become a significant asset, turning inefficiency into advantage and accelerating the real-world application of emerging technologies.”

U-M researchers compared an existing corn-based SAF production method called Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) with two new CO2-based routes. According to researchers, the AtJ process is effective but achieves a carbon reduction of only 4.5% to 20% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The two CO2-based pathways, however, start by converting captured CO2 into syngas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen). One path, Gas Fermentation, creates ethanol using syngas before using the AtJ process. The second path, Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, feeds syngas directly into a reactor to synthesize long-chain liquid jet fuel hydrocarbons.

A lifecycle assessment of the two methods projected substantial environmental benefits for both CO2 routes. However, the Gas Fermentation route was deemed the path with the “smoothest transition.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-50.png,N,,2025-11-13 17:56:29.400188

Every year, the week of March 19 (Russell’s birthday) is marked by Western Art Week in Great Falls.","There is no shortage of drive and entrepreneurial spirit in Big Sky Country.

From the moment my flight touched down at Great Falls International Airport in early October, signs of the area’s economic, geographic and cultural identity began to appear.

One of the first things I spied from the airplane window was a U.S. Air Force plane, later identified as a Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The Montana Air National Guard and Malmstrom Air Force Base are both located in Great Falls. The Air Guard’s mission includes tactical airlift, firefighting and search and rescue operations. The U.S. Air Force will be modernizing its aging nuclear missile system at Malmstrom Air Force Base (on the other side of the Missouri River from the airport). The Malmstrom AFB Sentinel Missile Upgrade program will see an estimated $1.5–2 billion in direct spending in Montana for construction, infrastructure, housing and support facilities. Malmstrom AFB manages over 150 missile silos across north-central Montana. The project is expected to spur more than 3,000 construction jobs and over 500 long-term support and maintenance positions.

Leaving the airport to catch my cab to the city, a gust of wind almost immediately snatched away the Atlanta Zoo baseball cap I was wearing to shield my eyes and airport hair. This proved to be an excellent aerometric marker for the abundant wind energy resources in the region, harvested via wind turbines that pepper the Great Falls landscape.

Welcome to the Electric City

And what a landscape it is: The Little Belt Mountains, Square Butte and the Rockies color the surrounding horizon of Great Falls, which at 60,000 residents is the third most populated city in the state after Billings and Missoula. Running through the city’s center is the Missouri River, which I walked alongside the next day with Jake Clark, vice president of business development at Great Falls Development Alliance. He told me about the moves being made to build out the local energy infrastructure.

“Great Falls has a really long history with energy,” Clark said, noting the several hydroelectric dams in the city that once powered copper production in the city. The Anaconda Copper Mining Company was the copper smelting and refining complex, in operation for about 100 years until its closure in 1980, that put Great Falls on the map. A power-intensive project that exemplified one of the first commercial uses of hydroelectric power, the refinery also smelted copper that would eventually be used in the early days of electrification across the country.

And the region continues to see big wins in energy and fuel.

“Our refinery cracked the code on sustainable aviation fuel,” says Clark about the Calumet Montana Refining facility. Great Falls is also home to Montana Renewables, the largest producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in North America. “And there’s a couple-billion-dollar upgrade ongoing right now to stay on the top of that hill,” Clark says of the $1.67 billion expansion at Montana Renewables supported by a U.S. Department of Energy loan guarantee, the largest clean energy investment in Montana. “So, they’ll be doing significantly more.”

Green hydrogen is also on the table for the Calumet refinery and at Montana Renewables. Most green fuels produced at the facilities are shipped to California, where state tax credits help incentivize that portion of the energy supply chain. “It’s farm-to-table jet fuel,” Clark says about the whole operation. “In addition to what is going on at our refinery now, Berkshire Hathaway Energy recently purchased what’s called the Montana Alberta Tie Line. If you go north of Great Falls, you see large wind farms. Those wind farms feed that line, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy purchased that in order to develop more energy business on the U.S. side of that line … We see the potential for a data center cluster between here and the Canadian border in our region to do several other data centers because we have more independent power generation than any other part of the state as well as the potential to develop some behind-the-meter additional assets. And we have enough acreage for supersites.”

A 600-MW hyperscale data center coming to the Great Falls area from Atlanta-based TAC Data Centers will span 569 acres and include 2 million sq. ft. under roof. The data center, dubbed Project Cardinal, is planned for an area near the AgriTech Park, north of Malstrom Air Force Base and near the Great Falls Rainbow Power Substation, with construction of the whole campus expected to be completed by 2030. Power capacity will be between 500 and 600 MW across several buildings, supported by two on-site substations. TAC is reported to be investing between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in the facility, which is projected to create 1,500 to 2,000 construction jobs and 150 to 200 high-paying permanent positions.

“We have the fiber,” Clark says about Great Falls’ potential for advanced digital infrastructure. “We have the water. We have the land. And we’re working on talent.”

Berkshire Hathaway Energy Montana will add a 72-MW battery system near Cut Bank (less than two hours from Great Falls), a 100-MW solar farm on about 1,000 acres in north-central Montana (expected to be complete in 2026) and a new Great Falls control center to complement the existing wind farms attached to the Montana Alberta Tie Line (MATL) connecting southern Alberta to Great Falls.

Always Improving

Since 2020, the city of Great Falls has experienced more economic activity, major investments and population growth than it’s seen in 40 years. Stability and affordability make the city a prime location for business, says Jolene Schalper, executive vice president at Great Falls Development Alliance.

“Great Falls, Montana, makes operations affordable,” Schalper says. “We have a long history of low taxes and stable governance. We seek out tools to aid our industries and are able to work in tandem with elected officials for meaningful policy change. Our job is to listen to you and identify ways to help you thrive. Your bottom line is ours. Your team are our neighbors. The focus on long-term relationships is a key component of why Great Falls, Montana, is a great place to do business.”

In addition to the business-friendly climate that the city and state have to offer, quality of life is always improving. On the city’s east side, the mixed-use development “The Falls,” expected to launch construction in late 2026, will be a 100-acre, $500 million to $700 million project featuring retail, hotel, homes, restaurants, trails and public spaces with the goal of becoming a shopping and living hub over the next two decades. Led by Mitchell Development & Investments, the project will measure 630,000 sq. ft. and host two hotels, 831 residential units and 20 acres of public space.

The area’s quality of life can also be measured by a long list of recreation, cultural and hospitality assets, including River’s Edge Trail, an urban trail system where I took an e-bike tour. The trail features nearly 60 miles of pathways (21 of them paved) and strings together several parks, sculptures and gazebos, connecting to the Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center, the Great Falls Civic Center, Riverside Railyard Skate Park, West Bank Park and Giant Springs State Park.

The Missouri River also supplies an abundance of fish for anglers. Walleye, northern pike, sunfish, crappies, bass, catfish can all be found in the river waters running through Great Falls. Blue ribbon trout fishing off the Missouri is also seen south of the city, and salmon has been known to also populate the river. This veritable haul lends itself to a strong local fishing economy which in 2024 contributed $910 million to Montana’s GDP, according to an August 2025 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research.

In downtown Great Falls, restaurant and bar Enbär, live music venue The Newberry, arcade bar Sidequest and ice cream shop Big Dipper form a thread of lively options all owned and operated by a local group of investors and entrepreneurs (Enbar Inc.) who also own the minor league baseball team, the Great Falls Voyagers.

A local family of entrepreneurs, the Tronsons, operate the successful 5th & Wine wine bar and restaurant, headed by patriarch Mark Tronson, as well as Buffalo Blanc, a local café & coffee bar run by daughter Whitney Tronson. Soon, the Tronson family will also add a sister wine & beer bar, Buffalo Noir, to their portfolio in Great Falls, which will be run by another Tronson daughter, Tara.

Other stops in the city that will delight include independent bookstore Cassiopeia Books (owned and operated by retired Brooklyn attorney Millie Whalen), Central Avenue Meats owned by head butcher Drew Hicks that sources beef and pork locally from McCafferty Ranch and Faltree Farms, respectively, and The Farmer’s Daughter Fibers, a nationally known yarn and fabric shop run by Candice English.

Visitors seeking an experience that reaches back to an earlier time will love the Sip ‘n Dip Lounge, in operation since 1962. The tiki bar, located in the historic O’Haire Inn downtown, features “mermaids” who swim up and greet patrons in an aquarium-like window view (sadly closed during my visit), kooky and vibrant tropical-themed art, a 64-ounce cocktail (the “fishbowl”) and a jazzy live musical performer.

Healthy Environment for Growth

The local hospital system in Great Falls, Benefis Health Systems, will be expanding its facilities with several new and upgraded services to better serve the health care needs of the community. Construction is currently underway on a Healthy Aging Center, a 15,000-sq.-ft. outpatient clinic expected to open in 2026 that will provide audiology, mobility and geriatric services. The Sanavita Estates Senior Living development will span nearly 43 acres with a 64-unit apartment building and 28 villas for 55+ individuals and provide quality-of-life amenities such as a wine bar, ice cream parlor and a wellness center. Benefis Health Systems also recently saw an expansion of its endoscopy lab, adding rooms and bays and cutting wait times, and a renovation of its Sletten Cancer Institute that will improve patient comfort with additional infusion chairs, private treatment rooms and larger lab and pharmacy space. A new walk-in urgent care clinic with on-site pharmacy, lab, imaging and occupational health services is also expected to open in late 2025.

In 2023, a new extension campus of Touro University, a Harlem-based private medical school system in New York City, opened in Great Falls — the Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine (TouroCOM). The 100,000-sq.-ft. medical school campus houses classrooms, an anatomy lab, a simulation center and more. Three students who will be part of the first group of medical school graduates to complete their education at TouroCOM told me the biggest draws of the school were its focus on providing care for those who need it most and its welcoming environment.

“I chose Touro because I wanted to explore a new state and environment that is different, coming from big cities,” says Shantell Angarita, who hopes to complete her residency in emergency medicine. “I was drawn toward the philosophy that Touro supports in serving patients in underserved areas.”

For Jireh Gerry, Touro was a perfect match for her goals of becoming an OB-GYN and also serving those same underserved populations.

“I chose Touro because the environment was so friendly and so refreshing from what I was used to in Los Angeles,” she says. “Additionally, the program at Touro truly helps equip student doctors to be able to serve underserved communities, which is my goal when I become a physician.”

Touro is a Jewish university system with several locations globally. Notably, the campus in Great Falls demonstrates respect for religions and walks of life from all over, providing kosher and halal cafeteria options and ways to learn and practice medicine for learners who come from different cultural backgrounds, such as providing simulation and computer-aided training for students who are not allowed to dissect cadavers due to spiritual beliefs.

The program at TouroCOM in Great Falls is expected to graduate 135 physicians each year.

Cowboys & Artists

Great Falls has a storied history of great art, dating back to the late 1800s and famed American artist of the American West Charles Marion Russell, who was one of the highest paid artists in the U.S. by the 1920s (largely helped by the business management acumen of his wife, Nancy Cooper Russell). Raised in Missouri, Russell moved to Montana at age 16 to work on ranches and lived there the rest of his life, eventually becoming a self-taught, full-time and prolific creator of Western works.

Every year, the week of March 19 (Russell’s birthday) is marked by Western Art Week in Great Falls. Millions of dollars in fine art are exhibited and sold at this event held at different locations in Great Falls, culminating in the Russell Auction — the hallmark fine art fundraising event held at the C.M.

LanzaJet has achieved a global first, confirming that its Freedom Pines Fuels plant in Soperton, Georgia, is now fully operational and producing on-spec jet fuel from ethanol at a commercial scale.

This marks the first time that alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel has been manufactured in a commercial-scale facility anywhere in the world, and the first time a non-oil-based sustainable aviation fuel pathway beyond HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) has reached this level of maturity.

The plant integrates several first-of-a-kind technologies, including LanzaJet’s proprietary ethanol-to-jet process, Technip Energies’ Hummingbird ethanol to ethylene unit, and an oligomerisation system developed jointly by the US Department of Energy and LanzaTech. LanzaJet brings these systems together into a continuous, end-to-end operation that produces fully certified jet fuel ready for blending.

The project represents over $300 million of investment and employment of more than 300 workers during construction. Around 65 direct and indirect roles remain in ongoing operations.

Company Chief Executive Jimmy Samartzis called the milestone “a major win for global aviation” and a demonstration of what is possible when research, engineering, and commercial deployment align. LanzaJet says the facility now serves as the template for future ATJ projects around the world.

How ethanol-to-jet unlocks new feedstocks beyond HEFA for SAF

This development addresses one of the central challenges facing the aviation sector. Almost all current SAF production is based on HEFA, and multiple expert bodies have warned that HEFA feedstocks are approaching their limit. Used cooking oil, animal fats, and related bio-oils cannot meet long-term demand, even with aggressive expansion.

ATJ directly broadens the supply base. Ethanol is produced at an industrial scale in multiple regions, and can also be derived from waste biomass, agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon. This allows countries with established ethanol industries to build domestic SAF capacity rather than rely on imports, reducing exposure to the feedstock constraints that have shaped the SAF market to date.

Freedom Pines demonstrates that a non-HEFA SAF pathway can operate reliably at a commercial scale, providing a reference design for other nations and investors. For airlines, it confirms that one of the most discussed next-generation SAF technologies can now deliver real volumes.

The timing is critical. With SAF mandates tightening in the EU, UK, and US, regulators have been clear that new pathways must reach commercial readiness before 2030 if long-term targets are to be met. Until now, few technologies had crossed that threshold.

What LanzaJet’s breakthrough means for future SAF production

LanzaJet intends to license and deploy its ATJ technology globally. The company is already working with partners in the US, UK, Japan, Australia, India, the EU, the Middle East, and South America. Freedom Pines is expected to serve as the model for future facilities, giving investors and governments a proven baseline for performance and integration.

The next phase will focus on replication at larger scales, cost reduction as plants mature, and securing long-term ethanol supply agreements, especially from waste and residue sources. The aviation sector will be watching closely to see whether ATJ plants can be brought online more quickly and reliably than other next-generation SAF projects, including Power to Liquid.

If successful, ATJ could become the first major post-HEFA pathway to deliver meaningful volumes of SAF before the end of the decade, easing supply pressure and helping airlines meet rising blend requirements. In a market defined by uncertainty, LanzaJet has now provided one of the clearest signs that the next wave of SAF production is finally beginning to materialise.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lanzajet-ethanol-to-jet-fuel-SAF-plant-at-Freedom-Pines.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 11:56:53.678677

This isn't really new. People have been working on this for over a decade now and unfortunately it has been a rocky road. In the US, interest as of late has all but evaporated due to uncertainty in the regulatory regime. The failure of the Fulcrum Bioenergy SAF project in Nevada didn't help boost enthusiasm for investing in these types of projects either. Fortunately, there are still opportunities abroad.

Trying to convince yourself that any kind of ""sustainable"" aviation is possible is delusional.

One of the most promising technologies in nearly a decade to reach commercial readiness, LanzaJet's ATJ technology offers a scalable solution to decarbonize aviation, leveraging the world's widely available ethanol feedstocks and the substantial additional production of ethanol possible from waste sources and recycled carbon. It provides the opportunity for countries to reinforce and expand their agriculture sectors by accessing this new market, enables economic development, and enhances domestic energy security. Nations can now leverage and control supply chains and domestic production of their fuels with LanzaJet's breakthrough technology.

LanzaJet Freedom Pines Fuels serves as a blueprint for future SAF production, creating a new pathway for global deployment and commercialization of the company's ATJ technology. LanzaJet successfully troubleshot and brought into operation a fully integrated First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) plant and technology solution. Included in LanzaJet's plant are also FOAK technologies - Technip Energies' Hummingbird® technology - an Ethanol-to-Ethylene solution, and Oligomerization jointly developed by the US Department of Energy and LanzaTech. LanzaJet invested in, engineered, built, integrated, and fully operationalized these technologies and the overall integrated solution to efficiently operate the plant as the first commercial-scale fuels facility.

LanzaJet's ATJ technology is designed to work with a broad range of sustainable feedstocks – including agricultural residues, energy crops, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon – to deliver significant lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions compared to conventional jet fuel. Once blended with Jet A-1 fuel, the result is a fully certified solution compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. LanzaJet is delivering this technology throughout the world including the US, Australia, Japan, India, United Kingdom, Colombia, European Union, Middle East, and Kazakhstan.

Located in Treutlen County in Soperton, Georgia and less than 100 miles from Savannah, LanzaJet invested over $300M to develop this facility which employed more than 300 people during construction and has created more than 65 direct and indirect jobs during ongoing operations.

LanzaJet stands as the culmination of a history of firsts within the SAF industry, dating back to its origins as part of LanzaTech in 2012 as the first ethanol-to-SAF technology which was developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab. That early work enabled lab-, pilot- and demo-scale plants, production of on-spec fuels, the approval of the ethanol-to-SAF pathway by ASTM in 2016, and the technology's first commercial flights which were completed with Virgin Atlantic and All Nippon Airways in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

What the Plan Proposes The Plan outlines how the Government intends to deliver the UK's carbon budgets while driving economic growth and energy resilience.
UK Methane Action Plan Published in parallel, the UK Methane Action Plan5 complements the Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan by focusing on reducing methane emissions domestically and internationally.","Overview

On 29 October 2025, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (""DESNZ"") published the Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan (the ""Plan"")1– a policy framework setting out how the UK will meet its statutory Carbon Budgets 4 to 6, covering the period 2023 to 2037.

The Plan has been published shortly before states meet at the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Belem (COP 30). One of the stated objectives of the Plan is to integrate the UK's national carbon budget with its international commitments on climate change mitigation, including the 2030 and 2035 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. It also marks a renewed phase in UK climate policy, which combines emissions-reduction targets with a growth-oriented industrial strategy. It seeks to accelerate progress toward net zero by 2050, while strengthening energy security, lowering household bills, and positioning the UK as a global destination for clean-energy investment.

What are carbon budgets?

Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the UK is legally bound to cap its total greenhouse gas emissions within successive five-year ""carbon budgets."" These budgets serve as interim milestones to ensure the UK remains on course for its long-term net-zero target. Each budget is set 12 years in advance based on recommendations from the Climate Change Committee and is legally binding, making them a central pillar of the UK's climate governance framework.

The UK is currently operating within Carbon Budget 4 (2023-2027) and is broadly on track to comply. Carbon Budget 6 (2033-2037) was set in 2021, and the level for Carbon Budget 7 (2038-2042) must be confirmed by June 2026. These legally binding limits provide the structural pathway for climate policy, shaping regulation, investment priorities and compliance obligations across the economy.

Why do they matter?

Carbon budgets translate the UK's long-term net-zero ambition into enforceable and intermediate targets, which create a structured pathway for emissions reduction. They shape government policy, regulatory frameworks and market signals, and also provide clarity and certainty for key stakeholders navigating the energy transition. The adequacy and transparency of previous UK carbon budgets have been subject to legal scrutiny in the English courts, with questions raised about their compliance with statutory requirements under the Climate Change Act.

What the Plan Proposes

The Plan outlines how the Government intends to deliver the UK's carbon budgets while driving economic growth and energy resilience. It consolidates over 300 policies and proposals across key sectors, such as power, industry, transport, heat and land use, which reflects a more integrated approach than previous climate strategies. Central themes include:

Energy security and diversification: with continued emphasis on scaling up renewable generation, nuclear power and low-carbon hydrogen. The Plan identifies key national infrastructure priorities, including the delivery of Sizewell C in East Anglia and the expansion of carbon-capture and storage projects in the North West and North East, both viewed as essential to maintaining stable baseload supply and supporting industrial decarbonisation.

Economic growth through clean technology: highlighting the UK's ambition to position itself as a global leader in green finance and net-zero innovation. The Plan forecasts the creation of 400,000 new jobs by 2030, underpinned by major investments in offshore-wind infrastructure in Wales and Scotland, grid upgrades and manufacturing of electric vehicle components.

Transport and industry: the Plan also highlights measures to decarbonise hard-to-abate sectors, including aviation. The forthcoming Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate came into effect in 2025, requiring SAF to comprise 2% of total UK jet fuel demand, rising linearly to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The mandate is intended to stimulate innovation in advanced fuels, promote the diversification of feedstocks and reduce reliance on limited bio-based resources. Beyond its emissions benefits, the policy is designed to attract private investment in domestic SAF production facilities and to position the UK as a competitive hub for low-carbon aviation fuel production and technology.

The Plan follows a period of legal and political scrutiny over earlier government climate strategies, which courts found insufficient under the Climate Change Act 2008. This iteration is therefore more data-driven and designed to be litigation-resilient, setting out clearer sectoral milestones, accountability mechanisms and evidence-based modelling to demonstrate compliance with statutory carbon budgets.

Financing and Investor Signalling

For the first time, the Plan is accompanied by a dedicated Investor Prospectus4 aimed at translating the UK's climate ambition into clear investment opportunities and financing pathways. The Investor Prospectus was developed with the Department for Business and Trade's Office for Investment and provides high-level guidance on where investors (from institutional financiers to infrastructure developers) can identify opportunities within the UK's net-zero transition.

In the coming months, DESNZ is expected to release a series of detailed sector factsheets, providing further clarity on policy interventions, timelines and anticipated impacts on power, heat, buildings, transport and industry.

For market participants, the Investor Prospectus signals a more transparent, partnership-based model for climate investment. It may potentially also inform due diligence and financing assumptions, particularly for long-term infrastructure and energy projects.

UK Methane Action Plan

Published in parallel, the UK Methane Action Plan5 complements the Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan by focusing on reducing methane emissions domestically and internationally. It sets out actions across agriculture, energy and waste, which are sectors responsible for a significant share of the UK's methane output, and also reaffirms the UK's commitment to the Global Methane Pledge, which targets a 30% global reduction by 2030 from 2020 levels. Recent efforts include the UK being elected Co-Chair of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition alongside Brazil in February 2025, signalling a strengthened commitment to international collaboration, as well as the promotion of the use of Earth Observation technologies to improve the monitoring and verification of methane emissions, a move intended to enhance transparency and data-driven policymaking. Connections and comparisons will be drawn with the EU Methane Reduction Regulation (MERR), discussed here.

Conclusion

The Plan sets a clearer pathway for how the UK intends to meet its statutory carbon budgets while promoting investment and energy security. In the suite of documents accompanying the Plan, the Government has also published a report on ""Unlocking the benefits of the clean energy economy""6, setting out the government's overarching strategy to reduce emissions to enhance energy security and create economic growth, as well as its response to the Climate Change Committee's Progress Report.7 Together, the Plan provides greater policy transparency for investors and businesses, particularly across the power, industry and transport sectors. However, delivery will depend on timely implementation of enabling regulation and funding mechanisms. It is important that organisations operating in affected sectors monitor upcoming DESNZ updates, which will define the detailed measures needed to achieve the UK's net-zero trajectory.

This innovative approach promises not only to divert mountains of trash from landfills but also to power airplanes with up to 90% lower emissions compared to conventional jet fuel, offering a compelling pathway toward a cleaner, more circular economy for air travel.

The Dual Challenge: Waste Crisis and Aviation Emissions

Cities worldwide grapple with ever-increasing volumes of municipal solid waste, a complex stream of organic matter, plastics, paper, and other materials. Traditionally, much of this waste ends up in landfills, consuming valuable land and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions through decomposition, or is incinerated, which can contribute to air pollution. Simultaneously, the aviation sector faces intense pressure to reduce its environmental footprint. Airplanes currently account for approximately 2.5% of global planet-warming gas pollution, and without significant intervention, these emissions are projected to more than double in the coming decades as air travel demand surges.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a critical solution for decarbonizing aviation. Unlike traditional jet fuel derived from fossil sources, SAF is produced from renewable and waste-derived resources, such as agricultural residue, used cooking oil, forestry waste, animal fats, and critically, municipal solid waste.

The Science of Turning Trash into Thrust

The conversion of municipal solid waste into jet fuel is a sophisticated process that typically involves several key stages, predominantly relying on thermochemical conversion technologies.

Gasification: Breaking Down the Waste

The journey begins with gasification, where pre-processed MSW is heated in a controlled, oxygen-limited environment. This process breaks down the solid, carbon-rich waste into a synthesis gas, or “syngas,” primarily composed of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This initial step is considered a core technical challenge in biomass energy development due to the heterogeneous nature of municipal waste. Improvements in gasification systems are crucial for scaling up this technology.

Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis: Rebuilding Molecules

Following gasification, the syngas enters a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactor. Here, with the aid of catalysts, the carbon monoxide and hydrogen molecules undergo a polymerization reaction, combining to form long-chain hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons are the building blocks for various fuels.

Refining and Hydrocracking: Tailoring for Aviation

The hydrocarbons produced in the Fischer-Tropsch process then undergo further refining, often through a step called hydrocracking. This process breaks down the long-chain hydrocarbons into the precise molecular structure required for jet fuel (kerosene). The resulting fuel is chemically very similar to conventional jet fuel, allowing it to be a “drop-in” fuel that can be blended with regular jet fuel (currently up to 50% for commercial flights, though 100% can be used on modern airliners) and used in existing aircraft engines and airport infrastructure without modification.

Significant Emissions Reduction and Environmental Benefits

Studies, including one published in Nature Sustainability, indicate that converting municipal solid waste into sustainable aviation fuel can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80-90% compared to conventional jet fuel on a life cycle basis. This substantial reduction stems from both the sustainable sourcing of the fuel and the diversion of waste from landfills, which are a major source of methane—a potent greenhouse gas.

Beyond carbon emissions, waste-to-jet fuel also offers additional environmental advantages. The production process can lead to a 90% reduction in particulate matter emissions during combustion, contributing to improved air quality around airports. Moreover, by repurposing waste, this technology promotes a circular economy, conserves landfill space, and reduces pollution pressure on watersheds when wet wastes are utilized.

Global Potential and Economic Outlook

The potential impact of waste-to-jet fuel is significant. Researchers estimate that globally, more than 62.5 billion liters of trash-based jet fuel could be produced annually, which could cut global aviation pollution by 16%. If green hydrogen is integrated into the process, production could reach 80 million tons per year, potentially supplying up to 28% of global jet fuel demand and reducing emissions by as much as 270 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

Several companies are actively pursuing waste-to-jet fuel solutions. LanzaJet, Neste, World Energy, Gevo, and Alder Fuels are among the key players in the sustainable aviation fuel space, developing innovative technologies and scaling up production. Partnerships, such as the one between NetJets and WasteFuel, aim to establish biorefineries that convert municipal waste into SAF, with targets of converting millions of tons of waste into tens of millions of gallons of SAF annually.

Challenges and the Path Forward

Despite its immense promise, widespread adoption of waste-to-jet fuel faces hurdles. The primary challenge remains cost, with SAF often being significantly more expensive than fossil jet fuel. Scaling up the complex gasification process for diverse waste streams is also a technical challenge that researchers are actively working to overcome. Furthermore, ensuring a consistent and high-quality feedstock supply from municipal waste requires robust waste management and sorting systems.

Overcoming these challenges will require continued research and development, supportive policies, and financial incentives to make SAF cost-competitive and to scale up production facilities. The “waste-to-fuel” approach is a critical step in the aviation industry’s journey toward net-zero emissions, offering a tangible way to clean up the skies while simultaneously addressing one of humanity’s most persistent environmental problems. The opportunity to turn a negative-value waste stream into a high-value energy asset is a powerful driver for this sustainable transition.",https://enertherm-engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/file-569.png,N,,2025-11-13 12:57:03.577045

By 2024, that number had soared to 9.5 billion, and projections from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and Airports Council International (ACI) suggest global air #travel could reach 22.3 billion passengers by 2053, nearly 2.4 times today’s volume.

Growth is driven by expanding middle-class travel in emerging markets, new routes, and the strengthening of global tourism networks. Yet, this expansion also brings challenges. Airlines remain committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) still meets less than 0.5% of fuel demand, with high costs and limited supply slowing progress.

As the world advances, balancing accessibility with sustainability will define the next era of global aviation, where progress in the skies must also entail responsibility on the ground.

Among the newly added or updated materials are wastewaters from papermaking, contaminated crude methanol, residues from beverage ethanol production, as well as papermaking wastewaters.

The new entries join a broad list of double-counting waste materials already eligible for renewable fuel generation, such as used cooking oil, palm oil mill effluent, brown grease, municipal grass cuttings and organic municipal solid waste.

Reinforcing circular economy goals

RTFO and SAF Mandate lists form part of the UK's circular economy approach to decarbonizing transport fuels.

Today, the prospects for the sector are more favourable in Europe.

While the SAF market in Europe has continued to gain momentum over the past year, sentiment in the US has cooled following the anti-climate stance of the Trump administration.

In Europe, visibility into revenues for SAF producers is getting clearer, while their US counterparts have spent 2025 shrouded in uncertainty.

Despite this, US corporates have been putting more money into funding initiatives for SAF. Just last month, a coalition of aviation players got together to launch the $150m Oneworld BEV Fund, anchored by American Airlines and Alaskan Airlines, and managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. That followed another group of corporates that backed the $100m United Airlines Sustainable Aviation Fund in 2023, which gained more LPs from the industry over the following year.

Regulatory cliff

But a US-based SAF investor was downbeat about the SAF market in the US. “It’s a different market from November of last year, that’s probably what the decisive turning point was,” says the investor, referring to Donald Trump’s election victory, which pulled a curtain down over sustainability initiatives backed by the US federal government, including subsidies for SAF developers.

“When the notion of the fund first got started, the regulatory environment, particularly in the United States, was much different,” says the SAF-focused investor.

“All this stuff takes lots of capital, and that capital really was going to be unlocked by virtue of government support, in one form or another, that was going to underpin the funding for it. That support has waned,” he says.

Federal tax credits in the US for sustainable fuels such as the 45Z credits under the Inflation Reduction Act which are given per gallon of SAF produced are less certain than they would have been when some startups last raised money. The new administration’s Treasury Department gave guidance earlier this year that softened expectations for the eligibility of certain feedstocks, and legislative proposals are in the works that might cap the credit-per-gallon below where it was expected.

45Z credits are meant to start this year but are set to expire in 2027 unless extended. That might change depending on the results of the mid-term elections.

At the state level, there are low carbon fuel standards (LCFS), which incentivise producers to lower the average lifecycle carbon intensity of their fuels below a declining annual target.

While LCFS rules are legally independent from federal regulations, the value of the credits is not unaffected by federal regulations. If 45Z support goes down, LCFS credits can actually become more valuable because there is less supply of credits overall, but any state-level increase would not likely compensate for the loss of federal support.

The SAF investor tells GCV that their portfolio companies do have enough liquidity for the next couple of years. For now, they’re in a holding pattern, watching to see how regulations evolve.

By contrast, European players are more confident. Both the UK and the EU have incremental blending mandates that are starting to kick in. The UK SAF mandate requires 2% of the UK’s aviation fuel demand to be met with SAF, ratcheting up to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

The EU’s ReFuelEU mandate starts slower but then accelerates faster than the UK’s, requiring 2% of member states’ fuel to be met with SAF this year, increasing to 6% by 2030, 34% by 2040, and 70% by 2050.

A European startup that recently raised funds is UK-based OXCCU, a company developing technology to convert carbon into fuels and chemicals. Its recent $28m series B saw more participation from corporates including Eni, Aramco, IAG, Safran, and Orlen compared with its series A. Encouraged by the success of its OX1 pilot plant at London Oxford Airport, it is seeking to open its second, larger demonstration plant next year.

Apart from OXCCU, other European SAF startups to get funded this year include Norwegian SAF producer Wastefront and Swiss SAF technology company Metafuels.

Tech advances

While SAF policy is progressing by fits and starts, the technology to produce low carbon aviation fuel is making headway. Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and eSAF have expanded the feedstock landscape. A large amount of money is still needed to build out commercial-scale facilities, although it may prove to be cheaper to retrofit existing refineries that are not making money.

SAF producers are seeking to change the kind of feedstocks they are using. Regulators and entrepreneurs are prioritising carbon feedstocks such as biogas, waste wood, agricultural waste and captured CO2 because they don’t bring the challenges of food displacement that crop-based bio-fuels do.

“We can start from biomethane or CO2, and I don’t think CO2 is in short supply,” says Nacho Gimenez, COO at OXCCU, who previously considered investments in SAF while an investor at BP Ventures and energy investor DTEK. The problem becomes more a logistical one of capturing the carbon and transporting it than sourcing it in the first place, he adds.

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is increasingly popular because it takes waste products such as used cooking oil, fatty streams from industrial waste, and other fats and vegetable oils, and can heavily reduce the lifecycle emissions.

But the availability of sustainable feedstock for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids compared with other feedstocks such as cultivated palm oil is not enough to meet demand. It is also more costly.

eSAF is also gaining popularity because it is made with renewable hydrogen and captured CO2, typically reducing emissions by at least 70% compared with jet fuel. It circumvents the supply constraints of hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids and benefits from a sub-mandate for synthetic fuels under ReFuelEU.

Wider outlook

The price of SAF production is still high, requiring economies of scale and large capex.

The price of jet fuel is tied to oil, while the ultimate price of SAF is determined by negotiated contracts.

The capex for building the production infrastructure will only come if investors see that offtake contracts are available at a good price. And at least in the US, where there is no federal blending mandate, that’s even harder to picture than in Europe. Some US investors are taking a step back to see where things go before committing more capital.

“We’ve laid our bets around the space [in terms of technologies], but the market kind of in a trough right now as it relates to climate tech, and sustainability in particular,” says the SAF investor.

“We’re being very prudent and measured with where we deploy capital going forward.”

But, even in Europe, if the costs aren’t brought down by the time the heavier mandates kick in, those costs will be passed on to consumers. Volume by itself is not enough, it will be the most cost-efficient startups that succeed.

“Once we get to those blending levels of 2040, it will not be the biggest SAF producers that thrive, but it will be the most economic producers,” says Gimenez.",https://globalventuring.com/content/uploads/2025/11/Feature-lead-image.png,N,,2025-11-13 07:56:27.321146

Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit organised by FICCI in partnership with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Minister underlined the urgent need for clarity, collaboration, and commitment among all stakeholders to meet the aviation sector’s growing energy demand.

“The aviation sector continues to expand faster than most other transport segments, with an annual growth rate of 6.7 per cent and nearly 10 million passenger trips expected in 2025,” said Kinjarapu. “Our ATF consumption is projected to reach 15–16 million tonnes by 2030 and 30–31 million tonnes by 2040. The solution lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuels.”

He confirmed that the Ministry is finalising the SAF policy to accelerate adoption. “The Ministry has been taking robust steps to speed up the SAF movement, and we are committed to releasing the SAF policy soon,” he stated.

Highlighting India’s potential, Kinjarapu said that as an agricultural powerhouse generating over 750 million tonnes of biomass, the country can become a global leader in SAF production. This transition, he said, could reduce India’s crude oil import bill by US$ 5–7 billion annually and generate around one million green jobs across the SAF value chain.

Over the past nine years, India has added 90 airports and 400 aircraft, while scheduled flight movements have risen by 78 per cent . The government plans to add 50 airports in the next five years and 200 more over the next two decades, with passenger traffic projected to reach 500 million annually.

Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, Director General of Civil Aviation, noted that decarbonising aviation is a shared global responsibility. “Our ambition to achieve a 5 per cent SAF blending target by 2030 is not just a goal but a declaration of intent to lead by example,” he said.

Adding an industry perspective, Jurgen Westermeier, Chairman, FICCI National Civil Aviation Committee and President & MD, Airbus India & South Asia, called SAF a transformative opportunity. “For India, SAF goes beyond environmental targets—it can enhance energy security and sovereignty,” he said.

Ashish Saraf, Co-Chairman, FICCI Civil Aviation Committee and Vice President & Country Head India, Pratt & Whitney, added, “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the cornerstone of India’s Net Zero aviation story. It can reduce emissions by up to two-thirds, positioning India as a global SAF hub.”

Municipal solid waste as a feedstock Municipal solid waste includes organic matter like food scraps and paper as well as plastics and metals.
Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs.","Aviation currently contributes about 2.5% of total global carbon emissions, and with air travel demand expected to double by 2040, cutting those emissions has become a pressing priority. One path forward is sustainable aviation fuel, a low-carbon alternative made from feedstocks such as used cooking oil and crops. But despite its potential, sustainable aviation fuel makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly due to high production costs and limited supply.

A new study in Nature Sustainability points to a promising breakthrough: using municipal solid waste as a reliable, low-emission, cost-effective feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel.

Researchers from Tsinghua University and the Harvard-China Project on Energy, Economy, and Environment evaluated municipal solid waste-based jet fuel produced through industrial-scale gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A life cycle analysis found that jet fuel made from municipal waste could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80–90% compared with conventional jet fuel. The main technical hurdle lies in scaling up gasification systems for widespread use.

""Unlike road transport, which is quickly shifting toward electrification, there's no silver-bullet solution for achieving carbon-neutral aviation,"" said Jingran Zhang, the study's first author and a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-China Project who is supported by the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability at Harvard. ""Turning everyday trash into jet fuel could be an innovative but major near-term step toward cleaner aviation. By converting municipal waste into low-carbon jet fuel that already works in today's engines, we can start cutting emissions immediately, without waiting for future technology.""

Municipal solid waste as a feedstock

Municipal solid waste includes organic matter like food scraps and paper as well as plastics and metals. Traditionally, much of this waste has been landfilled or incinerated, which consumes land or can contribute to air pollution. As landfill space shrinks and waste generation rises, converting municipal solid waste into liquid fuels could conserve land, cut emissions, and produce cleaner energy to help cities move toward zero-waste goals.

The Harvard study explores the largely under-researched potential of municipal solid waste-based jet fuel using real-world data on Fischer-Tropsch gasification technology. The researchers analyzed key emission sources, calculated greenhouse gas impacts, and identified ways to boost efficiency.

They found that while the process significantly lowers emissions, only about 33% of input carbon is converted into fuel due to gas composition mismatches. Efficiency could be improved by capturing carbon dioxide or adding green hydrogen, produced with renewable power, during processing.

Global implications

Many countries are ramping up efforts to make aviation more sustainable by adopting cleaner fuels. In the United States, the government aims to produce up to 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels annually by 2050, supported by strong financial incentives. In the European Union, new regulations will require all departing flights to gradually increase their share of sustainable aviation fuels, catapulting from 2% in 2025 to 70% by 2050. On a global scale, the International Civil Aviation Organization's CORSIA program requires operators to offset emissions growth, which they can do by buying eligible offsets or by using sustainable fuels.

The study examined how municipal solid waste could be converted into sustainable aviation fuel under several scenarios. In the most practical case, global municipal solid waste could yield around 50 million tons (62 billion liters) of jet fuel globally, cutting aviation's greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 16%. If waste management and conversion systems are inefficient, the benefits drop substantially.

However, if green hydrogen is integrated into the process, production could reach 80 million tons per year, which is enough to supply up to 28% of global jet fuel demand and reduce emissions by as much as 270 million tons of carbon dioxide annually.

In Europe, the projected output would already exceed the European Union's jet fuel-blending targets while remaining compliant with sustainability standards. Economically, the study suggests that adopting municipal solid waste-based jet fuels could save airlines money under carbon pricing systems like CORSIA, particularly when government incentives and subsidies are factored in.

Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuel currently makes up less than 1% of global jet fuel use, mainly because of its high production costs. This underscores the urgent need for strong policy action and financial incentives to scale up supply.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/airplane-wing.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 10:57:40.008757

The October fuel deliveries mark the company’s second and third major SAF deployments at U.S. airports within six months, following its first deployment at Los Angeles International Airport in May.

“Each executed agreement signals to fuel producers that airlines are willing and eager collaborators to help scale the SAF market,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, FedEx chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs. “The aviation industry still faces a mismatch between available SAF supply and carrier demand, but we are encouraged by early signs of increased SAF production globally this year.”

Chicago-O’Hare International Airport

At O’Hare, FedEx will receive a total of one million gallons of neat SAF blended at a minimum 30% mix from Air bp. With its first delivery in October, FedEx became the first U.S. all-cargo airline to purchase and deploy SAF at the airport.

“Existing fuel infrastructure and enabling policy conditions at the state level made sourcing SAF at O’Hare a logical next step in our alternative fuel procurement strategy,” Blanks Ellis said.

Miami International Airport

At Miami International Airport, FedEx has started receiving approximately three million gallons of blended SAF at a minimum 30% blend from AEG.

“With FedEx flights from Miami serving Latin America and the Caribbean daily, we are proud to see our Miami hub leading the way in sustainable fuel adoption,” said Luiz R. Vasconcelos, president of FedEx Latin America and the Caribbean. “This milestone reinforces our commitment and shows our customers that sustainability is not just a corporate goal—it is a regional priority. From SAF deployment in Miami to the rollout of electric delivery vehicles in Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Brazil, we are embedding sustainable innovation across our operations and contributing to our global sustainability strategy.”

SAF Part of Broader Aviation Sustainability Efforts

Neat SAF is mixed with traditional jet fuel before use, while blended SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that does not require changes to aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure. FedEx aims to source 30% of its fuel from alternative sources, on a blended basis, by 2030.

SAF is a key part of FedEx’s broader aviation sustainability and fuel efficiency strategy. While SAF and conventional jet fuel have similar emissions profiles when burned, SAF production can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared with conventional fuels. To meet industry-wide emissions goals, airlines must also focus on reducing overall fuel consumption and improving operational efficiency alongside SAF adoption.

Aircraft modernization and other fuel-saving initiatives allowed FedEx to avoid using 140 million gallons of jet fuel in FY 2024, saving the company $400 million. In the same year, FedEx met its previous target of reducing aircraft emissions intensity by 30% from a 2005 baseline and has since set a new goal of a 40% reduction by 2034.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-7.png,N,,2025-11-13 07:57:14.575017

Closing this gap will only happen with urgent, coordinated action to put green training at the core of every climate and business plan. Doing so not only accelerates progress, it connects people to economic opportunity.”

The initiative has already engaged with several countries, including Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, Senegal, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, to bring knowledge and learning functions together, as well establish country and industry action partnerships.

As a foundation for further cooperation, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) has published three case studies on Brazil, Kenya and Pakistan, while the German government’s International Climate Initiative (IKI) has funded a case study exploring the impact of skills shortages on global power emissions.

“The transition to a low-carbon economy will only succeed if people are positioned to benefit from it and equipped to drive it forward,” added Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of WRI. “By investing in people’s skills and potential, we turn the challenge of decarbonisation into an engine for growth and shared prosperity.” Read more here.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSarYrCRgtflDS1W/2adb10604ec34f367f0b6fd2040a4ebd06d59850effe766efcc67cbb08eddce4/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=news-1&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%231e6000%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2024%252F12%252Flogo-white.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fsustainabilityonline.net%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2025%252F11%252Fpexels-kampus-8636637.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22New%2520global%2520initiative%2520seeks%2520to%2520%2527make%2520climate%2520action%2520work%2520for%2520people%2527%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Fsustainabilityonline.net%2Fnews%2Fnew-global-initiative-seeks-to-make-climate-action-work-for-people,N,,2025-11-13 07:57:18.948138

This levy will support the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, and help reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. By charging passengers a small fee, the government ensures that the costs of transitioning to greener aviation practices are fairly distributed. This initiative positions Singapore as a global leader in aviation sustainability, setting an example for other nations and marking a significant milestone in efforts to reduce the environmental impact of air travel.

In a groundbreaking move, Singapore is introducing a “green fuel levy” on flights departing from Changi Airport, starting from April 2026. This levy, aimed at funding the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marks a significant step in the aviation industry’s efforts to address climate change. As one of the first countries to incorporate environmental accountability into flight pricing, Singapore is setting a global example for how major air hubs can balance the demand for air travel with the need for sustainability. While the levy is modest, it signifies a major shift in how airlines and passengers will approach eco-conscious flying.

What Is the Green Fuel Levy?

The green fuel levy is a new charge introduced by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, derived from renewable, low-carbon sources such as waste biomass and used cooking oil. SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel. However, it is still significantly more expensive to produce. To bridge this cost gap, the green fuel levy will be applied to all departing flights from Singapore, with the funds earmarked solely for the purchase of SAF.

The levy varies based on the distance of the flight and the class of travel. For example, passengers in economy or premium economy class will pay between S$1 (approximately Rs 68) for short regional flights and S$10.40 (around Rs 700) for long-haul journeys, such as those to the Americas. Business and first-class travellers will pay more, ranging from S$4 (Rs 270) to S$41.60 (around Rs 2,800), reflecting the higher fuel consumption associated with longer, more energy-intensive flights. Cargo flights are also subject to the levy, with charges ranging from S$0.01 to S$0.15 per kilogram, depending on the flight distance.

Key Dates and Applicability of the Green Fuel Levy

The green fuel levy officially takes effect from October 2026, but it will only apply to tickets issued from April 1, 2026, onward. Passengers who book tickets before this date will not be subject to the levy, even if their flight departs after the policy is implemented. The levy is applicable exclusively to flights departing from Singapore, meaning transit passengers who only pass through Changi Airport will not be required to pay the charge. For transparency, the levy will be clearly listed as a separate line item on flight tickets, ensuring passengers are fully informed of the additional cost.

The Rationale Behind the Green Fuel Levy

Singapore, as one of Asia’s busiest and most strategically important aviation hubs, plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of sustainable aviation. The levy is designed to help Singapore achieve its target of using sustainable aviation fuel for 1% of the country’s total jet fuel consumption by 2026, with plans to increase this figure to 3-5% by 2030. The initiative is in line with Singapore’s broader sustainability goals, which aim to reduce carbon emissions and improve the environmental footprint of air travel.

By introducing the green fuel levy, Singapore is also spreading the cost of greener air travel in a fair and transparent way. Rather than placing the burden solely on airlines or taxpayers, the government is asking passengers to contribute to the cost of cleaner aviation. This ensures that the transition to sustainable fuel remains financially viable while making a tangible impact on the country’s carbon reduction targets. The funds collected through the levy will be dedicated exclusively to the procurement of SAF, ensuring that the money is used efficiently and effectively for its intended purpose.

What Does the Green Fuel Levy Mean for Travellers?

For most passengers, the impact of the green fuel levy will be relatively small. The additional charge for economy class travellers ranges from Rs 68 to Rs 700, depending on the flight’s length. While this may be an additional expense, it is minimal compared to the overall cost of a flight ticket, especially for long-haul trips. For business and first-class passengers, the levy is higher, reflecting the larger carbon footprint of these more premium services.

One key point for travellers to remember is that tickets purchased before April 1, 2026, will not include the levy, even if the flight is scheduled after the policy comes into effect. This gives passengers some time to plan and adjust their travel arrangements if they wish to avoid the additional charge.

The introduction of the green fuel levy marks a significant shift in the aviation industry, as airlines, airports, and passengers are increasingly being asked to play a role in tackling climate change. By directly funding sustainable aviation fuel, Singapore is helping to pave the way for a greener future in air travel. This initiative not only reduces the environmental impact of flying but also sends a powerful message about the role of the aviation industry in contributing to broader sustainability goals.

Setting a Global Example for Sustainable Aviation

As one of the first countries to introduce a formal green fuel levy, Singapore’s move is likely to set a precedent for other global aviation hubs. The airline industry has long been one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, with fuel consumption being a significant source of emissions. By integrating environmental costs into flight pricing, Singapore is leading the charge in making sustainable air travel a reality. Other countries and airports around the world will likely follow suit, adopting similar models to support the transition to SAF and reduce the carbon footprint of global aviation.

While the green fuel levy is a small price to pay for most travellers, it represents a significant step toward sustainable air travel. The initiative not only supports Singapore’s ambitious carbon reduction goals but also encourages the global aviation industry to adopt more environmentally responsible practices. By charging passengers a modest fee to fund the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel, Singapore is not just reducing the environmental impact of its own aviation sector—it is helping to drive a global movement toward cleaner, greener skies.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-2025-11-13T104513283.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 03:57:09.316190

Following the acquisition, TGPL plans to change its name to TruAlt Sumi Gas Private Limited (hereinafter “TSGPL”). TSGPL aims to construct 16 compressed biomethane gas (CBG)*1 production facilities across India over the next three years and commence operations sequentially from 2026. The total daily production capacity of the 16 facilities is expected to reach approximately 320 tons, equivalent to the daily gas consumption of around 800,000 households in India. The raw materials for CBG production will include sugarcane and ethanol residue at TruAlt and other suppliers. The CBG produced will primarily be sold as automobile fuel to major city gas distributors within India. Alongside CBG production, Sumitomo Corporation and TruAlt also plan to collaborate on expanding bioethanol production and producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) derived from bioethanol.

Through its participation in the CBG production business and the bioenergy business in India, Sumitomo Corporation will accelerate the growth of its Energy Solutions Business, one of the key growth areas in its current Medium-Term Management Plan.

Promotion of CBG Supply in India

India, the world's third-largest energy consumer, is aiming to improve its energy self-sufficiency and achieve energy independence by 2047 in view of the country's growing energy demand. CBG is regarded as an important energy source that contributes both to effective waste utilization and improved energy self-sufficiency, as it can be produced from agricultural residue and other waste generated in India, a major agricultural nation. To promote domestic CBG supply, the Indian government has made it mandatory to blend CBG into automobile fuel and city gas for households. City gas distributors in India are required to gradually increase the CBG blending ratio and achieve a 5% CBG mix by 2028. Consequently, expansion of CBG production facilities in India is an urgent priority as the CBG market continues to grow.

Purpose of Investment in TSGPL

TruAlt is India's largest ethanol manufacturer and belongs to the same group with Nirani Sugars, one of India's major sugar producers. The company produces approximately two million liters of ethanol per day. TSGPL expects to achieve stable CBG production by sourcing raw materials such as residue generated during sugar manufacturing and ethanol production from TruAlt and other group companies’ production sites. Sumitomo Corporation will leverage its accumulated expertise and domestic network in India, particularly in the areas of CBG sales and marketing activities and will combine the strengths of both companies to promote CBG production across India.
