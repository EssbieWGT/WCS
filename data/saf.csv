Earlier this year, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, officially ditched net zero by 2050 as a Tory policy.
Labour was even forced to defend its net zero policy after an attack by its former leader, Tony Blair.
Traditional European carmakers were delighted, but manufacturers focused on electric cars said it would benefit Chinese rivals in the long term.
The UN-backed programme, launched in 2021, had committed firms to achieving net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.","Almost a year since Donald Trump returned to the White House with a rallying cry to the fossil fuel industry to “drill baby, drill”, a backlash against net zero appears to be gathering momentum.

More companies have retreated from, or watered down, their pledges to cut carbon emissions, instead prioritising shareholder returns over climate action.

In the UK, the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK has helped fracture the political consensus that had helped make Britain the first big economy to enshrine a commitment to cutting carbon emissions into law, in 2019. Earlier this year, the Conservative party leader, Kemi Badenoch, officially ditched net zero by 2050 as a Tory policy. Labour was even forced to defend its net zero policy after an attack by its former leader, Tony Blair.

Big players in retail and automotive this week became the latest businesses to weaken pledges – a retreat that threatens devastating consequences for the climate.

Running counter to this, many countries – notably China – have continued the march towards renewable power (which surpassed coal generation this year). Investment in clean energy, at $2tn a year, is now double that going into fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency.

Here we look at how important industries are treating net zero.

Cars and planes

For a few years after the pandemic, carmakers made bold promises that they would switch their factories to electric cars within a few years. Yet that momentum for change petered out by 2024 amid disappointing growth in battery car sales. In the US, EU and UK the lobbying campaign for weaker regulations has been intense – and successful.

Trump has torn up US electric vehicle subsidies – costing carmakers billions of dollars – and eased emissions rules to allow them to sell more cars with polluting petrol and diesel engines. This week, Ford said it would take a $19.5bn write-down and is scrapping several EV models.

The UK government said in April it would ease its zero-emission (ZEV) mandate. The rules still force carmakers to sell more electric cars each year, but new loopholes mean they can sell more hybrids, which combine a smaller battery with an internal combustion engine.

And the EU this week said that 10% of carmakers’ sales could be petrol or diesel after 2035, in a significant climbdown.

Traditional European carmakers were delighted, but manufacturers focused on electric cars said it would benefit Chinese rivals in the long term. Chris Heron, secretary general of E-Mobility Europe, a lobby group representing electric carmakers such as Tesla, Rivian and Polestar, said: “While China accelerates, Europe is hesitating, and hesitation is not a strategy.”

If the transition is stalling for ground transport, in the air things have not even started to take off. Airbus and Boeing, the global plane-making duopoly, have both made clear that their next planes will use gas turbine engines running on kerosene.

Airbus this year delayed plans to fly a plane using zero-emission “green” hydrogen by 2035, while supplies of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – the solution of choice for many in aviation – remain nugatory compared with the vast size of global demand.

Neither did UK government policy on aviation inspire confidence that net zero remained front and centre. Two London airports, Gatwick and Luton, had significant expansion plans signed off by ministers, meaning tens of thousands of additional flights a year at each.

Meanwhile, the chancellor gave resounding backing for Heathrow expansion – despite previous official work making clear that only limited growth, allied with swift progress on decarbonisation, could make a third runway in any way compatible with 2050 targets.

Energy

For now, UK green energy investors remain buoyed up by Labour’s aim to create a virtually carbon-free electricity system by 2030, to stick with the net zero target and its pledge for no new North Sea drilling (with caveats).

However, the government’s green targets were dealt a blow earlier this year when the struggling Danish renewable energy company Ørsted cancelled plans for one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarms, Hornsea 4, off the Yorkshire coast.

Europe’s oil majors, including BP and Shell, have retreated from their climate commitments in favour of refocusing on oil and gas production. BP’s boss, Murray Auchincloss – who was dramatically ousted this week – said the company’s optimism in the energy transition had been “misplaced” and promised the company’s disillusioned shareholders that he would “fundamentally reset” BP’s strategy after its failed attempt to go green. His successor appears unlikely to change tack. Shell set out plans to pump more oil and gas while halving its green spending.

Banks and financial services

A swathe of financial firms have been watering down climate commitments following Trump’s return.

The most public sign of the U-turn has been the collapse of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in October, after a wave of departures by US banks including JP Morgan, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, as well as UK lenders Barclays and HSBC. The UN-backed programme, launched in 2021, had committed firms to achieving net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.

HSBC had months earlier announced it was delaying omportant parts of its climate goals by 20 years and watering down environmental targets in a new long-term bonus plan for its chief executive, Georges Elhedery, who took over last year.

Large investment houses such as Vanguard and BlackRock have also pulled membership from a sister group known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, as the sector comes under pressure from Republican politicians.

Meanwhile, there are fears Labour could water down plans to require FTSE 100 firms and financial services to adopt “credible” climate transition plans, and disclosing their carbon footprints after City lobbying.

Retail

Retailers and their suppliers are among those taking a hard look at net zero ambitions amid rising costs.

Morrisons, the supermarket chain, this week delayed its ambition for net zero by 15 years until 2050, having previously set a deadline of 2035.

The British Retail Consortium industry body set out a roadmap to next zero by 2040 but its latest stocktake indicates the industry has only met the 2025 milestone on one measure – data on logistics. Only 38% of top suppliers have committed to meeting net zero.

Many retailers have reduced emissions in stores – with renewable energy and technology such as LED bulbs and electric vans – but most of their emissions are generated by their suppliers.

Even within stores the cost and complexity of shifting from gas to low-carbon heating , including the higher price of electricity compared with gas, has held back progress.

Local authorities

In the public sector, local councils have often taken net zero more seriously than even central government. Bristol was the first to declare a climate emergency in 2018 – a year before the government – and more than 300 other councils followed, with 90% setting net zero targets.

But as the political landscape has changed with the rise of Reform, some local authorities, led by those dominated by Farage’s party, are rolling back on net zero commitments. In Reform-led Lincolnshire, mayor Andrea Jenkyns has vowed to block any renewables projects in her jurisdiction (putting 12,000 jobs at risk if she succeeds), while Staffordshire county council, also Reform-controlled, has rescinded its declaration of a climate emergency.

Reform-controlled Durham council has scrapped its heat pump and solar panel scheme for government buildings, and energy efficiency upgrades such as insulation have been ditched in Kent, which is also under Reform.

Derbyshire county council disbanded its climate change, biodiversity and carbon reduction committee the week after Reform took power, and West Northamptonshire county council abandoned its net zero target.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b09b001d3eef92a03e30674799947d7384f81b2/468_0_4680_3744/master/4680.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48ee899d2264555f6f639914314d7316",N,,2025-12-20 05:57:23.244625

In its publication “Energy Demand of the Transport Sector,” part of the 2035 Ten-Year Energy Plan (PDE), the state-owned entity reports that SAF consumption will account for roughly 12% of domestic energy demand linked to passenger air transport by 2035.
EPE notes that 2027 marks the start of mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts for domestic operations by Brazilian airlines.
The PDE anticipates diesel oil B will remain the dominant fuel in the transport sector, with demand projected to reach 57.5 billion liters in 2035, growing 1.9% annually.
While electrification is gaining traction in specific areas such as last-mile freight, its share of total sector consumption is expected to remain limited through the end of the decade.","Brazil is poised for a major shift toward sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) beginning in 2027, with consumption projected to reach 0.03 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) by 2035, according to the Energy Research Company (EPE), reports bnamericas.

In its publication “Energy Demand of the Transport Sector,” part of the 2035 Ten-Year Energy Plan (PDE), the state-owned entity reports that SAF consumption will account for roughly 12% of domestic energy demand linked to passenger air transport by 2035.

The expected expansion is attributed to emission reduction targets under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) and ProBioQAV, established by the federal Fuel of the Future program. EPE notes that 2027 marks the start of mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cuts for domestic operations by Brazilian airlines.

Petrobras and Acelen are among the companies advancing research and planning SAF production in the country. In contrast, Brasil Biofuels (BBF) has paused its plans as the company undergoes court-supervised reorganization following a filing earlier this year.

The PDE anticipates diesel oil B will remain the dominant fuel in the transport sector, with demand projected to reach 57.5 billion liters in 2035, growing 1.9% annually.

While electrification is gaining traction in specific areas such as last-mile freight, its share of total sector consumption is expected to remain limited through the end of the decade. For light vehicles, gasoline C use is projected to decline as hydrous ethanol gains ground, aided by improved vehicle efficiency and public transport expansion. Between 2023 and 2035, hydrous ethanol consumption is set to grow 5.3% annually, offsetting part of the demand for gasoline.

In maritime transport, emerging fuels—including biodiesel, liquefied natural gas (LNG), ammonia, hydrogen, and electricity—are projected to gain adoption, particularly after 2030.

Overall energy demand in the transportation sector is forecast to reach 115 Mtoe in 2035, driven primarily by road transport, which will account for 93% of total consumption. This rise is supported by expected GDP growth averaging 2.8% annually and increased population mobility.

Freight transport will continue to rely heavily on trucks, with the segment projected to grow 2.8% per year, fueled by agribusiness, industry, and construction.

Rail transport is set for notable expansion, with the network expected to increase by around 20% to reach 36.9 thousand kilometers by 2035, boosting sector activity by 5.5% annually.

Waterway freight is also expected to advance, growing 3.2% annually, backed by investments in vessels, shipyards, and ports, and strengthened by cabotage in oil logistics.

On the passenger side, individual vehicle use is projected to grow 2.4% per year, with registrations estimated to reach 3.8 million units by 2035.

The study indicates a gradual but steady rise in light-vehicle electrification, especially in major cities. By 2035, electrified vehicles are expected to represent about 6% of the national fleet, while flex-fuel vehicles will remain dominant at approximately 87%.

Public transportation is also set to expand, supported by investments under the Novo PAC program. Urban bus services are projected to grow 3.7% annually through 2035, while metro-rail systems are expected to increase by 3.6% per year, boosted by the anticipated launch of the Intermunicipal Train (TIM) and parts of the Intercities Train (TIC) in São Paulo.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-12.png,N,,2025-12-20 05:57:31.142110

Its release highlighted a renewed emphasis on technological modernisation and resource diversification – a bid to make the nation’s critical infrastructure more resilient and less dependent on single points of failure.

Meanwhile, in the consumer sphere, Amazon celebrated its billionth sustainable package delivery in the US – a landmark proving that circular logistics and sustainable packaging can coexist with high-volume e-commerce.

The achievement illustrated the tangible effects of years of investment in renewable materials, optimised routing and smarter packaging analytics.

Beyond corporate success stories, Q1 also invited deeper reflection on evolving consumer behaviour.

One of the more unexpected logistics narratives came from the beverage sector, as demand for alcohol alternatives surged during “Dry January.” The rising preference among younger demographics for functional or alcohol-free drinks offered insight into how generational shifts are reshaping trade flows and inventory strategies in emerging markets.

Already Racking Up The Hours

According to present fleet data made available by ch-aviation, United Airlines has a grand total of 167 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets in its current order book, with those that have already been produced clocking in at an average age of 2.6 years old. The oldest of these is N27751, which, having first flown in June 2021, is now 4.5 years old. Its most recent test flight, a circular journey from Boeing Field (BFI), took place on December 16.

This month has also seen two other United Airlines-bound Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft take to the skies, with N27752 in the air as recently as December 17 when it flew from Boeing Field to Eugene, Oregon, and back. Meanwhile, N27753 made a circular test flight from Boeing Field on December 4. Needless to say, plenty more flight hours will be racked up before these jets can join United, which said back in 2017 that:

""The 737 MAX 10 will enable us to continue using larger and more efficient aircraft within our domestic network and better meet the needs of our customers today and into the future.""

One Of The Aircraft Has Been Used As A Boeing ecoDemonstrator

Arguably the most notable use of a Boeing 737 MAX 10 jet that is destined for United Airlines has been the deployment of N27602 as part of the US planemaker's 'ecoDemonstrator' research program. This was announced by Boeing in 2023, and saw the manufacturer team up with NASA to conduct tests.

As part of this initiative, the special aircraft, which, as seen in the picture embedded above, wore a colorful striped livery in this role, operated test flights powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). When in the air for this purpose, it was trailed by a Douglas DC-8 from NASA to measure its emissions.

This allowed researchers to gather data concerning the differing emissions levels produced by SAF compared to conventional jet fuel, as well as the differences in contrail ice particles. Boeing added that ""the researchers' aim [was] to understand how advanced fuels, engine combustor designs, and other technologies may reduce atmospheric warming,"" given that ""some research has suggested certain contrails can trap heat in the atmosphere.""

But the establishment of dedicated committees and the involvement of experienced partners like HIF Global and Topsoe suggest that Uruguay is taking a methodical, well-coordinated approach.
Globally, the Paysandú e-Fuels project is being watched as a potential template for how countries can leverage their renewable energy resources to produce clean fuels at scale.
With strong partnerships, clear goals, and a commitment to innovation, Uruguay is betting big on clean fuels.","On December 19, 2025, Uruguay took a decisive step into the future of clean energy, as HIF Global and the Government of Uruguay signed a landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to accelerate the development of an ambitious e-Fuels project in Paysandú. The agreement, announced in Montevideo and reported by EIN Presswire, is more than just a formality—it’s a comprehensive roadmap designed to bring the country’s vision for sustainable fuel production to life.

At the heart of the deal is a shared commitment to a project that could reshape Uruguay’s energy landscape and put the nation at the forefront of the global push for decarbonized transportation. The MoU, as outlined by HIF Global, sets out the technical and institutional milestones needed to reach a final investment decision. This includes not just the construction of a state-of-the-art e-Fuels production facility, but also the development of two major renewable energy parks—the Lucía Solar Park and the Elena Wind Park—which will power the entire operation with clean electricity.

But the agreement goes even further. Recognizing the importance of logistics, the MoU includes provisions to revitalize key railway lines. These upgrades are crucial for transporting the synthetic fuels from Paysandú to the Port of Montevideo, integrating Uruguay’s strategic infrastructure into the project’s operations and ensuring the finished product can reach global markets efficiently.

According to EIN Presswire, the MoU also establishes a High-Level Committee and a Technical Committee. These bodies, composed of government officials and HIF representatives, will coordinate everything from energy agreements and environmental permits to easement definitions and railway infrastructure. In other words, they’re tasked with making sure every piece of the puzzle fits together, so the project can move from blueprint to reality without unnecessary delays.

The scale of the project is nothing short of staggering. HIF Paysandú’s vision is to construct an industrial facility capable of producing up to 880,000 tons of e-Fuels per year. These synthetic fuels are made using green hydrogen—produced from renewable energy—and recycled CO₂, creating a closed-loop system that could decarbonize more than 400,000 vehicles annually. That’s not just a number on a page; it’s a real, measurable impact on global emissions, and a potential model for other countries grappling with the challenge of greening their transportation sectors.

The financial commitment is equally impressive. The project is expected to require an investment of over US$5.3 billion, a sum that underscores both the complexity and the promise of this endeavor. And it’s not just about money—there’s a significant human dimension too. During the construction phase, the project is projected to create approximately 1,400 jobs, with a further 300 permanent positions once operations commence. For the people of Paysandú and the wider region, that means new opportunities and a tangible economic boost.

Topsoe, a global leader in sustainable technology, has also joined the effort as a technology supplier for a related sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project in Uruguay, according to a December 19, 2025 report by Sladjana Djunisic. This partnership brings world-class expertise to the table, ensuring that the latest advances in fuel technology are integrated into Uruguay’s clean energy push. Topsoe’s involvement signals confidence in the country’s ability to deliver on its ambitious goals and further strengthens Uruguay’s position as a hub for next-generation fuels.

HIF Global, for its part, is no stranger to the world of e-Fuels. The company’s name—short for Highly Innovative Fuels—reflects its mission to advance global energy sustainability. HIF is already producing e-Fuels at its Haru Oni facility in Chile and is developing commercial-scale projects in the United States, Brazil, Australia, and now, Uruguay. The company’s experience and track record lend credibility to the Paysandú project, giving stakeholders reason to believe that this ambitious plan can move from concept to completion.

“The agreement establishes the technical and institutional milestones required for the pre-investment decision phase and confirms the signatories’ intent to move forward with the project,” HIF Global stated in its official release, highlighting the seriousness of both parties in turning vision into action.

Uruguay’s government, meanwhile, sees the project as a way to reinforce the country’s reputation as a renewable energy leader. With nearly 98% of its electricity already coming from renewables, Uruguay has long been a darling of the clean energy world. This new venture—focusing on e-Fuels and synthetic fuels—represents the next logical step, taking the country’s expertise in green power and applying it to the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors: aviation, shipping, and heavy transport.

The project’s design is as ambitious as its goals. Construction will proceed in four stages, allowing for careful scaling and integration of new technologies as they become available. The plant’s use of green hydrogen and recycled CO₂ means that, once operational, it will not only reduce emissions from vehicles but also help recycle carbon that would otherwise contribute to global warming. It’s a win-win, both for Uruguay and for the planet.

Of course, no project of this scale is without its challenges. The MoU’s emphasis on environmental permits, easements, and infrastructure upgrades makes it clear that the road ahead will require careful navigation of regulatory, technical, and social hurdles. But the establishment of dedicated committees and the involvement of experienced partners like HIF Global and Topsoe suggest that Uruguay is taking a methodical, well-coordinated approach.

For local communities, the promise of jobs and investment is significant. The construction phase alone will bring more than a thousand positions to the region, and the operational plant will provide hundreds of stable, skilled jobs in a future-oriented industry. That’s no small matter in a world where economic transitions can often leave workers behind.

Globally, the Paysandú e-Fuels project is being watched as a potential template for how countries can leverage their renewable energy resources to produce clean fuels at scale. If successful, it could inspire similar efforts elsewhere, helping to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels and toward a more sustainable future for transportation.

As the ink dries on the MoU and work begins in earnest, all eyes will be on Uruguay to see how this bold experiment unfolds. The stakes are high, but the potential rewards—for the country, its people, and the planet—are even higher. With strong partnerships, clear goals, and a commitment to innovation, Uruguay is betting big on clean fuels. The world will be watching to see if that bet pays off.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 07:56:54.941131

Two Young Climbers Begin Winter Ascent of McKinley

Two Young Climbers Begin Winter Ascent of McKinley Lane Christenson, 22, and Dalton Borton, 20, both students at the University of Alaska Anchorage, have embarked on a demanding winter ascent of Denali, also known as Mt. McKinley, which rises to 6,190 meters. The pair arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier two days ago, preparing to spend Christmas isolated on the mountain’s icy slopes. Their expedition takes place during the harshest season, when Denali’s severe cold and limited daylight render it one of the most formidable climbs worldwide. Experience and Preparation for Extreme Conditions Despite their youth, Christenson and Borton possess considerable experience navigating Alaska’s challenging mountain terrain. Borton first summited Denali in 2022 at the age of 17 and returned in March 2023 to tackle the technical Cassin Ridge under wintry conditions. Christenson reached Denali’s summit earlier this year during the conventional late spring season and also summited Bashful Peak, Anchorage’s highest point, in 2023. Nevertheless, a winter ascent of Denali presents a significantly greater challenge, with temperatures often colder than those encountered in the high Himalayas and the added difficulty of near-constant darkness due to the mountain’s northern latitude. The climbers will face the vast Alaska Range entirely alone, confronting not only the physical rigors of the climb but also the psychological strain of isolation. Their meticulous preparation includes specialized gear such as down suits and boots designed for 8,000-meter Himalayan peaks, as well as sleds, skis, and sufficient food and fuel to sustain their journey. Each will begin the ascent hauling approximately 200 pounds (91 kilograms) of equipment. The Rarity and Risks of Winter Ascents Winter ascents of Denali are exceptionally rare. According to Denali National Park records, only 17 people have reached the summit during winter, with six fatalities recorded in these attempts. The first successful winter ascent occurred in 1967, completed by Art Davidson, Ray Genet, and Dave Johnston over a 42-day expedition. In the past decade, only two climbers—both solo—have summited Denali in winter: Lonnie Dupre in 2015 and Jost Kobusch in 2023. Such high-profile expeditions often have broader implications beyond the climbing community. Companies specializing in winter mountaineering equipment may experience increased interest and sales as attention focuses on the specialized gear required for such extreme conditions. Meanwhile, the insurance industry, already contending with economic challenges, may be indirectly affected as businesses supporting adventure tourism and extreme sports reassess risk and coverage in light of these demanding undertakings. As Christenson and Borton commence their ascent, they join a select group of climbers who have dared to confront Denali’s winter extremes, pushing the limits of endurance and adventure.

Russian Airlines Report Nine Engine Failures in One Week

Russian Airlines Report Nine Engine Failures in One Week Russian airlines have come under intensified scrutiny following the report of nine separate engine failures and malfunctions within a single week, according to the Federal Air Transport Agency, Rosaviatsiya. These incidents, currently under investigation, have raised significant concerns regarding the reliability and maintenance of Russia’s aging civil aviation fleet. The market reacted cautiously, with airline stock prices experiencing a slight decline amid growing investor apprehension. Industry competitors are expected to leverage their own safety records in response to this troubling series of failures. A Week Marked by Multiple Engine Failures The first reported incident involved a Boeing 737 (RA-73231) operating as Pobeda Flight DP-6532 from Barnaul to Moscow-Sheremetyevo. Pilots were forced to shut down an engine after it failed to respond to thrust adjustments. Although the aircraft landed safely, a post-flight inspection uncovered oil leakage on the left engine’s outer cowling, signaling potential mechanical issues. On December 11, an IrAero Superjet 100 (RA-89001) experienced an uncommanded shutdown of its right engine during climb-out from Antalya, Turkey, en route to Sochi. The flight crew successfully restarted the engine and completed the journey without further incident. The only crash during this period occurred on December 13, when a Cessna 172 lost thrust at Novinki airfield, resulting in injury to one of the two occupants. Investigations revealed that the aircraft lacked both a certificate of airworthiness and authorization to operate in the airspace, raising questions about regulatory compliance. On December 14, a Boeing 757 (RA-73072) operated by AZUR Air suffered a right-engine failure while landing at Barnaul Airport after a flight from Thailand. The engine automatically shut down at an altitude of 460 meters, but the crew managed a safe landing on a single engine. Later that day, an Azimut Superjet 100 (RA-89094) was compelled to shut down an engine following a thrust-reverser malfunction message after landing at Tbilisi Airport in Georgia. Four Engine-Related Incidents in One Day December 16 was particularly alarming, with four separate engine-related incidents reported. At Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, a Nordwind Boeing 777 (RA-73340) aborted its takeoff after a surge and flame burst in the right engine, accompanied by a loud explosion. The aircraft came to a safe stop on the runway without further complications. Two Sukhoi Superjets operated by Rossiya were also affected on the same day. One aircraft (RA-89134), flying from Yerevan to Sochi, landed safely despite experiencing engine vibration. Subsequent inspection revealed a missing fairing on a fan blade, damage to acoustic panels, and five damaged stator vanes. The other aircraft (RA-89124) displayed a thrust reverser malfunction message, further highlighting mechanical vulnerabilities. Industry Response and Safety Implications This cluster of engine failures has intensified calls for more rigorous maintenance protocols and enhanced safety inspections across the Russian aviation sector. The incidents highlight the challenges faced by airlines operating older fleets, particularly in the context of international sanctions that have restricted access to spare parts and technical support. As competing airlines emphasize their own safety records, Russian carriers face mounting pressure to restore confidence through transparent investigations and strengthened regulatory oversight.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/a04425860e724be9a3f8b530ebe4efe6.avif,N,,2025-12-19 18:57:19.760757

The annual update highlights progress across renewable energy, campus energy systems, building efficiency, transportation, waste reduction, and healthy environments, including foundational work to address indirect (Scope 3) emissions, while also reflecting the university’s continued growth in facilities, research and academic activity.

“We are making steady, tangible progress across our campuses while modernizing the systems that support our academic and research mission,” said Shana S. Weber, associate vice president for campus sustainability. “These investments fundamentally strengthen our energy resilience, reduce polluting emissions, and advance our campus as a globally-relevant and trusted demonstration site for action and problem-solving.”

Expanding renewable energy; modernizing systems

A signature milestone this year was the launch of Maize Rays, the university’s solar initiative designed to expand renewable electricity both on campus and across Michigan in support of the university’s goal to achieve net-zero emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2) by 2027.

U-M is pursuing approximately 25 megawatts of on-campus solar capacity across the Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint campuses, including Michigan Medicine and Athletics. The first two solar arrays on North Campus are now commissioned and generating renewable electricity. Maize Rays also pairs campus installations with Michigan-based off-campus renewable energy and includes a community benefit supporting local solar projects on buildings that house community-serving organizations.

In parallel, the university continued advancing heat pump and geoexchange heating and cooling systems, an all-electric and highly efficient technology that leverages stable underground temperatures to reduce fossil fuel use. In 2025, crews drilled a 1,200-foot closed-loop test bore on Central Campus to assess the potential of deeper geoexchange systems.

Additional geoexchange systems are completed or underway at the Leinweber Computer Science and Information Building, Wolverine Village (Central Campus Residential Development), and the Edward and Rosalie Ginsberg Building, and all new building and major renovation projects are designed to be compatible with renewable-energy-driven heating and cooling systems.

Improving efficiency across campus buildings

U-M invested $1.1 million through its central revolving energy fund to support energy-efficiency upgrades across campus in FY ’25. Projects focused primarily on lighting and HVAC improvements, building on earlier LED upgrades spanning more than 13 million square feet of building space.

“These projects make good business sense and reduce energy use today while positioning the university for deeper efficiencies over time,” Weber said.

Advancing low-carbon transportation

The university expanded its low-carbon transportation portfolio by adding four additional battery-electric buses, bringing the total in service to 12 electric vehicles, which have collectively logged more than 52,000 miles and avoided 159,000 pounds of CO₂-equivalent emissions compared to conventional buses.

Campuswide electric vehicle infrastructure also continued to grow, with 230 EV charging stations now available and 56 university-owned electric vehicles in service. U-M also continued exploratory planning for a potential Automated Transit System, which is being considered alongside Campus Plan 2050 goals to expand multimodal transportation, including walking and biking connections across campus.

Reducing waste and strengthening campus environments

Waste reduction efforts expanded in partnership with research, event and student life teams. The Lab Swap Shop, launched with LSA, supported reuse of laboratory equipment and contributed to more than 17,500 pounds of lab diverted from landfills in 2025.

The Office of Campus Sustainability Zero Waste Program supported more than 1,000 events across campus in FY ’25, including major gatherings, and a new partnership with the Campus Farm enabled compostable waste from Michigan Stadium to be processed locally.

Campuswide compost infrastructure grew to 1,300 bins, while student move-out efforts diverted more than 12 tons of reusable materials. During the year, U-M also refreshed its campuswide waste-reduction goals, adopting updated targets and metrics to better reflect the full scope of waste prevention, reuse, composting and diversion efforts underway across campus.

The university also advanced work to strengthen campus ecosystems. U-M maintained its designation as a Bee Campus USA, installed new native landscapes including a 1,500-square-foot urban prairie near the Life Sciences Institute and adopted refreshed Resilient Grounds goals to guide long-term approaches to land management, biodiversity, stormwater and chemical reduction.

Advancing Scope 3 emissions work

The update also highlights continued foundational work to address Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect impacts associated with activities such as purchased goods and services, business travel, commuting, and construction materials.

During FY ’25, the Office of Campus Sustainability worked with external experts and campus partners to strengthen data quality, develop consistent tracking approaches, and synthesize feedback from more than 350 community members. In collaboration with the Center for Sustainable Systems in the School for Environment and Sustainability, the university advanced targeted analysis in four priority areas: business travel, food, capital goods (construction), and purchased goods and services.

As part of this work, U-M renewed a three-year partnership with Delta Airlines to advance the use of sustainable aviation fuel, a certified alternative jet fuel that can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The partnership supports efforts to address emissions associated with university-related air travel and complements broader Scope 3 analysis underway.

This phased work established a strong analytical foundation for future goal setting. Following recent senior leadership transitions, the university plans to complete Scope 3 goal-setting work in 2026.

Operations as learning opportunities

The update also reflects how major operational investments support U-M’s commitment to life-changing education. In FY ’25, the associate vice president for campus sustainability, the vice provost for sustainability and climate action, and the Office of the Vice President for Research established cross-functional campus as living learning lab working groups to better align campus energy, infrastructure, and resource-management projects with research priorities and educational opportunities.

“These efforts reinforce Michigan’s long-standing commitment to using the campus as a living-learning lab,” Weber said, “where operational systems are envisioned to intentionally support interdisciplinary research, applied learning, and real-world problem solving.”

Looking ahead

Looking ahead, the university will continue implementing on- and off-campus solar through Maize Rays, advancing geoexchange systems and energy-efficiency projects, expanding low-carbon transportation, and completing Scope 3 goal-setting work.

A more comprehensive update will be released this spring through the Sustainability Leadership Council.",,N,,2025-12-19 15:56:53.940549

Mr. Bloom, a board director who joined Gevo in 2021, inherits a company increasingly focused on scaling low-carbon fuels alongside carbon management.

“I am honored to be leading Gevo into its next phase of critical growth,” Mr. Bloom said, adding that his focus will be “increasing profitability from our active businesses while leveraging our technology, business system, and intellectual-property portfolio to accelerate Gevo’s growth.” Mr. Gruber called the moment “an exciting new chapter,” saying Mr. Bloom’s experience will be “instrumental as Gevo continues to scale and deliver on its mission to fill the critical market need for jet fuel.”

A Rating Sets the Stage for the Next Gevo CEO

Days after outlining the succession plan, Gevo disclosed that BeZero Carbon upgraded its North Dakota carbon capture and storage project to an “A” rating, placing it among the top tier of independently assessed carbon-removal assets. The facility issues carbon dioxide removal credits under the Puro.earth standard and is the only ethanol-based project to earn certification for thousand-year geological storage.

“CORCs are gaining traction in the growing VCM and are expected to provide valuable co-product revenue for our operations,” said Alex Clayton, Gevo’s chief business development officer. He said the “A” grade should “simplify the due diligence process for buyers” and improve credit value. Sustainability chief Nancy Young said the company is expanding its Verity data platform to deepen measurement and verification of farm practices tied to its feedstock.

This message hits home after what we all went through with Hurricane Helene, which devastated farms, families and entire communities,” McCall said.
“Helene also revealed something powerful: the faith, endurance and unity of Georgia farmers.
“We also pushed hard on the farm bill and disaster relief funding for Hurricane Helene victims.
Georgia’s block grant program will cover future economic losses, infrastructure losses and timber losses caused by Hurricane Helene in Georgia’s more than 100 disaster-declared counties.","Some 1,370 Georgia farmers and agribusiness leaders from across the state met on Jekyll Island Dec. 7-9 for the 88th Annual Georgia Farm Bureau (GFB) Convention. The three-day event included a trade show, awards presentations and educational sessions that briefed farmers on policy and production issues affecting Georgia’s major commodities.

The convention’s theme, “Rise and Thrive,” emphasized how the organization and Georgia’s agricultural community has worked together to help Georgia farmers hit by Hurricane Helene, last year, recover from the storm.

GFB President Tom McCall delivered his annual address, and GFB Chief Administrative Office Jeffrey Harvey gave an organizational update.

Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tyler Harper, Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns and U.S. Navy Retired Commander Frank “Walleye” Weisser addressed convention delegates during the general session on Dec. 8.

McCall discusses GFB leadership programs & legislative efforts

Tom McCall reiterated the organization’s commitment to helping Georgia farmers recover from Hurricane Helene, outlined how GFB is developing future agricultural leaders and discussed the legislative issues GFB advocated for on behalf of farmers this year.

“We are not defined by the number of times we fall, but rather by how many times we rise and how we thrive afterwards. This message hits home after what we all went through with Hurricane Helene, which devastated farms, families and entire communities,” McCall said. “Helene also revealed something powerful: the faith, endurance and unity of Georgia farmers. Our faith, determination and unity define us. That’s what Georgia Farm Bureau stands for – protecting your right to farm and protecting your family from loss.”

On Oct. 1, GFB announced the launch of a new program, Leadership GFB, which will equip rising and current GFB leaders with the tools they need to successfully advocate for agriculture, develop leadership skills, and embody the organization’s grassroots mission. Participants will attend sessions focused on leadership development, understanding the county, state and national structure of Farm Bureau and its grassroots network, policy work on agricultural issues, and the importance of agricultural literacy. GFB is expected to announce the class by Dec. 22.

McCall outlined how GFB is also laying the foundation for its next generation of leaders through chapters of Collegiate Young Farmers & Ranchers at ABAC and UGA. Officers from both chapters are being given opportunities to experience Farm Bureau from the inside out.

GFB also offers leadership programs through its Young Farmers & Ranchers Program for farmer members ages 18-35 and for female agriculturalists of all ages through its Women’s Leadership Program.

McCall stressed that GFB’s primary focus will always be to serve as the voice of farmers in the legislative arena.

In 2025 GFB supported tort-reform legislation, secured protection from unfair pesticide liability, secured practical truck-weight limits, fought for a common-sense federal definition of navigable waters, and for state deer-management improvements.

“We also pushed hard on the farm bill and disaster relief funding for Hurricane Helene victims. Every year bad pieces of legislation surface that could hurt your farms and families. GFB’s advocacy team helps stop them all while advancing the good bills to the governor’s desk.”

Savannah Port vital to U.S. ag exports

Georgia Ports Authority Chairman Kent Fountain gave an informative overview of the Savannah/Garden City port while addressing GFB convention attendees during the Dec. 8 general session of the GFB convention.

“We want to be the easiest port to do business with,” Fountain said. “We want to help you move your product throughout the world. Our mission is to be the economic engine for agriculture.”

Fountain said the Savannah port is second in the U.S. for ag exports behind the Los Angeles port. In the past year, 13% of all U.S. ag exports were shipped via the Savannah port while the Los Angeles port shipped 16% of U.S. ag exports. He said about 45% of Savannah’s exports are agricultural products. Raw cotton accounts for 15% of Savannah’s ag exports followed by poultry at 9%, pet and animal feed at 7%, logs and lumber at 6%, field seeds & bulbs at 4%, grain & flour products at 1%, meat at 1%, and other ag products at 3%.

Fountain said 70% of the United States’ population is served by products that move through the Georgia Ports Authority. The Savannah/Garden City port is the 43rd most connected port in the world and is the second most connected port in the U.S.

“On average, we can get products from the ship onto the rail within 24 hours to be moved to their next destination. We’re very proud of this,” Fountain said.

The port is the only one in the U.S. that has a customs facility onsite, he said.

Harper discusses USDA Hurricane Helene block grants & Farmer Bridge Assistance

While speaking at the convention, Georgia Agricultural Commissioner Tyler Harper said Georgia Department of Agriculture employees have spent hundreds of hours crafting a block grant plan to disperse the $531 million the USDA announced in September it will allocate to the state to help farmers who suffered loss to Hurricane Helene on Sept. 27, 2024. Georgia’s block grant program will cover future economic losses, infrastructure losses and timber losses caused by Hurricane Helene in Georgia’s more than 100 disaster-declared counties.

“USDA has our final agreement and plan in their hands, and we expect to make an announcement on the details of the program and how to apply any day now,” Harper said.

Visit www.farmrecovery.com for program details, such as a list of eligible counties and the types of documents applicants will need to submit with their application. Eligible timber producers and farmers should periodically check the website in the days to come to download an application.

As the general session ended, Harper returned to the podium to say he had just been notified that USDA was announcing the rollout of a $12 billion relief package designed to help farmers nationwide manage rising production costs and ongoing market disruptions. Most of the funds - up to $11 billion - will flow through the new Farmer Bridge Assistance Program, aimed at row crop producers including corn, cotton, peanuts, soybeans, wheat, oats, sorghum, canola, and other row crops.

Another $1 billion will be directed toward specialty crops and other commodities, with additional program details expected in the coming weeks.

According to USDA, payments are scheduled to begin rolling out by Feb. 28, 2026. Producers must ensure their 2025 acreage reports are filed with their local USDA Farm Service Agency by 5 p.m. ET on Dec. 19, 2025, to remain eligible.

Burns: Chopping away at timber issues

Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns reviewed steps the state legislature took during its 2025 session to aid farmers in the recovery from Hurricane Helene that includes reforestation tax credits and harvest tax suspension for 2025 related to Helene damage. Timber owners must apply by Dec. 31, 2025, to receive the exemptions. Visit https://gfagrow.org/helene-resources/ for more information and to download the applications.

Burns also discussed avenues the state is pursuing to help Georgia’s timber sector and forestry stakeholders through long-term solutions with new-product-development at research institutions regarding sustainable aviation fuel and modern timber-based building materials.

“These opportunities represent long-term solutions. You can’t do them overnight,” Burns said. “I can assure you that I and my colleagues in the House have been working for the last few months on solutions that … I believe will have an immediate impact and provide urgent relief to timber growers, timber owners and forestland owners in the state.

Burns noted collaborations with state house speakers in Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and other states, congressional delegations from Georgia and other southern states, federal agencies and the Trump administration. He mentioned conversations with Small Business Administrator (SBA) Kelly Loeffler to let her know that recent timber mill closures affect businesses of all sizes.

“There’s a ripple effect,” Burns said. “It’s across all of our communities. We want to inform them that we need some help.”

As a result, Burns said, SBA is helping in the development of strategies to adjust policies and regulations to provide relief.

The engagement has included work with United States Trade Representative Jameson Greer to make small changes to trade policy to remove what Burns called arbitrary trade barriers.

One such barrier is the export to the European Union of forest products fumigated with sulfuric fluoride. Burns said the product is licensed and widely used in the U.S. and the EU.

Another is tariffs relating to the transship clause, which Burns would like to see clarified to exempt wood that was grown in the U.S., shipped to other countries as manufacturing material, then returned to the U.S. as finished products.

“We’re asking for a slight clarification that will reassure importers when the products are imported back into this country that those products can be tariff-free and tariff-exempt, if they can provide documentation that the raw products that were utilized to prepare and manufacture those products originated here in this country,” Burns said.

Burns noted that the federal government is being asked to establish a 90-day notice before a changed tariff goes into effect.

“These are nothing but slight adjustments to existing language and policy that will provide the forest industry with a little breathing room,” Burns said.

Weisser: Failure is necessary for growth

Keynote speaker Frank “Walleye” Weisser shared his experiences as a Navy pilot, including two stints as a member of the Blue Angels and as pilot for Tom Cruise’s aerial scenes in the movie Top Gun: Maverick.

Weisser discussed the detail and focus required to do what Navy pilots do, driving home how difficult it is. He attended the U.S. Naval Academy and originally wanted to be a Navy SEAL. But, when Weisser got to service selection – when the Navy informs cadets what form their service will take – he was assigned to be a Navy pilot.

“To say I felt like a failure would be an unbelievable understatement for me,” Weisser said. “I called all my friends, and I said, ‘Everything you watched me strive for, I failed out.’ ”

Once enrolled in flight school, there is no transition to become a SEAL.

“The lesson I learned at that point was that up until that time, I was being selfish. It’s not selfish to serve your country. It’s not how I serve. It’s just that I serve.”

Flight school offered no smooth sailing. He failed his first test. When he got into a plane, he never got it off the ground. Once he got off the ground, more mistakes followed.

“I kind of failed into aviation and accelerated the failures from there. But at some point, it turned around,” Weisser said. “I share this with you, especially for individuals in this room who are young and have been successful at everything you’ve done, because at some point if you push yourself, you will fail.”

Failure, he said, isn’t final.

“You have to have the willingness and the desire to keep going. For me, these failures became unquestionably the biggest blessing in my life,” he said.

After Blue Angels shows, the pilots and flight crews go through debrief that includes a dose of self-review of all the mistakes each person made.

Admitting mistakes, he said, allows teams to move forward and builds trust.

“If you sit in front of people who work for you, who are junior to you, who are less experienced, and you’re willing to say, ‘I screwed this up,’ that’s really, really powerful.”",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/griceconnect/images/articles/tom-mccall.png;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-12-19 15:57:04.147942

The participants agreed that raising funds from their government shareholders had got harder – but noted that this trend pre-dated President Donald Trump’s re-election and is the case across developed economies. ‘We were already seeing a tightening in the fiscal space, and the concessional financing pool was already dwindling. This has just made the trend clearer.’

One European MDB noted that the Trump administration’s unwillingness to fund overseas development has its echoes across the Atlantic. ‘There’s a political debate about development finance and concessional finance all over the world, including in Europe. It’s understandable – governments are accountable to their own electorates.’

This means that MDBs and other advocates of development finance have to work harder to sell the benefits to politicians and the general public in donor countries. ‘We have to be clearer in our communication and explain why this is in the best interests of Europe, or in the best interests of the US,’ they added.

Reframing the narrative

The MDBs noted that part of the answer lies in reframing narratives around financing to align with priorities that are closer to those of the US administration. Several gave the example of the Mission 300 initiative, which seeks to provide 300m people in Sub-Saharan Africa with electricity by 2030, aiming to promote clean energy, economic growth and job creation through infrastructure investment, sector reform and public-private partnerships, including blended finance vehicles.

‘This is not only about climate, it’s about access to energy,’ one MDB said. ‘It’s not ideological, it’s good for energy resilience and economic growth.’ They added that, in many parts of the world, renewables can provide the cheapest source of energy, meaning that economic development and climate priorities remain aligned.

However, given the constraints on government funding for MDBs, they are also looking elsewhere for sources of finance for their priorities. For one MDB, government subsidies are a big focus. ‘We are having a big push on subsidy repurposing. We’re not against subsidies – that’s how governments signal investment priorities. But they aren’t necessarily helping where they are needed.’ The speaker noted that Nigeria has been successful in redirecting subsidies away from fossil fuels, and that the MDB is also making good progress supporting agricultural subsidy reform.

Moving away from perceptions of risk

Several MDBs noted that they are looking to switch from predominantly providing debt financing and guarantees to offering risk taking equity. ‘What we’re hearing from lower middle-income countries, particularly, is that the de-risking is helpful, but it’s not enough without a serious equity play,’ said one.

Another MDB observed there has been an assumption that the problem facing developing countries was not a lack of liquidity, but a specific risk preventing that capital being deployed. ‘We’ve learned that there isn’t excess liquidity, by and large.’ To overcome this, there needs to be ‘liquidity injected as more patient capital to signal which sectors we believe have long-term upside potential.’

This is also about encouraging co-investors – particularly in the private sector – to think about the climate transition in terms of investment opportunity. ‘We’ve been so focused on de-risking. We need to stop talking about risk all the time in the transition space and start talking about opportunity.’

Numerous sectors within the climate transition are already profitable, and MDBs’ equity investments provide a means of encouraging private sector co-financing. ‘It’s about signalling and catalysing’ coinvestment, one MDB noted.

Crowding in private capital

MDBs are well-positioned to do much of the heavy lifting in terms of due diligence and providing a stamp of approval that helps to bring in private sector investors. ‘We have entire teams just doing sustainability checks, which these private sector investors can benefit from,’ said one. ’We can absorb the transaction costs to give a check mark on an investment’s broader ESG. That reputational rigour is really important. And, in these transition sectors, particularly those in the early stages of development, it does help to bring in the private sector,’ another said.

MDBs are focusing efforts on developing country transition platforms that promise to bring in a wide range of host country stakeholders – government, the energy sector, industrial companies and local financiers – with a range of providers of various types of development and concessional finance.

‘There is a problem around the fragmentation of these concessional funds and it can be very difficult to combine different instruments to achieve impact,’ noted one MDB, given that they often have different eligibility constraints, tenors and risk tolerances. By developing programmatic country platforms, MDBs can bring this financing together with pipelines of projects and investments that require different types of capital.

In one example, the MDB directed grant funding to decommissioning coal-fired power plants, concessional finance to electricity grid development, while the renewable energy investment was left entirely to the commercial sector. ‘This combination worked very well.’

But despite finding innovative mechanisms, new sources of funding and common ground with sceptical donors, MDBs will inevitably have to be less ambitious when it comes to funding climate solutions that are further from commercialisation. ‘Those technologies that clearly require a “green premium” to become economically viable – sustainable aviation fuel, green cement, green steel – have become more difficult,’ one MDB said.

And, undoubtedly, it’s a much more difficult environment to navigate. ‘I’m not pessimistic, but the degree of complexity has increased dramatically.’

Through major investments in next-generation aircraft and steadying labour relations, Smith has been responsible for steering the group back to profitability after the coronavirus pandemic.

He joined our editorial director, Tyler Brûlé, in Studio 5 on Rue Bachaumont, Paris, to discuss how he restored profitability and improved efficiency, luxury and sustainability.

This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Listen to the full interview on ‘The Chiefs’ from Monocle Radio.

Earlier this year, you launched La Première, your newest first-class experience. What has the response been like?

It has been fantastic and exceeded our expectations. We’re going to expand the footprint by 50 per cent, adding more aircraft to the fleet with La Première cabins. We keep adding to the amenities that our customers are asking for. We believe that we can give the Gulf carriers a good run for their money but we view the Gulf carriers not as companies and instead as countries.

Can Air France compete against a country? I guess it depends on what the country wants. In Asia, we don’t have the same work rules. There are two or three in Asia that are a bit of a challenge but we went from number 26 in the world to number eight. We want to be number one in Europe in every cabin and I think we can get there.

Looking ahead, where is Air France-KLM focusing its growth? What new routes can passengers expect in 2026?

Prior to our decision to expand the fleet equipped with La Première cabins, the US was our number-one market. We’ve just announced that we’re going to add Boston and Houston in the US, as well as Atlanta – the home base of our partner Delta. We’re going to add more services to Asia: we’ll go to Hong Kong and perhaps we’ll see how Tel Aviv goes. Maybe one or two more in the Middle East. But if you look at the major GDP cities of our long-haul network, you can pick the next five or 10. The destinations we announce won’t be a surprise.

It has been a complex year for global aviation. What were the defining issues of 2025 for you?

We’re looking closely at overflight rights, taxes and mandates for fuels such as SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] and for ETS [Emissions Trading System] charges. We are advocating for European-based carriers to have a total level playing field. We have lost customers because of our inability to fly over Russia. But, for the most part, our best customers are staying with us. They’re happy with our service. What is impactful is the cost of operating.

Governments and NGOs drive climate change actions with another message: Do what we say or bad things happen.
We already know that the cost of fixing the climate change problem, sector by sector, varies massively.
Climate change adherents believe technology and industrialization caused the climate change problem.","Cerebri AI in 2022 began developing a CO2 calculator for air travel. It’s also been deploying traditional AI throughout its travel data engineering platform and large language model-based agents in its agentic solutions for managed travel. Here, founder and CEO Jean Belanger explains the worrying connection between AI and CO2 emissions, and argues that the travel industry is focused on the wrong climate solutions.

According to current climate change thinking in the corporate travel industry, to meet the goals of governments and NGOs, we have to decarbonize air travel, which is 70 percent to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions for a typical business trip, and/or reduce travel via higher fees and taxes.

Decarbonizing air travel means replacing jet fuel, a wonder product in terms of its power-to-weight ratio. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and e-fuels are horrifically expensive for the modestly profitable airline industry to develop and use on a global basis. Ticket prices will have to go up given how difficult it is to scale these initiatives, even with bleeding-edge technology. Increased fees and, yes, taxes to reduce demand are meeting a lot of expected resistance.

SAF premiums and increased fees and taxes for air travel will only exacerbate current affordability issues being exposed by our political process. And that is before we deal with the massive power requirements of new agentic AI and large language model (LLM) technology that inhales electricity in vast quantities.

AI and climate change are on a collision course, with the impact coming long before a solution to reducing CO2 emissions in corporate travel. I believe that AI may sponsor the solution to both problems and we all come out as winners. Let me explain.

Background

Over 30 percent of our global annual CO2 emissions is from electricity generation (17 billion tons). As many industries “electrify” (electric vehicles, for example), it is easy to see this increasing to over 50 percent of future CO2 emissions.

That 30 percent was calculated before factoring in the impact of the tsunami of AI data centers announced in the past 24 months. Anthropic, Google, Meta, OpenAI and X.AI are the key U.S. vendors driving the current AI revolution with their LLMs.

Anthropic estimated that the AI data centers needed by 2028 would consume 50 gigawatts of power. That’s enough to power many millions of homes.

LLMs and agentic AI are changing electricity generation forever. AI data centers require high-quality, reliable and stable electricity — characterized by voltage stability, low harmonic distortion, consistent frequency and minimal power spikes, and delivered with redundancy to support continuous, mission-critical operations.

But what proof do we have that this AI revolution will actually happen? First, AI works. Second, national security. Governments want in. They want their own national AI champions. The race is on.

Where Climate Change And AI Intersect

Silicon Valley innovators market a simple message: Buy our technology and good things happen. Governments and NGOs drive climate change actions with another message: Do what we say or bad things happen.

Silicon Valley will not invest in anything related to fossil fuels to power its AI revolution because it believes climate change is a serious problem. And renewables don’t meet the stiff technical power requirements of new AI data centers.

So, what are Bill Gates, Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, Peter Thiel, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Anduril founder Palmer Luckey doing? They are investing in next-gen nuclear power startups.

What?

Silicon Valley wants to go nuclear, believing the world cannot generate enough power fast enough to satisfy the needs of data centers powering LLMs and agentic AI.

They are investing in small modular reactors (SMR) that range in size from 10 megawatts to 300 megawatts, emphasize safety and industrial design, and enable factory production of nuclear equipment, thereby improving quality while reducing costs. Manufacturing nuclear reactors rather than building them onsite reduces costs at scale, and locating SMRs next to large power users minimizes the need to invest in distribution infrastructure (e.g., transmission lines delivering power hundreds of miles).

Robert Bryce’s team has tracked 46 entities from 19 countries that are developing 60 types of SMRs. Market pressure from SMR startups is forcing vendors of traditional 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactors to follow suit, with greater emphasis on safety and cost controls. Manufacturing nuclear reactors “at scale” will more than likely obsolete other methods of producing the high-quality electricity that AI data centers need.

The Bottom Line

Climate change adherents believe we must reduce our CO2 emissions by 2050 or face dire consequences – 25 years to solve the problem. Twenty-five years ago, the internet was struggling for acceptance. Twenty-five years before that, mobile phones had yet to appear. From a technology point of view, 25 years is a very long time.

We already know that the cost of fixing the climate change problem, sector by sector, varies massively. Replacing jet fuel is going to cost far more per pound of CO2 saved than attacking emissions in other sectors, like electricity generation.

If we want to accommodate the stunning requirements of both the “new AI” and the desire for developing countries to increase their standard of living, we can only do this one way: generate emissions-free, high-quality electricity, at scale and at affordable prices.

Climate change adherents believe technology and industrialization caused the climate change problem. Maybe it should be no surprise that our best and brightest in Silicon Valley might solve the climate change problem over the next 25 years by fixing their AI electricity generation issues, reinventing nuclear power generation with SMRs and forcing large-scale nuclear providers to get their act together.

Currently nuclear energy generates 18 percent to 19 percent of the electricity in the United States. We know it works. We should count on our brilliant technologists who have more than likely found the answers we need rather than on faceless government/NGO bureaucrats issuing regulation after regulation.

By investing alongside Silicon Valley, the travel industry and aviation can reduce CO2 emissions far faster — and in a less expensive fashion — than investing in the promise of high-cost SAF, e-fuels and green hydrogen.",https://www.thecompanydime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jean-Belanger-200-200.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 11:57:29.155222

The trade group, which represents the world’s airlines, argues this competition could delay aviation’s climate goals to become net-zero by 2050.
“With AI passing up the airlines, we’re falling behind on CO2 emissions,” said Breeze Airways CEO David Neeleman.
The Money Problem IATA estimates airlines need about $174 billion in annual investment to produce enough sustainable fuel and meet their 2050 net-zero target.
In Europe, IATA says oil companies are charging airlines extra fees that exceed actual SAF costs by more than double.","Airlines warn the explosive growth of artificial intelligence could stall aviation’s green transition by consuming the renewable energy needed to produce cleaner jet fuel.

In a new report, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) points to two issues:

Data centers are “adding strong and rising demand for electricity, both renewable and other, to the already supply-constrained electricity and renewable-energy markets, pushing up prices.”

At the same time, they’re increasing CO2 emissions as AI expands faster than renewable-energy supply.

“Hence, this sector is causing double trouble,” IATA said. “Pushing up energy prices, and secondly by increasing CO2 emissions as it expands faster than renewable-energy supply.”

SAF is made from sources such as used cooking oil and crops, and renewable energy is needed to process the materials into jet fuel. IATA claims SAF emits up to 70% less emissions when compared to traditional jet fuel, and sees it as the main lever to reduce airline emissions.

The trade group, which represents the world’s airlines, argues this competition could delay aviation’s climate goals to become net-zero by 2050.

“Without coordinated policy to prioritize renewables and safeguard liquid fuel needs, this could delay aviation’s decarbonization and divert investment away from critical climate solutions.”

IATA claims AI data centers now account for up to 4% of global emissions, which is about the same as the aviation industry.

‘Go After AI. Don’t Go After Us’

Airline executives are frustrated.

“With AI passing up the airlines, we’re falling behind on CO2 emissions,” said Breeze Airways CEO David Neeleman. “You have so much power generation to generate all the AI stuff, that they’re going to create so much CO2.”

“AI is the new bad guy. So go after AI. Don’t go after us airlines.”

He criticized the cost of aviation’s climate requirements, saying they threaten jobs across the industry while doing little to solve the problem given aviation’s “small percentage” of global emissions.

The Money Problem

IATA estimates airlines need about $174 billion in annual investment to produce enough sustainable fuel and meet their 2050 net-zero target.

But right now, investment in low-emissions fuels sits at just $30 billion globally, IATA said.

Meanwhile, AI is attracting $200-400 billion in investment this year alone, with that figure expected to hit $500 billion in 2026, according to the report.

“Clearly the reallocation of capital to renewable energy in general, and to renewable fuels and SAF in particular, is not happening at the scale that is commensurate with its standing as a global priority,” IATA writes.

A Different Picture

However, recent research paints a different picture of AI’s climate impact.

A study published in the journal Patterns this month found that AI accounts for around 0.1% of global electricity demand and 0.04% of global emissions.

The research, led by scientists at institutions including the University of Massachusetts Amherst, acknowledges AI’s energy use is growing rapidly but says current claims about its emissions are “significantly overestimated.”

The International Energy Agency recently estimated that renewable energy has overtaken coal as the world’s largest source of electricity.

Skift contacted IATA for additional information but did not receive a response.

The SAF Shortage

IATA expects sustainable aviation fuel to make up less than 1% of total jet fuel use in 2026 — “an unambiguous verdict on how ineffective the current policy environment is,” the report says.

Airlines are also facing higher costs due to new mandates.

In Europe, IATA says oil companies are charging airlines extra fees that exceed actual SAF costs by more than double.

The group calls for “coordinated policy to prioritize renewables and safeguard liquid fuel needs,” warning that without it, aviation’s shift away from fossil fuels will take longer and cost more.

In this exclusive Invezz interview, Symes – an Oxford University chemistry graduate with deep experience in climate tech investing at BP Ventures and IP Group – explains how the Oxford spin-out’s novel catalysis is de-risking eSAF production just months after raising $28 million from major aviation and energy players.

With the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at Oxford Airport now operational since 2024 and producing jet-range hydrocarbons directly from waste carbon and hydrogen, Symes argues that innovating on conversion chemistry, rather than relying solely on feedstocks or policy, will drive the economics needed for mass adoption.

He further highlights the strategic involvement of investors like Aramco Ventures, noting that incumbents see a role in the transition to waste-based SAF.

Additionally, Symes predicts that direct CO₂ utilisation pathways will dominate long-term as mandates tighten toward 2050.

Below are edited excerpts from the interview:

Targeting cost parity: economics of one-step PtL

Invezz: The price of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is still 3–6× higher than fossil jet fuel. Your new demo plant at Oxford Airport just started producing real PtL SAF—when do you realistically see OXCCU’s fuel hitting price parity with conventional Jet A-1?

Andrew Symes: Today, advanced SAF is typically around 5–10× the price of fossil jet fuel. Our mission is to bring that down to around 2× fossil jet fuel, which we believe is achievable with the right technology and scale.

Independent third-party techno-economic modelling shows our one-step process can reduce CAPEX by ~50% and cost per tonne by ~25% compared to conventional routes.

At that level, the impact on ticket prices is modest and manageable. Reaching true price parity with Jet A-1 would require further reductions in feedstock and green electricity costs, and increased scale.

Aramco ventures

Invezz: Aramco Ventures just co-led your $28M Series B. How does it feel to have one of the world’s biggest oil companies betting on a technology that could make their core product obsolete?

Andrew Symes: Aramco Ventures became an investor in OXCCU in 2023 and reinvested in the company’s Series B.

The Series B round was co-led by new investors Safran and Orlen, alongside Aramco and other aviation and energy players, including IAG and Eni.

From the beginning, we have wanted to engage with the existing industry.

The partners we work with recognise that aviation needs a scalable solution to reduce emissions, and that they can be part of that solution.

Many of the core capabilities remain the same. The skills required to deliver jet fuel to airports and to use it in aircraft do not change.

Existing refinery, pipeline and tank assets can also play a role in co-processing, transport and blending.

Fossil jet fuel will still be sold during the transition, but technologies like ours allow that system to shift over time towards waste-based SAF.

Scaling SAF: overcoming feedstock and process bottlenecks

Invezz: IATA says we need 450 billion litres of SAF per year by 2050 to reach net-zero. What’s the one bottleneck—hydrogen cost, CO2 supply, policy, or something else—that’s still keeping us from scaling that fast?

Andrew Symes: Feedstock availability sits at the centre of everything because it drives cost.

For HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) SAF, used fats and oils used are clearly limited. For advanced bioSAF, biocarbon waste is difficult to aggregate and therefore, can be costly.

For eSAF, green electricity is the key feedstock, as it drives the cost of green hydrogen.

What is often overlooked though, is how important the processes are that convert these feedstocks into SAF. Unlike HEFA, which is a fairly simple and proven process, advanced SAF and eSAF require new conversion routes.

Innovation to reduce the number of steps and improve selectivity toward jet fuel is critical.

This is what we are focused on at OXCCU. Feedstock availability will always be somewhat of a challenge for SAF compared to fossil fuels, and that is hard to change.

What we can focus on are the conversion processes. That is why our focus is relentlessly on simplifying the chemistry and reducing capital intensity.

Policy and regulation matter enormously because they create demand certainty, but even with strong mandates, SAF will only scale if the economics work.

Invezz: Europe’s ReFuelEU mandate is ramping up aggressively from 2025. Is the regulation moving fast enough, or is it actually now pulling the market faster than technology can respond?

Andrew Symes: ReFuelEU is not a mistake. Aviation needs a solution, and it needs it to start scaling now, not in 2035.

Without early policy support, costs will never come down, and the technology will not be ready when demand arrives.

That said, regulation must remain pragmatic and overly rigid rules around feedstocks risk slowing deployment rather than accelerating it.

Policy should create the market, while allowing technology the flexibility to evolve.

Market momentum: take-off moment for power-to-liquids

Invezz: United Airlines just signed the biggest SAF offtake deal in history with CEMEX for power-to-liquid fuel. Are we finally seeing the “take-off” moment for PtL, or is this still early hype?

Andrew Symes: We are moving out of the hype phase and into early execution. Power-to-liquids is now backed by regulation, sub-mandates, and real offtake interest, particularly in Europe.

That said, this is still early. Building commercial plants takes time, capital and engineering effort.

What will determine success is who can deliver cost-competitive fuel at scale over the next decade.

Invezz: You’ve talked about making jet fuel for “a few pence per litre” at scale. Give us your boldest prediction: what will OXCCU’s production cost per litre be in 2030 and in 2035?

Andrew Symes: Our stated ambition is to reduce advanced SAF from today’s 5–10× fossil jet fuel to around 2× fossil jet fuel, using genuine waste carbon feedstocks and simplified process design.

Future of SAF

Invezz: A lot of SAF today still comes from used cooking oil and animal fats. When do you think direct CO2-to-jet-fuel routes like yours will overtake HEFA as the dominant SAF pathway?

Andrew Symes: HEFA plays a crucial role today, but it is fundamentally constrained by land use and feedstock availability. Just using oils cannot meet long-term demand at scale without serious environmental trade-offs.

We believe CO₂ and/or CO with H2 to SAF via iron-based Fischer-Tropsch will dominate.

The flexibility to work with CO2 directly as well as CO means it is applicable to converting: gasified solid carbon waste, reformed biogas, and CO2 and green H2.

These waste-based pathways are essential for reaching high blending levels in the 2030s and beyond.

As mandates rise towards 2040 and 2050, these routes will become increasingly dominant because they are not limited by the same land constraints as HEFA SAF.

The reason investors engage is that cost and complexity are the real barriers to SAF. Our approach is a simplification of existing routes.

By avoiding intermediates such as carbon monoxide via RWGS or methanol, we can reduce capital intensity and improve hydrogen efficiency, which is where the cost reduction lies.

Technical breakthrough: single-reactor catalyst demonstration

Invezz: Your catalyst does the Fischer-Tropsch and upgrading steps in one reactor. Without giving away the secret sauce—what’s the one breakthrough in the last 18 months that suddenly made investors say “this is real”?

Andrew Symes: Demonstration. We have shown, through our OX1 plant and independent testing, that it is possible to produce jet-range hydrocarbons directly from waste carbon and hydrogen in a single step, without a separate RWGS or methanol stage.

Fuel testing partner Intertek confirmed our fuel sits within the jet fuel range and, after simple hydrotreatment, is comparable to FT-SPK specifications.

This de-risks both cost and complexity. Fewer steps means lower CAPEX, lower energy losses and a more provable pathway to scale.

We have already demonstrated this at our OX1 facility at Oxford Airport, which has been operating since 2024 and has produced samples of synthetic SAF blend components.

That plant provided the data needed to validate the chemistry and inform scale-up.

We are now building OX2, our second demonstration plant, which will operate at a larger scale and produce greater volumes of fuel for testing and certification, ahead of commercial scale plants.

Invezz: If Donald Trump wins again in 2028 and pulls the US out of global climate deals a second time, how damaging would that actually be to the global SAF market?

Andrew Symes: It would slow the US market, but it would not stop SAF globally. What we are already seeing is a divergence.

Europe and the UK have clear blending mandates and increasing revenue certainty; the Middle East and Asia are following suit. While the US outlook is more volatile.

Capital follows visibility. Inconsistent policy makes it harder to finance large infrastructure, but aviation decarbonisation will still move forward across global regions.

Long-term vision: path to lower-carbon flying

Invezz: Last one, big picture: by 2040, will flying commercially be carbon-neutral by default, or will it still be the “guilty pleasure” industry that everyone loves to hate?

Andrew Symes: People are going to keep flying, and demand is likely to grow. The question is whether we choose to build the fuel system that allows aviation to keep delivering its economic and social benefits with a much lower climate impact.

Because of its energy density, aviation will continue to rely on liquid hydrocarbons for decades.

That is why SAF matters. It is a drop-in route to reducing fuel emissions without asking airlines to redesign aircraft or airports.

In the UK, aviation emissions are already higher than those from the electricity supply sector. If we wait until 2035 or 2040 to scale solutions, it will be too late.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 11:57:45.745061

Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor spoke with Farm Director KC Sheperd, highlighting the strong momentum for E15 (a 15% ethanol blend) and the industry’s focus on securing permanent regulatory fixes and expanding global markets.

E15 Growth and Legislative Push

The industry is seeing unprecedented momentum, making a push to update a 35-year-old regulation that currently limits year-round sales of the fuel:

National Reach: E15 is now legally able to be sold in all 50 states following recent legalization in California.

Retail Expansion: The number of retailers selling E15 has increased by almost 25% this year, the largest growth since 2018.

Legislative Priority: Securing a legislative fix to allow year-round E15 sales nationwide remains a top priority, with conversations ongoing on Capitol Hill and with the White House. This permanent fix would eliminate the current need for the EPA to issue emergency waivers each summer to allow E15 sales due to fuel volatility restrictions known as Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) limits.

Bipartisan Effort: The push has strong bipartisan support. For instance, the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act has been introduced in Congress to permanently extend the RVP waiver to E15, eliminating seasonal restrictions.

Current Status: While a permanent fix remains the goal, recent legislative attempts, such as including the fix in a broader short-term funding bill, have faced opposition from some House Republicans concerned about the impact on the U.S. refining sector.

Economic and Agricultural Benefits

E15 is being positioned as a solution for both consumer costs and farm oversupply:

Consumer Savings: Higher blends of ethanol make fuel more affordable. Consumers typically save 10 to 30 cents per gallon with E15, with some reports showing savings as high as 80 cents to a dollar.

Corn Demand: If every vehicle drove on a 15% ethanol blend, it would utilize 2.5 billion bushels of U.S. corn every year, providing a vital market for corn producers who are seeing fantastic crops and need a home for their grain.

Political Focus: The two main drivers in Washington supporting the E15 fix are the need to address the state of the farm economy (providing markets, not handouts) and the national attention on consumer prices and the cost of fuel.

This represents a 14% increase over the $22.0 billion recorded during the same period last year.

The company saw its operating income nearly double, climbing to $1.38 billion from $0.74 billion in the previous year. According to the company, the growth was primarily fueled by higher yields in U.S. domestic and international priority shipping, alongside increased domestic package volumes.

The bottom line also benefited from aggressive cost-saving measures through ongoing transformation initiatives and a reduction in business optimisation expenses.

“I am extremely proud of our team members worldwide for their commitment to make every FedEx experience outstanding this Peak season,” said Raj Subramaniam, FedEx President and CEO,

However, the quarter was not without its challenges. The gains were partially offset by the financial fallout from shifting global trade policies, rising wage rates, and increased variable incentive compensation. FedEx also navigated higher purchased transportation costs and the operational impact of grounding its MD-11 aircraft fleet.

The performance across business segments was mixed. The Federal Express division saw improved operating results, benefiting from the same yield and volume trends driving the consolidated growth. Conversely, the FedEx Freight segment experienced a decline in results.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawaii, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawaii, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific through its Pono Energy subsidiary, to study camelina as a multipurpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii’s launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaii’s first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle-carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel.

Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

“As Hawaii’s airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy,” said Alanna James, the sustainability innovation director for Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. “Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net-zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaii’s energy independence.”

Ed Sniffen, the director of Hawaii’s state department of transportation, said, “We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawaii’s transportation needs. We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state’s clean-energy goals.”

Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private-resource company, will launch Pono Energy Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks.

Its oilseeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens.

This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawaii by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

“Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawaii to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels,” said Chris Bennett, the vice president of sustainable energy solutions for Pono Pacific Land Management LLC. “By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawaii’s ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It’s a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture and a win for the environment—an example of how Hawaii can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions.”

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii’s earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaii Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaii’s year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy.

Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawaii’s cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state’s largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

Earlier this year, Par Pacific, the parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawaii Renewables and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi and Eneos, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery’s processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

“In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn’t think we would be able to progress so quickly,” said Eric Wright, the president of Par Hawaii. “With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it’s exciting to see the results of our team’s hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork.”

James added, “We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year. This is an important milestone for our company and Hawaii, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_81f452d4928144a28c41f0a05fe4e8cd~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_957,h_638,al_c,q_85/80995f_81f452d4928144a28c41f0a05fe4e8cd~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-12-19 09:56:14.842360

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has reported a slowdown in the growth of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, warning that policy frameworks need urgent correction ahead of upcoming e-SAF mandates.

According to IATA’s latest estimates, global SAF production is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes in 2025, doubling from 2024 levels. However, growth is projected to slow in 2026, with output rising to only 2.4 million tonnes. SAF will account for just 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, increasing marginally to 0.8 per cent in 2026. At current prices, the SAF premium is estimated to add USD 3.6 billion to industry fuel costs in 2025.

IATA said the 2025 forecast represents a downward revision due to limited policy support and high costs. In mandated markets, SAF prices can reach up to five times that of conventional jet fuel.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further. The decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

IATA highlighted that EU and UK mandates have increased costs without ensuring adequate supply. Airlines paid an estimated $2.9 billion premium for limited SAF volumes in 2025.

Looking ahead, IATA cautioned that without strong incentives, upcoming e-SAF mandates in the UK and EU could further raise costs and limit supply.

“Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://static.businessworld.in/Copy of Copy of Slider for website Final.ai - 2025-12-19T164812.029_20251219164836_ogImage_49.png,N,,2025-12-19 08:58:18.594778

The airline, which was founded in Macon, Georgia, is having one of its most progressive 12 months to date, making considerable progress on its fuel efficiency targets, forming new partnerships to develop aircraft prototypes and reducing the use of unsustainable materials.

The Atlanta-based carrier also surpasses its near-term fuel savings objective, delivering in excess of 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings from operational improvements in the first quarter alone. This achievement results in savings of more than US$125 million and advances its net zero ambitions.

Manufacturing partnerships and aircraft design

In March, Delta announced a partnership with aerospace startup JetZero to support the development of its blended wing-body (BWB) aircraft. This futuristic plane design is anticipated to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than the average aircraft currently in service.

Delta is lending its operational expertise through its Sustainable Skies Lab to help bring the BWB aircraft closer to commercial viability.

Later in September, Delta partners with Maeve Aerospace to expedite the development of hybrid electric aircraft for regional flights.

Fuel efficiency through innovative engineering

Elsewhere, Delta strengthens its collaboration with Airbus, testing a flying technique called fello'fly, which is inspired by migrating geese.

This method involves a pair of aircraft flying together, where one creates an uplift that can improve the fuel efficiency of the other. According to Airbus, this practice could reduce fuel consumption by 5% on long-haul flights.

Delta also adds MicroTau, an Australian aerospace technology company, to its Sustainable Skies Lab. MicroTau creates an external cladding for planes that mimics shark skin, which the startup claims reduces drag and saves fuel.

The technology can be applied to an aircraft's fuselage, wings and tail and may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.

Delta is on track to increase its usage of SAF by 50% compared to the previous year. In 2025, the carrier collaborates with Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland on a project that sees the first commercial-scale delivery of SAF to an airport, Portland International Airport.

According to Airbus, SAF can reduce an airline’s emissions by up to 80%.

One of Delta’s primary goals for the year is to procure more than 35 sustainable aircraft. On average, these new planes are over 25% more fuel-efficient per seat mile than the aircraft Delta has retired since 2019.

In 2024, emissions from UK flights grew faster than the number of flights.","As we explained in our previous article in September 2025, the CAA is responsible for implementing the UK’s environmental reporting obligations, which it does through publishing the Aviation Environmental Review (the “AER”). In our previous article, we provided an overview of the CAA’s new approach towards the AER; now, just a few months later, we have the first example of how the CAA has put this approach into practice with the publication of its latest AER using data from up until 2024.

Read on below for our brief overview of CAP 3198 and what it can tell us about the state of UK aviation.

What is the aim of environmental reporting, and how does the AER help achieve it?

As a carbon-intensive industry, aviation plays a crucial role in the UK’s efforts to meet its international environmental commitments. As we recognised in September, the AER provides an important tool for monitoring the industry’s performance with regard to the UK’s environmental objectives and for providing industry stakeholders with usable and detailed data.

What was the direction of travel in 2024?

CAP 3198 confirms that 2019 was the peak year for UK aviation in terms of flight numbers and CO2 emissions. The AER therefore uses 2019 aviation data as its benchmark for measuring performance. CAP 3198 also makes it clear that, if Net Zero is to be achieved by 2050, the baseline levels from 2019 cannot be exceeded.

In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution and air quality, road transport remains the largest contributor in the UK; for instance, 97% of greenhouse gas emissions are generated by road transport. Domestic civil aviation is, comparatively, a much smaller contributor at only 1%. However, emissions and pollution from road transport have fallen significantly overall. For example, from 2005 to 2023, emissions from passenger cars reduced by 23% despite the number of miles travelled increasing. A similar trend has been observed in the rail sector.

This is not the case for aviation. In 2024, emissions from UK flights grew faster than the number of flights. Accordingly, aviation is on track to become one of the highest-emitting sectors in the UK as other modes of transport decarbonise more quickly.

What about sustainable fuel?

Despite being one of the key areas identified in CAP 3153 for future reporting, the report does not include data on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This is unsurprising given the historic nature of the data considered and accounting for the fact that the UK’s SAF Mandate has only recently come into force (see our overview of the SAF Mandate regime here). We can expect that it will take some time for the impact of SAF to filter through, and that the next edition of the AER will include more data on this point.

What does it mean for airlines?

The report uses a combination of pre-existing data sources and newly developed databases to analyse the emissions of aircraft departing the UK. The new database has greater accuracy by using the time spent actually in the air by each aircraft, rather than estimates, to measure emissions.

This allows the AER to provide more granular detail on aviation’s environmental impact. This includes greater transparency as to the relative environmental impacts of domestic and short-haul flights on the one hand, and medium-to-long-haul flights on the other. For example, the report confirms that while ultra-short and short-haul flights of under 1,500km account for 63% of all flights in the UK, they only account for 17% of total emissions. By contrast, long-haul flights are responsible for generating 63% of all emissions but represent the smallest proportion of flights in the UK (11%) overall.

It is possible that greater awareness in this area may lead to shifts in passenger behaviour and increased pressure for investment in more sustainable aircraft types and SAF. However, it is also possible that the increased transparency provided by the AER will provide new opportunities for airlines to strategically differentiate themselves in the market by improving resource efficiency and demonstrating leadership in sustainability.

What does it mean for airports?

The report includes detailed findings on air quality (broken down into NOx, SO2, PM2.5 and NMVOCS) and noise pollution around airports, which are individually named.

The results of this analysis come as no surprise. They indicate that flights from the busiest 10 airports across the UK generate more than 95% of all emissions, with Heathrow alone generating more emissions than the other top 10 airports combined.

There is positive news, however: while air traffic has not quite regained 2019 levels (94%), the level of noise pollution has actually fallen at a faster rate, leaving fewer people exposed to daytime aviation noise in 2024. Additionally, the level of SO2 emissions recorded across UK airports in 2023 was 67% lower than in 2019.

That notwithstanding, the air quality data reported in the AER suggests that other sectors are decarbonising more quickly than aviation. This may lead to increased scrutiny for the sector.

Next steps

The CAA is required to publish an AER at least every three years. We can therefore expect the next edition to be published by no later than December 2028.

It will be interesting to see what story the next installment of data analysis tells us about the progress made by the industry following developments including the UK SAF Mandate, the increasing adoption of more fuel-efficient aircraft and the ongoing airspace modernisation programme. It will also be interesting to monitor whether the AER framework will account for other decarbonisation improvements across the sector, including the impact of the CAA's ongoing Hydrogen Challenge. This aims to increase sustainability by preparing UK aviation for the adoption of hydrogen as a zero-carbon fuel, both for use by new aircraft types (primarily on domestic regional routes) and within airport infrastructure.

The syncrude will be processed in an existing refinery together with fossil crude oil and refined into certified Jet-A-1 fuel. Thus, Synhelion directly replaces fossil crude oil with sustainable syncrude, without the need for any adjustments to the existing infrastructure. The fuel will be delivered to the airport via the regular logistics chain and fed into the fuel supply system. Synhelion’s synthetic jet fuel is based on renewable energy and sustainable feedstocks.

A strong signal for sustainable aviation

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonizing our flight operations,” says Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS. “Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

With this offtake agreement, SWISS is actively supporting the scaling of Synhelion’s technology for the production of renewable synthetic fuels as a customer, investor, and strategic partner. This long-term planning certainty enables targeted expansion of production capacity and helps reduce costs over time.

Pioneering partnership

Synhelion also emphasizes the significance of the agreement: “The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of our technology,” says Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion. “This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

Expanding the partnership with Kuehne+Nagel

Part of the renewable jet fuel produced by Synhelion will be resold by SWISS to the logistics service provider Kuehne+Nagel. The company will use the sustainable fuel for air freight transportation with Swiss WorldCargo, offering its customers a tangible solution to reduce their carbon footprint in global logistics.

First delivery already completed

In July 2025, SWISS became the first airline in the world to use solar fuel from Synhelion in regular flight operations. Synhelion delivered its first barrel of syncrude from its DAWN plant to a refinery in northern Germany, where the syncrude was processed into certified jet fuel (Jet-A-1) and subsequently fed into the fuel supply system via Hamburg Airport.

“And this is SAF,” Haas says, holding up another sealed bottle filled with crystal-clear liquid.
“It’s jet fuel – though most people wouldn’t guess it, since it looks just like water.
And a key part of his job is to accelerate SAF adoption at Cathay Pacific.
SAF attributes are the environmental benefits that result from a specified amount of SAF used to replace conventional jet fuel.","“Do you know what this is, or what this might be – the dirty-looking one?” asks Oliver Haas, the head of sustainability – commercial and innovation at Cathay Pacific, holding up a laboratory bottle filled with dark, murky liquid. The bottle contains used cooking oil, Haas explains, which is one of the raw materials most widely used for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“And this is SAF,” Haas says, holding up another sealed bottle filled with crystal-clear liquid. “It’s jet fuel – though most people wouldn’t guess it, since it looks just like water. But it’s incredibly refined and packed with high-performance chemistry.”

“The magic of SAF is that basically you can turn this into this,” Haas says, holding the two bottles side by side. “You can turn a waste product into jet-grade fuel.”

Having been obsessed – in his words – with aircraft since he was five years old, Haas now sits in an office filled with models of them. And a key part of his job is to accelerate SAF adoption at Cathay Pacific.

In addition to used cooking oil, raw materials used to produce SAF include municipal waste, agricultural residue and even carbon dioxide. The chemical properties of SAF are almost identical to those of conventional jet fuel, and both types can be safely combined for use in aircraft.

“The benefit of SAF is that it is a so-called ‘drop-in fuel’,” Haas says. “Today, it has to be blended by up to 50 per cent with jet fuel, and there are various tests happening in the industry to allow 100 per cent of it to be used. But fundamentally, it can be dropped into an existing aircraft.”

While there are other options for powering an aircraft in a more sustainable way, including hydrogen and electricity, “the big challenge in aviation is that it is very difficult to find alternatives that can compete with jet fuel,” Haas says.

While small electric aircraft are under development, Haas points out they are more suited for regional, short-haul routes in markets such as Europe, the United States and Australia. And though hydrogen can fuel larger aircraft, the challenge lies in producing it cleanly and at a scale that makes it viable.

According to technical analysis conducted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency, SAF has the greatest potential to reduce carbon emissions produced by air travel.

Haas cites a typical flight from Sydney to Hong Kong as an example: “That is a nine-hour flight, which Cathay Pacific currently flies with aircraft that carry more than 300 passengers. There simply aren’t many options to move that many people over that distance in that time, other than by using liquid fuels.”

While SAF is, for now, the most viable option for airlines to reduce their carbon emissions while maintaining current numbers of flights, it also comes with significant challenges, such as high production costs. And SAF supply is still limited – in 2024, it made up just 0.3 per cent of global jet fuel production, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade body with 350 member airlines. At these levels, costs will remain high at all points of the SAF supply chain.

Cathay Pacific has launched a new platform that allows passengers to estimate the carbon emissions generated by their flights and make a voluntary contribution to buy SAF attributes. SAF attributes are the environmental benefits that result from a specified amount of SAF used to replace conventional jet fuel.

Each contribution made is used to purchase SAF that is in addition to the airline’s mandated requirement of the percentage of SAF to be mixed into conventional jet fuel. Some countries and trading blocs have now mandated a minimum usage requirement for SAF. The United Kingdom, for instance, has set a SAF usage target of 10 per cent by 2030, while the European Union has set a minimum mandate of 2 per cent this year, to be increased to 70 per cent by 2050.

Eligible members of the Cathay membership programme can earn one Asia Mile for every HK$1 contribution they make to the SAF programme – a special rate offered to passengers to encourage them to take meaningful action and contribute to scaling up the use of SAF.

However, the use of SAF continues to remain a mystery to many people. Haas explains that unlike an electric car, which feels different in the way it sounds, drives and accelerates, SAF is effectively invisible to passengers.

“Even if I put SAF in the aircraft you are sitting in, you don’t have an emotional relationship with that. You can’t touch it. You can’t smell it. You can’t feel it. The whole point of SAF is that it is made to be as close to an equivalent of conventional jet fuel as possible,” he says.

With this in mind, Haas and his team are working on ways to make SAF more relatable to passengers, with most ideas still in their early stages.

No airline can do this alone, and Cathay Pacific’s approach to scaling SAF also includes the Corporate SAF Programme, established in 2022 for its corporate customers. It allows them to purchase SAF attributes with the airline and supports companies in reducing indirect emissions from business trips, while helping the airline to scale SAF usage.

Recently, the airline also announced its participation – as a founding investor – in a new fund, alongside several Oneworld alliance members and Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), an investment firm founded by Bill Gates that funds climate technology. The Oneworld BEV Fund will address difficulties around the production and cost of SAF, and invest in new technology to that end. Cathay Pacific also announced a joint investment agreement with Airbus, valued at HK$545 million (US$70 million), to drive the development of SAF production globally.

And at its home base, Cathay Pacific has co-initiated the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition, working with partners to support policy and infrastructure development that will facilitate the use of SAF at Hong Kong International Airport.

However, it is the need to increase general awareness of SAF that Haas says keeps him awake at night and gets him up in the morning.

“Aviation connects people, culture and ideas, and I want to see more of that happen,” he says. “And as individual fliers, we carry a responsibility when we fly. The future of aviation is about continuing to make global travel possible, not just for ourselves, but for others and other generations too.”

The agreement, witnessed by the minister of petroleum and mineral resources, marks a structural shift in how Egypt’s energy and petrochemical sectors approach climate goals, industrial value creation, and export-oriented growth.

Unlike pilot programs or memoranda of understanding, this deal authorizes actual production, signaling that SAF is moving from concept to infrastructure in Egypt.

Why sustainable aviation fuel matters now

Aviation accounts for a growing share of global emissions, and airlines face mounting pressure from regulators, investors, and customers to cut carbon intensity. SAF has emerged as the most viable near-term solution, as it can be blended with conventional jet fuel without requiring new aircraft or airport infrastructure.

For Egypt, SAF is strategically attractive for three reasons:

Immediate emissions impact without disrupting aviation operations

Alignment with international climate and aviation standards, particularly in Europe

Creation of a high-value green fuel export, not just domestic substitution

By entering SAF production early, Egypt positions itself within a global supply chain that is still capacity-constrained but rapidly expanding.

What the Alexandria project will deliver

The SAF facility will be built in Alexandria and designed to convert used cooking oil into aviation-grade fuel. This choice of feedstock is economically and environmentally significant.

Key project characteristics include:

Annual production capacity: up to 120,000 tons

Feedstock: waste oils, primarily used cooking oil

Estimated emissions reduction: around 400,000 tons of CO₂ per year

From an industrial standpoint, the project does more than produce cleaner fuel—it upgrades waste into a premium energy product, reinforcing circular-economy principles while reducing reliance on virgin fossil inputs.

Technology as the critical enabler

At the heart of the project is advanced hydrotreating technology capable of converting waste oils into fuel that meets international aviation specifications. Conversion rates of up to 80 percent significantly improve project economics, making SAF more competitive against conventional jet fuel.

This matters because SAF’s biggest challenge globally is cost. Higher conversion efficiency directly reduces unit costs and strengthens the business case for scaling production.

By adopting proven global technology platforms rather than experimental solutions, Egypt reduces execution risk and accelerates time to market.

Economic returns beyond emissions reduction

While climate benefits are central, the SAF project has broader economic implications:

1. Value-added manufacturing

Instead of exporting raw hydrocarbons or low-margin products, Egypt is moving into advanced fuel processing with higher margins and technical complexity.

2. Export potential

European airlines and airports are under regulatory pressure to increase SAF usage. Egypt’s geographic proximity gives it a logistics advantage in serving Mediterranean and European markets.

3. Job creation and skills transfer

SAF production requires specialized chemical, engineering, and operational expertise, strengthening Egypt’s industrial skill base.

4. Waste management benefits

Scaling used cooking oil collection formalizes waste streams that are often informal or underutilized, creating new micro-economies around collection and logistics.

A signal to investors and global partners

Beyond the plant itself, the agreement sends a broader message: Egypt is open to commercial-scale green energy investments, not just renewables like solar and wind, but also low-carbon fuels that serve global industries.

This diversification matters. As countries compete for climate-aligned capital, projects that combine technology, exports, and measurable emissions reduction are increasingly favored by international investors and development institutions.

SAF as part of Egypt’s energy transition strategy

The petroleum sector’s involvement is particularly notable. Rather than viewing decarbonization as a threat, Egypt’s energy authorities are positioning traditional institutions as drivers of the transition, using existing infrastructure, expertise, and partnerships to enter new markets.

SAF fits neatly into this approach:

It leverages petrochemical know-how

It supports national climate commitments

It preserves Egypt’s relevance in a lower-carbon global energy system

A first step with long-term implications

While one plant will not transform aviation overnight, this agreement establishes a blueprint. If successful, it can be replicated, expanded, and integrated into a broader ecosystem of green fuels, including marine fuels and synthetic alternatives.",https://egbc-images.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/content/w620/438450.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 05:56:53.670326

According to recent research among Private Jet Card Comparisons subscribers, 42.3% of respondents who are not flying privately yet but are considering it say sustainability programs will be important in choosing a flight provider.","The change in the U.S. political climate is not sidetracking private jet sustainability initiatives or affecting the need for high-profile private jet users to stay focused on the issue.

In a wide-ranging interview, 4Air founder and CEO Kennedy Ricci discussed why the changing winds in Washington, D.C., are not affecting the business aviation segment’s leadership in reducing emissions.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced rollbacks for auto fuel emissions standards.

President Donald J. Trump said at the time, “We’re officially terminating Joe Biden’s ridiculously burdensome, horrible, actually, CAFE standards that impose expensive restrictions.”

Global Industry

However, the global nature of private jet activity means private aviation suppliers from OEMs to MROs and end users are still highly focused on sustainability, Ricci tells Private Jet Card Comparisons.

Ricci notes, “A lot of our industry is international.”

He continues, “Even if you’re based in the U.S. and, if you’re flying overseas, Europe’s obviously a big destination point, (sustainability regulations) matters to you as a U.S. operator.”

Ricci notes, “We’ve seen the rest of the world continue to march ahead.”

Beyond Europe, there are more than a dozen mandates for sustainable aviation fuel.

The United Arab Emirates is the most recent country to introduce a SAF mandate.

Other mandates come from China, Korea, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, Australia, Brazil, “pretty broadly across the world.”

Even in the U.S., Ricci says, despite the rhetoric in Washington D.C., “what we’ve really seen is things went back to the state level. So we already have a mix of federal and state incentives.”

The net effect for private jet operators, both commercial and private, is that compliance has become more intensive.

“It’s kind of increased the complexity of what you have to look at,” he says.

For example, California’s latest disclosure requirements apply to companies with over $500 million in revenue that do business in the state.

While 4Air launched in 2020, focused on helping source carbon credits, the web of regulations and incentives means “how do we support (customers)…knowing the requirements (and complying).”

Ricci says that failing to take the measures seriously, comply, and report can be costly.

“If you don’t, you get an angry letter at the end of the year that says, ‘Hey, you didn’t comply, and here’s what you owe, plus 100% penalty.'”

4Air also helps identify and obtain incentives to use SAF and reward decarbonization efforts.

Increasing Disclosures

Over the past five years, Ricci says the percentage of large companies disclosing their emissions has increased.

The 2025 State of Corporate Sustainability Disclosure Report, published by the UCLA Anderson Center for Impact, reports a “notable uptick” in emissions and climate risk reporting.

The UCLA Report adds:

‘Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG-emission-disclosure rates remain high at over 88% for S&P 500 companies, while Scope 3 disclosures have improved to 69.5%. Net-zero and carbon-neutrality commitments are becoming increasingly common, with almost 57% of S&P 500 companies having announced such goals. Companies are also beginning to lay important groundwork for climate transition planning: 24.4% of firms have publicly disclosed a transition plan outlining their intended pathways toward decarbonization.’

Ricci says, “A lot of our work of 4Air has actually been building reports for our customers’ customers of what their emissions were? How much did they fly? How much fuel did they consume? What was their carbon impact?”

While 4Air does work directly with UHNWs in some cases, it primarily serves end users through their aircraft management companies, corporate flight departments, and charter and fractional operators.

Private Aviation Sustainability

While anti-private jet groups have called into question the industry’s sustainability initiatives from SAF to carbon credits and eVTOLs as being a mix of greenwashing and pie in the sky, Ricci takes a more measured view.

He points to 4Air’s work identifying and reducing non-carbon emissions, which can have twice the warming effect as carbon emissions.

4Air has been leading several studies about how future flight planning can reduce those contrails.

Those studies will first be proven out using private aviation, he says.

In fact, Ricci notes that business aviation is the incubator for fuel-saving and emissions-reducing technology that is later applied to wider air travel.

Think of those winglets – they were born in private aviation.

Ricci says it will be the same story with both SAF and eVTOLs.

While acknowledging questions about the validity of some carbon offset programs, he sees the criticism as an opportunity to put projects under a microscope and better communicate how and over what period they deliver the desired impact.

Ricci says, “We are taking those higher integrity kind of diligence processes into mind.

We’re very thoughtful about the project types that we’re working with.”

He adds that in the area of future fuel, the industry is investing in everything from new SAF sources to alternatives such as hydrogen.

Ban Private Jets

While aviation, private aviation, and even the broader travel industry are often the target of climate campaigners, Ricci says, “The atmosphere doesn’t care that it came from aviation or that it came from shipping or that it came from forestry. We need to identify reductions and align the types of incentives and willingness to pay with the actual solutions.”

Studies show aviation accounts for about 2% of all global carbon emissions.

Private jets are just 2% of that 2%.

Thinking about groups that are focused on banning private jets, Ricci says, “I’d want to communicate that our desire to decarbonize is genuine.”

Ricci adds, “We want to find good solutions that are meaningful and impactful. We want to make sure we’re thoughtful about the types of programs we’re working on. We want truly sustainable innovations. So the interest we have is genuine.”

To those groups, he says, “If there are ways that you can help us make sure that what we’re doing is actually driving impact, then we’re all for that.”

Next Generation Flyers

What’s more, private jet flight providers will also have to consider the next wave of new customers.

Agreement supports DHL Group’s target to reach 30 percent sustainable aviation fuel use by 2030

DHL Global Forwarding and Air France KLM Martinair Cargo have expanded their partnership with a new framework agreement aimed at accelerating decarbonization across the air freight sector, shifting the focus from transactional fuel purchases to structured, verifiable emission reduction rights.

The agreement builds on a collaboration launched in 2022 and introduces a clearer commercial and governance framework for emission reduction claims. Central to the deal is the development of market ready book and claim models designed to scale sustainable aviation fuel adoption while providing transparency and credibility for corporate climate reporting.

Moving Beyond Transactional SAF Procurement

Under the new framework, DHL Global Forwarding has signed a work order covering 35,000 metric tons of well to wheel CO2e emission reduction rights. The approach reflects a broader shift in how large logistics players are addressing aviation emissions, particularly in a market where physical access to sustainable aviation fuels remains uneven across routes and regions.

Rather than tying emission reductions solely to where fuel is physically uplifted, book and claim mechanisms allow environmental benefits to be allocated independently of specific flights. This structure is increasingly viewed as essential for scaling SAF in the near term, especially for multinational shippers with complex global networks.

“This framework agreement shows what collaborative decarbonization in air freight can look like,” said Henk Venema, Executive Vice President of Global Air Freight at DHL Global Forwarding. “Emission Reduction Rights provide predictability, scalability, and transparency, three critical factors for sustainable aviation fuels to make a real impact within the market. Together with AFKLMP, we are establishing a foundation that can serve as a model for the entire industry.”

A Strategic Carrier Relationship

Air France KLM Martinair Cargo has been one of DHL Global Forwarding’s leading carriers for the past five years and a top performer in DHL’s GoGreen Carrier Evaluation Program. The airline group has also been an active participant in industry initiatives, conferences, and working groups focused on transparency, standard setting, and practical pathways for reducing air freight emissions.

The renewed agreement formalizes a long term collaboration that extends beyond fuel sourcing to include digital verification processes and standardized emissions accounting. For DHL, this strengthens its position as a provider of emission reduced air freight products for customers facing rising regulatory and investor scrutiny of Scope 3 emissions.

“We are proud to renew this partnership with DHL Global Forwarding, a clear sign of leadership,” said GertJan Roelands, SVP Commercial at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo. “Our shared ambition and continued collaboration on SAF are fundamental to scaling the solutions needed to reduce the carbon footprint of the air freight industry. This new agreement reflects mutual trust, operational commitment, and a firm belief that only through close cooperation can we drive meaningful change across the air freight value chain.”

Governance, Reporting, And Scope 3 Pressures

The agreement comes as companies face growing pressure to demonstrate credible progress on indirect emissions, particularly from transportation and logistics. Book and claim systems are gaining attention from regulators, standards bodies, and corporate buyers as a pragmatic interim solution while global SAF supply ramps up.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus products sit at the center of this strategy. The offering enables true value chain decarbonization by replacing fossil fuels with sustainable fuels within DHL’s network and allocating the resulting environmental benefits to customers, even when shipments are not physically moved on low carbon assets.

This allows DHL customers to reduce reported Scope 3 emissions from upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, while supporting voluntary greenhouse gas reporting and progress tracking against decarbonization targets.

Implications For The Global Air Freight Market

The DHL AFKLMP framework agreement aligns with DHL Group’s broader goal to raise sustainable aviation fuel use to 30 percent by 2030. By anchoring SAF deployment in long term contracts and standardized emission reduction rights, the partnership aims to provide the scale and predictability needed to attract further investment into low carbon aviation fuels.

The agreement was formally marked at a ceremony in Amsterdam attended by senior executives from both companies, including Venema and Patrick Bongers, Head of AFR Growth at DHL Global Forwarding.

For the wider air freight industry, the deal reflects a shift toward collaborative, system level solutions that address both physical fuel constraints and the governance challenges of emissions accounting. As regulators and customers demand clearer evidence of climate impact, frameworks that combine operational commitment with credible verification are likely to play a growing role in how aviation decarbonization is financed and delivered globally.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DHL-Air-France-KLM-Cargo-Expand-Emissions-Reduction-Framework-For-Air-Freight.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 02:58:07.203735

OMB review marks a final stage before a proposed rule is released for public comment.

According to information released by the OMB, the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) includes guidance regarding 45Z implementation, including the calculation of emissions factors for transportation fuel, the determination of clean fuel production credits, and producer registration.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly when compared to last year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.

Also in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy released the 45ZCF-GREET model, which is designed specifically to evaluate life cycle GHG emissions to meet the requirements of section 45Z.

The DOE in July 2025 issued a notice soliciting public comments on a preliminary plan for determining provisional emissions rates (PER) for the purposes of the 45Z clean fuel production credit. A PER must be determined for any fuel not addressed in the emissions rate tables.

According to information published by the OMB, the upcoming NPRM is expected to address public comments gathered by Treasury and the IRS in response to the January 2025 notices. “These notices were published in early 2025 to meet the statutory deadline of January 1, 2025, however the rules need to be further formalized in an NPRM and then finalized,” according to the OMB’s summary of the NPRM.

One of the things that I think I love the most about Formula One is the sheer amount of innovation and research and development that comes from this space, then find themselves applied in other industries. When we got to our carbon footprint, we realised about 1/3 of it comes from the fact that we are a global business. We fly around the world both things cars, garage equipment and people. Kernels are committed to major investments in sustainable aviation fuel funding 1,000,000 US gallons of sustainable aviation fuel certificates to cover all of its business flight travel. This helped them achieve. The 23% reduction in emissions per race back in 2024 versus 2023. In the US, 12% of transportation emissions is from aviation. And so this gives us a chance to really make an impact in an area that enables us to reach our net zero goal as a world, but also through the work that we're doing together in our respective industries. And on top of that, cutting Rd. freight emissions by 48%. So large scale demands from companies like McLaren absolutely help scale. These markets like the sustainable aviation fuel market, absolutely it's about creating demand signals to create an early market. We need to have partnerships like this that can drive the volume we need to see to really make this really a business valuable endeavor.

The European-backed project is expected to cost between $4B and $6B

A proposal for an industrial plant on Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore that would produce a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel has passed its first regulatory hurdle, acquiring environmental approval from the province.

In a news release, Nova Sustainable Fuels – a company backed by European energy giant Octopus Energy Generation – called it “one of Eastern Canada’s most ambitious energy projects,” and said the approval is an important step forward.

The plan is to use solar and wind farms as well as biomass to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable methanol. The company describes the products as “two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector.”

Nova Scotia Environment Minister Tim Halman signed off on the project Thursday, with some conditions.

Halman’s conditions include that the project has to get underway within two years (although it can apply for extensions), the company has to submit additional information to support conservation and it has to develop a plan for engaging with the Mi’kmaq.

The approval deals with the first phase of Nova Sustainable Fuels’ plans: a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, N.S.

The second phase of Nova Sustainable Fuels’ plan is to build wind and solar farms that would connect to the plant. That will require another environmental assessment, which the company said it plans to submit in 2027.

The facility would require 60 truckloads of biomass – that is, woody byproducts from the forestry industry – per day and 586 cubic metres of fresh water per hour. The plan is to pull the water from two nearby lakes, Meadow Lake and Ocean Lake, through pipelines.

The project will require industrial approval and water withdrawal approval before it can proceed.

The company has estimated the project will cost between $4 billion to $6 billion to launch. It’s expected to take about three years to construct and have a 50-year lifespan.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 16:57:34.037726

The company plans to use waste biomass from Nova Scotia forestry and forest-based industries to create low-emission aviation fuel as an alternative to petroleum-based fuel.
“Projects like this are crucial to helping to reduce global carbon emissions, while creating jobs and growing our economy,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change.
The project must comply with 34 stringent terms and conditions in its environmental assessment approval that are designed to protect the environment and human health.
The project will also require an industrial approval and a water withdrawal approval.","Nova Sustainable Fuels has received environmental assessment approval for the first phase of a project that will see the company develop a renewable energy park in Goldboro, Guysborough County, where it will produce sustainable aviation fuel.

The company plans to use waste biomass from Nova Scotia forestry and forest-based industries to create low-emission aviation fuel as an alternative to petroleum-based fuel.

“Projects like this are crucial to helping to reduce global carbon emissions, while creating jobs and growing our economy,” said Timothy Halman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “And when we welcome projects like this, it continues to position Nova Scotia as a leader in climate change action, innovation and the global clean energy transformation.”

The company will need a second environmental assessment approval for its second phase – a proposed wind energy and solar farm and a transmission line to supply renewable energy for fuel production.

The company expects the project will create about 1,000 jobs during the construction phase, up to 80 jobs during its operation (expected to end in 2081) and direct and indirect economic benefits for local businesses, communities and residents.

The project must comply with 34 stringent terms and conditions in its environmental assessment approval that are designed to protect the environment and human health. The project will also require an industrial approval and a water withdrawal approval.

Quick Facts:

the company would create a new market for Nova Scotia’s oversupply of biomass from forestry activity, including wood chips and bark that are the byproduct of silviculture, harvesting and sawmilling

the Minister of Environment and Climate Change – the province's environmental regulator – uses the Environment Act and is guided by science and evidence when reviewing environmental assessment requests

if a project is approved, the regulator typically includes terms and conditions which are designed to ensure the environment and people remain protected throughout the life of the project, while also allowing viable, safe and responsible development to take place

the Department's inspection, compliance and enforcement staff ensure companies comply with the terms and conditions of their various approvals; in 2024, they conducted about 6,400 inspections to ensure companies were complying with Nova Scotia’s environmental rules and laws

In China, the price of waste cooking oil, often called “gutter oil”, has risen around fourfold in two years, said Feng Yu, president of aerospace conglomerate Honeywell China.
China’s gutter oil problem first came to prominence in 1998, when Southern Metropolis Daily published a series of reports on the illegal processing of waste grease from sewers and restaurant drains back into cooking oil.
In 2010, reportedly in response to media investigations, regulators issued an emergency notice to block gutter oil from entering the catering sector, noted China News.

In China, the price of waste cooking oil, often called “gutter oil”, has risen around fourfold in two years, said Feng Yu, president of aerospace conglomerate Honeywell China.

Speaking at a roundtable in Beijing, Feng pointed to the “severe shortage” for this resource worldwide, reported Caixin. Waste oil is a key feedstock for hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), a hydrogenation and refining process that is currently the most commercially mature method of producing SAF.

China’s gutter oil problem first came to prominence in 1998, when Southern Metropolis Daily published a series of reports on the illegal processing of waste grease from sewers and restaurant drains back into cooking oil. In 2010, reportedly in response to media investigations, regulators issued an emergency notice to block gutter oil from entering the catering sector, noted China News. After tighter enforcement, waste cooking oil has increasingly been instead redirected into regulated industrial uses such as biodiesel and, more recently, SAF.

In recent years, SAF has gained strong momentum as a near-term option to reduce aviation emissions, being able to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. Cost, however, is a problem. SAF trades at two to five times the price of fossil jet fuel in several markets, and according to the International Air Transport Association’s estimates, this price gap could add USD 3.6 billion to airline cost burdens in 2025, noted S&P Global.

Even so, production capacity is growing. Chinese companies that have or are in the process of obtaining airworthiness certification for their SAF have over one million tonnes of production capacity per year, Caixin reported. Additionally, a new facility was inaugurated earlier this month by Honeywell and Jia’ao Environmental Protection that uses proprietary technology to turn about 500,000 tonnes of waste oil into SAF daily, the outlet noted.

Global policies, such as that of the EU, have been a major driver of the SAF push. The bloc has set targets requiring 2% SAF use by 2025 and 70% by 2050. China has no mandatory blending rule, but plans to have consumed 50,000 tonnes of SAF between 2021 and 2025.

Critics remain unconvinced. The co-author of a 2024 report by the Washington-based Institute of Policy Studies called SAF a “huge greenwashing exercise” by the aviation industry, arguing it cannot scale fast enough to replace fossil jet fuel, noted The Guardian. Heavy reliance on bio-based feedstocks could also bring serious risks, including pressure on food supply, damage to natural carbon sinks, and higher pollution from land-use change, the outlet reported.",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2024/04/China-news-digest_THUMBNAIL_Alamy_2EKJEG3.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:57:12.699245

Securing the FEED contract positions SAMSUNG E&A favorably to participate in subsequent engineering, procurement, and construction stages.
This latest contract follows SAMSUNG E&A’s successful acquisition of a KRW 1.4 trillion SAF project in Malaysia late last year, confirming its formal entry into the global SAF market.","SAMSUNG E&A, a comprehensive solutions provider serving the global energy sector, has taken a significant step forward in its clean energy expansion by securing a Front End Engineering Design (FEED) contract for a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in the United States. This achievement represents the company’s full-scale entry into the rapidly growing global clean energy and SAF markets, reinforcing its strategic focus on energy transition technologies.

The company announced on the 15th that it formally signed an agreement on the 12th with DG Fuels, a U.S.-based developer specializing in sustainable aviation fuel projects. Under this agreement, SAMSUNG E&A will carry out the FEED scope for the Louisiana SAF Production Project, a major clean energy initiative planned for the southern United States. The contract covers one of two primary design packages, with SAMSUNG E&A responsible for the clean hydrogen production package. The value of the FEED contract is approximately KRW 23 billion (around USD 15.7 million), and the engineering phase is expected to take roughly 10 months to complete.

Upon successful delivery of the basic engineering work, SAMSUNG E&A plans to pursue a follow-on contract for the project’s main execution phase. The total investment size of the overall project is estimated at nearly USD 3 billion (approximately KRW 4.5 trillion), underscoring the scale and strategic importance of the development. Securing the FEED contract positions SAMSUNG E&A favorably to participate in subsequent engineering, procurement, and construction stages.

The SAF facility will be constructed in St. James Parish, Louisiana, and is designed to produce approximately 600,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel per year. The plant will utilize regionally abundant waste-based feedstocks, including agricultural residues and woody biomass, supporting both carbon reduction and local resource utilization. This approach aligns with global efforts to decarbonize the aviation sector by replacing conventional fossil-based jet fuel with bio-derived alternatives.

As part of its scope, SAMSUNG E&A will oversee advanced blue hydrogen infrastructure, including facilities such as Air Separation Units (ASU), Auto Thermal Reformers (ATR), and carbon dioxide capture systems. In addition, the company will deliver green hydrogen facilities based on water electrolysis technology, enabling the project to integrate both blue and green hydrogen pathways to support low-carbon fuel production.

This latest contract follows SAMSUNG E&A’s successful acquisition of a KRW 1.4 trillion SAF project in Malaysia late last year, confirming its formal entry into the global SAF market. Sustainable aviation fuel is increasingly viewed as a critical solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in air transport, and global mandates requiring SAF blending are expected to drive consistent market growth in the coming years.

SAMSUNG E&A’s progress is anchored in its future-oriented E&Able strategy, which focuses on securing and deploying key energy transition technologies such as SAF, carbon capture, hydrogen, ammonia, and LNG. Through targeted investments and strategic collaborations, the company has already delivered concrete results, including SAF facilities in Malaysia, a biodegradable plastics plant in the UAE, eco-friendly LNG projects in Indonesia and North America, and a low-carbon ammonia plant in the United States.

Commenting on the achievement, Hong Namkoong, President and CEO of SAMSUNG E&A, stated that the company will strive to secure additional orders by successfully completing the FEED phase. He emphasized that the project will strengthen SAMSUNG E&A’s foothold in North America while expanding its role in next-generation energy transition sectors such as SAF, hydrogen, and carbon capture.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-18 11:57:17.611397

The EU-backed research effort, coordinated by Austria’s Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), reportedly aims to develop a waste-free, climate-neutral biorefinery.
Called ToFuel, the four-year, innovative project aims to convert tomato processing residues into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) while also producing valuable by-products such as fertilizer, animal feed, and nutritional oil.
HEFA is a well-established method for producing sustainable aviation fuel from vegetable, animal, or recycled fats and oils that meets international aviation fuel standards.
“Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price,” Kienberger stated in a statement.","Scientists in Europe have launched an initiative to turn residual tomato waste into sustainable jet fuel in a bid to cut carbon emissions and tackle one of aviation’s toughest challenges.

The EU-backed research effort, coordinated by Austria’s Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), reportedly aims to develop a waste-free, climate-neutral biorefinery.

Called ToFuel, the four-year, innovative project aims to convert tomato processing residues into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) while also producing valuable by-products such as fertilizer, animal feed, and nutritional oil.

“According to estimates, around three per cent of the sustainable aviation fuels required in Europe by 2030 could be covered from the amount of tomato pomace produced throughout the EU, i.e., the residues from tomato processing,” Marlene Kienberger, PhD, a professor at TU Graz and project manager, explained.

Powering jets with tomatoes

According to the research team, the approach could support Europe’s efforts to reduce aviation emissions while creating economic value from agricultural waste that is currently discarded or burned.

Meanwhile, tomatoes are the second-most-consumed vegetable in the world, after potatoes. The EU produces around 17 megatons annually, resulting in large volumes of residual biomass.

This includes materials like leaves, stems, peels, seeds, and unripe or spoiled fruit, most of which are considered low-value waste despite being rich in energy-dense compounds that can be converted into fuel.

To achieve this, the researchers are exploring two advanced processing routes. The first uses extrusion, in which the biomass is heated and pressurized before undergoing rapid decompression.

This breaks down plant cell structures and prepares the material for fermentation. Microorganisms then convert it into lipid-rich oils suitable for fuel production.

The second approach uses hydrothermal liquefaction to convert wet biomass into bio-oil and biochar under high temperatures and pressures. The resulting bio-oil is then purified to remove nitrogen-containing compounds that would otherwise interfere with fuel synthesis.

Decarbonizing air travel

The purification and fractionation steps are being developed jointly by scientists from TU Graz, the University of Zagreb in Croatia, and Portugal’s national energy laboratory (LNEG).

The lipids and bio-oil are then converted into a fuel that fulfils the international quality standards for sustainable aviation fuel using the HEFA (Hydrogenated Esters and Fatty Acids) process at the Technical University of Leoben in Austria.

HEFA is a well-established method for producing sustainable aviation fuel from vegetable, animal, or recycled fats and oils that meets international aviation fuel standards.

“Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price,” Kienberger stated in a statement. “Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuels simply have to be economically viable.

During the project, the two technologies will be scaled up toward pre-industrial demonstration as researchers evaluate their environmental, economic, and social impacts. The utilization of tomato residues also creates new sources of income for food processing companies.

Officially launching on January 1, 2026, the ToFuel project will bring together 11 partners from seven European countries. It will operate with a budget of USD 4.1 million (EUR 3.5 million).",https://cms.interestingengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/A1_bf9fd9.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 11:57:28.030706

This year, we're counting them down from Dec. 18 to Dec. 31. On Jan. 1 and Jan. 2, we will look at some of the runners-up for this year. Today, we begin the countdown with No. 10: How biofuels court cases and government policies drove continued change in the market for biofuels.

**

LINCOLN, Neb. (DTN) -- From a Supreme Court ruling in favor of biofuels groups, to a new Renewable Fuel Standard volumes proposal and more debate on small-refinery exemptions, biofuels news this year was highly consequential and starts our Top 10 Ag Stories of 2025 countdown.

As President Donald Trump took office for a second term, the year started with the U.S. Supreme Court hearing oral arguments from biofuels and petroleum industry groups on the proper court to hear court challenges to small-refinery exemptions to the RFS. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

The Supreme Court ruled later in the year that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was indeed the proper venue. It was considered a win for biofuels because it is expected to bring consistency to future cases.

Unlike the first go-round with the Trump administration that saw the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant numerous SREs without considering how it affected the RFS, the second Trump administration decided to take a different approach.

The administration released proposed RFS volumes for 2026 and 2027 that gave a significant boost to renewable diesel volumes. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…) That proposal sparked a jump in the soybean futures price.

In August 2025, the Trump administration granted full exemptions on 63 small-refinery exemption petitions, partial exemptions for 77 and denied 28 others. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

The following month, the EPA proposed several options to reallocate biofuels gallons lost through SREs to other obligated parties including petroleum companies, also announcing the RFS volumes proposal could be further delayed because of the SRE issue. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

The first Trump administration took a lot of heat for granting more than 80 SREs without trying to reallocate biofuels gallons lost -- by some estimates at 4 billion gallons.

Also in September, the California Senate voted unanimously on a bill to sell E15 in the state for the first time. The legislation was later signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. The move opened a 600- to 800-million-gallon market for ethanol. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

E15 in California was welcomed news in a year that passed without federal lawmakers addressing national E15 legislatively.

Despite repeated calls from biofuels groups, the Trump administration did not provide additional tax guidance on the 45Z Clean Fuels Production tax credit as companies continued to wait for certainty on their investments in sustainable aviation fuel. (https://www.dtnpf.com/…)

Even with a lack of 45Z certainty, companies like Summit Carbon Solutions continued to move on to next steps in building a carbon pipeline to connect to nearly 50 ethanol plants across the Midwest.

Summit not only announced that it hired Joe Griffin as a new chief executive officer, but Griffin then launched a campaign to improve relationships with landowners along the future path of the pipeline. The pipeline is considered an important avenue to help ethanol companies lower their carbon footprint enough for ethanol to be considered a good feedstock for SAF production.

The Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) confirmed on Thursday that all facilities and industrial areas under its jurisdiction are state-owned. The $200m figure previously cited represents the project’s investment costs rather than a purchase price for the land, the authority said in a statement issued via the cabinet’s media centre.

The government said the project will generate both direct and indirect returns, including land usufruct fees, Sokhna port handling charges, and administrative fees. Indirect benefits include the procurement of local raw materials, the involvement of Egyptian construction firms, and the creation of thousands of direct jobs for Egyptian workers.

“The land for the Al Mana Holding project… is granted to the company under the usufruct system, as is customary with the authority’s other investment contracts, without ceding any part of it,” the SCZone stated.

The authority also clarified that tax and customs exemptions granted to the project are standard investment incentives provided under the SCZone law for special economic zones, rather than specific concessions for a single investor.

Regarding the project’s commercial viability, the statement noted that Al Mana had secured an agreement with Shell to supply its entire production output prior to signing the contract with the SCZone. This arrangement was based on extensive financial studies to ensure marketing and return on investment.

The SCZone highlighted that Sokhna was selected due to the integration between the industrial zone and the port—recently recognised by Guinness World Records as the world’s deepest man-made port basin. The location serves as a pivotal gateway to the Red Sea and Africa, reducing production and transport costs for target markets.

Agreement highlights how airlines are using long-term SAF supply partnerships to manage decarbonization risk amid tightening global aviation climate policy

A multi-region SAF rollout for a global airline network

Cathay Group has entered into an agreement with Neste to supply sustainable aviation fuel across three of the world’s most strategically important aviation markets, marking a step change in how large international carriers are scaling SAF use beyond single-airport pilots.

Under the agreement, Neste supplies Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ for Cathay Group’s aviation operations in Europe, the United States, and Asia-Pacific. The fuel is already being delivered in blended form into airport fuel systems, allowing it to be used directly on scheduled flights without operational disruption.

In Europe, blended SAF is being supplied for Cathay Pacific flights departing from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. In the United States, Neste has been delivering SAF for Cathay Pacific operations at Los Angeles International Airport. In Asia-Pacific, the fuel is supplied into Singapore Changi Airport’s fuel facilities for flights operated by Air Hong Kong, the Cathay Group-owned all-cargo airline.

By convincing multiple airports and fuel systems to support SAF blending for its operations, Cathay is moving beyond symbolic adoption and into repeatable, scalable use across its long-haul network.

Why SAF remains the airline industry’s primary lever

For aviation, where near-term electrification remains unviable for long-haul routes, SAF is widely viewed as the most practical solution available today for cutting lifecycle emissions. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent over the fuel’s life cycle compared with conventional fossil-based jet fuel.

Neste’s SAF is produced from renewable waste and residue raw materials, including used cooking oil and animal fat waste. It is certified for commercial use and can be blended up to 50 percent with conventional jet fuel. Crucially for airlines under cost and operational pressure, it works with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure.

This compatibility allows airlines to decarbonize incrementally while avoiding capital-intensive fleet or infrastructure overhauls, a key consideration as regulatory pressure rises in Europe, North America, and parts of Asia.

Corporate commitments meet fuel supply reality

For Cathay Group, the agreement reflects a strategy focused on embedding SAF into daily operations rather than relying on limited-volume showcase flights.

“Partnering with Neste marks a significant step toward our shared vision of decarbonizing air travel. This collaboration is among our multifaceted strategy in accelerating the adoption of SAF within our extensive network, which reinforces our commitment to innovation and sustainability, ensuring we deliver meaningful impact for our customers and the air transport industry. SAF continues to play an important role in our decarbonization journey as the most viable solution today for addressing emissions associated with flying,” said Kristof Van Passel, Head of Procurement Operations & Sustainability at Cathay Pacific.

From Neste’s perspective, the agreement demonstrates how global SAF production capacity can be translated into real-world airline usage across continents.

“Neste is proud to support Cathay Group in its journey to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by supplying Neste MY SAF. Our global SAF production and supply capabilities offer international airlines, such as Cathay, a viable option to scale up usage of SAF, which is a key lever to reduce aviation related emissions. At the same time it enables Cathay’s customers to reduce the GHG emissions of their air travel and transport activities,” said Mario Mifsud, Vice President Renewable Fuels Sales & Trading EMEA & APAC at Neste.

Supply scale and policy alignment

Neste’s global SAF production capacity currently stands at 1.5 million tons per annum and is expected to increase to 2.2 million tons by 2027. That scale is becoming increasingly relevant as governments introduce blending mandates and emissions reporting requirements for aviation fuel.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation sets binding SAF blending targets for airlines operating in the region. Similar policy discussions are underway in the US and Asia-Pacific, creating both compliance risk and strategic opportunity for carriers able to secure reliable SAF supply early.

For investors and airline executives, the Cathay-Neste agreement illustrates how fuel procurement is becoming a core climate governance issue. Long-term SAF access is no longer a branding exercise but a hedge against regulatory tightening, carbon pricing exposure, and future fuel scarcity.

As aviation faces intensifying scrutiny over its climate footprint, multi-region SAF supply agreements like this one are emerging as a defining feature of credible airline decarbonization strategies.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Neste-Supplies-SAF-To-Cathay-Group-Across-Europe-US-And-Asia-Pacific.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 14:57:50.627904

The recognition came after a comprehensive evaluation by a team of international sustainability experts of the local organising committee’s efforts to reduce the event’s environmental impacts and maximise their social and local economic benefits.

The WCH Tokyo 25 was only the third event to achieve the top level of the evaluation system since it was implemented in 2024, and the first edition of a World Athletics Championships to do so.

“From the outset, the local organising committee made reducing the environmental impact of these championships and maximising their social impact a top priority,” World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said. “They did so by having a strong vision and clear objective to create a sustainability template that all sporting events, not just athletics, can follow. The Tokyo team has set a high bar for future World Championships.""

The local organising committee of the WCH Tokyo 25 were the first outdoor World Athletics Championships host to fully adopt the ABW Standard and its 55 action areas. The WCH Tokyo 25 sustainability plan, created in alignment with the standard, charted a path towards platinum level certification, and with it, the creation of what organisers have dubbed ‘The Tokyo Model’, a new global benchmark for delivering an environmentally and socially responsible international sports event.

”We are deeply proud that the sustainability initiatives of the World Athletics Championships Tokyo 2025 have been highly recognised by World Athletics, achieving the highest platinum level under the Athletics for a Better World Standard,” said Mitsugi Ogata, President of the WCH Tokyo 25 local organising committee. “This achievement is the result of close collaboration among the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the Japan Association of Athletics Federations, sponsors, and all those who contributed to delivering a sustainable event.”

A focus on renewable energy sources and biofuels

Biofuels powered 100% of the temporary generators used to provide power for broadcasters, a first for a World Athletics Championships. Additionally, all electricity purchased for the championships was either supplied from renewable energy sources or guaranteed through certified energy certificates.

All cars, compact shuttles and motorcycles from the official vehicle fleet provided by World Athletics Partner Honda were either electric, hybrid or fuel cell (green-powered hydrogen) powered, another first for a World Athletics Championships. Biofuels also powered the temporary power generators at the training venues and some of the transportation fleet used to transport athletes. That too was a first.

Almost all of the spectators used public transportation to reach the National Stadium, further reducing the event’s carbon footprint.

Innovation on show, sharing sustainability stories

Organisers used the event to showcase locally-developed sustainable innovation, initiatives that also contributed to the championships’ sustainability legacy.

The hub of that activity was the LOC tent in the Stadium park, which featured displays explaining and sharing the event’s sustainability programme. Nearly 20,000 spectators visited the tent over the course of the championships.

The area was used to demonstrate practical applications of Next-Generation Solar Cells, a solar power technology developed in Japan. The cells are 20 times thinner than regular solar panels and can be plastered over stadiums, airports and office buildings, enabling mass adoption to solar power across large parts of the country. Lights, powered by the cells, were installed along the spectator route from the train station to the stadium and remained in place after the championships.

Another popular draw were the sustainability quizzes and giveaways hosted by athletes and athletics legends. More than 1000 spectators attended those seven activations.

Organisers communicated their sustainability initiatives widely through campaigns targeting specific themes and through a looped video shown on dozens of screens throughout the stadium.

Sustainable aviation fuel awareness and supply chain campaign

In alignment with its ‘Zero Emissions Tokyo by 2050’ targets, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government launched a used cooking oil collection project in 2023 that encourages businesses and communities to help build a supply chain for domestically produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a type of biofuel usually made from food and feed crops, waste oils and fats. When more widely implemented, use of SAF can ultimately reduce the carbon emissions of aviation fuel by up to 80% over its lifecycle.

The mascot RikuOne and Haruka Kitaguchi, the 2023 world javelin champion, helped promote the campaign.

Local sourcing and waste reduction

A dedicated sustainable procurement policy was developed, with World Athletics guidance, to inform all sourcing decisions, prioritising environmentally responsible products when available. Some highlights:

• 450,000 single-used plastic bottles, more than 10 tonnes, were recycled through a circular ‘Bottle to Bottle’ recycling system, developed in cooperation with event sponsor Otsuka Pharmaceuticals

• 81% of the products used at the event were sourced within 100km

• All catered meals at VIP areas and in the team hotels featured vegan and vegetarian options, focusing on locally and regionally-sourced food

• Food loss was reduced through the rigorous assessment and optimisation of the number of meals provided, as well as through measures such as the composting of discarded food materials

The policy also included reuse and repurposing initiatives that engaged with various community and regional groups.

Other initiatives included a plogging event organised by event sponsor Morinaga, several Kids Athletics activations in the build-up to the event, training and announcements related to sustainability for the LOC staff and volunteers and cultural sensitivity training for the event's 3000 volunteers, and athletics participation programmes that reached thousands of local elementary school students.

A comprehensive sustainability report, providing insight and analysis of the LOC's sustainability impact, will be published soon.

Ogata added: ""The strong message of integrating sports and sustainability conveyed during this championship will remain a significant legacy of the event. Initiatives such as SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), next-generation solar cells ‘Air Solar’, the use of biofuels and low-emission vehicles, as well as bottle-to-bottle recycling and plogging, are believed to serve as a model for future sporting events. Encouraged by this recognition, we are committed to carrying this legacy forward into the future.”

About the Athletics for a Better World Standard

The centenary year is not a time for looking back but for pushing forward with its net zero targets. The airline has made progress on electrifying its ground operations, improved fuel efficiency and reduced waste across its operations.

The Atlanta-based carrier surpassed its near-term fuel savings goal, delivering more than 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings from operational improvements in the first quarter alone. This achievement not only saves Delta more than US$125m but also advances its pursuit of net zero emissions.

A key part of this success comes from Delta's cross-enterprise Carbon Council, which implements measures including on-board weight reduction, optimised aircraft speed and new landing procedures.

Compared to current regional aircraft designs, Maeve's aircraft aims to cut fuel consumption and emissions by up to 40% using conventional jet fuel. Further lifecycle emissions reductions could be possible when using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design, enhance operational efficiency, elevate employee and customer experiences and cut emissions,” says Kristen Bojko, Vice President of Fleet at Delta Air Lines.

Earlier in the year, Delta also partnered with aerospace startup JetZero. The airline is providing operational expertise through its Sustainable Skies Lab to support the development of a blended wing-body (BWB) aircraft.

This futuristic-looking plane is expected to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than the average aircraft in operation today.

Innovative technology and efficiency gains

Delta's focus on innovation extends beyond new aircraft models. Delta renews its collaboration with Airbus to test fello'fly, a flying technique inspired by migrating geese. By pairing flights so one aircraft can benefit from the uplift created by another, the practice could reduce fuel consumption by 5% on long-haul flights, according to Airbus.

The airline also added MicroTau, an Australian aerospace technology company, to its Sustainable Skies Lab. MicroTau creates an external cladding for planes that mimics shark skin to reduce drag and save fuel. The startup estimates the technology, which can be applied to a plane’s fuselage, wings and tail, may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.

Further initiatives include the testing of finlets on the rear fuselage to reshape airflow and reduce drag. Delta also finalised the modification of the split-scimitar winglet upgrade on its 737-800 fleet this year, marking the completion of adding advanced winglet technology to all existing fleets that can be modified.

Scaling SAF and electrifying ground operations

While new aircraft and technologies mature, Delta continued to focus on measures within its immediate control. The airline says it is on track to increase its usage of SAF by 50% compared to last year.

In 2025, a collaboration with Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland saw the first-ever commercial-scale delivery of SAF to Portland International Airport. According to Airbus, SAF can reduce an airline’s emissions by up to 80%.

On the ground, Delta partnered with Green Taxi Aerospace to explore electric taxiing technology. This innovation aims to reduce fuel use, operating costs, taxi time and carbon emissions during the ground phase of flight operations.

The year also saw the airline replace plastic cups with paper alternatives across its entire operation and open new facilities at Seattle-Tacoma International with sustainability in mind, featuring smart windows and all-electric energy with motion-sensing lights.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/535c1631ecc9f90b593e8eede5b4306b:36f6d59fbd9edb96884780e4d467d2bc/gettyimages-1294131568.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 09:58:56.264730

(NYSE:JOBY), a company developing electric air taxis for commercial passenger service, today announced its support for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) National Strategy, as well as its intent to immediately engage on key recommendations. The Strategy provides a clear policy roadmap for AAM deployment and integration across workforce, infrastructure, safety and data sharing.

“This strategy is tangible proof that the U.S. government recognizes the value of the AAM industry, and it comes as we’re preparing for early air taxi operations in U.S. cities through the eIPP program, created by an Executive Order this summer. It’s a powerful signal that our federal government, in coordination with state, local and tribal communities, is prepared to usher in the next generation of U.S. leadership in aviation,” said JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO of Joby.

Congress passed the “Advanced Air Mobility and Coordination Act” in 2022 to ensure federal agencies work in coordination on investments necessary for the maturation of the AAM ecosystem in the United States. The DOT, under Secretary Duffy’s leadership, subsequently brought together at least 19 federal agencies and departments to develop and publish this Strategy. The Strategy fosters innovation, ensures safety, and promotes cohesion across the federal government to shape the future of air transportation in the United States.

It also comes as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and DOT look to execute the Electric Vertical Take Off and Landing (eVTOL) Integration Pilot Program (eIPP) starting in 2026. eIPP supports eVTOL use cases across the country ahead of FAA Type Certification, such as proving routes for operations. The eIPP’s near-term operations and the Strategy’s policy recommendations empower regulators, communities and industry alike to move forward in lockstep.

Joby’s advanced progress towards certification and operational maturity uniquely positions the company to immediately engage on the Strategy’s core recommendations:

Leverage Existing or Repurposed Infrastructure: Joby’s operational strategy has always focused on using a blend of existing and new infrastructure to deploy its air taxi services. The Strategy’s emphasis on facilitating the use of “existing or repurposed infrastructure for near- and medium-term AAM operations” directly aligns with Joby’s plan to initiate commercial services without requiring significant upfront investment in infrastructure.

Data Sharing with Respective Government Agencies: Joby has led the industry’s regulatory path, becoming the first eVTOL company to finalize its certification blueprint (G-1) with the FAA, and is now entering the final stages of validating all necessary design, flight and manufacturing data. Combined with flying over 50,000 miles - including 850 flights in 2025 and operating test flights within the National Airspace System - means Joby has a significant amount of data needed for the Strategy.

Building the Workforce: Careers in aviation unlock opportunities for economic mobility and Joby has been actively engaged in building a skilled AAM workforce here in the United States. The company employs more than 2,000 people globally, including through Joby’s apprenticeship program. Joby’s manufacturing workforce continues to grow at the company’s scaled production site in Dayton, Ohio and its pilot production line in Marina, California. Through its aviation academy, the company is also building a talent pipeline of pilots and aircraft mechanics. The Strategy’s focus on developing workforce pipelines, including leveraging military experience, supports Joby’s integrated manufacturing and operating strategy, as well as its development of dual-use technologies for U.S. defense.

Autonomy & Safety: The commitment to developing an aviation autonomy roadmap aligns with work already underway at Joby. Joby’s Superpilot™ autonomous flight technology, validated over thousands of flight miles, provides critical operational data to advance the Strategy’s goals for increasingly autonomous and scaled operations. In addition, Joby has participated in two simulations with the FAA and NASA to validate integration of eVTOL operations using existing air traffic control procedures into the National Airspace System around Los Angeles International Airport, Dallas Love Field and DFW airports.

The Administration’s roadmap comes at a moment of unprecedented validation for Joby. In 2025, Joby’s flight test program spanned three countries, including operations at the World Expo in Osaka, Japan, extreme-environment testing in the United Arab Emirates, and public airport-to-airport missions in California. With its aircraft now advancing into the final stage of FAA certification, and pre-certification demonstration programs launching next year, 2026 is set to be an inflection point.",https://www.asdnews.com/NewsImages/b/95206/103141_O.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 10:57:23.299837

The aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In this context, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) have emerged as a critical alternative to conventional jet fuels. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of SAF technologies from a chemical engineering perspective, highlighting key production routes, technological maturity levels, and implementation challenges. A bibliometric analysis using the Scopus database and VOSviewer software was conducted to identify research trends and thematic clusters in SAF literature. The analysis reveals a growing interest in advanced biofuels and physicochemical conversion technologies, particularly those supported by catalytic and thermochemical processes. Certified and emerging SAF pathways were examined with respect to their process efficiency, feedstock availability, and scalability. Additionally, the study explores the potential of Latin America as a strategic region for SAF development, considering its abundant biomass resources and ongoing pilot projects. This critical and holistic analysis aims to support researchers, engineers, and policymakers in understanding the current state and future directions of SAF technologies within the framework of chemical process design and optimization. Overall, Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) and Fischer–Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) are identified as the most mature and widely deployed SAF production routes, whereas Alcohol to Jet (ATJ), Synthesized Iso-Paraffins (SIP), and Direct Sugar to Hydrocarbons (DSHC) remain at earlier technological stages despite their long-term potential for feedstock diversification and reduced environmental impacts. The analysis also underscores Latin America, where abundant biomass resources, consolidated agro-industrial systems, and emerging SAF research initiatives create favorable conditions for future development and deployment.

1. Introduction

Air transport plays a fundamental role in the global economy by facilitating connectivity between regions, international trade, and tourism. However, its exponential growth has raised increasing concerns about its environmental impact, particularly due to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other compounds that contribute to climate change [1]. Aviation is responsible for approximately 2–3% of global CO2 emissions, but its impact on global warming is greater due to the release of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and the formation of contrails, which amplify radiative forcing [2,3]. In this context, the transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) has emerged as one of the most promising strategies to reduce the sector’s carbon footprint [4].

Recent assessments by the International Energy Agency (IEA) provide more detailed insight into aviation’s climate impact. In short-haul flights, aircraft emit approximately 0.25 kg of CO2 per passenger-kilometer, while long-haul flights emit around 0.20 kg due to improved operational efficiency over longer distances [5]. Beyond CO2, high-altitude emissions of NOx, water vapor, and particulate matter enhance radiative forcing, significantly increasing the warming effect associated with aviation activities [3].

When compared to other modes of transport, aviation remains considerably more carbon intensive. Private vehicles typically generate 0.12 to 0.20 kg of CO2 per passenger-kilometer, while buses emit between 0.05 and 0.10 kg. Maritime transport, which moves a large portion of global freight, exhibits much lower emissions per tonne-kilometer, generally ranging from 0.03 to 0.04 kg of CO2 [6]. These differences highlight the disproportionate climate impact of aviation and have intensified concerns regarding the decarbonization of the sector in the context of global climate commitments such as the Paris Agreement [2,7].

SAF includes various technologies and feedstocks, ranging from second and third-generation biofuels to synthetic fuels produced through carbon capture and water electrolysis. Despite significant advances in research and development, large-scale adoption of these fuels faces technical, economic, and regulatory challenges [8]. SAF production continues to be more expensive than conventional fossil fuels, and availability is limited by infrastructure constraints and the absence of a unified international regulatory framework [9].

To be used in commercial aviation, biofuels must comply with strict quality and safety standards established by international organizations. The primary certification for SAF is ASTM D7566, developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), which defines specification requirements and certification processes before SAF can be blended with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 fuel. This standard ensures chemical equivalence with current aviation fuels and enables their use without modifications to aircraft engines or fuel handling systems. In addition, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) [10,11] and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) [12] have established guidelines to ensure the sustainability and verified carbon reduction in SAF throughout their life cycle.

Although research on SAF has expanded in recent years, much of the existing literature remains distributed among studies that analyze isolated topics such as specific conversion pathways, environmental assessments, or policy frameworks [13,14]. This dispersion highlights the value of consolidating these elements from a chemical engineering perspective. At the same time, growing interest in low-carbon fuels across Latin America, combined with the region’s abundant biomass resources and established agro-industrial infrastructure, presents a strategic opportunity for the expansion of SAF production. Recent initiatives, such as Ecopetrol’s efforts to produce SAF at the Cartagena Refinery using recycled oils, including used cooking oil and palm-oil-derived feedstocks supplied by Ecodiesel and other Colombian small and medium-sized enterprises [15], demonstrate the region’s potential to position Latin America as an emerging contributor to the global SAF landscape.

Latin America also offers a significant advantage due to its extensive biomass availability, agricultural capacity, and expanding research activity. Regional assessments indicate that Latin America could sustainably generate approximately 19.9 EJ (exajoules) of biomass annually, a quantity that corresponds to more than 3 billion barrels of oil in energy terms [16,17]. This potential aligns with global research trends that show increasing regional participation in SAF-related studies, especially in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, where interest in alternative aviation fuels has grown alongside broader sustainability objectives.

In addition to resource potential, the region has implemented concrete initiatives that demonstrate early industrial readiness. Brazil has advanced research and pilot-scale projects involving technologies such as ATJ and Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) using sugarcane ethanol, soybean oil, and other agro-industrial residues [18]. Paraguay’s Omega Green project, which is the first commercial-scale SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil plant in South America, illustrates the feasibility of exporting sustainable fuels derived from regional feedstocks [19]. Colombia has also completed successful test flights with SAF blends and is exploring the development of a dedicated production facility supported by private-sector interest in expanding HEFA-SPK capacity [20]. These initiatives underscore Latin America’s emerging role in the global transition toward SAF and reveal opportunities to leverage regional feedstocks, infrastructure, and public–private collaboration.

Therefore, this study aims to analyze SAF production technologies through a bibliometric approach, consolidating scattered information and identifying trends, technological developments, and existing challenges from a chemical engineering perspective. The analysis highlights the most promising conversion routes, evaluates their technical feasibility, and examines factors influencing their adoption at a global level. It also considers regional opportunities, with particular emphasis on Latin America’s emerging role in SAF production. Ultimately, the findings may support the development of strategies to optimize SAF production and facilitate their integration into the aviation sector, contributing to a more sustainable air transport model.

2. Materials and Methods

The Scopus database was used to retrieve documents related to SAF. Data collection took place on 24 January 2025, through a systematic search in the fields of article title, abstract, and keywords. The search was refined to include only articles and reviews, covering the period from 2004 to 2024. This process resulted in a total of 2418 records, comprising 1873 articles and 545 reviews.

The search equation used was: (TITLE-ABS-KEY: (“Sustainable Aviation Fuel” OR “Biofuels” OR “Synthetic Fuels” OR “Renewable Jet Fuel” OR “Green Aviation Fuel” OR “SAFS”) AND (“production technology” OR “production process” OR “synthesis method”)).

Once retrieved, the data, including citation details, bibliographical information, abstracts, keywords, and funding information, were exported to Microsoft Excel® for further organization and analysis. VOSviewer 1.6.20 [21] was used to visualize and process the data.

These clusters highlight the diverse approaches explored by researchers, ranging from first-generation biofuels to advanced conversion technologies. Each cluster is characterized by specific keywords that indicate the predominant research focus in that area. The following sections provide a detailed overview of each cluster, outlining the main topics and trends observed in the scientific literature.

3.2. Classification of Technologies for Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Table 1 provides a structured classification of SAF technologies based on their production method, feedstock, development stage, application in aviation, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, and emission reduction relative to Jet A1. Conventional Jet A1 fuel, derived from fossil-based crude oil, is included as a reference point with life cycle emissions of 89 g CO2eq/MJ [22]. In contrast, alternative SAF technologies exhibit significantly lower emissions and varied levels of technological maturity.

Fischer–Tropsch (FT) and FT-SPK pathways are classified as commercial technologies, reflecting their established deployment and integration into current fuel supply chains. HEFA also appears as a fully commercial route, supported by its compatibility with existing infrastructure and a consistent supply of lipid-based feedstocks [23,24]. The ATJ and Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet (CHJ) processes are at commercial or pilot/commercial stages, indicating active efforts in scale-up and early market penetration, particularly with biomass-derived ethanol and used cooking oil as feedstocks.

In contrast, technologies such as Dimethylcyclooctane (DMCO), Power-to-Liquid (PtL), and Direct Air Capture (DAC)-based routes remain at the pilot or research/demonstration stages. These pathways, while showing high emission reduction potential (up to ~90%), face current limitations related to feedstock processing, CO2 capture, renewable hydrogen supply, and economic feasibility. SAF from microalgae is likewise in early development due to ongoing challenges in biomass productivity and conversion efficiency [14,25].

Overall, Table 1 highlights the diversity of SAF production pathways not only in terms of feedstock and conversion technologies but also in their environmental performance and technological readiness. This comparative view underscores the coexistence of mature, commercially viable options alongside emerging routes with high potential but requiring further research, demonstration, and policy support to reach large-scale implementation.

3.3. Opportunities and Challenges in Biofuel Technologies

Lau et al. (2024) reported that the assessment of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is a valuable tool to classify the maturity of each technological pathway for SAF production [26]. TRL is a standardized scale ranging from 1 to 9, where TRL 1 refers to the observation of basic principles, and TRL 9 corresponds to a technology that has been proven in an operational environment. Among the reviewed technologies shown in Table 2, HEFA stands out with a TRL of 9, indicating full commercial maturity and certification by ASTM International, under standards such as ASTM D7566. FT-SPK fuels are also highly mature (TRL 6–8), with ongoing commercial use [26].

In contrast, technologies like CHJ (TRL 4–6), DMCO (TRL ~4), and microalgae-derived SAF (TRL 3–4) remain in early development stages, with limited demonstration and significant technical barriers [22]. The ATJ pathway (TRL 7–8) is approaching full deployment but still faces scale-up limitations. Finally, emerging concepts such as PtL and DAC integrated into SAF processes are estimated to range between TRL 4 and 6, depending on the specific configuration [27]. This classification provides a clear understanding of both current technological progress and the remaining challenges to achieve widespread implementation of SAF technologies.

The ASTM D7566 [28] standard is the primary international specification that governs the quality requirements for aviation turbine fuels containing synthesized hydrocarbons. These include several types of SAF produced through alternative pathways. The standard outlines the performance and compositional criteria that SAF must meet to ensure compatibility with existing aircraft engines and fuel systems.

Each approved SAF production pathway is included as a separate annex within ASTM D7566. For example, Annex A1 covers FT-SPK, Annex A2 covers HEFA-SPK, Annex A5 covers Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK), and Annex A6 covers CHJ. These annexes provide detailed technical specifications for the respective fuels, including blending limits, compositional requirements, and performance parameters.

Once a SAF is blended within the limits defined by ASTM D7566 and meets all required specifications, it can be reclassified as conventional jet fuel under ASTM D1655, the standard specification for Jet A and Jet A-1 fuels. This reclassification allows SAF to be used interchangeably with fossil-based jet fuel in commercial aviation without requiring modifications to aircraft engines or infrastructure.

This ability to reclassify SAF as conventional jet fuel under ASTM D1655 highlights one of the key attributes of certain SAF technologies: their drop-in nature. A drop-in fuel is defined as a synthetic or bio-based fuel that is chemically and physically compatible with petroleum-derived jet fuels, allowing it to be used in existing aircraft engines and fuel infrastructure without any technical modifications. Drop-in SAF can be blended with fossil-based Jet A or Jet A-1 fuels up to specific limits (typically 10% to 50%, depending on the certified pathway), while maintaining compliance with operational and safety standards. This compatibility significantly reduces logistical and regulatory barriers to SAF adoption, enabling gradual integration into the aviation fuel supply chain [29]. Technologies such as HEFA-SPK, FT-SPK, and ATJ-SPK are considered drop-in fuels under ASTM D7566 due to their demonstrated performance, blending behavior, and combustion properties within commercial aviation systems [23,30,31].

3.4. Trends in Biofuel Technologies: Emerging Innovations vs. Established Solutions

With the support of AI-based bibliometric analysis, Table 3 provides an overview of the most studied SAF technologies over the last decade. It includes both technologies that have already been implemented in the aviation sector and those that remain under development or exploration. Each entry in the table summarizes the production method, key countries or institutions leading research or deployment, the level of aviation implementation potential, as well as the main technical advantages and limitations associated with each pathway. Prominent technologies such as HEFA-SPK and FT-SPK stand out due to their ASTM certification and commercial deployment, while others like DSHC, SIP, and CH are still facing technical, economic, or regulatory barriers. This comparative synthesis serves as a strategic reference point for evaluating the maturity and scalability of SAF technologies in support of the aviation sector’s decarbonization efforts.

This comparative framework is particularly relevant when combined with the TRL classification presented in Table 1 and Table 2, as it enables the identification of technologies that, despite having a high technological readiness level, may still face practical or economic barriers to widespread adoption. For instance, FT-SPK and ATJ-SPK exhibit TRLs between 6 and 8 and are already ASTM-certified (Annexes A1 and A5 of ASTM D7566), yet their high capital cost, complex gasification processes (FT), and limited energy density (ATJ) continue to constrain large-scale deployment [30,31,37]. Conversely, some pathways at lower TRLs, such as CHJ or DSHC, demonstrate notable advantages in terms of feedstock flexibility, the use of wet biomass or sugar-derived intermediates, and potential for carbon circularity, but remain at early development stages (TRL 4–6) with limited industrial demonstration and no current ASTM approval [26]. These contrasting cases illustrate how the integration of technical maturity metrics with broader performance characteristics offers a more nuanced understanding of the opportunities and limitations across SAF pathways, as reflected in Table 2 and Table 3.

In reviewing the technological landscape presented in Table 3, it is evident that SAF research and deployment are currently concentrated in a few leading regions, notably the United States, European Union countries, and China. These regions host key institutions such as Gevo, Neste, Velocys, Sunfire, and Synfuels China, which are actively advancing both industrial implementation and technological innovation in pathways such as HEFA-SPK, FT-SPK, and PtL [26,31]. National and regional policies, coupled with strong research infrastructures and targeted investments, have significantly accelerated SAF development in these areas [30].

In contrast, Latin America remains underrepresented in terms of scientific publications and pilot-scale SAF initiatives, despite its favorable conditions, such as vast biomass availability, robust agricultural sectors, and growing interest in renewable energy. Countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico possess significant potential to develop and implement SAF technologies, particularly those based on bioethanol (e.g., ATJ) and lipid-based feedstocks (e.g., HEFA). However, the current lack of technological infrastructure, dedicated funding, and policy alignment limits the region’s contribution to global SAF innovation [13]. This gap underscores the need for greater regional collaboration, investment in R&D, and integration into international SAF initiatives to fully harness Latin America’s strategic bioresource advantages in the transition to sustainable aviation.

To complement the comparative insights offered in Table 3, Figure 8 provides a visual synthesis of SAF production pathways, beginning with categorized feedstocks and tracing their respective conversion routes through to potential aviation applications. Each connection reflects the specific type of conversion process, thermochemical, biological, hybrid, or electrochemical, applied to a given feedstock-technology pairing. Technologies that have achieved ASTM certification are linked to defined SAF blend limits (e.g., 50% or 10%), while those still in pilot or research phases are indicated as “Potential SAF” to denote their pre-commercial status. This integrated mapping highlights the diversity and interdependence of technological pathways and biomass sources, emphasizing how feedstock properties influence the conversion method and ultimate deployment viability. In doing so, Figure 8 serves as a strategic visual reference for understanding the alignment between resource availability, technological maturity, and SAF implementation potential.

3.5. Unlocking Regional Resources: SAF Production Opportunities in Latin America

Latin America represents a region of growing strategic importance in the development of SAF. Its favorable combination of agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and increasing environmental commitments offers a unique opportunity to position the region as a significant SAF producer. Several countries are currently advancing concrete projects that integrate local feedstocks, public–private partnerships, and emerging conversion technologies to accelerate SAF deployment.

In Panama, one of the most ambitious initiatives is the Golden City Biorefinery, led by SGP BioEnergy in collaboration with government stakeholders. Announced in 2022 and expected to begin operations by 2025, this facility is designed to become the world’s largest advanced biorefinery for SAF and renewable diesel. With an estimated production capacity of up to 180,000 barrels per day, the project aims to process multiple feedstocks, including waste oils and agricultural biomass, using HEFA and Fischer–Tropsch routes [39,40].

Brazil has consolidated its leadership in biofuel development by expanding into SAF production. National research institutes, such as FAPESP, have launched studies to enable ATJ and HEFA technologies using sugarcane ethanol, soybean oil, and animal fats. The country has conducted feasibility assessments for deploying SAF at scale, with technical validation aligned to international standards. Brazilian participation in multilateral initiatives like the Global Framework for SAF Deployment reflects both political and industrial readiness [41,42].

In Paraguay, the Omega Green project, led by ECB Group, constitutes South America’s first commercial-scale plant exclusively dedicated to SAF and HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) production. Located in Villeta and supported by a free trade zone agreement, the facility secured over USD 1.5 billion in investment. Construction has advanced since the agreement with the government, and the plant will process soybean oil, used cooking oil, and animal fats to serve European and North American markets. It is expected to begin operations in the short term [43,44].

Colombia has also made significant progress. In 2024, Ecopetrol successfully completed a test flight using SAF, marking a national milestone in sustainable aviation. The company announced plans to invest up to USD 700 million to develop a dedicated SAF production facility, expected to start operations by 2025 [43,44]. Additionally, private initiatives such as BioD are actively planning and constructing SAF plants that will utilize waste oils and fats through HEFA-SPK processes. These projects aim to contribute to national fuel mandates and position Colombia as a regional SAF supplier by 2030 [45,46].

Furthermore, several studies have assessed the potential for SAF deployment in Colombia. In particular, López Gómez et al. [20] performed a PESTEL based diagnosis that identified the main political, economic, technological, and environmental challenges, while highlighting sugarcane, palm oil, corn, and coffee residues as key feedstocks. Their recommendations stress the importance of coordinated research and development investment and supply-chain development to enable large-scale production and secure Colombia’s competitiveness in international markets.

These national initiatives reflect broader regional trends identified by international organizations such as IATA, which emphasize the role of Latin America in scaling up SAF production through second-generation feedstocks and flexible technology platforms. In combination with supportive policy frameworks and global demand for low-carbon fuels, these developments position the region as a strategic supplier for international aviation. However, to fully unlock its potential, Latin America must address challenges related to regulatory harmonization, infrastructure readiness, and financing mechanisms [47,48,49].

4. Conclusions

This study provides a comprehensive and integrated overview of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), highlighting the importance of adopting a multidisciplinary approach rooted in chemical engineering principles to accelerate their development and large-scale implementation. The bibliometric analysis conducted in this work shows that research on SAF has expanded considerably during the last decade, with a clear transition from general assessments to studies focused on advanced biofuels, catalyst improvement, process intensification, and system optimization. This shift reflects both the growing maturity of the field and the urgency to reduce emissions from the aviation sector in accordance with global climate commitments.

Within the technological landscape, HEFA-SPK and FT-SPK stand out as the most mature and widely studied routes. Both have achieved ASTM certification and demonstrate a level of technological readiness that enables commercial application. In contrast, pathways such as ATJ, SIP, and DSHC remain in earlier stages of development due to operational, catalytic, and economic limitations. Even so, these emerging routes possess long-term potential to diversify feedstocks, reduce environmental impacts, and expand SAF production capacity once their technical and economic barriers are addressed.

Chemical engineering plays a central role in optimizing SAF production. Advances in reaction engineering, thermochemical conversion, bioprocess integration, feedstock pretreatment, and heat and mass transfer can significantly enhance conversion efficiencies and reduce production costs. Complementing these advances with robust life-cycle and techno-economic assessment will be essential for guiding investment decisions and designing more sustainable and efficient fuel production systems.

The study also emphasizes the importance of regional strategies for SAF development. Latin America demonstrates considerable potential due to its abundant biomass resources, consolidated agro-industrial infrastructure, and growing research activity. Countries such as Brazil and Colombia illustrate how coordinated public and private initiatives can encourage pilot projects, certified test flights, and the establishment of early production capabilities. These experiences highlight the relevance of tailoring SAF strategies to regional feedstock availability, logistical conditions, and technological capacity.

In conclusion, the transition toward a low-carbon aviation sector depends not only on technological innovation but also on coordinated and sustained collaboration among academia, industry, and policy makers. Overcoming the current barriers to SAF adoption will require stable regulatory frameworks, economic incentives, investment in research and development, and the creation of reliable and sustainable supply chains. Advancing SAF from promising alternatives to widely accessible commercial fuels will depend on building integrated solutions that are technically feasible, economically competitive, and environmentally responsible.

Announced on 14 December, in the presence of the Egyptian prime minister, the new venture will include a new factory in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, Egypt's international investment magnet along the Suez Canal, the shortest link between Asia and Europe.

To be established by Qatar-based Al Mana Holding, a diversified conglomerate with interests across energy, automotive, and real estate, the new factory will cover more than 100,000 square metres.

The Qatari conglomerate will invest $200 million in the first phase of the project, with subsequent phases expected to reach $500 million.

Upon completion, the new factory is expected to be operational by the end of 2027 and produce 600,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel, utilising used cooking oil in its production.

Al Mana Holding has already secured a long-term deal with a major international energy company to purchase the factory's entire output, which will be exported to global markets.

This is the first Qatari investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, and it aligns with Egypt's green energy production ambitions.

It also highlights the growing economic and investment ties between Cairo and Doha, which economists say are warming at a critical time.

An ambitious plan

The new project could move Egypt a step closer to its goal of becoming an international hub for green energy production, according to experts.

The sustainable jet fuel produced by the new factory is expected to reduce harmful emissions by 50-80% compared with conventional jet fuel, according to Egyptian officials.

It also aligns with global aviation decarbonisation efforts and Egypt's push for export-oriented renewable fuel production, particularly from renewable sources, environmentalists said.

""Egypt has taken a series of measures in the past years to become an international green energy production hub,"" environmentalist Osama Abu Qura told The New Arab.

""The new factory contributes to these efforts, capitalising on what Egypt already has, including the human capital, production requirements and the ease to export output to foreign markets,"" he added.

Egypt plans to increase the share of renewables in power generation to 42% by 2030 and 60% by 2040, a significant jump from the current 12% share. Cairo's goal is to raise this share to 20% in 2025/2026.

Egypt also launched its National Strategy for Low-Carbon Hydrogen in 2024, aiming to become a global leader in green hydrogen production and export, targeting 5-8% of the tradable market by 2040.

Progress toward achieving those goals has been slower than expected due to grid and financing constraints, as well as past energy shortages. Nevertheless, international partnerships are accelerating implementation.

The factory will be established in the Integrated Sokhna Zone at Ain Sokhna on the Red Sea, an ideal location for the project due to its strategic, logistical, infrastructure, and policy advantages.

The zone is a prime logistics and export hub, located along the Suez Canal, which accounts for an average of 12% of global trade. The site also directly connects its industrial area to Sokhna Port, enabling easy import of feedstocks, particularly used cooking oil, which will be utilised to produce sustainable jet fuel and then exported to the international market.

Growing partnership

The new deal is part of billions of dollars in investment pledges from Doha to Cairo over the past months, reflecting a strengthening partnership.

These new investments build on broader economic cooperation between the two capitals, with total existing Qatari investments in Egypt reaching around $3.2 billion across a wide range of sectors, including finance, industry and tourism.

In April this year, Qatar pledged $7.5 billion in direct investments to Egypt during a visit to Doha by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

In November, Qatari Diar signed a deal to establish a luxury development in the Semla and Alam al-Roum areas on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, including residential areas, hotels, golf courses, marinas, and schools.

With a total value of $29.7 billion, the deal includes a $3.5 billion cash payment to the Egyptian government by the end of this December.

This avalanche of Qatari investments, observers said, reflects improving relations between Egypt and Qatar, a development that serves the best interests of both states.

""Such projects are very important for the [Egyptian] economy because they create jobs, bring in foreign currency and stimulate production,"" leading Egyptian economist Khaled al-Shafie said to TNA, citing ""remarkable"" investment opportunities in Egypt.

""Egypt stands at the crossroads of important markets in Africa and Asia,"" al-Shafie said. ""In the past decade, it also revolutionised its infrastructure, turning into a suitable environment for businesses of all types.""

""The two countries are developing a win-win model where Qatari money fuels Egypt's development,"" al-Shafie added.

He noted that, in return, Qatari companies benefit from Egypt's investment incentives and gain access to multiple markets through the preferential deals Egypt has signed with these markets.

""Egypt also possesses the largest market in the region, where a huge consumer base brings in assured profits for investors,"" he said.

The same investments come as Egypt struggles to overcome the toll that regional and international geopolitical developments are having on its economy.

Israel's war on Gaza and instability in the Red Sea have cost the Egyptian economy dearly, including the loss of revenues for the Suez Canal and tourism, amounting to over $13 billion during the two years of Israel's genocidal war.

Beyond economic cooperation, Cairo and Doha are also cooperating on many regional issues, including Gaza, where the two capitals partnered with the US to hammer out a ceasefire, albeit apparently one-sided, that took effect in mid-October between Hamas and Israel.

They are also cooperating with Washington to develop the controversial ""stabilisation force"" that will take over Gaza during the second phase of the deal.

This cooperation, Qatari political analysts say, is part of a changing regional landscape in which regional powers are finding ways to move beyond their differences and leverage their newfound amity to bolster regional stability and advance their own development interests.

""The regional landscape is undergoing swift change, the close Qatari-Egyptian cooperation being one of the most remarkable features of this change,"" Qatari political analyst Gaber Al Harami said.

Close political and diplomatic coordination between the two countries, he told TNA, also contributes to regional stability.",https://www.newarab.com/sites/default/files/styles/new_arab_overlay_medium_16_9/public/2216988426.jpeg?itok=uf7nMkqJ,N,,2025-12-18 07:56:43.391663

The US airline made progress in 2025 against its sustainability targets, through a series of strategic procurement decisions and supplier partnerships, aimed at improving efficiency and developing next-generation aircraft.

The carrier surpassed its near-term fuel savings goal, delivering more than 55 million gallons of jet fuel savings from operational improvements in the first quarter alone.

This achievement resulted in cost savings of over US$125m contributing to its net zero ambitions. These savings were a result of Delta's cross-enterprise Carbon Council, which implemented measures including onboard weight reduction, new landing procedures and drag-reduction technologies.

Strategic sourcing and efficiency measures

Delta's Carbon Council was instrumental in the fuel savings realised in 2025.

The council focused on several key operational areas, such as optimising aircraft speed and routing and using technology to track and minimise Auxiliary Power Unit usage between flights.

While the individual impact of these initiatives could be viewed as small, their collective effect has made a notable contribution to reducing Delta’s emissions.

To foster a culture of efficiency, the airline also introduced a “Green Station of the Year” programme. This initiative encourages employees to contribute to fuel-saving behaviours in their daily work, creating competition among frontline teams to identify and implement sustainability improvements.

Partnering for next-generation aircraft

A key part of Delta’s strategy involves investing in the future of aircraft design.

In March, the airline announced a partnership with aerospace start-up JetZero to support the development of its blended wing-body (BWB) aircraft.

This design is expected to be up to 50% more fuel efficient than many aircraft currently in operation. Through its Sustainable Skies Lab, Delta is providing operational expertise to help bring the BWB aircraft closer to commercial viability.

In September, a partnership was formed with Maeve Aerospace to expedite the development of hybrid-electric aircraft for regional flights. Maeve's aircraft aims to cut fuel consumption and emissions by up to 40% using conventional jet fuel.

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft we look to partners like Maeve who embody the forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta – solutions that advance aircraft design enhance operational efficiency elevate employee and customer experiences and cut emissions,” says Kristen Bojko, Vice President of Fleet at Delta Air Lines.

Delta also deepened its relationship with Airbus, testing a technique called fello'fly, where two aircraft fly in formation to improve fuel efficiency. According to Airbus, the practice can reduce fuel consumption by 5% on long-haul flights.

Innovative materials and SAF investment

Delta is also exploring novel technologies through its Sustainable Skies Lab.

The airline has added MicroTau, an Australian company that has created an external aircraft cladding that mimics shark skin to reduce drag.

MicroTau estimates the technology which can be applied to an aircraft's fuselage wings and tail may improve fuel efficiency by up to 4%.

Regarding fuel, Delta is on track to increase its use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 50% compared to last year.

In a 2025 project with Shell Aviation, Montana Renewables and the Port of Portland, the airline participated in the first-ever commercial-scale delivery of SAF to Portland International Airport.

According to Airbus, SAF can reduce an airline’s emissions by up to 80%. Acknowledging the current supply constraints, investments from airlines like Delta are crucial for scaling SAF production.

The airline’s focus this year has also been on procuring more than 35 sustainable aircraft, which on average are over 25% more fuel efficient per seat mile than the aircraft it has retired since 2019.

On the ground, Delta has switched to paper cups across its entire operation and opened new facilities at Seattle-Tacoma International, designed with sustainability in mind.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b9353d940f88d4abc637cedac4d8a49a:31f953c6fba549c6d858c596f7907842/delta-s-centennial-year-saw-the-airline-make-some-progress-against-its-net-zero-targets.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-18 07:56:47.558340

Before the extracted bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be purified of mainly nitrogen-containing interfering ions.
These unwanted ions would otherwise have a negative impact on the subsequent conversion into a sustainable aviation fuel.
Consortium leader Kienberger Marlene emphasises: “Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price.
The official project start date for “ToFuel: An integrated biorefinery for sustainable aviation fuel production from tomato residues” is 1 January 2026.","Waste from tomato processing will serve to power aircraft. Under the leadership of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), the EU project ToFuel is developing a new biorefinery concept that will convert tomato residues into sustainable aviation fuel as well as into fertiliser, animal feed and nutritional oil. The research team is aiming for a waste-free and climate-neutral process that is also economically competitive and thus makes an important contribution to the defossilization of air transport

Tomatoes are the second most consumed vegetable in the world after potatoes. The EU is the third largest producer with around 17 megatonnes of tomatoes harvested. However, tomato production produces large quantities of residual biomass – plant material such as flowers, leaves and stems, peel, seeds and tomatoes of inadequate quality. Most of these residues are incinerated as agricultural waste or disposed of at high cost. At the same time, the goal of European climate neutrality and the associated reduction of CO₂ emissions in the aviation sector is largely dependent on the production of competitive and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from renewable raw materials.

“According to estimates, around three per cent of the sustainable aviation fuels required in Europe by 2030 could be covered from the amount of tomato pomace produced throughout the EU, i.e. the residues from tomato processing,” explains project manager Kienberger Marlene from the Institute of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Technology at TU Graz.

In order to turn tomato waste into a high-quality fuel, the biomass must first be processed so that microorganisms can utilise it efficiently. ToFuel is investigating two modern fractionation technologies. During extrusion, the biomass is treated under heat and pressure and then broken down into its cellular components by an abrupt drop in pressure. This creates an optimally digested biomass for the subsequent fermentation process, in which microorganisms produce lipids that are later processed into aviation fuel. In the second fractionation technology, hydrothermal liquefaction, the biomass is converted into bio-oil and biochar under high pressure and at high temperatures. Before the extracted bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be purified of mainly nitrogen-containing interfering ions. These unwanted ions would otherwise have a negative impact on the subsequent conversion into a sustainable aviation fuel. The corresponding fractionation, biotechnological and purification processes are being developed by the Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia ( LNEG - Laboratorio de Energia ) in Lisbon, TU Graz and the University of Zagreb / Sveučilište u Zagrebu in close cooperation.

The processes developed in the project are gradually being scaled up to a pre-industrial scale and comprehensively tested. Consortium leader Kienberger Marlene emphasises: “Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price. Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuels simply have to be economically viable.”The project team is also analysing the ecological, economic and social impact of the technologies. The utilisation of tomato residues also creates new sources of income for food processing companies.

The official project start date for “ToFuel: An integrated biorefinery for sustainable aviation fuel production from tomato residues” is 1 January 2026. A total of eleven partners from seven European countries are working on ToFuel. In addition to TU Graz, these include the Portuguese research institute LNEG - Laboratorio de Energia , the University of Zagreb / Sveučilište u Zagrebu , Technische Universität Wien , LUT University in Finland, University of Leoben and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft . Industry partners Mutti and Podravka will provide tomato residues and contribute their many years of expertise in processing plant-based raw materials. The research will be accompanied by a comprehensive commercialisation and publication strategy, which will be developed by the project partners ESEIA - European Sustainable Energy Innovation Alliance and Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes - EEIP . At least six PhDs, twelve master’s and 15 bachelor’s students are to be trained as part of the project. The project budget amounts to 3.5 million euros over four years, one million of which will go to the consortium leader TU Graz.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQGgSf1pQDSIKQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B4EZsxE9fbKgAQ-/0/1766054944009?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=5XOaGXbSYiWaTHv8FqP30VjvV5sPPh7_1VvUCZEtrXo,N,,2025-12-18 06:58:52.565439

The Florida-based company, which calls this category “Private Class”, plans to operate using a fleet of Airbus A220-300s and A321neos.

The airline first launched back in October at NBAA-BACE 2025 in Las Vegas. Wade Black, a veteran in aviation, real estate, and luxury travel, will lead the airline as the chief executive alongside another seasoned aviation professional Sean McGeough who will be the airline’s chief development officer.

Talking to CJI at NBAA-BACE, McGeough elaborated the core concept behind Magnifica Air: “There’s a big white space between flying first and flying private, and we’re right in the middle. We’re going to redefine the category – we call it private class. It’ll be all the benefits of flying private: amazing cabins, concierge service, everything from black cars to great meals on board. It’ll be a privilege to fly again as opposed to a nuisance.”

Egypt has entered into a USD 200 million partnership with Qatar’s Al Mana Holding to establish a large-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in Ain Sokhna, within the Suez Canal Economic Zone on the Red Sea coast. The project underscores Egypt’s accelerating shift toward renewable energy, industrial sustainability, and export-oriented green manufacturing.

Developed over three phases on 100,000 square metres in the Integrated Sokhna industrial zone, the facility will convert used cooking oil into aviation fuel. The first phase alone is expected to produce 200,000 tonnes of SAF annually, positioning the project as one of the most ambitious clean aviation fuel initiatives on the African continent.

The agreement marks the first industrial investment by a Qatari company in the Suez Canal Economic Zone, highlighting deepening economic ties between Cairo and Doha. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly described the project as evidence of renewed momentum in bilateral relations, driven by political alignment and expanding economic cooperation. It follows Qatar’s recent announcement of USD 29.7 billion in investments in Egypt’s tourism and real estate sectors—the largest since diplomatic relations were restored after the 2017–2021 Gulf rift.

Beyond its bilateral significance, the SAF project places Egypt at the forefront of clean aviation fuel development in Africa. While countries such as Kenya, Ethiopia, and South Africa remain largely at pilot or feasibility stages—often focused on road-transport biofuels—Egypt is moving directly into commercial-scale production with defined capacity targets and strong international backing. Morocco, despite its advanced renewable energy base, remains more focused on green hydrogen than aviation fuel.

Egypt’s choice of the Suez Canal Economic Zone provides a decisive strategic advantage. Located along one of the world’s busiest maritime corridors and close to major international airports, the zone offers efficient logistics for exporting SAF to Europe, the Middle East, and across Africa. Comparable logistics ecosystems are largely absent elsewhere on the continent, where regulatory uncertainty or limited industrial infrastructure often constrains green fuel exports.

The project also reflects Egypt’s distinctive financing model. Rather than relying primarily on Western development banks or multilateral institutions, Egypt is increasingly leveraging Gulf capital from partners such as Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—allowing for faster capital deployment and fewer policy conditionalities than those faced by many African peers.

Egypt’s ongoing economic pressures, including rising external debt and fiscal constraints, have further accelerated reforms and openness to large-scale foreign investment. In this context, the SAF initiative aligns economic necessity with climate objectives, a balance that many African economies are still struggling to achieve at scale.

Taken together, the SAF agreement and parallel Qatari investments illustrate how Egypt is using energy, infrastructure, and industrial projects as tools of economic recovery and regional diplomacy. Compared with other African nations still laying the groundwork for energy transition, Egypt is already executing—positioning itself as a continental hub for sustainable aviation fuel and a leader in green industrial development.

Aviation Fuel Production from Tomato Residues: TU Graz Coordinates Visionary EU project

Susanne Filzwieser Kommunikation und Marketing

Technische Universität Graz

Residual biomass from tomato production is turned into climate-friendly aviation fuel. The aim of the EU ToFuel project is to develop a waste-free and CO₂-neutral biorefinery concept that produces sustainable and economically competitive aviation fuel.

Waste from tomato processing will serve to power aircraft. Under the leadership of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), the EU project ToFuel is developing a new biorefinery concept that will convert tomato residues into sustainable aviation fuel as well as into fertiliser, animal feed and nutritional oil. The research team is aiming for a waste-free and climate-neutral process that is also economically competitive and thus makes an important contribution to the defossilization of air transport.

Residual material as a valuable resource

Tomatoes are the second most consumed vegetable in the world after potatoes. The EU is the third largest producer with around 17 megatonnes of tomatoes harvested. However, tomato production produces large quantities of residual biomass – plant material such as flowers, leaves and stems, peel, seeds and tomatoes of inadequate quality. Most of these residues are incinerated as agricultural waste or disposed of at high cost.

At the same time, the goal of European climate neutrality and the associated reduction of CO₂ emissions in the aviation sector is largely dependent on the production of competitive and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) from renewable raw materials. “According to estimates, around three per cent of the sustainable aviation fuels required in Europe by 2030 could be covered from the amount of tomato pomace produced throughout the EU, i.e. the residues from tomato processing,” explains project manager Marlene Kienberger from the Institute of Chemical Engineering and Environmental Technology at TU Graz.

From plant to oil to aviation fuel

In order to turn tomato waste into a high-quality fuel, the biomass must first be processed so that microorganisms can utilise it efficiently. ToFuel is investigating two modern fractionation technologies. During extrusion, the biomass is treated under heat and pressure and then broken down into its cellular components by an abrupt drop in pressure. This creates an optimally digested biomass for the subsequent fermentation process, in which microorganisms produce lipids that are later processed into aviation fuel. In the second fractionation technology, hydrothermal liquefaction, the biomass is converted into bio-oil and biochar under high pressure and at high temperatures.

Before the extracted bio-oil can be refined into aviation fuel, it must be purified of mainly nitrogen-containing interfering ions. These unwanted ions would otherwise have a negative impact on the subsequent conversion into a sustainable aviation fuel. The corresponding fractionation, biotechnological and purification processes are being developed by the Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia (LNEG) in Lisbon, TU Graz and the University of Zagreb in close cooperation.

The lipids and bio-oil are then converted into a fuel that fulfils the international quality standards for sustainable aviation fuel using the HEFA process at the University of Leoben. HEFA stands for “hydrogenated esters and fatty acids” and is a process for producing sustainable aviation fuel from vegetable, animal or recycled fats and oils.

The processes developed in the project are gradually being scaled up to a pre-industrial scale and comprehensively tested. Consortium leader Marlene Kienberger emphasises: “Our clear goal is to produce sustainable aviation fuel based on tomato waste at a competitive sales price. Ultimately, sustainable aviation fuels simply have to be economically viable.” The project team is also analysing the ecological, economic and social impact of the technologies. The utilisation of tomato residues also creates new sources of income for food processing companies.

Strong European consortium

The official project start date for “ToFuel: An integrated biorefinery for sustainable aviation fuel production from tomato residues” is 1 January 2026. A total of eleven partners from seven European countries are working on ToFuel. In addition to TU Graz, these include the Portuguese research institute LNEG, the University of Zagreb, Vienna University of Technology, Lappeenranta University of Technology in Finland, University of Leoben and the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. Industry partners Mutti and Podravka will provide tomato residues and contribute their many years of expertise in processing plant-based raw materials. The research will be accompanied by a comprehensive commercialisation and publication strategy, which will be developed by the project partners ESEIA and EEIP. At least six PhDs, twelve master’s and 15 bachelor’s students are to be trained as part of the project. The project budget amounts to 3.5 million euros over four years, one million of which will go to the consortium leader TU Graz.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential unified commercial platform and strategic integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global, said, ""This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform - linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern's developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream's environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF's HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

""Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered - not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.""

Potential environmental-attribute monetization and digital infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform's low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (""LCA"") methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, chairman of DevvStream, said, ""Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths - XCF's production expertise, Southern's developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream's environmental-asset monetization capabilities - to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.""

Potential multi-pathway SAF collaboration and offtake framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern's planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern's in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF's HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, CEO of Southern, added, ""We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.""

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern's biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana's growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern's existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added, ""We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern's developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.""

I. GLOBAL

Conference of the Parties 30th annual meeting (COP30) plan to further global investment in climate action

From November 10 to November 21, 2025, nearly 200 countries participated in the United Nation’s (UN) 30th annual climate meeting, COP30 held in Belém, Brazil. For the first time since its convening in 1995, the United States was absent from the COP. Leaders from each country in attendance agreed on a few notable climate action initiatives, such as the Mutirão Decision and the Gender Action Plan, as reflected in the final outcomes report. The Mutirão Decision addresses financing and investment in climate-based initiatives, including calling for the tripling of adaptation finance by 2030 compared to 2025 levels. Two key provisions of this decision are the Global Implementation Accelerator, which aims to help countries implement adaptation plans, and the Belém Mission to 1.5, which is a platform designed to “foster enhanced ambition and international cooperation across mitigation, adaptation, and investment.” The Mutirão Decision also addresses the role of trade in climate action by calling for a dialogue with the World Trade Organisation, United Nations Trade and Development, and International Trade Centre to consider the “opportunities, challenges and barriers in relation to enhancing international cooperation related to the role of trade.” The Gender Action Plan contains provisions meant to address the ways in which climate change, as the UN Women organization states, “is not gender neutral.” This document aims to serve as a tool for governments, policymakers, and private parties that provide climate finance and anticipates that these parties will consider the unique risks women and girls experience from climate change and advance “gender-responsive climate policies,” including in the following areas: capacity-building and knowledge sharing, participation and leadership, implementation, and monitoring and reporting. Notably, criticism of COP30 was that while discussed, no agreement on the transition away from fossil fuels or halting of deforestation was adopted in the final text.

Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co. (Glass Lewis) publish updated proxy voting guidelines

On November 25, 2025, ISS published its 2026 U.S. Benchmark Policy Changes, which are effective for meetings on or after February 1, 2026. ISS made several changes related to executive compensation, non-employee director compensation, capital structures, and environmental and social shareholder proposals, among others. In particular, ISS’s U.S. policy updates include a change in approach to shareholder proposals: rather than generally recommending votes “for” certain environmental and social shareholder proposals, ISS will now make recommendations on a case-by-case basis. This change applies to proposals requesting disclosure of climate change-related risks; greenhouse gas emissions; diversity policies, initiatives, or workforce data; supplier or human rights policies; and political contributions and trade association policies and activities. The 2026 updates also make certain changes to the factors that ISS will consider when determining its voting recommendations for these proposals. As rationale for these changes, ISS cited feedback from clients, declining shareholder support, the changing regulatory landscape, changes in company practices, and improvement in company disclosures in the past few years. ISS’s global approach to these proposals has been and continues to be to generally recommend votes on a case-by-case basis considering a variety of factors focusing on whether “implementation of the proposal is likely to enhance or protect shareholder value.”

Glass Lewis recently published its 2026 Benchmark Policy Guidelines (GL 2026 Guidelines). The GL 2026 Guidelines include updates regarding pay-for-performance methodology, mandatory arbitration provisions in governing documents, amendments to a company’s governing documents, and shareholder proposals. With regard to shareholder proposals specifically, the GL 2026 Guidelines removed language indicating that Glass Lewis may “in certain very limited circumstances” recommend votes against members of a company’s governance committee if Glass Lewis believes that the company has omitted a shareholder proposal via the Rule 14a-8 no-action request process in such a way that exclusion “is detrimental to shareholders.” Instead, the GL 2026 Guidelines refer to recent changes in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) changed approach to shareholder proposals and note that Glass Lewis is monitoring the “SEC’s ongoing changes and their ramifications” and may update its voting guidelines “prior to or during the 2026 proxy season should its approach to these matters change or regulatory developments warrant such an update,” while noting that the “basic premise” of Glass Lewis’s policy is that “shareholders should be afforded the opportunity to vote on matters of material importance.” The GL 2026 Guidelines also removed discussion related to oversight of environmental and social issues, including language that indicated Glass Lewis would recommend votes against members of the board, in favor of shareholder proposals, and/or against management proposals if companies “have not provided for explicit, board-level oversight of environmental and social matters and/or when a substantial environmental or social risk has been ignored or inadequately addressed.”

The GL 2026 Guidelines have retained Glass Lewis’s policy regarding board diversity, including a reference to its March 2025 “Supplemental Statement on Diversity Considerations at U.S. Companies.” As described in our March 2025 ESG Update, while Glass Lewis’s policy expects diversity on companies’ boards (generally expecting 30% gender diversity and at least one director from an underrepresented community) and disclosure of individual or aggregate demographic information for directors, when recommending votes against a director related to diversity, Glass Lewis will offer clients two recommendations: “one that applies [the] Benchmark Policy approach as articulated in [the] 2025 Benchmark Policy Guidelines for the US Market, and one that does not consider gender or underrepresented community diversity as part of the recommendation.” However, this approach may evolve in light of the Executive Order discussed below.

II. UNITED KINGDOM

The Transition Finance Council launches its second public consultation

On November 3, 2025, the Transition Finance Council published new drafts of (i) the Transition Finance Guidelines (Guidelines); and (ii) the Implementation Handbook. It also published a Consultation Question and Update and launched a corresponding second public consultation on the drafts. This follows a first consultation that closed last September, as a result of which the drafts were updated to revise the universal factors so they are more streamlined and better capable of assessment, map the guidelines to the Net Zero Investment Framework, and clarify the relationship between entity-level transition finance consistent with the Guidelines and green and sustainability-linked bonds and loans, amongst others. The consultation is open until January 30, 2026 and welcomes feedback from a range of stakeholders, including corporate entities and asset owners and managers.

The UK Government publishes amendments to the draft packaging waste regulations

On November 3, 2025, the UK Government published the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging and Packaging Waste) (Amendment) Regulations 2025 (Amended pEPR Regulations). The pEPR Regulations require businesses that supply packaging or packaged goods to cover the costs of managing household packaging waste and providing disposal information, intended to ensure that a portion of packaging is recycled and verified. The Amended pEPR Regulations will enable the appointment of a producer responsibility organisation (PRO) to take on key operational functions, allow producers to offset food-grade plastic packaging waste against their disposal cost obligations in certain circumstances, and aim to remove loopholes and improve clarity. Such amendments are due to come into force on January 1, 2026.

On November 5, 2025, HM Treasury published its new financial inclusion strategy, setting out a national plan across six pillars to remove barriers to financial participation and build financial resilience. The strategy covers digital inclusion, access to banking, savings, insurance, and credit, tackling problem debt, and financial education, with review after two years. On November 28, 2025, the House of Commons Treasury Committee launched an inquiry into HM Treasury’s financial inclusion strategy and issued a call for evidence. Submissions are due by January 12, 2026.

On December 1, 2025, the Financial Conduct Authority published CP25/34 consulting on proposed regulation of ESG ratings providers, including requirements on transparency, governance and systems and controls, conflicts of interest, and stakeholder engagement. Responses are due by March 31, 2026, with final rules expected in the fourth quarter of 2026 and regulation applying from June 29, 2028.

On December 3, 2025, the Prudential Regulation Authority published PS25/25 confirming updates to its climate-related risks supervisory expectations, replacing SS3/19 with SS4/25. Changes include clarifying proportionality, recognizing litigation risk, clarifying the six-month review period, allowing integration into existing governance and risk registers, and a proportionate approach to climate scenario analysis.

Omnibus update: Omnibus trilogue in full swing as European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) revisions and reporting reliefs advance

Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD): After trilogue negotiations began on November 18, 2025, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU have now reached a political agreement on key elements of the Omnibus Simplification Package. The Council and the European Parliament have already confirmed the compromise. The final text still needs to be approved by the Council of the EU and will enter into force twenty days after its publication in the Official Journal. For further details please see our client alert.

Meanwhile, the European Commission’s “quick fix” Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1416 was published, providing transitional relief for Wave 1 companies. The regulation postpones certain ESRS disclosure requirements for the 2025 and 2026 financial years and extends phase-in provisions for complex topical standards such as biodiversity and social disclosures. This will allow Wave 1 companies to refrain from expanding their sustainability disclosures while the Omnibus Simplification Package is still under negotiations.

ESRS: On December 3, 2025, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) submitted its final technical advice on its draft of simplified ESRS to the European Commission, building on the Exposure Draft published on July 31, 2025 and the EFRAG Sustainability Reporting Board’s internal vote in late November 2025. The new ESRS aim to, among other things, simplify the materiality assessment, provide a stronger emphasis on usefulness of information, significantly reduce data points, and increase interoperability with the International Sustainability Standards Board. For further details, please see our latest client alert on this topic.

The European Commission indicated that it intends to review the draft and prepare its delegated act revising the original ESRS in the first half of 2026, with the applicability date of the new ESRS to be confirmed in the delegated act. The introductory wording in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1416 seems to suggest that the revised standards will only start to apply for the reporting period of financial year 2027.

EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) update: European Parliament adopts proposal to postpone and simplify the EUDR

Following a provisional political agreement between the Council of the EU and the European Parliament on December 4, 2025, the European Parliament adopted the agreed upon amendments on December 17, 2025, which include, among other things, the following:

All businesses will have one additional year to comply with the EUDR. Large operators and traders will be in scope starting December 30, 2026, and small operators starting June 30, 2027.

The EUDR’s due diligence requirements will be simplified, obliging only businesses who first introduce the relevant product into the EU market, and reducing obligations for micro and small primary operators which would now only have to submit a one-off simplified declaration.

Next, the text must be endorsed by the Council and published in the Official Journal of the EU. For the amendments to enter into force as intended, the final text must be published before the end of 2025. If not, the current EUDR deadlines will continue to apply.

In this context, a recent joint industry letter should also be noted, which expressed concerns about reopening or delaying the EUDR, emphasizing that many companies have already invested substantially in compliance preparation and warning that a postponement could undermine regulatory certainty and the EUDR’s environmental objectives.

Decision of Regional Court Berlin on climate neutral claims

In line with a recent decision from the German Federal Court of Justice, the Regional Court Berlin similarly held in a decision dated October 16, 2025 that a company’s climate neutral claims were misleading, as they were lacking disclosure of the extent of reductions and offsetting. Simply referring to offsetting measures was considered insufficient. Further, the court held that it is necessary that companies communicate about the scope, nature, and effect of their reduction measures. The ruling is not binding yet.

European Commission proposes new product categories and lighter disclosures under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)

On November 20, 2025, the European Commission released its proposal to amend the SFDR. The proposal aims to improve the identification and analysis of sustainability-focused investment products after a comprehensive review of the SFDR by the European Commission showed that, among other things, the current framework produces overly long and complex disclosures and increases the risks of greenwashing and mis-selling.

To address these issues, the proposal introduces three new categories for funds based on their sustainability or transition characteristics: Sustainable, Transition, or ESG Basic. The new categories are defined by the industries and activities a financial product must exclude from its portfolio and by its positive contribution, with at least 70% of the portfolio required to follow an ESG strategy aligned with the product’s category. Furthermore, the European Commission plans to reduce disclosure obligations for financial market participants, particularly streamlining product-level disclosures, by focusing on available, comparable, and meaningful data tied to the new fund categories.

Other highlights:

The EU Ombudsman has identified a series of shortcomings in the European Commission’s process to launch its “Omnibus” initiative, pointing to “maladministration” by the European Commission and criticizing, among other things, the lack of public consultation.

The European Parliament and the Council of the EU have reached a provisional agreement to introduce a new binding target in the European Climate Law to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040.

Currently, 18 of the 30 EU Member and EEA States have transposed the “Stop-the-Clock” Directive into national law, including Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. An overview of the current transposition status of the CSRD into national laws and the “Stop-the-Clock” process under the Omnibus Simplification Package can be found here.

U.S. officials and enforcers scrutinize proxy advisory firms’ influence over shareholder voting

On December 11, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing the SEC, Federal Trade Commission, and Department of Labor to take various actions “to end the outsized influence of proxy advisors that prioritize radical political agendas over investor returns.” The Executive Order specifically calls out ISS and Glass Lewis and alleges that that they “control more than 90 percent of the proxy advisor market.” While having no immediate impact on ISS and Glass Lewis, the Executive Order heightens the regulatory scrutiny of and pressure on proxy advisory firms’ practices and on the actions of their clients. For more information, see our client alert.

On November 12, 2025, media reports indicated that the Federal Trade Commission has opened a civil antitrust investigation into ISS and Glass Lewis, focusing on whether the firms’ practices constitute unfair methods of competition and how their recommendations impact shareholder votes, including on environmental and social shareholder proposals. The investigation reportedly examines the firms’ market position and competitive conduct in providing research, analysis, and voting advice to institutional investors.

On November 20, 2025, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier filed a complaint against ISS and Glass Lewis, alleging violations of state consumer protection and antitrust laws. According to the filing, the two firms “constitut[e] up to 97 percent of the market for proxy voting advice,” giving them “an astronomical impact on the American economy and corporate culture.” The complaint asserts that ISS and Glass Lewis have “used this enormous influence to push their own dogmatic agenda” and “controversial ideological mandates” rather than prioritize shareholder value. The filing also alleges coordinated conduct between ISS and Glass Lewis, asserting that the firms “agreed to move in lockstep, preventing competition and ensuring that neither will face competitive pressure.” The Attorney General seeks injunctive relief, damages, civil penalties, and other relief.

SEC Commissioner signals continued focus on “materiality only” in sustainability reporting

On November 21, 2025, SEC Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda delivered remarks at the U.S.–Japan Symposium organized by Harvard Law School’s Program on International Financial Systems. He stressed that sustainability or ESG-related disclosures should be required only when they are “financially material,” stating that non-financial policy metrics such as environmental policy issues should be reserved for environmental regulators, not financial regulators. Commissioner Uyeda reiterated that under the current U.S. disclosure framework, issuers must report climate or sustainability information only if it materially affects their business, financial condition, or operating results. He cautioned that imposing broader ESG mandates on corporate disclosure or stewardship regimes risks turning disclosure obligations into instruments for advancing “policy aspirations” and that doing so could blur the line between investor-relevant information and broader regulatory or political goals. The Commissioner’s remarks are consistent with prior comments, including those summarized in our May 2025 update.

Federal agencies advance deregulatory actions across water, wildlife, offshore leasing, and clean energy programs

Various federal agencies have continued to advance deregulatory actions, including the following:

On November 17, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps proposed a rule that would limit federal authority over wetlands and streams under the Clean Water Act by redefining key terms that affect the definition of “waters of the United States.” The proposed rule is intended to “cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act.” If finalized, the rule could significantly reduce the number of wetlands and bodies of water subject to federal permitting. The proposal is open for public comment until January 5, 2026.

On November 19, 2025, the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced four proposed rules that would reduce Endangered Species Act protections by reinstating aspects of the regulatory framework as they existed in 2019 and 2020. As summarized in the DOI’s announcement, the proposed rules revise “procedures and criteria used for listing, reclassifying, and delisting species on the Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants and designating critical habitat,” reinstate prior definitions and processes related to interagency cooperation, eliminate the “blanket rule” in favor of species-specific protections for threatened species, and return to the 2020 approach to “consideration of the economic impact, the impact on national security, and any other relevant impact of designating any particular area as critical habitat.” The proposed rules are open for public comment until December 22, 2025.

On November 20, 2025, the DOI announced a proposal for a new offshore leasing program that would authorize as many as 34 lease sales across approximately 1.27 billion acres of federal waters in Alaska, the Gulf of America, and the Pacific coast. The DOI announcement stated that the plan aims to “open new opportunities for offshore investment and job creation, reinforce America’s role as a global energy leader, and help ensure a stable and secure energy supply well into the future.” The proposal is open for public comment until January 23, 2026.

On November 20, 2025, the Department of Energy announced an organizational realignment that eliminates the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and replaces them with a new entity called the Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation. The realignment aims to reflect the “priorities of expanding American energy production, accelerating scientific and technological leadership, and ensuring the continued safety and readiness of the Nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile.”

Other highlights:

On November 25, 2025, Senator Ted Cruz introduced the Stop TSP ESG Act to “prevent professional asset managers who manage federal employee retirement funds from using those taxpayer dollars to push Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies through corporate shareholder votes.” The announcement clarifies that the bill is concerned primarily with proxy voting by BlackRock Capital Advisers and State Street Global Advisors.

On November 27, 2025, the Canadian federal government and the province of Alberta signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to “strengthen energy collaboration and build a stronger, more competitive, and more sustainable economy.” The MOU suspends the planned federal oil and gas emissions cap and exempts Alberta from the federal Clean Electricity Regulations and instead commits Alberta to advancing the development of a bitumen pipeline, negotiating a new carbon pricing agreement, and supporting development of “the world’s largest” carbon capture and storage project.

On November 18, 2025, Canadian Minister of Finance and National Revenue François-Philippe Champagne introduced Bill C-15 to the Canadian House of Commons for first reading. Among other things, if enacted, the bill would amend the greenwashing provisions under the Competition Act by removing “the requirement that the substantiation of representations about the environmental benefits of businesses or business activities must be done in accordance with internationally recognized methodology.”

On November 18, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit enjoined California’s new climate-related risk reporting law pending an appeal by a coalition of leading business organizations challenging its constitutionality in the ongoing legal proceeding, and on December 1, 2025, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) responded to the injunction by posting an enforcement advisory stating it would not enforce the law “against covered entities for failing to post and submit reports by the January 1, 2026, statutory deadline.” For more details, see our blog post here.

On December 9, 2025, CARB published its first proposed regulations for California Senate Bills 261 (on climate-related risk reporting) and 253 (on greenhouse gas emissions reporting) and issued a Staff Report explaining their proposed approach. A 45-day comment period will open December 26, 2025 and end February 9, 2026. This will be followed by a public hearing on February 26, 2026 at 9 a.m. PT to consider approving the regulations.

On November 18, 2025, the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance announced that it will not respond to most Rule 14a-8 no-action requests or express any views on companies’ intended reliance on any basis for excluding shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 for the 2025–2026 proxy season. For more details, see our client alert.

On December 3, 2025, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released a prepublication of its proposed new corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for light-duty vehicles for model years 2022 through 2031. The proposal also includes several significant revisions to the CAFE program. For more details, see our client alert.

Taiwan aligns sustainable bond framework with global standards

From November 24, 2025, Taiwan’s sustainable bond regime fully incorporates blue and biodiversity bonds under its green bond framework, aligning with the 2025 ICMA Green Bond Principles. Eligible categories include marine conservation, biodiversity protection, water resource conservation, waste recycling or reuse, development of renewable energy and energy technology, and other climate change adaptation projects or projects approved by the Taipei Exchange (TPEx), with several successful issuances already in the market. TPEx is actively encouraging issuers to explore these instruments as demand for nature-linked financing grows ahead of COP30 in Brazil.

Hong Kong issues record HKD 10 billion multi-currency digital green bonds with tokenized central bank money

On November 11, 2025, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government announced that it successfully priced its third batch of digital green bonds (HKD, RMB, USD, and EUR) under the Government Sustainable Bond Program, raising around HKD 10 billion (~USD $1.28 million), marking the world’s largest digital bond offering to date and the first digital bond offering that integrates tokenized central bank money (e‑HKD and e‑CNY) as a settlement option. The four tranches were priced on November 10 as follows: HKD2.5 billion (2-year, 2.5%), RMB2.5 billion (5-year, 1.9%), USD $300 million (3-year, 3.633%), and EUR300 million (4-year, 2.512%). The subscriptions across four currency tranches exceeded HKD130 billion from a broad base of global institutional investors. Proceeds will be used to finance or refinance projects under the HKSAR Government’s Green Bond Framework, reinforcing Hong Kong’s strategy to scale green and sustainable finance and position itself as a leading digital assets hub.

Key ESG initiatives unveiled at Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Capital Markets Forum

On November 6, 2025, the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), a high-level grouping of capital markets regulators from 11 ASEAN jurisdictions, introduced several key ESG-related initiatives, including an updated version of the ASEAN Simplified ESG Disclosure Guide for Small and Medium Enterprises, which has been refined to provide guidance to SMEs in preparing ESG disclosures, a roadmap for the development of interoperable, high-integrity carbon credit markets in the region, and an updated version of the ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, which serves as a reference point to guide capital and funding toward activities that help promote sustainability in the region.

In 2024, the airline, which had long struggled with heavy debt and relied on support from the Kenyan state, returned to profitability for the first time in more than a decade. The company said a 10% increase in capacity supported a 4% rise in traffic, bringing total passengers carried during the year to 5.23 million.

George Kamal, who brings more than 29 years of leadership experience in the aviation sector across the Middle East and Africa, now takes charge in an environment still shaped by structural challenges. A key priority remains the return to sustainable financial balance. Despite the recovery recorded in 2024, Kenya Airways posted a pre-tax loss of 12.17 billion Kenyan shillings, or about $94.5 million, in the first half of 2025.

At the same time, the airline continues to pursue expansion and diversification. Management announced plans to raise $500 million by the first quarter of 2026 to strengthen the fleet, with the aim of increasing aircraft numbers from 34 to 53 over the next five years. On diversification, Kenya Airways is also focusing on local production of sustainable aviation fuel and the development of urban air mobility services, including flying taxis.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/d369ffcdefa7c783a4dc2378a6db985c_S.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 19:56:56.201038

Investment enables SAF production for more sustainable future flying, diversifies Hawaii’s fuels industry, strengthens energy independence, and supports agriculture

HONOLULU, Dec. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines today announced it has joined Par Hawaii to invest in pioneering the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Hawaiʻi using locally grown agriculture feedstock to reduce aviation carbon emissions.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawai’i, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawai’i, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific, through its Pono Energy, Inc. subsidiary, to study Camelina sativa (camelina) as a multi-purpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii’s launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaiʻi’s first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

“As Hawaiʻi’s airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy,” said Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. “Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaiʻi’s energy independence.”

“We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawai’i’s transportation needs,” said Ed Sniffen, director of the Hawai’i State Department of Transportation. “We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii, and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state’s clean energy goals.”

Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private resource company, will launch Pono Energy, Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens. This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawai’i by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

“Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawai’i to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels,” said Chris Bennett, Pono Pacific’s vice president of sustainable energy solutions.

“By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawai’i’s ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It’s a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture, and a win for the environment — an example of how Hawai’i can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions.”

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii’s earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaiʻi Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaiʻi’s year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy. Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawai’i’s cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026. Earlier this year, Par Pacific, parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawai’i Renewables, and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery’s processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

“In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn’t think we would be able to progress so quickly,” said Par Hawaii President Eric Wright. “With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it’s exciting to see the results of our team’s hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork.”

“We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,” added James. “This is an important milestone for our company and Hawai’i, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.”

Represented on a line graph, fossil fuels evoke the lower jaw of a crocodile’s open mouth sinking downward, with economic growth represented by the upper jaw rising. Said differently, it’s another way to think about decoupling economic growth from fossil fuel use and emissions.

The “Crocodile Economy” has already taken form in 49 countries, mostly concentrated in Europe and Oceania, the region represented by Australia and surrounding nations, according to a study published last year in the journal Nature. In new research out last week, the nonprofit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit estimates that countries representing 92 percent of the global economy have decoupled their emissions from economic growth in the 10 years since the Paris Climate Agreement.

Emerging economies will accelerate the pace of change by going directly to renewables as their energy needs grow, the business climate group Exponential Roadmap Initiative projects. “Emerging economies can skip carbon-intensive development altogether by leveraging today’s affordable clean technologies,” Katarina Wangler Björk, chief impact officer of Exponential Roadmap, and Owen Gaffney, co-founder of the climate-focused researcher coalition Future Earth Media Lab, wrote on the World Economic Forum.

“Even in the United States, energy-related CO2 emissions are ~20 percent lower than in 2005, while GDP has continued to rise,” Exponential Roadmap wrote in its October report, citing the U.S. government’s own data. Jonathan Watts of The Guardian added: “Donald Trump has tried to move the U.S. in the opposite direction, but his first term as president caused only a brief uptick in emissions. For most of the past two decades, U.S. emissions have been falling.”

Leading the pack in the U.S., the state of California demonstrates that decoupling emissions from growth is a matter of political will, not lack of technology. Due to the state’s longstanding pollution control efforts, California continues to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at rates faster than almost any other state while growing its economy.

“In California, we know that a healthy, clean climate and thriving economy aren’t zero-sum games. We can excel at both,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement this fall. The state cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21 percent since 2000 while its economy grew 81 percent,, according to the governor’s office.

Most sustainability investors commit to stepping up the pace

Regardless of federal energy policy, the U.S. financial sector is “already behaving as if a fossil fuel phase-out is underway,” Ingmar Rentzhog, CEO and founder of the influential climate action organization We Don’t Have Time, wrote in Forbes over the weekend.

“Not through headlines or pledges, but through mandates, risk models, and capital allocation decisions that quietly reroute money away from assets with declining transition credibility,” Retzhog wrote, citing a new Morgan Stanley survey of sustainability-oriented institutional investors.

The survey included more than 900 investors that practice sustainable investing, or plan to do so. “Regionally, more than 90 percent of North American asset owners surveyed said they expect to increase the proportion of their assets in sustainable strategies in the next two years, slightly ahead of investors in Europe (82 percent) and APAC (85 percent),” Morgan Stanley found.

While the Morgan Stanley report did not distinguish between Canadian and U.S. investors, other surveys indicate a strong commitment to sustainability by U.S. investors and businesses in particular. Pitchbook’s Sixth Annual Sustainable Investment Survey published this fall, for example, showed strong interest in sustainable investment practices among U.S. fund managers, investment consultants and other financial professionals.

.“Among respondents, 72 percent say they currently incorporate ESG factors into their investment evaluation and management process,” Anikka Sophia Villegas, senior analyst of fund strategies and sustainable investing at PitchBook, wrote of the research for Morningstar. “Just 5 percent indicated that they used to, but no longer do.”

While those who responded to the survey remain engaged in sustainable investing, Pitchbook saw the number of survey responses drop sharply this year as business leaders are reluctant to articulate ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles in public. Skittishness over the “ESG” acronym predates this year. Companies began responding to a growing surge in anti-ESG backlash during the Joe Biden administration, a trend that has intensified in 2025.

Over the summer, EcoVadis published the results of a survey of 400 executives representing U.S. companies with more than $1 billion in revenue. While fewer companies are talking openly about ESG, 87 percent of executives told EcoVadis they maintained or increased their sustainability investments this year. “Technology remained a key focus area for investment, according to the survey, with 89 percent of respondents planning further ESG tech investments over the next 12 months,” reported Mark Segal, founder of the news organization ESG Today.

The inevitable rise of the Crocodile Economy

President Donald Trump declared an “energy emergency” upon taking office with the intention of supporting oil, gas and coal producers in the U.S. However, the new White House policy also explicitly supports several forms of renewable energy. The president tapped hydropower and biomass for support in his emergency declaration on Jan. 20, and Energy Secretary Chris Wright added geothermal energy in his first Secretarial Order issued in February.

In addition, the Energy Department has continued to support the development of new, long-duration energy storage systems and new marine energy devices that harvest electricity from the movement of waves, tides and currents.

While none of these renewables offer the present-day scalability demonstrated by wind turbines and solar panels, all of them have the potential to help accelerate the renewable transition in the near future. In particular, the geothermal industry is already deploying new drilling technologies to extend into new, previously untapped regions of the U.S.

The biomass sector also shows signs of scaling as activity in the domestic SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) industry ramps up. “Momentum is building fast,” the leading domestic SAF producer XCF Global noted in November. “Under the U.S. SAF Grand Challenge, federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of annual production by 2030 — scaling to 35 billion gallons by 2050 to meet 100 percent of domestic demand.”

That may seem somewhat optimistic, considering that SAF only accounted for about 1 percent of the global supply of jet fuel last year. Nevertheless, XCF Global is planning to expand its existing 40 million gallons-per-year SAF facility in Nevada to approximately 80 million gallons. The company has also partnered with the bio-waste gasification specialist Southern Energy Renewables and the carbon management firm DevvStream to evaluate the potential for an SAF facility in Louisiana to produce about 40 million gallons per year.

XCF is just one example among many as more U.S. states, cities and businesses follow California’s lead and join other nations around the world in decoupling economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions.",https://triplepundit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cropped-3P-Icon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-17 15:57:16.994860

""In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn't think we would be able to progress so quickly,"" said Par Hawaii President Eric Wright. ""With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it's exciting to see the results of our team's hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork.""

""We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,"" added James. ""This is an important milestone for our company and Hawai'i, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.""

Reaching the original climate targets by the previously communicated very ambitious target years would have required significant investments that are currently not realistic. Neste continues to drive growth in renewable fuels, providing alternatives to fossil fuels to mitigate climate change.

Neste sets a carbon footprint target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in its own operations (Scope 1 & 2) by 80% by 2040, replacing the target of reaching carbon neutral production by 2035.

The timeline for the related interim target of 50% emission reduction is extended from 2030 to 2035.

With these changes Neste focuses solely on absolute emission reductions in its own operations and removes the option of using emission compensation from its climate target setting.

Two of Neste’s climate targets remain unchanged: the carbon footprint target to reduce the use-phase emission intensity of sold products by 50% by 2040, and the carbon handprint target to help customers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 20 Mt annually by 2030. The respective reference years 2019 and 2020 have not been changed.

“The company's original targets to reduce its carbon footprint were based on a plan to transform Neste’s Porvoo refinery into a renewable and circular solutions refining hub by 2035. Since we announced the delay of Porvoo refinery transformation earlier this year, we have conducted a careful assessment of our climate targets to ensure they are ambitious but realistic,” said Neste’s CEO Heikki Malinen.

In the short term, Neste’s climate footprint mitigation actions focus on energy efficiency and operational excellence measures as well as evaluating alternatives to fossil hydrogen.

“Neste continues to provide its customers and consumers alternatives to fossil fuels, and our continuing investment in the world’s largest renewable fuels refinery in Rotterdam underlines our commitment to this,” added Malinen.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Neste-revises-pic-Biofuel-17-12.png,N,,2025-12-17 13:57:16.023384

Investment enables SAF production for more sustainable future flying, diversifies Hawaii's fuels industry, strengthens energy independence, and supports agriculture

HONOLULU, Dec. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines today announced it has joined Par Hawaii to invest in pioneering the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Hawaiʻi using locally grown agriculture feedstock to reduce aviation carbon emissions.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawai'i, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawai'i, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific, through its Pono Energy, Inc. subsidiary, to study Camelina sativa (camelina) as a multi-purpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii's launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaiʻi's first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Pono Pacific's crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

""As Hawaiʻi's airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy,"" said Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines. ""Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaiʻi's energy independence.""

""We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawai'i's transportation needs,"" said Ed Sniffen, director of the Hawai'i State Department of Transportation. ""We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii, and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state's clean energy goals.""

Pono Pacific, the state's largest private resource company, will launch Pono Energy, Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens. This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawai'i by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry's carbon footprint.

""Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawai'i to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels,"" said Chris Bennett, Pono Pacific's vice president of sustainable energy solutions.

""By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawai'i's ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It's a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture, and a win for the environment — an example of how Hawai'i can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions.""

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii's earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaiʻi Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaiʻi's year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy. Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawai'i's cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026. Earlier this year, Par Pacific, parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawai'i Renewables, and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery's processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

At the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, we know that understanding the atmosphere has never mattered more. As 2025 draws to a close, we’ve been looking back at our science stories from this year. This article highlights some of the contributions our community of staff have made towards atmospheric science.

January – Discovering disparity in England’s air pollution emissions

At the start of the year, we reported that minoritised ethnic groups, often living in urban centres or near major roads, face disproportionately high levels of harmful emissions of air pollutants.

Air quality researchers combined census data on socioeconomic deprivation and detailed information on population ethnicity at fine scales with air pollution emissions data in England. They identified that all 24 minoritised ethnic groups studied experienced higher than average air pollution emissions than socio-economically matched populations in the majority ‘White: English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British‘ ethnic group.

February – Identifying critical climate tipping points

In February, two teams set out to measure and model climate tippings points – where rapid and abrupt changes are irreversible on societal timescales.

Scientists are especially concerned about the rapid melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the collapse of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Both could lead to huge disruptions worldwide, such as drastic weather changes in Europe and rising sea levels globally.

The GAMB2LE project will build a pioneering automated and mobile polar observatory, which will focus on collecting continuous high-resolution data about the atmosphere-ice interface on the Greenland Ice Sheet.

The PROMOTE project will create a new generation of Earth System models to generate simulations of plausible tipping points, and provide recommendations for targeted observational networks. The models will be improved to better represent ice sheets and freshwater export from ice sheets into the ocean, as well as ocean eddies and mixing of water masses.

March – Understanding mountainous terrains to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts

Mountains have a big impact on local weather, regional weather patterns, and airflow in the lower and upper atmosphere.

In the spring, the NCAS-led part of the TEAMx programme set out to address the shortage of mountain weather data. Their focus over the year would be the Alps, a mountain range that stretches across 8 countries in Europe.

Joining an international team of 100+ fieldwork scientists, they began to develop and deploy bespoke research-grade instrumentation into the alpine environment – launching paired radiosondes, installing a new X-band weather radar on a mountain crest, and operating our research aircraft.

April – Integrating satellite and in-situ observations with model data

In April, we introduced VISION – a cutting-edge tool which is revolutionising atmospheric science by seamlessly integrating satellite and in-situ observations with model data, enabling researchers to create a digital twin of the FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s research aircraft, enhance model accuracy, and drive climate insights with unprecedented precision.

VISION will have real-world benefits both to the science produced by the FAAM Airborne Laboratory, but also to the carbon emissions and flight costs involved with collecting data.

May – UK’s first sustainable aviation fuel emissions “chase” experiment

In May, we investigated how pollutants from aircraft could be reduced by using sustainable aviation fuel.

Our FAAM Airborne Laboratory’s atmospheric research aircraft “chased” Cranfield University’s National Flying Laboratory Centre research aircraft to measure the emissions it produces during flight. With one trailing the other to sample its emissions, the scientists were able to compare the pollutants produced by sustainable aviation fuel and traditional jet fuel. This is a major step forward in understanding how different aviation fuels change the impact of flying on air quality and the climate.

June – Weather and climate forecasting for renewable energy

This summer we highlighted how researchers are using weather and climate forecasting to help renewable energy in East Africa.

As East Africa transitions toward a low-carbon future, renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower are playing an increasingly critical role in national development strategies. These sources of energy are inherently weather-dependent, making power systems vulnerable to climate variability, low winds, increased cloud cover, and droughts.

A new collaborative research initiative, known as POWER-Kenya, is investigating how sub-seasonal weather forecasts (typically 2 to 4 weeks ahead) can inform Kenya’s strategy for a resilient renewable energy supply.

July – From clean air to a warming planet

In July, a new international study, co-authored by the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, found that recent monumental efforts to reduce air pollution in East Asia may have inadvertently contributed to a noticeable acceleration in global warming since 2010.

For decades, air pollution – particularly sulfate aerosols from burning fossil fuels – has helped cool the Earth’s surface by reflecting sunlight back into space. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated in 2021 that aerosols had a net cooling effect of about 0.4°C globally.

But, starting in the early 2010s, East Asia began implementing strict air quality policies that are vital for human health. China, where air pollution is responsible for approximately one million premature deaths each year, has led the change. These efforts have resulted in a dramatic 75% reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions over the past 15 years.

The relatively quick clean-up of air pollution in East Asia, although it reduces the cooling mask, is both necessary and long overdue to protect human health. And as aerosol levels stabilise, the pace of warming is expected to return to the longer-term trend driven by greenhouse gases.

August – Low emission hydrogen engines could cut air pollution from construction

In August, we reported on a promising innovation that could offer a practical and impactful route to reducing air pollution from the construction industry, and improving air quality in cities.

The hydrogen internal combustion engine, also known as H2ICE, can be used in heavy-duty and off-grid environments. Emissions of nitrogen oxides from a 4-cylinder 55kW spark ignition hydrogen engine using lean-burn combustion were found to be 40 – 500 times lower than those from state-of-the-art diesel engines.

H2ICE may be particularly beneficial for densely populated urban areas and major infrastructure sites where air quality effects are considered as part of planning approvals.

September – Forecasting monsoon rainfall in a changing climate

At the end of summer and prompted by the disastrous monsoon season in South Asia, we highlighted how researchers are using forecast-based attribution to provide insights into how climate change may have influenced rainfall patterns over Pakistan.

Three years ago, Pakistan experienced devastating floods caused by abnormally heavy monsoon rainfall from June to August. The 2022 disaster affected millions of people, left thousands homeless, and tragically claimed more than 1,500 lives. Over two million acres of crops were destroyed, and more than 700,000 livestock were lost, creating long-lasting humanitarian and economic impacts.

Months before the floods began, seasonal forecasts from several weather models had indicated a heightened risk of unusually heavy rainfall across Pakistan. This raised the possibility of using forecasts not just to predict events, but also to assess the impact of climate change on them.

The results of the forecast-based attribution were not straightforward, but they show that climate change is one piece of the puzzle.

October – Weather radar reveal patterns in UK insect populations

In the autumn, an insect monitoring study using weather radar data was in the spotlight. Traditionally used to track rainfall and storms, weather radar have been used to help researchers monitor the daily movements and long-term abundance of flying and floating insects.

Despite growing concern about insect declines due to climate change, land use, and light pollution, it’s been difficult to track large-scale trends – until now.

The team repurposed data from the UK’s network of weather surveillance radars. By measuring how radar signals bounce off airborne objects and using dual-polarisation technology to tell insects apart from raindrops, the scientists were able to estimate the number of insects flying between 500 and 700 metres above ground.

Their results show an average of 11.2 trillion insects in the air during daytime hours and just over 5 trillion at night during the main flying seasons. Insect abundance was higher in areas with woodlands, grasslands, and even urban areas – but dropped in intensively farmed regions and where artificial lighting was high. And while daytime insect numbers remain relatively stable or even increased in southern regions, the researchers found that nighttime-airborne insects have declined overall – especially in the far north.

November – Major drop in sulfur emissions from ships

In November, we confirmed that recent global regulations have significantly reduced sulfur emissions from ships, helping to improve air quality in coastal regions.

Using aircraft-based measurements for the first time, alongside ground-based instruments, the research team measured sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emitted by ships in the North-East Atlantic and European coastal waters.

The team found that the average sulfur content in ship fuel dropped nearly tenfold in open ocean areas following the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 regulation.

December – High levels of air pollution in homes

At the end of the year, we shared an important study that discovered harmful levels of indoor air pollution in homes, during one of the largest and most detailed indoor air quality investigations to take place in the UK – led by the INGENIOUS project team.

High concentrations of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, were found in some of the homes of 309 families participating in the long-term Born in Bradford health study – with recommended World Health Organisation guidelines exceeded on 41% of all monitored days. Families from deprived areas and ethnic minority backgrounds were found to be facing the highest levels of exposure.

While electrification and hydrogen-powered aircraft are long-term possibilities, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) offers an immediate and scalable solution that can be used in existing aircraft engines and airport infrastructure. However, SAF production is still limited, and the industry needs more, and increasingly sustainable, solutions to further decarbonise the aviation.

Fjord PtX addresses this challenge by producing eSAF through a locally integrated system that couples renewable energy, carbon capture and district heating. Located in Aalborg, the project builds on strong municipal partnerships to create a circular and integrated energy system. The CO₂ will be sourced from Nordværk’s waste-to-energy operations, turning local emissions into a valuable feedstock.

Aalborg Forsyning, Aalborg Municipality’s utility company, will provide both land and technical water, in turn receiving surplus heat from the plant, feeding directly into the district heating network. This level of sector coupling, linking waste, energy, heating and transport, is essential to making SAF production both sustainable and scalable.

By 2030, Fjord PtX will produce up to 90,000 tonnes of eSAF annually, enough to cover either approx. 15% of the projected European demand for eSAF or unlock Danish ambitions of fully renewable domestic aviation. The production will utilize up to 330,000 tonnes of CO2 annually and is expected to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90%, compared to fossil jet fuel. The project will support European and Danish climate ambitions, while also creating local jobs.

The score places ATR at the “management” level, indicating established governance, risk management, and performance tracking related to climate impacts.

CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, is widely regarded as a benchmark for corporate climate disclosure. Its annual assessments evaluate the quality and completeness of companies’ climate data, how organizations manage climate-related risks and opportunities, and whether decarbonization strategies are aligned with long-term global climate goals. A “B” score signals that a company has moved beyond basic disclosure and is implementing coordinated, organization-wide actions to reduce environmental impact.

Consistency in Climate Governance

Maintaining a CDP “B” score over multiple years is notable in an aviation sector facing increasing scrutiny over emissions, fuel use, and lifecycle impacts. ATR’s repeated performance suggests continuity in governance structures, internal accountability, and long-term planning rather than one-off improvements tied to a single reporting cycle.

The company’s approach centers on annual environmental disclosure to CDP, which enables year-over-year tracking of emissions performance and climate-related risks. This consistency supports comparability for investors, customers, and regulators seeking insight into how aircraft manufacturers are responding to tightening climate expectations.

SBTi-Validated Decarbonization Targets

A key driver behind ATR’s CDP performance is its decarbonization pathway, validated in 2023 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The pathway aligns with the Paris Agreement and reflects ATR’s stated ambition to contribute to net-zero aviation by 2050.

ATR’s targets include:

A 50.4% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from operations and energy use (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2030

A 30% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its in-service aircraft fleet (Scope 3, use of sold products) by 2030

Both targets use 2018 as the baseline year, placing emphasis on absolute reductions rather than intensity-only improvements.

Aircraft Efficiency and SAF Deployment

Beyond target setting, ATR continues to focus on improving aircraft efficiency, positioning its turboprop aircraft as among the lowest-emission options in the regional aviation market. Turboprops typically consume less fuel on short-haul routes compared to regional jets, making efficiency gains particularly relevant as airlines face rising fuel costs and carbon constraints.

The OEM is also supporting the deployment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which remains one of the primary near-term levers for reducing aviation emissions. While SAF availability and cost remain challenges globally, aircraft compatibility and manufacturer support are considered essential to scaling adoption.

Transparency as a Strategic Signal

In a statement accompanying the CDP score, the company emphasized the role of disclosure in driving accountability and progress. “By disclosing our environmental data annually to CDP, we reaffirm our commitment to transparency, accountability and continuous progress in limiting the environmental and climate-related impact of our activities,” the press release stated. It added that the score “highlights the strength and reliability of our strategy and reinforces our determination to support customers in transitioning toward lower-emission operations worldwide.”",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251216-135216-5ac-ATR%2072-500%20MSN%20703%20in%2040%20years%20of%20making%20a%20difference%20livery%20%20run-up%20point%20at%20Francazal%20airport.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 11:58:04.370970

Build back industrial decarbonisation funding, including hydrogen funding streams, and ensure timely delivery of public funds that minimise regional competition.","The UK has long been regarded as a climate leader and has achieved clear progress to back it up. It has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 percent since 1990 and was the first major economy to legislate for net zero and set legally binding carbon budgets.

Part of this attempt has been its leadership on hydrogen. Since releasing its low-carbon hydrogen strategy in 2021, the UK has taken meaningful steps to build out a hydrogen economy, including setting time-bound production targets, formulating a pragmatic low-carbon hydrogen standard (LCHS) for accounting emissions reductions, and establishing its Hydrogen Production Business Model. It has also created critical funding streams like the Hydrogen Allocation Rounds (HAR) and Cluster Sequencing processes, which support the development of hydrogen projects within carbon capture and storage (CCS) networks.

With a Hydrogen Strategy update expected imminently, this is a timely opportunity to reflect on what the UK has got right and where there are opportunities for course correction to ensure hydrogen is deployed in the sectors that need the clean molecule most.

These questions were central to the CATF-E3G event held earlier this month in London, which examined how and where the UK should deploy clean hydrogen to best decarbonise its economy as part of a pragmatic decarbonisation portfolio. Below are some key takeaways from that discussion.

Hydrogen will play a critical but not extensive role in UK decarbonisation

While it is too early to define every end use, low-carbon hydrogen will be most critical for industry and long-distance transport. The clearest cases for hydrogen in the UK are in energy-intensive industries, such as chemicals and fuels production, that cannot decarbonise without a clean molecule, and which can also take advantage of shared industry cluster infrastructure. Hydrogen-derived fuels will be required for the UK’s aviation and maritime sectors, with demand expected to grow into the 2040s.

Electrification, however, should remain the default decarbonisation choice, with hydrogen reserved for applications that are genuinely hard-to-electrify or the only option available. The UK government, therefore, must consider how its hydrogen strategy is more closely integrated into broader industrial decarbonisation and electrification endeavours.

Some hydrogen transport and storage (T&S) may be needed at the national level, but the location, scale, and function of such infrastructure require further assessment. For example, long-distance hydrogen transport through the gas network is becoming increasingly unrealistic and lacks strategic purpose, and T&S will be more beneficial when deployed around critical demand centres.

Addressing misalignment across national hydrogen policy and funding is critical

Despite early leadership on low-carbon hydrogen, inconsistent policy frameworks and delayed implementation are now creating barriers to investment and deployment.

Funding frameworks across hydrogen-related schemes are misaligned in approach. Some allow developers to apply for funds from multiple schemes whereas others restrict support to just one pot. For example, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) and Department for Transport (DfT) each have their own hydrogen-derived fuels schemes and a producer supported under the DESNZ scheme is not eligible for support under the DfT scheme.

Frameworks also apply regional competition inconsistently. The cluster sequencing and infrastructure allocations require regions to compete for funding, whereas HAR does not. The UK Government should instead plan decarbonisation strategically at the national level, prioritising infrastructure in the most critical locations. NESO’s Strategic Spatial Energy Plan due in 2027 should support this approach. This will mean making difficult but necessary decisions to ensure best value of public funds and enable projects to move from planning to operation.

Furthermore, hydrogen standards cross-government are not fully aligned. A clear standout is the DfT Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate, which does not align with DESNZ hydrogen rules as CCS-enabled hydrogen is currently ineligible as a feedstock for aviation fuels production limiting domestic feedstock production potential.

These policy inconsistences across government departments and quasi-government bodies like the National Energy System Operator (NESO) undermine business cases and delay investment decisions in first-of-a-kind hydrogen projects. And this is not just applicable to hydrogen, as cross-governmental policy coordination and support on industrial decarbonisation is also needed.

The planning and governance process would also benefit from broader stakeholder representation, particularly NGO perspectives and those of public interest. NGO perspectives would be particularly welcome under initiatives such as the Hydrogen Delivery Council, where viewpoints are limited to only government and industry, which may lead to unrealistic decisions/outcomes.

The UK has been a frontrunner on hydrogen, but it must follow through on commitments

The UK’s twin-track approach to electrolytic and CCS-enabled hydrogen production has enabled effective optionality for project developers, supported by dedicated funding streams for each pathway. However, the transition from planning to real-world progress has been slower than anticipated.

Electrolytic hydrogen production remains expensive, with costs significantly higher than early estimates. Early projects have faced high costs, and a clear pathway to economies of scale is needed to help bring costs down. Policy is also needed to tackle high energy prices faced by industry.

Delays to awarding HAR 2 projects have reduced investor confidence and slowed the speed of deployment, yet the existing policy framework does not reflect these realities. The private sector cannot price policy uncertainty on its own, and a widening “valley of death” that developers face now threatens the viability of the next wave of projects.

Without action, decarbonisation risks turning into deindustrialisation

Slow government support has already had consequences. The shutdown of the UK ammonia industry and the need for last-minute intervention to prevent Tata Steel’s exit from the domestic market illustrate how delays and uncertainty have real world consequences for energy-intensive industries. Whether these industries remain in the UK is closely linked to the pace and clarity of decarbonisation policy and availability of public support mechanisms, including hydrogen.

A path forward for the UK’s hydrogen strategy

To get hydrogen efforts back on track, the UK should:

Update its national hydrogen strategy to better reflect sectoral demand and interlink more clearly with industrial decarbonisation priorities.

Align and coordinate low-carbon hydrogen and fuels policy across Government bodies to ensure uniform and fair application.

Bring more holistic voices into decision-making processes for more pragmatic planning.

Build back industrial decarbonisation funding, including hydrogen funding streams, and ensure timely delivery of public funds that minimise regional competition.

Hydrogen can be an important part of the UK’s net zero transition, but only if deployed where it is most needed and underpinned by a coherent, predictable, and coordinated policy environment. The upcoming national strategy update offers a key opportunity for the UK to reaffirm its leadership and build a hydrogen sector that strengthens both climate ambition and industrial competitiveness.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/04065528/UK-AERIAL-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:56:48.154402

This specific engine variant serves as the powerplant for Leonardo’s AW149 and AW189 helicopter fleets, which are currently utilized globally for offshore transport, passenger transit, and search-and-rescue operations.

The CT7-2E1 is a derivative of the established CT7/T700 engine family. While the broader engine family has logged a combined total of over 100 million flight hours across all military and commercial variants, the 2E1 is specifically optimized for the “super medium” helicopter class. The accumulated flight time indicates steady utilization of the Leonardo airframes in varied operating environments, ranging from maritime conditions to hot-and-high altitude zones.

According to the manufacturer, the CT7-2E1 architecture was designed to balance long-range performance with efficiency. While retaining the core design of the T700, this variant incorporates several modern upgrades intended to reduce weight and fuel burn. Key technical features include:

FADEC Integration: A Full Authority Digital Engine Control system for automated engine management.

Material Upgrades: Usage of advanced materials specifically within the turbine section to handle higher thermal loads.

Operational Efficiency: The design focuses on lowering maintenance costs and fuel consumption relative to peer engines in its weight class.

In addition to standard operations, the engine is qualified to operate on approved Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blends.

DevvStream is anticipated to oversee the creation, validation, and commercialisation of environmental assets tied to the platform’s potential low-carbon fuels.","DevvStream, Southern Energy Renewables (Southern), and XCF Global have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) to examine the joint development of an integrated low-carbon fuels platform.

The proposed collaboration aims to boost the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the US, expand production capacity, and incorporate environmental-attribute monetisation into a single customer solution.

The companies will evaluate the feasibility of building a “Gen 1” SAF facility in Louisiana using hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA). This would complement Southern Energy Renewables’ previously announced biomass-based “Gen 2” SAF gasification plant.

This evaluation is part of ongoing negotiations towards a binding agreement that could see the creation of a commercial platform allowing customers to access fuel, logistics, and environmental attributes through one integrated offering.

DevvStream chairman Carl Stanton said: “Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment.

“This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths – XCF’s production expertise, Southern’s developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset monetisation capabilities – to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.”

According to the parties, the US market for SAF is projected to reach nearly $7bn by the end of this decade, with global demand forecasted to surpass 5.5 billion gallons and a total market value exceeding $25bn.

Projections for 2050 suggest the global SAF market could surpass $250bn.

The collaboration is intended to support this expected sector growth by increasing long-term supply across various production pathways and advancing the commercialisation and transparency of environmental attributes.

Environmental-attribute integration is expected to play a significant role in the potential collaboration. DevvStream is anticipated to oversee the creation, validation, and commercialisation of environmental assets tied to the platform’s potential low-carbon fuels.

These assets may include compliance and voluntary carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital measurement, reporting, verification (MRV) tools, and tokenised tracking systems.

The companies also intend to jointly assess solutions for helping customers capture, verify, and monetise attributes such as low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) credits, renewable identification numbers (RINs), and incentives under regulations such as 45Z/45Q.

Further evaluation will cover lifecycle analysis methodologies and carbon-intensity optimisation systems designed to improve project economics and uphold standards in SAF development.

Southern Energy Renewables CEO Jay Patel said: “We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit.”

According to statements from the three companies, the MoU indicates an intention to pursue opportunities in sustainable aviation fuel and related low-carbon fuels.

The europe aircraft MRO market size was valued at USD 21.29 billion in 2024 and is anticipated to reach USD 22.34 billion in 2025 from USD 33.92 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.36% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2033.

Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) is a critical backbone of the continent’s aviation ecosystem ensuring airworthiness operational continuity and regulatory compliance across commercial business and defense fleets. Unlike transactional service sectors aircraft MRO is governed by stringent oversight from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency which mandates recurring inspections component replacements and airframe checks based on flight hours and calendar intervals. According to Eurocontrol, European airlines operated a combined fleet exceeding 3,200 commercial aircraft in 2024, which is reflecting a 12% increase from pre‑pandemic levels and amplifying scheduled maintenance demand. Furthermore, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports that the average age of narrow‑body aircraft in Western Europe reached 11.4 years in 2024, elevating the need for structural inspections and system retrofits. The region hosts over 180 EASA Part 145 certified MRO facilities, with major hubs in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain, leveraging engineering expertise and OEM partnerships. Beyond commercial aviation, Europe’s defense sector maintains over 1,600 fixed‑wing military aircraft, as documented by the European Defence Agency (EDA), necessitating specialized depot‑level maintenance. This intricate interplay of regulatory rigor, fleet dynamics, and technological evolution defines the contemporary European aircraft MRO landscape, as it adapts to sustainability mandates and digital transformation.

MARKET DRIVERS

Aging Commercial Fleet Intensifies Structural and System Overhaul Requirements

The progressive aging of Europe’s commercial aircraft fleet has emerged as a primary driver of MRO demand due to mandatory airframe inspections component fatigue assessments and avionics modernization cycles, which is majorly driving the European aircraft MRO market growth. As per IATA (2024), the average age of narrow body aircraft operated by European carriers reached 11.4 years while wide body fleets averaged 13.7 years, which is signalling entry into high maintenance phases. Aircraft exceeding 10 years require comprehensive D checks every 6–10 years involving complete disassembly corrosion treatment and structural reinforcement. Lufthansa Technik reported conducting 42 heavy maintenance checks in 2023 alone on Airbus A320ceo and Boeing 737 Classic variants all exceeding 12 years of service. According to EASA, repetitive eddy current inspections on wing spars and fuselage lap joints are mandated after 30,000 flight cycles, a threshold increasingly met by legacy fleets. Replacement of obsolete components such as hydraulic actuators and analogue flight displays further compounds workload. As per Cirium (2024), 68% of European narrow bodies are projected to surpass the 12-year mark by 2027. This demographic pressure ensures sustained demand for deep maintenance regardless of short-term traffic fluctuations.

Regulatory Mandates for Avionics Modernization and Emissions Compliance Accelerate Retrofit Demand

European aviation authorities have enacted progressive regulatory frameworks compelling airlines to upgrade aircraft systems for safety communication and environmental performance, thereby fuelling MRO activity and the regional market expansion. According to the European Commission, all aircraft operating in EU airspace must be equipped with Performance Based Navigation and Controller Pilot Data Link Communication capabilities by 2026. This mandate has triggered a wave of avionics retrofits with over 1,400 European registered aircraft undergoing cockpit upgrades in 2023 as per Eurocontrol. Simultaneously the EU Emissions Trading System now fully integrates aviation requiring precise fuel monitoring and data reporting which necessitates installation of advanced fuel flow sensors and flight data recorders. Airbus estimates that 75% of its in service A320 fleet in Europe requires supplemental data acquisition units to comply. Additionally, noise abatement regulations around major airports such as Heathrow and Frankfurt enforce Stage IV noise compliance pushing operators to retrofit hush kits or replace engines. Rolls Royce reported servicing 210 Trent 700 engines in 2024 for noise and emissions enhancements under these rules. These overlapping regulatory imperatives transform MRO from reactive upkeep into a strategic compliance function.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Persistent Shortage of Certified Aviation Technicians Constrains Capacity Utilization

The Europe aircraft MRO market faces a critical workforce bottleneck due to an acute shortage of licensed aviation maintenance engineers which directly limits shop capacity and turnaround efficiency. According to EASA, over 12,000 new technician certifications are needed annually across the EU to meet current demand yet training institutions produce fewer than 8,000 qualified graduates each year. This gap has widened since 2022 as experienced personnel retired in record numbers with the German Aerospace Industries Association estimating that 35% of its maintenance workforce is over 55 years old. Airlines such as Air France and easyJet have reported MRO slot delays of up to 21 days in 2024 due to staffing shortages at third party facilities. The issue is exacerbated by uneven geographic distribution with Eastern European MRO centers lacking sufficient certified personnel despite available infrastructure. EASA’s strict certification requirements under Part 66 prohibit task delegation to non-licensed personnel for critical inspections further tightening bottlenecks. While virtual reality training and modular certification programs are emerging, the pipeline remains insufficient to support projected fleet growth. This human capital deficit represents a structural ceiling on MRO throughput regardless of capital investment.

Volatility in Aircraft on Ground Periods Disrupts Maintenance Scheduling and Resource Allocation

Unpredictable aircraft utilization patterns driven by operational disruptions and ad hoc route changes have significantly destabilized MRO planning across Europe, which is further impeding the regional market growth. According to the European Cockpit Association (2024), over 28% of short haul flights experienced last minute cancellations or aircraft swaps due to crew shortages and air traffic control constraints. Such volatility forces airlines to defer scheduled maintenance leading to compressed heavy check windows and cascading delays. Lufthansa Technik disclosed that 17% of its planned C checks in Q1 2024 were rescheduled due to unplanned aircraft grounding from technical faults or crew unavailability. This unpredictability complicates inventory management for rotable components and reduces workforce productivity as technicians shift between tasks. Moreover, MRO contracts increasingly include strict turnaround time penalties with non-compliance fees averaging €45,000 per delayed day as per Oliver Wyman industry benchmarks. Facilities operating at 90% capacity cannot absorb these shocks without overtime or subcontracting both of which inflate costs. Until airlines achieve stable flying schedules through improved crew planning and airspace modernization MRO providers will contend with inefficient resource deployment.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Expansion of Digital Twin and Predictive Maintenance Platforms Creates High Value Service Offerings

The integration of digital twin technology and data driven predictive maintenance is unlocking new revenue streams and operational efficiencies for European aircraft MRO market. By creating virtual replicas of aircraft systems fed by real time sensor data from engines APUs and landing gear MRO firms can forecast component failures before they occur. As per Airbus (2024), nearly 900 of its aircraft in European service now transmit live health data through the Skywise platform enabling predictive interventions. Lufthansa Technik’s AVIATAR system processed over 2.3 billion data points in 2024 to optimize component life and reduce unscheduled removals by 18%. This shift from fixed interval to condition-based maintenance extends asset life and minimizes aircraft on ground time. European regulators including EASA have endorsed these models by updating maintenance approval procedures to accept data driven deferrals. Furthermore, digital twins facilitate virtual troubleshooting allowing engineers to simulate repairs before physical work begins cutting workshop time by up to 30% as demonstrated in trials by Satair. Airlines such as Finnair have signed multi-year digital MRO contracts valuing data analytics on par with traditional labor. This transformation positions MRO providers as integrated data partners rather than reactive service vendors.

Growth in Sustainable Aviation Fuel Compatibility Testing Drives Specialized Engine MRO Demand

The accelerating adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel across Europe is generating novel MRO requirements centred on engine compatibility certification and material degradation analysis, which is another promising opportunity for the European aircraft MRO market. The European Commission mandates that 6% of all aviation fuel supplied in the EU must be sustainable by 2030 under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative. Airlines are blending up to 50% SAF in current operations. However, prolonged exposure to certain bio derived fuel components can accelerate seal wear and deposit formation in high pressure turbine sections. Rolls Royce has conducted over 200 engine teardowns since 2022 specifically to assess SAF induced wear with findings integrated into revised maintenance protocols. In 2024 Safran and Air France launched a joint program to monitor CFM56 engines on SAF rich routes with enhanced borescope inspections every 500 flight hours. EASA has issued new service bulletins requiring fuel system material verification for aircraft operating above 30% SAF blends. This regulatory and operational shift compels MRO providers to develop specialized inspection checklists trained personnel and material compatibility databases. As SAF usage expands from niche demonstrations to mainstream operations these tailored engine MRO services will become standard across European maintenance networks.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Fragmented Regulatory Oversight Across Non-EU European States Complicates Cross Border MRO Certification

The absence of harmonized aviation maintenance regulations in non-EU European countries creates significant compliance complexity for pan regional MRO providers, which is a major challenge to the European market growth. While EASA Part 145 certification is recognized across the European Union nations such as Serbia Ukraine and Moldova maintain independent airworthiness authorities with divergent approval processes. According to the European Business Aviation Association, operators in the Western Balkans face an average of 45 additional days to validate MRO work performed in EU facilities due to bilateral agreement delays. This fragmentation forces MRO companies to maintain duplicate documentation systems and pursue country specific approvals inflating administrative costs by an estimated 12% as reported by the European Regions Airline Association. Moreover, components repaired in an EASA certified shop may require re inspection before installation on aircraft registered in non-aligned states disrupting just in time logistics. During the 2024 Balkan airspace recovery following regional disruptions several carriers reported aircraft grounded for over 3 weeks awaiting paperwork validation. Until the European Common Aviation Area fully integrates oversight standards this jurisdictional patchwork will impede seamless MRO service delivery across the continent.

Rising Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities in Connected MRO Ecosystems Threaten Operational Integrity

The digitalization of aircraft maintenance systems has introduced significant cybersecurity risks that threaten data integrity workshop safety and regulatory compliance across Europe, which is further challenging the aircraft MRO market growth in Europe. Modern MRO operations rely on interconnected platforms for technical logbooks component tracking and remote diagnostics yet 63% of European MRO providers reported at least one cyber incident in 2024 according to ENISA. Attack vectors include compromised electronic flight bags falsified service records and malware injected through third party software updates. In one 2023 case a major European MRO facility had to suspend all work for 72 hours after ransomware encrypted its component traceability database delaying over 30 aircraft releases. EASA has since issued cybersecurity guidelines for maintenance organizations but implementation remains voluntary and uneven. The integration of OEM proprietary systems such as Boeing’s AnalytX and Airbus’s Airspace further fragments security protocols. Without standardized encryption access controls and incident response frameworks the industry remains exposed to disruptions that could cascade through the aviation supply chain. This emerging threat dimension necessitates dedicated cyber resilience investments beyond traditional workshop safety paradigms.

Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty welcomed the pace of bilateral engagement during a telephone call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, noting that sustained political coordination has created a framework for deeper economic and investment cooperation between the two countries.

According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Tamim Khallaf, Abdelatty said Egypt is seeking to convene the fifth round of the ministerial-level Strategic Dialogue and the joint committee meeting to advance cooperation across multiple domains, as both sides prepare to mark 70 years of diplomatic relations next year.

The foreign minister pointed to the role of Chinese companies in major infrastructure projects in Egypt, including the Light Rail Transit project and the Central Business District in the New Administrative Capital. These projects are seen as strengthening urban transport capacity, connectivity and logistics efficiency, alongside cooperation in renewable energy and desalination.

Ain Sokhna’s logistics positioning has also been reinforced by recent developments at the port, where Deputy Prime Minister for Industrial Development and Minister of Industry and Transport Kamel El-Wazir received a Guinness World Records certificate recognising Ain Sokhna as the deepest man-made port basin constructed on land, with a depth of 19 metres. The port’s development forms part of a national plan to enhance Egypt’s role in international trade and position Sokhna as a logistics and transit hub on the Red Sea, supporting large vessels, higher cargo volumes and port-centric supply chains.

The logistics role of Ain Sokhna has also been expanded through new industrial investments linked directly to port operations. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Dr Mostafa Madbouly witnessed the signing of a contract for a sustainable aviation fuel production project by Qatari Al-Mana Holding Company in the Sokhna Integrated Zone of the Suez Canal Economic Zone. The project marks the first Qatari industrial investment within the Suez Canal economy and involves the establishment of SAf Fly Limited, a dedicated production entity located across both the industrial zone and the port area, integrating manufacturing and maritime logistics functions.

With an investment of $200 million, the project is being developed on a total area of 100,000 square metres, including 30,000 square metres inside Ain Sokhna port, enabling direct access to export infrastructure. The facility is designed to produce 200,000 tonnes annually of sustainable aviation fuel, bio-propane and bio-naphtha, derived from used edible oils. Al-Mana Holding has signed a long-term supply agreement with Shell to purchase the full output, with fuel deliveries scheduled to begin by the end of 2027, reinforcing Sokhna’s role in global energy and aviation fuel supply chains.

Abdelatty also highlighted investment opportunities linked to Egypt’s strategy to localise industry and transfer technology, with an emphasis on attracting Chinese investment in artificial intelligence and digitalisation, areas that support modern logistics, industrial automation and supply chain management.

The discussions come as Egypt continues to position economic zones and transport corridors as platforms for foreign investment tied to manufacturing, logistics and trade flows, supported by large-scale infrastructure development.

The call also covered coordination in multilateral forums and regional developments, including Gaza and Sudan, with both sides stressing continued consultation and cooperation as part of the broader strategic partnership.",https://www.logupdateafrica.com/h-upload/2025/12/17/90072-fb-img-1765730561817-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:57:40.368496
