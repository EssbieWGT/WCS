This historic journey from London Heathrow to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York marks a pivotal moment in aviation history, demonstrating the potential for a more sustainable future. As the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, the success of this flight offers hope and sets a new standard for future air travel. But what exactly does this mean for the future of aviation, and how can it impact our fight against climate change?

The Power of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, is revolutionizing the aviation industry by providing a viable alternative to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. Composed primarily of used cooking oils and animal fats, SAF represents a more sustainable option that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. The fuel used in this historic flight was a blend of Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and a small percentage of Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), derived from plant sugars and other renewable sources.

Virgin Atlantic’s successful use of SAF underscores its potential as a safe and reliable substitute that is fully compatible with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure. This innovation not only paves the way for reducing aviation’s carbon footprint but also aligns with global goals to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The airline’s achievement sends a clear message: sustainable alternatives are not just feasible—they are crucial for the future of aviation.

Addressing the Impact of Contrails

While the reduction of carbon emissions is a significant milestone, the aviation industry also faces challenges related to contrails—those streaks of cloud that aircraft leave in their wake. According to research cited by Virgin Atlantic, contrails contribute to 57% of aviation’s impact on global warming. This far exceeds the 2.4% attributed to CO2 emissions from fuel combustion.

The flight from London to New York also served as a platform for the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Contrail Impact Task Force (CITF) to conduct practical tests aimed at understanding and mitigating the climate impact of contrails. By sharing data from these studies with aviation companies worldwide, the group hopes to develop strategies that will further minimize aviation’s environmental footprint. The potential to address contrails represents a significant opportunity to advance climate goals and enhance the sustainability of long-haul flights.

Government Support and Future Implications

This landmark flight was financially supported by the British government, highlighting the importance of public-private partnerships in advancing sustainable technologies. Such collaborations are essential for accelerating innovation and implementing changes on a global scale. The success of this flight could inspire further government investment and regulatory support, driving the widespread adoption of SAF across the aviation industry.

The implications extend beyond just reducing emissions. Transitioning to sustainable fuels can encourage the development of new industries and job opportunities in renewable energy, further stimulating economic growth. As airlines and governments worldwide recognize the potential of SAF, we may see a paradigm shift in how air travel is perceived and executed, setting a precedent for other sectors to follow.

The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities

Despite the success of this historic flight, challenges remain. The production and supply of SAF need to be scaled up to meet global demand, and cost considerations must be addressed to make it a viable option for all airlines. However, the progress achieved thus far provides a strong foundation for future developments.

As the aviation industry continues to innovate, the potential for SAF and other sustainable technologies to transform air travel is immense. The journey towards a greener future is underway, but it requires ongoing commitment, collaboration, and investment. How will the aviation industry overcome these challenges to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come?

by Kelly Barraza

The way to a Mainer’s heart is through their stomach — appropriate for this New England state abundant in food and agricultural resources.

Slated to open in spring of 2026, the plant will source locally grown russet potatoes for the production of their chips, which will be well supplied by the $1.3 billion Maine potato industry that in 2022 supported over 6,000 jobs and $237 million in labor income, according to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service.

Plans for the plant were first announced in early 2024 by local businessman Bruce Sargent and Jim Pelkey of Falcon Transportation in Presque Isle, Maine. Sargent spoke to Site Selection about the project and this area of Maine, indicating how bullish the city of Limestone and the Loring Development Authority have been in revitalizing business at the 3,800-acre base. The growing business roster there now includes established and prospective projects such as a sustainable aviation fuel facility from DG Fuels, an AI startup and investment group Green 4 Maine.

Big Plans for Limestone

Sargent’s early exposure to the local Maine potato and agriculture business before his 40-year-long career in refrigerated freight transportation clearly left roots that will help boost the ambitious project through its development phase.

“I’m up for the challenge,” he says. “There’s always room for the little manufacturer. I don’t worry about the competition.”

Initially operating independently, Sargent plans to scale the plant’s production with eyes on a potential partnership with larger food and beverage entities in order to deliver his product across the United States.

“I want to put out a good product, and I want to put it out fast at a high volume,” Sargent says of Taste of Maine Potato Chips’ future distribution plans. “Private label and co-pack is my object — selling to franchises like Publix, Food Lion.”

The Loring Development Authority and City of Limestone were noted for their collaboration with industry to build out Loring Commerce Centre, with Limestone open to offering 20- and 30-year tax increment financing (TIF) and other duty-free options to new businesses looking to grow in the area.

The facility’s location in Maine, where the potato is one of many crops farmed on a large scale, is strategic in avoiding the need to import potato crop from other states like Idaho and Washington. This is vital for reducing freight cost and managing shrinkage rate in the food manufacturing process. It also allows Taste of Maine to work directly with local Maine farmers.

The Taste of Maine factory will fry potato slices in batches with each industrial fryer having a capacity of 500 pounds of finished product per hour. A total of eight fryers are planned at full build-out.

Repurposing an Air Force Base

The potato chip plant is just one of many in-progress and recently completed projects at Loring Commerce Centre.

In November 2024, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) company DG Fuels announced a $4 billion, 1,200-acre SAF facility at Loring Commerce Centre expected to break ground in 2026. This location is planned to have a yearly output of 190 million gallons of jet fuel derived from 1.7 million tons of wood biomass. There is discussion on whether inactive rail in northern Maine will be repurposed for this operation, as DG Fuels has worked with the Maine Department of Transportation to identify existing rail that may be used to transport biomass from Limestone to Loring across Aroostook County. DG Fuels has also indicated interest in using an existing pipeline to carry SAF from Loring to coastal Maine for distribution at airports on the Eastern Seaboard.

“This project, when completed, would represent a big part of the vision that the state has always had for Loring,” stated then-Loring Development Authority of Maine Board Chair Jeremy Fischer in 2022, noting that the potential impact cannot be overstated in terms of jobs and increased economic activity in the area. “Thanks to all who have brought their efforts to bear to make this a reality and thanks in advance to those whose contributions have yet to be made.”

Green 4 Maine, based in Portland, Maine, is also working with DG Fuels to build workforce housing in Loring to support the project construction. DG Fuels is also planning several sustainable fuel facility projects across the U.S., including in Nebraska and Minnesota (see the January 2025 issue of Site Selection).

This collaboration, which covers the provision of 7,400 metric tons (approximately 9.5 million liters) of SAF over the next year, positions DHL towards reducing its carbon footprint in air transportation. Such advancements reflect the growing need for greener aviation solutions amid global sustainability efforts.

Historically, DHL has actively pursued sustainability goals, exemplified by its continuous investment in alternative fuel sources and commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. Proactive steps like this SAF procurement signify progress within the air cargo sector towards cleaner practices. Neste’s ongoing efforts to provide green fuel solutions, demonstrated through its substantial annual SAF production, further underscore DHL’s role as an industry front-runner in adopting sustainable initiatives.

How does the Agreement Impact DHL’s Sustainability Goals?

The new agreement with Neste plays a pivotal role in DHL’s comprehensive Sustainability Roadmap, which involves a ten-year, €7 billion investment in emissions-reducing initiatives. Part of this plan is expanding its zero-emissions fleet and amplifying the use of sustainable fuels across all transportation modes to over 30% by 2030. Christopher Ong, Managing Director for DHL Express Singapore, emphasized their leadership in sustainable logistics, stating,

“We are not just meeting industry standards but setting them.”

What Role Does Singapore Play in Advancing SAF Use?

Singapore’s aviation sector is aligning with global sustainability efforts, aiming to slash carbon emissions. By integrating SAF in logistics, it supports the nation’s agenda to make SAF usage mandatory for departing flights from 2026. DHL’s latest endeavor with Neste represents a significant step towards these national goals, presenting Singapore as a forward-thinking aviation hub.

Neste’s SAF, prepared at their expansive Singapore production facility, is a result of intricate renewable processing, utilizing resources such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste.

In a push for climate accountability, Air France-KLM has become the first airline group to adopt the European Union’s new Flight Emissions Label (FEL), developed in partnership with the European Commission and EASA.

The label, aimed at standardising emissions data for passengers, marks a significant step toward transparent, climate-conscious air travel across the EU.

Under a Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) signed with EASA, Air France and KLM will now begin testing and implementing the fully digital FEL platform.

The tool aims to offer passengers clear, consistent information on the carbon emissions associated with each flight. This will not only empower consumers to make more sustainable travel choices but also encourage airlines to adopt more environmentally responsible practices.

The partnership is seen as the first concrete manifestation of Regulation (EU) 2024/3170, adopted in December 2024, which formally established the voluntary environmental labelling scheme.

The FEL is part of a broader EU strategy that includes the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, both of which are designed to accelerate decarbonisation within the aviation sector.

New levels of transparency in airline carbon reporting

Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air France-KLM, describes the agreement as a critical milestone in the group’s climate strategy.

“Our early and active participation is designed to help shape a fair, transparent, and effective framework for all airlines.” he says. “This initiative is a critical component of our broader strategy to lead the decarbonisation of our industry.”

Air France-KLM will now work closely with EASA’s digital experts to test the FEL platform’s end-to-end workflow-from submitting flight-level data to receiving emissions label outputs.

This includes reporting real-time metrics such as fuel consumption, sustainable fuel (SAF) use, passenger load, cargo carried, and time spent airborne.

In return, the airline group will gain early access to the FEL’s reporting methodology and its underlying calculation framework, giving it a competitive edge and positioning it as a frontrunner in sustainable aviation.

What the Flight Emissions Label hopes to achieve

The introduction of the FEL arrives at a moment of increasing climate pressure.

Aviation accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, and that figure is expected to grow without intervention. For decades, carbon offset schemes and voluntary emissions calculators have existed, but these have often lacked uniformity and credibility.

The new labelling framework will change that. By standardising emissions data and display formats, the FEL gives consumers trustworthy, comparable information. Only airlines enrolled in the scheme will be permitted to publicly display emissions labels to EU passengers.

Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, welcoming the partnership, says: “This decisive step turns Air France and KLM’s commitment to decarbonisation into concrete action.

“It reinforces fair competition, transparency, and trust. I encourage other airlines to join this initiative, driving a more sustainable and transparent future for European aviation.”

What can passengers expect from the Flight Emissions Label?

Once fully operational, the FEL will allow passengers booking with participating airlines to see a breakdown of their flight’s emissions performance.

Likened to food nutrition labels or appliance energy ratings, the scheme will generate a standardised, easily understood visual guide to the climate impact of a flight.

Air France-KLM is expected to begin displaying this data publicly in the coming months, subject to the completion of the trial phase.

The scheme is open to both EU and non-EU carriers operating flights in the region, provided they fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation).

While the programme is voluntary for now, there is a potential that the FEL could become mandatory in future.

With mounting regulatory and consumer demand for greener operations, FEL may emerge as a global benchmark, especially as regions like Asia and North America evaluate similar frameworks to drive aviation decarbonisation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/A-KLM-Airbus-A321neo.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 14:22:49.771734

Improved efficiency at the heart of a clean-sheet design Optimising aerodynamic efficiency is at the core of the A220’s airframe design.
To achieve this, the A220 boasts advanced features, such as the newly designed nose and tailcone, both of which reduce the drag on the aircraft.
The latest improvements for enhanced safety & performance Despite the integration of the latest technologies from the get-go, a clean-sheet design still requires continuous improvement to keep it at the forefront of innovation.
And the long-awaited capability to operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel is expected to be possible for all Airbus aircraft before 2030.","Today, many of the planes flying our skies are test-proven aircraft – built on +40-year-old designs – that have been enhanced with the latest engine and avionics technologies.

However, every few decades, an aircraft comes along that boldly makes a fresh start. Most recently, that aircraft is the A220.

“With the A220, we really started from a blank slate,” explains Jean-François Parent, Airbus A220 Chief Engineer. “Our objective was to build the most efficient small single-aisle aircraft on the market, and we engineered – in a thoughtful way – the features that would deliver on this objective.”

Indeed, the A220 Family – comprising two variants: A220-100 and A220-300 – are “clean-sheet” aircraft built on an entirely new design that rethinks aerodynamic efficiency, allows for the use of the most advanced materials, and integrates the latest systems and avionics.

Because developing new aircraft is significantly more costly than simply improving an existing design, this approach is generally used when there is a need to serve new or different markets that existing designs can’t address. For the A220, that segment is the 100- to 160-seat market.

Improved efficiency at the heart of a clean-sheet design

Optimising aerodynamic efficiency is at the core of the A220’s airframe design. To achieve this, the A220 boasts advanced features, such as the newly designed nose and tailcone, both of which reduce the drag on the aircraft. The fuselage wetted area – which is the entire surface area that is in direct contact with the air – is the smallest for aircraft of its class, keeping drag at a minimum.

Among the A220’s most noteworthy innovations is its 40% use of advanced materials. The majority of aircraft are built from a combination of titanium, steel and aluminium. The A220 is no exception in this respect, but it also incorporates advanced composites – such as polymers and carbon fibre – in the wing, centre wingbox, empennage, rear fuselage and horizontal stabiliser. These composite materials are less prone to corrosion and fatigue compared to metal, and offer an exceptional strength-to-weight ratio. Case in point: the A220’s wing is 10% lighter than a conventional all-aluminium wing, which reduces fuel burn and emissions.

Inside the aircraft, the A220’s cockpit – designed by pilots for pilots – is widely appreciated for its modern and state-of-the-art flight deck powered by Airbus’ fly-by-wire technology. The simplified yet robust layout was designed to be as intuitive as possible with large screens, fewer manual controls and user-friendly on-board equipment – such as two-mode fly-by-wire flight controls and sidestick controllers. This cockpit layout enables pilots to fly the A220 Family’s two variants with the same type rating.

The A220’s engine and cabin have also been given the clean-sheet treatment with incredible results – improvements that will be explored more closely in future installments of the A220 web series.

The latest improvements for enhanced safety & performance

Despite the integration of the latest technologies from the get-go, a clean-sheet design still requires continuous improvement to keep it at the forefront of innovation. And the A220 has continued to integrate new features and functionalities since its launch.

For example, the A220-100 and A220-300 have consistently benefited from maximum take-off weight (MTOW) increases – approved by international regulatory authorities – throughout the years with the first increases starting in 2020. Since then, the A220’s MTOW has increased by 3 tonnes, which has expanded the aircraft’s maximum range. The latest payload increase is expected later this year.

Avionics upgrades are also a top priority for the A220. In 2026, the A220 will fully integrate the latest Runway Overrun Awareness and Alerting System (ROAAS), an onboard system that alerts pilots if more deceleration force is needed to avert a runway overrun. Because runway overruns are considered one of the major contributors to aircraft accidents worldwide, this improvement will further optimise safety by providing the flight crew with timely alerts when the aircraft is at risk of not being able to stop before the end of the runway. This upgrade will align with EASA’s mandate to have ROAAS integrated in all new commercial aircraft.

Further ahead, Airbus’ HBCPlus connectivity solution, which will significantly improve onboard broadband access, is expected to arrive after 2028. And the long-awaited capability to operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel is expected to be possible for all Airbus aircraft before 2030.

Thanks to these innovations and Airbus’ continued investment in the programme, the A220 is solidifying its reputation as one of the most innovative aircraft with a clean-sheet design that delivers.

It takes requests from aircraft and those with SAF who can offer a supply.

Once a match has been made, the airline and the supplier can then open discussions to reach specific terms including items such as price terms for payment, according to IATA.

This new platform offers support for items such as spot purchases and offtake agreements – it is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only.

However, the industry trade body has said that other participants, for example, non-aviation corporations, can take part in due course.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA's SVP Sustainability and Chief Economist, says: ""To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF.""

Addressing critical market challenges

IATA says the SAF Matchmaker platform will address what it describes as three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

This central platform will help to simplify the operation of SAF procurement by making it easier and quicker for parties to open discussions without any additional fees – which will help to further develop the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Helping to carry detailed information regarding available SAF – such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and the technology of production – as well as the emissions reductions plus the compliance with the ICAO CORSIA carbon scheme or the EU's Renewable Energy Directive.

Producers of SAF and suppliers will be given the opportunity to post available and planned SAF volumes, while airlines are able to register their interest in either purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes, with subsequent trades taking place outside the platform.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is increasingly seen as crucial in reducing emissions within the aviation sector, potentially contributing to 65% of the required reductions to achieve net-zero CO₂ emissions by 2050, according to the International Air Transport Association.

As part of this effort, FedEx, the world's largest express cargo airline, and Neste, a global leader in SAF production, have partnered to achieve a major milestone in sustainable transportation.

The pair have agreed on a substantial supply chain development at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), where FedEx will receive 8,800 tonnes of blended SAF—making it the largest SAF purchase by a US cargo line at LAX to date.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/17477459e70148fee359a7646383fbb5:82ccb0b059b40266e8abe3714defff38/planes-runway.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:09:47.085462

However, delivery delays, the BDL explains, are preventing German airlines from boosting their fleet renewal and fuel consumption reduction.","In recent years, airlines, airports, and other major aviation stakeholders have all been keeping a close eye on their fuel consumption. With the rollout of sustainable aviation fuel ( SAF) having been relatively slow thus far, and alternative means of propulsion such as hydrogen and electricity still in their embryonic phases, the best that most carriers can do now is look to reduce their use of conventional jet fuel.

This is an initiative that, in Germany, seems to be being carried out with a considerable degree of success, putting the country's airlines and airports in a good position as far as their progress towards meeting the industry's shared goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 is concerned. Indeed, one of the nation's leading interest groups recently revealed that German airlines are using less fuel than ever before.

Jet Fuel Use Is At An All-Time Low In Germany

Last week, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Luftverkehrswirtschaft ('German Aviation Association') proudly announced that jet fuel consumption at German airlines had reached a record low, averaging just 3.38 liters per passenger per 100 km (62 miles) in 2024. According to the BDL, a Berlin-based aviation interest group, this represents a 46% reduction compared to 1990's figure of 6.3 liters.

With carbon emissions per passenger having correspondingly been cut almost in half in the last 34 years, German carriers are certainly doing their bit when it comes to making the commercial aviation sector a more sustainable industry. According to the BDL, only 12% of respondents to a survey correctly guessed that the figure would be this low, with Dr Joachim Lang, its Managing Director, explaining that:

""Many people are surprised by how low the actual kerosene consumption of a flight actually is, and German airlines are improving their carbon footprint year after year. (...) Thanks to quieter engines, noise pollution is also significantly reduced, especially during takeoff and landing. This also benefits residents living near airports.""

Over 30% Of Germans Expected Consumption Levels To Be Nine Times As High

Diving into further detail regarding its survey concerning the average jet fuel consumption per passenger per 100 km in Germany, the BDL explains that ""31% estimated the average consumption at 30 liters,"" almost nine times as high as the actual figure of 3.38 liters. A similar proportion (around a third) were unable to provide an answer, with a further 23% putting 15 liters as their educated guess.

The BDL cites fleet renewal programs at German airlines as being a driving force behind the nation's impressive overall reduction in average fuel consumption. Indeed, Lang goes on to explains that ""replacing an older aircraft with a new model immediately reduces kerosene consumption and CO2 emissions by up to 30%.""

According to the BDL, Germany's airlines currently have a collective fleet of 830 aircraft. However, they are also investing in their future on a considerable scale, with the group explaining that they have also ""placed or reserved orders for 482 new aircraft with a list price of €82 billion ($96 billion) through 2034."" Each of these new arrivals in the coming nine years will further reduce average fuel consumption.

Long-Haul Aircraft Are Particularly Fuel-Efficient

While Germany's airlines averaged 3.38 liters of jet fuel consumption per passenger per 100 km in 2024, there are certain aircraft where this figure drops even lower. Most notably, widebody long-haul aircraft, where there are more passengers between whom to divide the fuel consumption, are the shining stars on this front.

According to the BDL, widebodies can sometimes be more than a liter better than the overall national average when it comes to jet fuel consumption per passenger per 100 km, with the group explaining that the most modern examples average between 2.1 and 2.5 liters. However, delivery delays, the BDL explains, are preventing German airlines from boosting their fleet renewal and fuel consumption reduction.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_1118464442-copy.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:00.192977

Yet across the country on the East Coast, Georgia has quietly emerged as a formidable competitor, rapidly consolidating its position as one of the premier aerospace hubs in the United States.

It’s hard to understate the importance of the aerospace industry, which contributes $57 billion and more than 200,000 jobs, to Georgia’s economy.

When thinking about aviation in Georgia, a couple of well-known names inevitably come to mind, such as Delta Air Lines, by some measures one of the world’s three largest airlines, and Atlanta-Hartsfield International Airport (ATL), the world’s busiest airport.

But, when it comes to aerospace, Georgia is also home to a strong industrial base, including household names such as executive jet manufacturer Gulfstream Aerospace and defense conglomerate Lockheed Martin, as well as another 800 companies.

Perhaps even more interesting is that as well as these well-established giants, a number of young companies active in the new emerging segments of aerospace have also set up shop in the state. We are talking about companies like Archer, which has built its first mass industrial plant in Convington, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) producer LanzaJet, which has set up a 10-million-gallon-a-year plant in Soperton, and hypersonic aircraft developer Hermeus, which is based in Atlanta.

How Georgia is trying to attract more investment in aerospace

In the lead up to the Paris Air Show, which took place in June 2025, AeroTime spoke to Elizabeth Mclean, Assistant Director at Georgia’s Department of Economic Development, to learn more about the state’s strategy to continue growing its aerospace sector.

The nascent advanced air mobility industry is one of the segments targeted by this organization, which is tasked with attracting fresh investment to Georgia’s aerospace ecosystem.

Mclean explained how, on the back of Archer’s investment, Georgia’s Department of Economic Development recently published an advanced air mobility blueprint, a 20-page document that outlines concrete steps to help establish the state as a leader in the sector.

However, Mclean also highlighted that this interest in emerging segments of the industry does not mean neglecting investments in more traditional fields such as maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO). In fact, Georgia hosts the largest MRO operation in the US, run by Delta Tech Ops, and has also seen recent investments from the likes of Pratt & Whitney, which invested over $200 million at its Columbus facility in 2023, and Embraer Aircraft Maintenance Services (EAMS), which is building up its activities in Macon, Georgia.

The state relies on its educational ecosystem to keep all these ventures supplied with a pipeline of fresh talent. Mclean underlined the role that engineering powerhouses like Georgia Tech play in all this. For example, in May 2025, Georgia Tech signed a partnership with Altair, a Michigan-based technology firm which develops AI-driven simulation software for cutting edge aerospace design applications. This technology is being used, for example, to design JetZero’s revolutionary blended wing body airliner.

“It is a very diverse ecosystem,” Mclean said. “What actually sets us apart from other states with strong aerospace industries is that we have the whole spectrum of activities, from the HQs to manufacturing, MRO, you name it.”",https://www.aerotime.aero/images/shutterstock_2418961933-1-e1752578448911.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:11.627074

With a capacity to produce 1 million tons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) annually—the largest such facility globally—Neste is uniquely positioned to capitalize on Asia-Pacific's regulatory mandates and airline commitments to slash emissions. This strategic asset, paired with partnerships like its landmark deal with DHL Express, underscores why investors should view Neste as a critical beneficiary of the SAF boom.

The Singapore Refinery: A Moat in Motion

Neste's Singapore refinery, completed in 2023 after a $1.5 billion expansion, is not just a production hub but a showcase of industrial-scale sustainability. Its 1 million tons/year SAF capacity (part of a total renewable fuels output of 2.6 million tons) relies on advanced feedstock processing, including waste cooking oil and residues. Over 90% of its raw materials are sustainably sourced, a compliance advantage as regulators tighten standards.

The refinery's role is further cemented by its proximity to key Asian aviation markets. A striking example is its $60 million SAF supply deal with DHL Express, delivering 9.5 million liters of neat SAF to power international cargo flights from Singapore Changi Airport through 2026. This partnership, one of Asia's largest SAF agreements to date, highlights Neste's ability to secure long-term contracts with major carriers.

Policy Tailwinds: Asia-Pacific's Regulatory Push

Regulatory momentum is the engine behind SAF demand. Singapore's mandate to blend 1% SAF into aviation fuel by 2026, with a target of 5% by 2030, directly aligns with Neste's Singapore operations. Regionally, the EU's ReFuelEU regulation—requiring a 2% SAF blend by 2025—is a catalyst for cross-border collaboration. Airlines like Singapore Airlines and Scoot are already using locally produced Neste SAF at Changi Airport, reducing reliance on imported fuel and meeting compliance targets.

Japan, Hong Kong, and India are also advancing SAF policies. By 2030, Asia-Pacific airlines aim to achieve 5% SAF adoption as part of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines' climate goals. Neste's early partnerships—such as with Japan's ITOCHU Corporation—position it to dominate these emerging markets.

The Investment Case: Scale, Partnerships, and ESG Appeal

Neste's moat lies in its first-mover advantage and operational scale. By 2027, its global SAF capacity will reach 2.2 million tons annually, with the Singapore refinery accounting for nearly half of this growth. This expansion is underpinned by $2.2 billion allocated for SAF projects through 2027, including hydrogen production upgrades to boost efficiency.

While Neste's EBITDA fell to €1.25 billion in 2024 from €3.46 billion in 2023—due to pricing pressures and competition—the fourth-quarter rebound in SAF sales signals stabilizing demand. Airlines' long-term commitments (e.g., DHL's multiyear deal) and the cost certainty of fixed-price contracts mitigate near-term risks.

Moreover, Neste's ESG profile is a magnet for impact investors. Its goal to reduce 20 million tons of CO₂ annually by 2030 aligns with global net-zero targets, while its carbon-neutral production aim by 2035 adds credibility.

Risks and Considerations

Feedstock supply remains a critical challenge. Current waste/residue feedstocks can meet near-term demand but will require innovation—like algae-based or power-to-liquid fuels—to scale further. Neste's R&D investments (e.g., partnerships with Finland's VTT Technical Research Centre) are addressing this, but execution risks persist.

Competitors like Shell, TotalEnergies, and regional players in China and India could intensify price wars. However, Neste's end-to-end supply chain expertise—from feedstock sourcing to airport distribution—creates a barrier to entry.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Asia's Green Skies

Neste's Singapore refinery is more than a production site; it's a linchpin in the Asia-Pacific's shift to sustainable aviation. With mandates tightening and partnerships solidifying, the company's ability to scale SAF production at a time when demand is surging makes it a compelling investment. While short-term volatility exists, the long-term trajectory—driven by regulation and airline commitments—is unambiguously upward. For investors focused on ESG-aligned growth, Neste's dominance in the region's SAF supply chain offers a rare blend of scalability, profitability, and purpose.

Investors should monitor Neste's feedstock diversification progress and SAF pricing trends, but the strategic foundation is clear: this is a company building castles in the sky—and they're green.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:20.363087

Sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable aviation fuel providing a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel. Using Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%** over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste’s SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. SAF is certified for commercial use and can currently be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel before use. It works seamlessly with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. Today, Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tons per annum, and it is set to grow to 2.2 million tons in 2027.

*) CORSIA is a recognized scheme offering a harmonized way to reduce CO2 emissions from international aviation to curb its impact on climate change. It was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the implementation of CORSIA is currently in the first, voluntary phase. Once certified by an ICAO-approved sustainability certification scheme, SAF qualifies as a CORSIA Eligible Fuel (CEF) and can be used by an airline to meet the CO2 emission reduction allocation requirements under CORSIA.

By harnessing seawater, captured CO2, and renewable electricity, they aim to create a sustainable aviation fuel. Their innovative approach eschews traditional biomass and fossil resources, providing a promising alternative for reducing carbon emissions associated with air travel. This initiative is poised to challenge conventional aviation fuel production methods, reflecting a growing interest in sustainable energy solutions.

SeaO2’s current work follows previous announcements regarding similar initiatives in sustainable technology. Past discussions in related sectors have focused on the potential of alternative energy projects, though not always with a specific focus on aviation. Historically, fuel industry leaders have explored varying methods of CO2 capture and conversion, seeking scalable solutions. However, SeaO2’s integration of seawater as a primary resource is a distinct departure from past proposals, offering a unique angle on CO2 utilization and renewable energy. This strategic orientation could reshape conversations around future energy models.

How will this project produce aviation fuel?

The collaboration aims to capture CO2 from seawater and convert it into essential building blocks for aviation fuel. This initiative encompasses four focal areas, starting with establishing system requirements and exploring potential use cases. Subsequent steps involve refining SeaO2’s electrochemical technology to convert seawater into hydrogen and CO2 using advanced reactor designs. A final techno-economic analysis will gauge the project’s cost-effectiveness against traditional kerosene production methods, marking a significant step in transitioning toward a more sustainable aviation sector.

What is SeaO2’s approach to ocean-based CO2 removal?

SeaO2 has been pioneering an electrochemical process known as Direct Ocean Capture (DOC), intended to lower atmospheric CO2 levels by removing carbon dioxide from the ocean. Established in 2021, the company envisions removing 1 gigaton of CO2 by the year 2045. Unlike other methods, this process doesn’t rely on chemicals or external inputs, instead using electricity to facilitate CO2 extraction. The technology derives from Delft University of Technology research and aligns with emerging sustainable industrial practices.

“We envision a compact, modular approach to large-scale carbon removal,” SeaO2’s co-founder Ruben Brands stated.

This system’s adaptability allows integration with existing infrastructure, which may reduce costs and enhance scalability. Looking towards 2030 and beyond, SeaO2 plans to transform outdated oil and gas platforms into offshore carbon capture hubs, utilizing renewable energy sources such as wind power for their operations.

Moreover, SeaO2 frames captured CO2 not as waste but as a viable resource. It foresees applications across multiple sectors, converting carbon into various chemicals and fuels. These applications not only provide potential new revenue streams but also facilitate emissions reductions where limited alternatives exist. The utilitarian view of CO2 sets a transformative precedent for other industries looking to achieve emission reduction targets.

The trajectory for SeaO2 showcases a merging of technological innovation with practical resource management, holding the potential to shape the future environmental footprint of aviation and other sectors. Projects of this nature illustrate the viable intersection of economic pragmatism with ecological responsibility, reflecting a nuanced understanding of contemporary energy challenges.",https://finance.coin-turk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/business-017-4.png,N,,2025-07-15 11:10:53.479907

The funding will support the development of a decentralised process to produce aviation fuel using seawater, renewable electricity, and captured CO2.

The project combines work in CO2 capture, electrochemical conversion, and catalysis to establish a method of fuel production that operates without biomass or fossil sources.

Producing aviation fuel from seawater and captured CO2

The project focuses on developing a process to produce aviation fuel from seawater and captured CO2, structured around four main areas. It begins with defining system requirements, use cases, and technical criteria for a viable water-to-e-SAF pathway.

The next phase advances SeaO2’s electrochemical technology to extract CO2 from seawater and generate hydrogen from ultrapure water. Captured CO2 is then converted into alcohols and olefins, core components of aviation fuel, using specialised reactor designs and catalysts.

Finally, a techno-economic analysis will assess the cost and scalability of the integrated process and benchmark it against conventional kerosene.

Ocean-based CO2 removal technology

Founded in 2021 by Ruben Brands and David Vermaas, SeaO2 is working to reduce carbon dioxide concentrations in the ocean, which in turn helps lower levels in the atmosphere.

Its goal is to remove 1 gigaton of CO2 by 2045 through a process called Direct Ocean Capture. This method passes seawater through an electrochemical system that removes CO2 before returning the treated water to the ocean, where it can absorb more CO2 from the air.

SeaO2 builds on technology developed at Delft University of Technology and Wetsus. The system operates without chemicals or external feedstock and relies fully on electricity, aligning with net-zero targets and electrified industry needs. It aims to offer a compact, modular approach to large-scale carbon removal using ocean-based systems.

Scaling vision

SeaO2 is expanding its Direct Ocean Capture (DOC) technology through a modular system designed for scale and integration. The units can be deployed across a range of water-pumping industries, including thermal power, desalination, and aquaculture, allowing for shared infrastructure and lower operational costs.

Looking ahead to the 2030s, SeaO2 plans to repurpose oil and gas platforms as offshore DOC hubs, combining them with offshore wind and geological storage. The captured CO2 can either be stored permanently as part of carbon removal strategies or used as feedstock for producing chemicals and fuels.

A valuable resource

SeaO2 also promotes the use of captured CO2 as a resource rather than a waste product. The carbon can be applied directly in sectors such as food, beverages, packaging, and agriculture, or converted into fuels and chemicals, including methanol, ethylene, alcohols, formic acid, formate, syngas, and urea. These uses support emission reduction in sectors with limited alternatives.",https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ruben-Brands-founder-of-SeaO2-Image-credit-SeaO2.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 11:11:04.029951

Cautions against overly burdensome controls that could disrupt supply, especially for limited supply products like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)

Advocating for practical, transparent and recognised verification processes with stakeholder input and balanced roles for certification bodies and member states

Reforms to improve the EU Biofuels Database (UDB) for better traceability

Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres – which recently signed a multi-year SAF agreement with British Airways – argued that a credible verification system was fundamental to realising the EU’s ambitious climate and sustainability goals.

“As a producer committed to authentic waste-to-fuel pathways, we view rigorous certification not as a hurdle but as essential infrastructure for the renewable fuels market,” he said.

“Our position paper reflects our dedication to fostering a transparent, equitable, and fraud-resistant ecosystem for biofuels that benefits all stakeholders – from producers and policy makers to consumers and the environment.”

The main challenges to SAF certification and widespread adoption include high production costs, limited feedstock availability and sustainability concerns, complex and evolving regulatory frameworks and certification processes, and the need for significant infrastructure development and investment.

The UK Department of Transport issued SAF Mandate: Compliance Guidance in January.

Data on the sustainability of fuel supplied must be verified by an approved third-party verifier before certificates will be issued.

Raman Ojha, president, Shell Aviation said, “This moment marks a significant milestone not only for Avelia but for the aviation sector.
Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF.","Shell Aviation, Accenture and Amex GBT have announced expansion of their sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solution, Avelia.

First unveiled three years ago, Avelia saw Shell Aviation supplying SAF into the aviation fuel network with a novel ‘book-and-claim’ mechanism enabling travellers to buy the SAF and, if it was not available at the departure airport, the SAF would instead be fed into another aircraft in an airport where it was available.

The new expansion sees Avelia “evolving to an industry solution with independent data hosting and a multi-supplier model”. In practice, this will mean that multiple suppliers will be accepted.

The partners are also investigating a BYOS (Bring Your Own SAF) model, enabling airlines to manage more of their SAF portfolio in Avelia, including SAF originally purchased outside of the Shell supply network as well as SAF that otherwise would have been tracked offline and not on a digital registry.

The intention is to increase the volume of SAF bought through the Avelia platform, “helping build credibility for book and claim at an industry level and accelerating SAF adoption”.

It will also provide companies with a clear, scalable pathway to credible business travel life cycle GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions reductions from aviation.

Although SAF is seen as essential for aviation to meet its net zero targets, according to IATA, in 2025, production is expected to reach only 2.1 million tonnes or 0.7% of total jet fuel production.

Avelia has established itself as the leading blockchain-powered ‘book and claim’ solution, helping companies to access the GHG benefits of SAF without being constrained by its physical availability at specific locations.

Shell Aviation, Accenture and Amex GBT announced that, as of 31 March 2025, more than 57 corporations and airlines had joined Avelia and over 900 retirements had been executed (use of SAF).

This contributed to the injection of over 33 million gallons of SAF into the existing global fuel network at 17 airports, equivalent to over 300,000 tonnes of CO2e abated, or the equivalent of 530,000 passengers flying from London to New York.

This week, Geelong Refinery successfully processed 10 tonnes of tyre pyrolysis oil alongside crude oil toproduce a full range of fuels and products. This follows the refinery processing a similar quantity of pyrolysis oil derived from waste plastic in May, demonstrating its capability to process at scale oils made from waste and the critical role the facility will play in Australia’s sustainable future.

The development is a significant step in plans to establish tyre-recycling in Melbourne. For this demonstration, the tyre pyrolysis oil was imported from Poland with appropriate approvals from the Australian Government – it is currently not available domestically.

Earlier this year, Viva Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with Klean Industries, a Canadian resource recovery and advanced recycling provider, to study the potential to create a tyre-recycling facility in Melbourne capable of processing up to 80,000 tonnes of used tyres per year.

The recycling facility proposed by Klean would extract three products from tyres: recovered carbon black (rCB), steel, and biogenic pyrolysis oil. Under the agreement, Viva Energy would take the biogenic pyrolysis oil for processing at Geelong Refinery, allowing it to create lower-carbon intensity fuels.

Viva Energy’s successful processing of tyre pyrolysis oil not only signals progress for Australia’s own sustainable fuel industry, but also brings the country in line with global efforts to advance circular economies.

Tyre pyrolysis oil is already recognised in the EU as a low-carbon alternative to traditional fuels and feedstocks. Australia currently does not recognise lower-carbon fuels made via co-processing, meaning the associated carbon reduction benefits cannot be claimed by Viva Energy’s customers.

That is something that could change with the right policy settings, according to Viva Energy Chief Strategy Officer Lachlan Pfeiffer.

“The refinery’s ability to process pyrolysis oil from both tyres and waste plastic demonstrates the versatility of our facility and our commitment to supporting a lower-carbon future,” Mr Pfeiffer said. “Viva Energy is proud to play a role in the production of lower-carbon fuels and products and reduce the number of tyres that go into landfill. The project can only proceed if the regulatory landscape encourages businesses to progress these important initiatives.”

It is a sentiment supported by Lina Goodman, CEO of Tyre Stewardship Australia, who said the processing of tyre pyrolysis oil at Geelong Refinery is a significant step forward in demonstrating the potential of end-of-life tyres as a valuable resource.

“Tyre pyrolysis oil is increasingly recognised internationally, particularly in the EU, as a low-carbon alternative,” she said. “We welcome initiatives that showcase the viability of these solutions at scale that extract value from end-of-life tyres and support the transition to a more sustainable, low-emissions future for Australia.”

Viva Energy’s successful refinement of tyre pyrolysis oil, produced using Klean Industries’ advanced thermal conversion technology, marks a significant milestone for the circular economy in Australia, according to Jesse Klinkhamer, Klean Industries Inc.

“This achievement not only confirms the quality and compatibility of our recovered oils with existing refining infrastructure but also demonstrates the commercial viability of converting end-of-life tyres into high-value, low-carbon fuels and chemicals. It's a crucial step forward in fulfilling Klean Industries’ vision of establishing a fully integrated resource recovery and low-carbon fuel production facility in Melbourne, Australia,” he said.

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA), which makes permanent or modifies key provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) and scales back numerous energy tax incentives enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This alert is a summary of certain general business tax, clean energy tax credit and international tax provisions of the OBBBA. All section references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

General Business Tax

Bonus Depreciation (Section 168(k) and (n))

Permanence. The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100 percent bonus depreciation under Section 168(k) for qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025.

Qualified Production Property. New Section 168(n) allows an immediate deduction for 100 percent of the cost of “qualified production property.” Generally, qualified production property is any domestic manufacturing, refining, agricultural production or chemical production facility the construction of which begins after January 19, 2025 and before January 1, 2029 and that is placed in service after July 4, 2025 and before January 1, 2031.

Domestic Research and Experimental (R&E) Expenditures (Section 174A)

Domestic R&E. The OBBBA restores immediate expensing of domestic R&E expenditures under new Section 174A for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. This reverses the five-year amortization requirement that took effect in 2022 under the TCJA. Section 174A does not allow expensing of amounts paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (including oil and gas).

Capitalization. Capitalization and amortization of domestic R&E expenditures remains available upon election.

Business Interest Limitation (Section 163(j))

EBITDA Calculation Reinstated. The OBBBA permanently returns the limitation on business interest deductibility to an EBITDA-based formula, reversing the more restrictive EBIT-based test in effect since 2022. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Ordering. The OBBBA provides that the Section 163(j) limitation is calculated prior to applying any interest capitalization provisions (subject to certain exceptions) and requires taxpayers to first apply their allowed business interest deduction against business interest that would otherwise be capitalized. This change takes effect for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Expansion of Qualifying Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Clean Energy Expansion. The OBBBA expands the definition of “qualifying income” under Section 7704 to include income from the transportation or storage of certain clean fuels, production of electricity from certain clean sources and other energy-transition infrastructure.

Partnership Transactions (Section 707(a)(2))

Self-execution. The OBBBA confirms that Section 707(a)(2), which addresses disguised sales between partners and partnerships, is self-executing. This eliminates any ambiguity about the enforceability of the disguised sales rules with respect to disguised sales of partnership interests in the absence of final regulations.

Deduction for Qualified Business Income (Section 199A)

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the 20 percent deduction for qualified business income.

Excess Business Loss Limitation (Section 461(l))

Permanence. The OBBBA makes permanent the limitation on excess business losses for noncorporate taxpayers, which was set to expire after 2028. Excess losses will continue to be converted into net operating losses carried forward to future years.

Qualified Opportunity Zones (QOZs) and Qualified Opportunity Funds (QOFs) (Subchapter Z)

QOZ Renewal. The OBBBA renews the QOZ program with new QOZ designations to be made on July 1, 2026 and each July 1st every 10 years thereafter. New QOZ designations will go into effect on January 1st of the year following the designation.

QOF Renewal. Similarly, new QOFs will be established with respect to newly designated QOZs. Investors in QOFs will be able to defer capital gains for up to five years. In addition, taxpayers will receive a partial basis step-up in their investment if their holding period is at least five years and recognize no gain if their holding period is between 10 and 30 years.

Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) Gain Exclusion (Section 1202)

Holding Period. Non-corporate taxpayers can exclude from taxable income gain on the disposition of QSBS if such stock was held for five years and certain other requirements are satisfied. The OBBBA changes the holding-period requirement for QSBS issued after July 4, 2025 to allow a 50 percent exclusion for QSBS held for three years, a 75 percent exclusion after four years and full exclusion after five years.

Cap Increases. For QSBS issued after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA increases the maximum gain that can be excluded from the disposition of QSBS of a single issuer from $10 million to $15 million. In addition, the maximum gross asset threshold for a C corporation to be a qualified small business increased from $50 million to $75 million. The increased amounts are indexed for inflation for subsequent years. These changes apply to QSBS issued after July 4, 2025.

Clean Energy Tax Credits

Clean Electricity Production and Investment Credits (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Wind and Solar. The OBBBA phases out the Section 45Y and 48E credits for wind and solar projects. Wind and solar projects that begin construction on or after July 5, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit. Wind and solar projects that begin construction prior to July 5, 2026 are eligible for the Section 45Y or 48E credit under the rules that existed prior to the passage of the OBBBA.

Fuel Cells. The OBBBA adds qualified fuel cell property to the property eligible for the Section 48E credit at a 30 percent rate. Fuel cell projects are not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or the zero greenhouse gas emissions rate requirement. Fuel cell projects are not eligible for any credit adders.

Other Technologies. The OBBBA modifies the phase-out rules under Sections 45Y and 48E for non-wind and non-solar projects. For any such projects that begin construction in 2034 and 2035, the Section 45Y and 48E credits are subject to a 25 percent and 50 percent reduction, respectively. Any such projects that begin construction in 2036 or later will not qualify for the Section 45Y or 48E credit.

Domestic Content Adder. The OBBBA makes the domestic content percentage requirements under Section 48E consistent with those under Section 45Y for projects that begin construction on or after June 16, 2025. Prior to the passage of the OBBBA, the domestic content percentage requirement under Section 48E was 40 percent but under Section 45Y ranged from 40 percent to 55 percent depending on when construction began.

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

Extension. The Section 45Z credit is extended by two years to include transportation fuel sold through December 31, 2029.

Feedstock. After December 31, 2025, transportation fuel must be exclusively derived from feedstock that is produced or grown in the United States, Mexico or Canada.

Emissions Rate. The emissions rate for a transportation fuel may not be less than zero; however, an exception allows negative emissions rates for fuels derived from animal manure. Further, the emissions rate shall be adjusted as necessary to exclude any emissions attributed to indirect land use changes. Such amendments apply to emissions rates published for transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The value of the Section 45Z credit for sustainable aviation fuel is reduced from $1.75 to $1.00 for each gallon produced after December 31, 2025.

No Double Counting. To qualify for the credit, the transportation fuel must not be produced from a fuel for which the Section 45Z credit was allowable.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

Rate Parity. The base credit rate for carbon oxides captured from an industrial source and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $12 to $17 per metric ton so that it is equal to the base credit rate for permanent sequestration. Similarly, in the case of direct air capture facilities, the base credit rate for carbon oxides captured and injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery or utilized is increased from $26 to $36 per metric ton. Such increases apply to facilities or equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Wind Components. The Section 45X credit is terminated for wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027.

Metallurgical Coal. Metallurgical coal that is suitable for the production of steel (regardless of whether production occurs inside or outside of the United States) was added as an applicable critical mineral. This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Phase-out. The phase-out of the Section 45X credit was modified so that the credit (other than with respect to metallurgical coal) is subject to a 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent reduction in 2031, 2032 and 2033, respectively. The Section 45X credit terminates for metallurgical coal after 2029 and for other applicable critical minerals after 2033.

Battery Modules. The definition of “battery module” was changed to require each module to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.” This change applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Integrated Components. The OBBBA allows manufacturers to claim the Section 45X credit on multiple primary components that are integrated, incorporated or assembled into secondary components if (a) the primary components are produced in the same facility as the secondary components, (b) the secondary components are sold to unrelated persons and (c) at least 65 percent of the direct material costs to produce the secondary components are attributable to primary components that are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

Termination. The Section 45V credit is terminated for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2027.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules

The OBBBA restricts taxpayers with connections to certain countries or foreign entities from claiming credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z and 48E. The FEOC rules largely relate to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea (as well as certain listed foreign persons and entities, which are not discussed below). In general, a taxpayer is prohibited from claiming credits under any one of the following circumstances:

The taxpayer is a “specified foreign entity.”

A specified foreign entity includes, among others, (a) the government of China, Russia, Iran or North Korea; (b) a citizen or national of one of those countries (provided that such person is not a U.S. citizen, national or resident); (c) an entity organized in, or having its principal place of business in, one of those countries; and (d) an entity owned more than 50 percent by persons described in clauses (a) through (c).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the Section 45Z credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer is a “foreign-influenced entity.”

A foreign-influenced entity includes an entity with respect to which (a) a specified foreign entity has authority to appoint board members or officers, (b) a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent of such entity, (c) multiple specified foreign entities own at least 40 percent of such entity or (d) at least 15 percent of the debt of such entity is held by specified foreign entities.

Except in the case of Sections 45Q and 45Z, a foreign-influenced entity also includes an entity that made payments to a specified foreign entity in the prior taxable year pursuant to a contract, agreement or arrangement (e.g., a license) that allows the specified foreign entity (or a related entity) to exercise effective control over a project or the production of any components (Specified Foreign Entity Payments).

This restriction applies to the credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y and 48E for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 and to the Section 45Z credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

The taxpayer receives “material assistance” on a project from specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities.

A project is deemed to receive material assistance if the material assistance cost ratio for the project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The threshold percentages increase over time and range from 40 percent to 90 percent depending on the year, credit and technology. The material assistance cost ratio is computed as a fraction, with the numerator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components not manufactured by specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities, and the denominator equaling total direct costs attributable to manufactured products and components.

The Secretary of the Treasury is required to issue safe harbor tables by December 31, 2026 identifying total direct cost percentages attributable to manufactured products and components. Until the safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on the percentages in the domestic content safe harbor tables in IRS Notice 2025-08, certifications from suppliers regarding direct costs and certifications from suppliers stating that manufactured products and components were not manufactured or produced by a specified foreign entity or foreign-influenced entity.

This restriction applies to the credits under Section 45Y and 48E for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 (on a project-by-project basis) and to the Section 45X credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

In addition, if a taxpayer makes Specified Foreign Entity Payments within 10 years after a project claiming the Section 48E credit is placed in service, the full amount of the credit claimed is subject to recapture. This restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

International Tax

Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) (Now “Net CFC Tested Income” (NCTI)) (Section 904)

Rate. The OBBBA modifies the global intangible low-taxed income inclusion rules such that a corporation’s effective GILTI rate will increase from 10.5 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the GILTI rate to 13.125 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Currently, a taxpayer can effectively exclude 10 percent of a controlled foreign corporation’s qualified business asset investment (QBAI) from the taxpayer’s GILTI inclusion calculation. The OBBBA eliminates this QBAI exclusion for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) (Now “Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income” (FDDEI)) (Section 250)

Rate. Similar to those modifications made to the GILTI regime, the OBBBA modifies the FDII rules such that a corporation’s effective FDII rate will increase from 13.125 percent to 14 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change preempts the increase in the FDII rate to 16.4 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

QBAI. Similar to QBAI with respect to GILTI, the OBBBA eliminates the QBAI exclusion for FDII for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) (Section 59A)

Rate. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the BEAT rate will increase from 10 percent to 10.5 percent. This change preempts the increase in the BEAT rate to 12.5 percent that was scheduled to take effect.

Tax Credit Transfers (Section 6418) Background The IRA made certain tax credits (including the section 45Y PTC and 48E ITC) transferable for cash on a one-time basis, subject to certain limitations.
Please see our prior client alert on the IRA tax credit transfer regime here.
[19] The bonus is not available for the section 48E ITC.","Client Alert | July 14, 2025

This update details changes made by the Act to the tax benefits for clean energy projects, including the new limitations on certain energy-related tax credits enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA).

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA or the Act),[1] which enacts significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax benefits available to clean energy projects. The text of the Act can be found here. Our prior alert on the tax highlights of the Act can be found here.

This alert provides further details regarding the changes made by the OBBBA to the tax benefits for clean energy projects, including the new limitations on certain energy-related tax credits enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IRA).[2]

Wind and Solar Energy (Sections 45Y and 48E)

Background

Before the OBBBA, qualifying wind and solar projects were eligible for a production tax credit (PTC) under section 45Y or an investment tax credit (ITC) under section 48E. Under the IRA, the section 45Y PTC and section 48E ITC were subject to phase-out following the later of 2032 or the year the Treasury Secretary determined that the annual greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) from the production of electricity in the United States was equal to or less than 25 percent of a 2022 baseline. Our prior alert on the section 45Y and 48E credits can be found here.

Under pre-OBBBA IRS guidance (first issued in 2014), a wind or solar project that began construction would qualify for ITCs or PTCs if it was placed in service by the end of the fourth calendar year after the year in which construction began (assuming other applicable requirements are met).[3] Construction of a project was deemed to “begin” by the performance of physical work of a significant nature or by satisfying a safe harbor through payment or incurrence of at least five percent of certain project costs.[4] That pre-OBBBA IRS guidance contains rules governing the type of “physical work” that qualifies but specifically provides that “there is no fixed minimum amount of work or monetary or percentage threshold required to satisfy” the physical work standard.[5]

Projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026

Under the Act, qualifying wind and solar projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 must be placed in service by December 31, 2027 to be eligible for ITCs and PTCs.

Projects that begin construction on or before July 4, 2026[6]

As of the date of this alert (July 14, 2025), the section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC placement-in-service deadline is uncertain for qualifying wind and solar projects that began construction before July 4, 2026 and thus are exempt from the December 31, 2027 placement-in-service deadline.

This uncertainty stems from President Trump’s July 7, 2025 Executive Order that directed the Treasury Secretary, by August 18, 2025, to “strictly enforce the termination of the [section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC] for wind and solar facilities,” which includes

issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

Both the scope of the Executive Order and the manner in which it will be interpreted are unclear, and we will publish another alert once this guidance is issued.

Certain Leasing Arrangements

For taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the OBBBA prohibits the section 48E ITC for qualified investments in certain small wind facilities (used in connection with a residential dwelling unit by the lessee) if the taxpayer rents or leases the facilities to a third party, and disallows the section 45Y PTC with respect to electricity produced by such facilities during those taxable years.

Application of the prohibition is uncertain with respect to facilities generating electricity from solar energy. The heading of the provision states that it applies to “solar leasing arrangements,” but the prohibition by its terms (and a potentially errant cross-reference) applies to solar water heating property, which is not eligible for either the section 48E ITC or section 45Y PTC in the first instance.

Foreign Entity of Concern Rules (FEOC)

The OBBBA also introduces new section 48E ITC and section 45Y PTC eligibility requirements that target certain foreign (e.g., China) ownership or influence with respect to benefited projects and participation in supply chains (collectively, “Foreign Restrictions”).[7] As discussed below, some or all of the restrictions also apply to various other credits.

More specifically, the section 45Y PTC and section 48E ITC are not allowed to a “specified foreign entity” (SFE) or a “foreign-influenced entity” (FIE), nor are they allowed with respect to a facility the construction of which receives “material assistance” from an SFE or an FIE. These three concepts are discussed in more detail below.

SFE: An SFE is defined to include the governments (including agencies and instrumentalities) of China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea; citizens or nationals of any of those countries;[8] entities or branches formed in or having their principal place of business in any of those countries; and controlled entities and subsidiaries of any of the above (determined on a more-than-50 percent equity ownership basis and regardless of jurisdiction of organization).[9] SFE status is generally determined as of the last day of the taxable year.[10]

FIE: An FIE is defined as an entity that meets any of the following tests: (i) an SFE has direct authority to appoint certain officers, (ii) an SFE has at least 25 percent equity ownership or, taken together with other SFEs, at least 40 percent equity ownership, (iii) one or more SFEs has issued at least 15 percent of the entity’s debt, or (iv) the entity made an “effective control” payment to an SFE during the previous year (discussed below). FIE status is determined as of the last day of the taxable year.

Effective Control: An entity makes an “effective control” payment if, during the previous taxable year, the entity made a payment to an SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement that entitles the SFE (or a related party) to exercise “specific authority over key aspects” of the energy generation of the entity’s (or a related person’s) facility that are “not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt” that otherwise would determine FIE status. The OBBBA goes on to provide a broad list of contractual provisions (relating to amount and timing of electricity production, offtake arrangements, access to data, and facility maintenance and repair) that convey impermissible authority to a counterparty. The OBBBA is especially scrutinous of intellectual property licenses (other than qualifying bona fide sales)—for example, any such arrangement (relating to a facility) that is entered into after July 4, 2025 is deemed to convey effective control to the SFE.[11]

Material Assistance: A facility receives “material assistance” from an SFE or FIE if an impermissible amount of the total direct costs of the manufactured products (including components) incorporated into the facility upon completion of construction are mined, produced, or manufactured by an SFE or an FIE. Pending receipt of Treasury guidance contemplated by the Act, taxpayers may rely on certifications from suppliers of manufactured products to determine if those products (or components) were manufactured by an SFE or FIE; new penalties apply to false or inaccurate supplier certifications.[12] Stricter penalties (and an extended statute of limitations) apply to assessments in respect of credits disallowed for “material assistance” violations.

Special rules allow publicly traded entities to rely on publicly reported information to determine their SFE and FIE status.[13]

The SFE ownership, FIE, and “effective control” rules apply to credits claimed for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the “material assistance” rules apply to projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

The “effective control” payment rules are also backed up by a new section 48E ITC recapture rule, effective for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Under this rule, for the 10 years after a qualifying facility is placed in service, a section 48E ITC is subject to 100-percent recapture (i.e., no vesting) if the taxpayer (i) is allowed a section 48E ITC for any taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 and (ii) makes a payment to an SFE (“with respect to a taxable year”) pursuant to a contract that entitles the SFE (or a related person) to “effective control” over any facility of the taxpayer or a related person.[14] The recapture tax is due in the year the “effective control” payment is made.

The OBBBA did not include a controversial proposed excise tax included in prior versions of the legislation that would have applied to wind and solar facilities (regardless of whether ITCs or PTCs were claimed) that incorporated certain components sourced from prohibited foreign sources.

Domestic Content Clarification

The Act aligns the thresholds for the domestic content bonus credit under the section 48E ITC with the domestic content thresholds under the section 45Y PTC by increasing the section 48E thresholds to match the section 45Y requirements. In an apparent drafting glitch made by Congress in the IRA, the domestic content thresholds were lower under section 48E as compared to the domestic content thresholds under section 45Y.[15] This change is effective for facilities the construction of which begins on or after June 16, 2025.

Depreciation

The Act does not affect the eligibility of solar or wind projects to claim preferential five-year accelerated depreciation.

Battery Storage (Section 48E)

Background

Before the OBBBA, qualifying energy storage projects were eligible for the section 48E ITC, subject to phase-out on the same timeline as wind and solar projects (discussed above).

OBBBA Changes

The OBBBA did not change the section 48E ITC eligibility timeline for battery storage projects.

The OBBBA subjects storage projects seeking the section 48E ITC to the Foreign Restrictions applicable to wind and solar projects (discussed above), albeit with stricter “material assistance” provisions.

Fuel Cells (Section 45V and 48E)

Background

Under prior law, fuel cells were eligible for credits under Section 48E only if those cells met the emissions requirements of that section. Because feedstocks for fuel cell projects typically produce GGEs, this often made eligibility for the section 48E ITC challenging.

OBBBA Changes

Qualifying fuel cell projects that begin construction after December 31, 2025 are now eligible for a new 30-percent ITC that exempts the projects from the IRA’s prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements and GGE requirements. The new ITC is not eligible for the domestic content and energy community bonuses made available under the IRA.[16]

The Act also moves up the commencement-of-construction deadline for the IRA’s 10-year credit under section 45V for the production of clean hydrogen (a fuel cell feedstock) from January 1, 2033 to January 1, 2028. The Foreign Restrictions do not apply to the clean hydrogen PTC. Our prior alert on the section 45V credit can be found here.

Clean Fuels (Section 45Z)

Background

Before the OBBBA, section 45Z provided a PTC for clean transportation fuel, including a higher credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel. This credit was not available for fuel sold after December 31, 2027

OBBBA Changes

The Act extends the clean fuel production credit by two years, with the result that eligible fuel sold until December 31, 2029 is eligible for this credit.

The Act also relaxes the lifecycle GGE rules for credit-eligible fuel produced after 2025 by excluding the effects of indirect land use changes from the lifecycle GGE calculation.

In an apparent negative reaction to Treasury and IRS guidance released earlier this year, the OBBBA also authorizes the Treasury Secretary to confirm that sales by a taxpayer to an intermediary are permitted if the taxpayer has reason to believe that the fuel ultimately will be sold to an unrelated person.[17]

The Act effectively introduces a new cap on the credit. As background, the credit’s rate is the product of a formula that reduces the credit by reference to a specific fuel’s GGE rate; before the Act, however, fuels with a negative GGE rate could have seen their credit rate increase over the headline statutory rate under the Code’s formula.[18] The Act prospectively limits the fuels for which negative GGE rates that can be taken into account to fuels from specific animal manure feedstocks (e.g., dairy, swine, poultry).

The Act also provides that, for fuel produced after 2025, the credit is available only for fuel derived exclusively from feedstocks produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. The Act also eliminates the enhanced credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025.

Certain of the Foreign Restrictions also apply to clean fuel PTCs. The SFE ownership prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Nuclear (Section 45Y and 48E)

Background

Under current law, qualifying nuclear projects are eligible for PTCs under section 45Y or ITCs under section 48E.

OBBBA Changes

Under the Act, a bonus amount was added to the section 45Y PTC for certain nuclear facilities placed in service in metropolitan statistical areas that have (or, at any time after December 31, 2009, has had) at least 0.17 percent direct employment in nuclear-related sectors.[19] The bonus amount is available for qualifying projects that begin construction in taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The Foreign Restrictions apply to ITCs or PTCs for new nuclear projects on the same timeline as wind and solar projects. For nuclear facilities placed in service before the IRA and claiming the section 45U PTC, the SFE prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration (CCUS) (Section 45Q)

Background

Prior to the OBBBA, section 45Q provided a tax credit of $60 per metric ton for qualified CCUS facilities that captured qualified carbon oxides (QCOs) and either “utilized” (e.g., used in a commercial process) the QCOs or used the QCOs for enhanced oil and gas recovery. Qualified CCUS facilities that stored QCOs in secure geological formations were eligible for a higher credit of $85 per metric ton.[20]

OBBBA Changes

The OBBBA increases the section 45Q credit for QCOs that are “utilized” or used in enhanced oil or natural gas recovery to equal the credit rate for QCOs that are stored in secure geological formations. The credit rate increase applies to equipment placed in service after July 4, 2025

The SFE ownership prohibition and the FIE prohibition (other than the “effective control” payment rules) apply to CCUS projects for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

Background

The IRA made available a tax credit for the production and sale of certain eligible solar, wind, and energy storage components manufactured in the United States, as well as the production of certain critical minerals. The credits (other than the credits for critical minerals) were subject to a phaseout beginning in 2030.

OBBBA Changes

The Act introduces a new category of credit-eligible critical minerals—metallurgical coal suitable for use in the production of steel, regardless of where produced. The metallurgical coal credit is 2.5 percent of qualifying production costs (as compared to the 10 percent credit for other critical minerals).

The credit for wind components is terminated for components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The Act phases out the credit for critical minerals (other than metallurgical coal) starting in 2031 and terminates the new credit for metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029.

The Act also revises the definition of credit-eligible battery module production to require inclusion of all essential equipment necessary for battery functionality.

The Foreign Restrictions are made applicable to section 45X but are generally applied to the production of components (rather the construction of the facility) and are subject to separate “material assistance” thresholds.

These changes are effective for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025.

The OBBA did not adopt an earlier Senate proposal to prohibit claiming multiple credits (or “stacking”) for the production of components that are integrated into and sold as a single product but did add new requirements to qualify for such stacking. To be eligible for stacking, the components must be produced at the same facility, the end product must be sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65 percent of the direct material costs of the underlying components must be attributable to United States mining, production, or manufacturing. This change is effective for components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

Tax Credit Transfers (Section 6418)

Background

The IRA made certain tax credits (including the section 45Y PTC and 48E ITC) transferable for cash on a one-time basis, subject to certain limitations. Please see our prior client alert on the IRA tax credit transfer regime here.

OBBBA Changes

The Act largely leaves intact the tax credit transfer regime introduced by the IRA; for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, however, an SFE cannot buy section 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, or 48E credits.[21]

New Classes of Qualified Income for Publicly Traded Partnerships (Section 7704)

Background

Publicly traded partnerships are generally taxed as corporations unless they derive at least 90 percent of their income from certain qualifying sources. Prior to the OBBBA, qualifying sources were limited to passive income and income from certain fossil fuel-related energy or transportation activities.

OBBBA Changes

The Act expands the definition of “qualifying income” to include income derived from qualifying hydrogen storage and transportation; electricity production from qualifying nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal facilities; carbon capture facilities, including electricity production from qualifying facilities with sufficient carbon capture; and thermal energy from hydropower and geothermal facilities.

The amendment is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Why Does the Navy Need a Heavy Lift UAV?

The Navy is inquiring about an unmanned heavy lift aircraft to sustain combat effectiveness in future wars by ensuring logistics can reach small, dispersed and vulnerable forces in denied or degraded environments without putting humans or high-value assets at risk. Other priorities include better supporting distributed maritime operations, operating in contested environments, reducing the logistics footprint and bridging capability gaps.

The Navy is wasting no time preparing contract awards for this effort. Naval Air Systems Command, or NAVAIR, is considering awarding an other transaction agreement for ULS-A in FY 2026.

Let’s dive into the potential offerors for this highly-anticipated program.

Phenix Solutions Ultra 2XL

Phenix Solutions of Oregon has developed a heavy-lift dual coaxial rotor UAV that is capable of carrying more than 1,300 lbs, a company official told ExecutiveGov. The platform can use an enclosed payload container or a sling to carry its payload beneath the aircraft.

The Ultra 2XL can carry varying payload amounts depending on fuel levels and total payload. The Ultra 2XL can perform ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-shore logistics missions.

The company is promoting the Ultra 2XL as providing an existing and proven Technology Readiness Level-8 vehicle designed for use as a tactical unmanned resupply aircraft. The platform can perform multiple military and civilian missions beyond visual line of sight and its mission modules can be quickly reconfigured in the field if mission requirements change.

Phenix Solutions was awarded the Next Generation Logistics Unmanned Aircraft System Phase I contract specifically focusing on heavy lift aircraft, vertical replenishment logistics and ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore cargo delivery. Phenix was also selected as an original equipment UAS manufacturer for an important U.S. Marine Corps program—Medium Air Resupply Vehicle-Expeditionary Logistics, or MARV-EL, Phase I, which has similar requirements to ULS-A.

The company is in the process of submitting for the next phase of MARV-EL and expects a contract decision to be made by the end of the year.

Near Earth Autonomy RUC-60

Near Earth Autonomy is developing an optionally-piloted aircraft based on the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter that has been in service with the DOD for generations. The platform is being promoted as performing logistics missions in contested environments and can carry 2,500 lbs 125 n miles, a company official told ExecutiveGov.

Near Earth Autonomy believes retrofit kits are the most efficient way to rapidly address the need by upgrading existing aircraft into uncrewed logistics solutions. The company is also developing retrokit solutions for the AgustaWestland AW139, the Kaman KARGO UAV and the TRV-150 quadcopter.

The Army in April awarded Near Earth Autonomy a $15 million contract to retrofit UH-60Ls with its advanced autonomy kits to make the helicopters uncrewed and high-tempo logistics aircraft. The initiative creates a repeatable and scalable process and allows the Army to avoid long acquisition timelines and unlock new capabilities from legacy aircraft.

Near Earth Autonomy highlights its Captain deterministic autonomy architecture as central to this program. Designed for performance in complex and degraded environments, Captain enables safe flight and hazard avoidance without needing onboard crew, a remote pilot or a continuous data link. Near Earth Autonomy is leveraging a modular open systems approach, or MOSA, for this UH-60L retrofit contract.

The Army will work with Near Earth Autonomy to develop new operational procedures for autonomous logistics by performing a series of autonomous flights. This should lead to a mature, mission-ready product. Near Earth Autonomy began working toward an unmanned Black Hawk in 2021.

Sabrewing Aircraft Rhaegal

Sabrewing Aircraft is developing a regional cargo unmanned aircraft capable of carrying up to 5,400 lbs of payload over 1,000 n miles in vertical takeoff and landing, or VTOL, mode. If a customer prioritizes larger payload capacity for the Rhaegal, the horizontal runway takeoff and landing permits up to 10,000 lbs of payload, according to Sabrewing’s website.

The Rhaegal achieved its first hover flight in 2022 while lifting 829 lbs. The company touts the Rhaegal’s ability to use sustainable aviation fuel to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80 percent.

Sabrewing has landed a number of contracts, including one from Ameriflight, who intends on purchasing 35 Rhaegals. Ameriflight intends to use the platform to enter new business opportunities in distribution center logistics as part of a diversified aviation services business model.

Piasecki Kaman KARGO

Piasecki Aircraft made a huge splash earlier this year when it acquired the KARGO heavy lift quadcopter UAV from Kaman Air Vehicles, developer of the K-Max TITAN heavy lift helicopter. The KARGO is a medium-lift, autonomous UAV that has been demonstrated to both the U.S. Marine Corps and Army for its VTOL cargo capabilities. The platform has a payload capacity of 1,000 lbs with a range of up to 500 n miles, according to Defense News.

The KARGO is designed to fit in a standard shipping container and can be unloaded and operated by as few as two people. Kaman, while owning the KARGO UAV program, received an initial $12 million contract from the USMC for MARV-EL and has two existing full-scale prototypes, according to a company statement.",https://media.executivegov.com/2025/07/heavy-lift-uav-navy-logistics-ulsa.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 18:08:29.463359

This initiative aims to boost the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by welcoming more fuel suppliers into its blockchain-powered system. The partners believe this evolution will make SAF accessible to a wider audience, potentially stimulating more environmentally conscious choices in air travel, even if availability remains limited at certain airports.

Before this development, Avelia had launched in 2022 offering 1 million gallons of SAF, initially sourcing only from Shell Aviation. Now, with over 57 companies and airlines on board, Avelia has injected over 33 million gallons of SAF across 17 global locations, cutting down more than 300,000 tonnes of CO2e when compared to traditional jet fuel. Previous estimations on SAF production indicated that by 2025, it would comprise a mere 0.7% of all aviation fuel consumption. This underlines the pressing need for platforms like Avelia to amplify SAF’s presence in the aviation sector.

Can Avelia’s Growth Transform SAF Accessibility?

The initiative’s expansion to a multi-supplier model is central to its strategy. This change allows participants to source SAF from various suppliers and consolidate their activities within Avelia. Shell, Accenture, and Amex GBT believe introducing more fuel suppliers will strengthen the platform’s credibility and impact. Furthermore, the “Bring Your Own SAF” feature aims to offer airlines more control over their SAF portfolios, even for fuel acquired outside the current supply network.

How Is Technology Enhancing Avelia’s Objectives?

Blockchain technology is pivotal in Avelia’s enhancements. Accenture now manages the platform’s data, ensuring a secure, transparent, and externally verified system. By doing so, Avelia seeks to foster trust among participants and encourage broader adoption within the industry.

Industry experts have expressed optimism about these updates. Evan Konwiser of Amex GBT highlighted the platform’s capacity to mitigate Scope 3 emissions for companies, underscoring its role in advancing the first and most established book-and-claim SAF system. Shell’s Raman Ojha noted this moment as significant not only for Avelia but also for the wider aviation sector.

Meanwhile, Accenture’s Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg emphasized the importance of strategic partnership in elevating the platform’s capabilities and maintaining data transparency. By leveraging blockchain and fostering a collaborative environment, Avelia aligns itself with the aviation industry’s sustainability goals.

Avelia’s recent advances highlight the strategic marriage of technology and sustainability. As aviation continues grappling with its environmental footprint, platforms like Avelia represent proactive efforts to confront these challenges. Despite its potential, ongoing collaboration and technological refinement will be crucial to overcoming existing barriers and facilitating broader SAF usage across the sector.",https://finance.coin-turk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/business-003-3.png,N,,2025-07-14 17:07:07.264377

The discussion also included a new partnership as an example of how Phillips 66 is unlocking that value.
The airline has received 5 million gallons of neat SAF from Phillips 66 through June at Los Angeles International Airport.
“We’re historically a traditional energy company, but our view is that we need all forms of energy.”","Phillips 66’s integrated model uniquely positions the company for success in the energy transition, Phillips 66 EVP of Commercial and Marketing Brian Mandell said recently. Mandell participated in a keynote fireside chat at the Reuters Global Energy Transition Conference in New York City last month, discussing integration across the Phillips 66 value chain and how it helps the company pursue lower-carbon opportunities. The discussion also included a new partnership as an example of how Phillips 66 is unlocking that value.

“What’s interesting about our integrated system is you can take assets and leverage them for new opportunities,” Mandell said. “We’re focused on both traditional energies and also emerging energies, particularly renewable fuels.”

Mandell mentioned Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as an example, announcing a new deal with British Airways. The airline has received 5 million gallons of neat SAF from Phillips 66 through June at Los Angeles International Airport. The deal joins a growing list of other agreements the company has recently made.

“We were the first refinery in the UK to produce SAF at scale, and in 2022, we did a deal with British Airways to sell them that product,” Mandell said. “Last year we announced a deal with United at Chicago O’Hare International Airport.”

Setting Phillips 66 apart

Mandell also highlighted the transformation of the company’s San Francisco refinery, which now runs 50,000 barrels a day of feedstock.

“We saw an opportunity to convert that refinery into a renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel refiner,” said Mandell, referring to the renamed Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex. “Rodeo is part of our newest segment, our renewables segment, and is a great example of how we are evaluating opportunities for lower-carbon solutions.” Part of Phillips 66’s integrated model also includes a commercial organization that focuses on “finding the right feedstock, the right price, at the right time to make sure what the plant needs, we have,” Mandell said.

Mandell explained that optimizing plants by running the best suited feedstock is how Phillips 66 unlocked other opportunities. This allows for the most efficient slate for a refinery while staying customer-centric.

Mandell provided an example of California’s desire for renewable diesel, where Phillips 66 supplies over 600 76® branded stores. “Our integrated model can take renewable diesel to the end consumer. We’re constantly trying to get the product all the way through that last mile.”

Collaboration is necessary

Effort by various stakeholders is needed to continue the development and implementation of renewable fuels, said Mandell. Using SAF as an example, he noted it is difficult to invest and innovate with changing policies, thus calling for more collaboration.

“We’re going to need airlines, shippers, airports, producers and the government to all work together to develop [the SAF] market,” said Mandell. “We’re historically a traditional energy company, but our view is that we need all forms of energy.”",https://www.phillips66.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/BAYWAYSTILLS0060.png,N,,2025-07-14 16:09:53.545970

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago.
Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.
It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.
But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.","Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

And Washington state's support for sustainable aviation fuel goes beyond tax incentives.

Washington State University is globally the top contributing organization to scientific literature in the sustainable aviation fuel field, based on an analysis of articles, papers, editorials and news items published between 2001 to 2023. Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Laboratory (BSEL) at WSU Tri-Cities and co-director of the WSU-PNNL Bioproducts Institute, was the most cited author.

At the end of 2024, SkyNRG Americas Inc. announced its proposal to build on property purchased from the Port of Walla Walla near the Columbia River for a sustainable aviation fuel production facility. The project has also received a $1.5 million grant from the state Department of Commerce, as part of the Governor’s Economic Development Strategic Reserve Fund.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.",https://www.tricitiesbusinessnews.com/ext/resources/2025/07/14/Airplane.jpg?height=635&t=1752513003&width=1200,N,,2025-07-14 15:10:08.055200

This comprised a quantifiable decline in jet fuel and petrol consumption, mainly due to decreased air and road traffic due to seasonal weather disruptions. Consequently, the jet kerosene demand continued to be subdued irrespective of continuous year-on-year revival in the aviation business.

On the supply side, local refiners remained steady at operations levels, holding substantial inventories of jet kerosene through the month. Leading players such as Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (IOCL) kept ATF supplied continuously, augmented by strong infrastructure, including sophisticated hydrant fueling systems in prominent airports and strategic storage sites. In addition, consistent import volumes—particularly U.S., Brazilian, and Russian crude oil quantities—served to augment the well-stocked supply environment, positioning inventories comfortably in front of demand.

The India Refining Summit in June also underscored the changing strategy of the industry, centering around more valuable petrochemicals and cleaner technologies to drive long-term efficiency and sustainability. Although these changes may not have yet directly affected pricing, they announce structural shifts that can impact the Jet kerosene market in the years ahead.

Even with the declining trend throughout June, jet kerosene prices saw a sudden 7.5% swing in early July. Industry analysts attribute this dramatic turn, they say, to diminishing inventory positions, speculative positions, or pre-policy adjustment changes in the aviation fuel mix.

India will put a mandate on domestic carriers to mix at least 1% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in their ATF consumption from sometime later in 2025. Subject to the availability of biofuels, the mandate could be increased to 4–5%, which could fundamentally alter the demand profile for conventional jet kerosene in the near term.

At the same time, international forces are also impacting the wider jet kerosene market. International demand has been weakening, and the International Energy Agency reduced its projection of 2025 jet fuel consumption in light of diminished cross-border travel by Chinese tourists and regulatory uncertainty in the United States.

As per ChemAnalyst, the price of Jet Kerosene is expected to remain volatile, in the forthcoming days. Ongoing global trade uncertainties may disrupt the oil supply in the region leading to increased production cost of Jet Kerosene in the market.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-14 14:13:49.264030

Billionaire Elon Musk's company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that the meeting would be held Nov. 6, but that may prove troublesome because it comes nearly three months after it is required to do so under state law in Texas, where the company is incorporated.

The annual meeting, given Tesla's fortunes this year, has the potential to be a raucous event and it is unclear how investors will react to the delay, which is rare for any major U.S. corporation.

Tesla shares have plunged 27% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump, as well as rising competition.

The announcement of the meeting comes a day after a group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders sent a letter to the company's board pressing for an annual meeting after receiving no word of one with the deadline just days away.

Many shareholders have been miffed by Musk's participation in the Trump administration this year, saying he needs to focus on his EV company which is facing extraordinary pressures.

“An annual meeting provides shareholders with the opportunity to hear directly from the board about these concerns, and to vote for or against directors, the board’s approach to executive compensation, and other matters of material importance,” the group said in the letter.

The group cited Texas law, which requires companies to schedule annual shareholders meetings within 13 months of the prior annual meeting.

Tesla’s last shareholders meeting was on June 13 of last year, where investors voted to restore Musk’s record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier that year.

Safety Responsibilities While carbon pipelines haven’t noted a fatality since reporting began in 1988, like any project of this magnitude, landowners and advocacy groups have voiced concerns about safety.
“We've been operating CO2 pipelines in this country for 40 years, and they've been operating even longer in other countries,” Shaw said.
The federal Department of Transportation, through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), is ultimately responsible for issuing and enforcing safety regulations.
Inspections are performed by the pipeline company and pipeline regulators, according to the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit public watchdog organization.","As the ethanol industry seeks to decarbonize, so as to meet tax credit requirements, pipeline companies are planning to establish routes across the Midwest. Those pipelines will transport and sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during ethanol production, allowing ethanol plants to take advantage of tax credits.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 expanded the 45Q tax credit.

According to documentation from the Iowa Corn Growers Association, this credit incentivizes carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), with the federal government providing funding as follows:

$85 per metric ton (17¢ cents per gallon of ethanol) for CO2 permanently sequestered underground, and

$60 per metric ton (12¢ cents per gallon of ethanol) for CO2 used for enhanced oil recovery or other industrial uses.

The 45Z tax credit specifically incentivizes fuel producers to lower their carbon intensity (CI) scores to 50 or lower. For on-road vehicles, 45Z offers 2¢ per gallon, up to $1 per gallon for every CI point reduction below 50. For sustainable aviation fuel, 45Z offers 3½¢ per gallon, up to $1.75 per gallon for every CI point reduction below 50.

Growing a Pipeline

The first large-scale CO2 pipeline in the U.S. was the Canyon Reef pipeline, established in the 1970s for use during the enhanced oil recovery process in the Permian Basin in Texas. Pipeline infrastructure grew to around 3,000 miles during the early 2000s. Now there are over 5,300 miles of carbon pipelines in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).

The U.S. Department of Energy estimates the country will need an increase of up to 20 times the existing carbon pipeline mileage by 2050. Several studies have attempted to optimize the required pipelines. based on varying estimates of CO2 that will need to be transported, with an estimated 30,000 to 96,000 miles of additional carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) pipelines required by 2050, according to the Department of Energy. In addition to the expansion in pipeline capacity, other modes of CO2 transportation will also be required for facilitating offshore storage, shorter routes, and collection from facilities, including barge, ship, train, and truck.

Safety Responsibilities

While carbon pipelines haven’t noted a fatality since reporting began in 1988, like any project of this magnitude, landowners and advocacy groups have voiced concerns about safety.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, a trade association for ethanol producers, said confusion and political agendas have clouded the discussion around carbon pipeline safety.

“We've been operating CO2 pipelines in this country for 40 years, and they've been operating even longer in other countries,” Shaw said. “There's never been a loss of life — you can't say that for almost anything else — so the track record is pretty good. I have to differentiate between the people who have safety questions, and the people who use questions as a political instrument to oppose CO2 pipelines because they don't like them.”

Congress has the ultimate responsibility to set pipeline safety regulations. The federal Department of Transportation, through its Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), is ultimately responsible for issuing and enforcing safety regulations. States are allowed to accept the responsibility for regulations within their borders with an annual certification from PHMSA. State and local governments can regulate development near pipelines with their land use authority.

Inspections are performed by the pipeline company and pipeline regulators, according to the Pipeline Safety Trust, a nonprofit public watchdog organization. Requirements for pipeline inspections vary on factors such as contents, location, and width. Some techniques include aerial flyovers, truck drive-bys, or on-foot inspections. Internal inspections are performed by a device called a “smart pig,” which travels through the pipeline, using sensors to detect corrosion, dents, scratches, and other weaknesses.

PHMSA requires pipeline companies to produce dispersion models, as well as risk analyses to identify potential impacts to high-consequence areas. Factors include topography, weather, leaked CO2 volume, and pipe diameter — while modeled at maximum, higher-than-normal operating volume. A pipeline operator must have a written integrity management program that addresses the risk on each pipeline segment, identify preventive and mitigative measures to protect each area, and continually evaluate the plan throughout the pipeline’s lifespan.

When a Burst Happens

Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless, heavier-than-air gas that can cause asphyxiation after prolonged exposure and is potentially lethal over wide distances. At normal temperatures, CO2 is a gas; CCS pipelines carry CO2 in highly pressurized liquid form. Natural gas pipelines are not suited for CO2 transportation. They have a maximum pressure rating of 1,480 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) — a Class 600 pipeline, according to the American National Standards Institute. A pipeline built for CO2 service is designed for 2,200 psig — a Class 900 pipeline.

When exposed to water, CO2 turns into carbonic acid, which can eat through a steel pipeline, potentially leading to a volatile rupture. When a pressurized pipeline bursts, the dramatic change of pressure at the release point can cause the CO2 to rapidly expand, causing it to drop sharply to sub-freezing temperatures, according to the American Petroleum Institute.

The cold CO2 presents a dermal hazard, causing frostbite like dry ice, to those coming into contact with the released gas or the nearby piping and equipment. It can produce a thick water vapor cloud, which may be dispersed by the wind. Due to the density of CO2, during cool and humid conditions with little to no wind, the CO2 could accumulate in lowlying areas, such as valleys and ditches. This cloud can also reduce visibility — especially at night — making driving or walking through the CO2 release hazardous. As the gas adjusts to ambient air temperatures, the opaque vapor cloud dissipates, but it may still be present.

Recent Pipeline Leaks

In February 2020, a pipeline operated by Denbury Inc. in Satartia, Mississippi, burst, spewing CO2 for about four hours before the rupture was repaired. Over 200 residents in the surrounding area were evacuated, and 45 were hospitalized, according to PHMSA's failure investigation report, which it released May 26, 2022. Many residents experienced seizure-like symptoms, felling those affected and causing tremors and difficulty breathing. Motor vehicles stopped working, impeding emergency response. In the subsequent years, some residents have reported ongoing respiratory issues, as well as headaches, difficulty concentrating, and muscle tremors, according to a report by NPR.

In response, PHMSA in 2022 announced steps to implement new safety measures in its oversight, created the failure investigation report, and began soliciting research to strengthen CO2 pipeline safety.

In its investigation, PHMSA attributed the pipeline burst to soil saturation from recent rainfall. Vertical erosion of the sloped hillside, exacerbated by the rainfall, produced enough load to compress the pipeline and cause the welding to fail. PHMSA found that Denbury’s operations and maintenance procedures didn’t address the potential for pipeline damage caused by soil instability, and that the company's aerial inspection patrols failed to identify the potential geohazard before the incident.

According to the PHMSA's report, Denbury failed to notify local responders, hindering the ability of emergency services to respond in a timely manner; local responders contacted Denbury about 40 minutes after the burst. The report also found that Denbury’s CO2 dispersion model underestimated the potential affected area that could be impacted by a release, and that the modeling did not identify Satartia.

In 2022, PHMSA issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty, and Proposed Compliance Order to Denbury Gulf Coast Pipeline, LLC for multiple violations of Federal pipeline safety regulations, with proposed civil penalties amounting to $3,866,734. In 2025, another $2,366,900 of penalties was proposed. The final penalty assessed was $2,868,100.

In April 2024, Denbury, since acquired by ExxonMobil, was responsible for another pipeline burst in Sulphur, Louisiana. A 2-foot-diameter pipeline at a pump station ruptured and released around 107,000 gallons of CO2 over the course of nearly two and a half hours, according to the Ward Six Fire Protection District in Calcasieu Parish. Residents within a quarter mile of the pump were told to shelter in place, close doors and windows, and turn off air-conditioners. No injuries or serious illnesses were reported at the time.

Looking Forward

In the final days of President Biden’s administration, PHMSA proposed new, comprehensive requirements for CO2 and other hazardous liquid pipelines.

“I have learned first-hand from affected communities in [Sartartia,] Mississippi and across America why we need stronger CO2 pipeline safety standards,” said Tristan Brown, PHMSA deputy administrator at the time of the announcement. “These new requirements will be the strongest, most comprehensive standards for carbon dioxide transportation in the world and will set our nation on a safer path as we continue to address climate challenges.”

It was withdrawn days later when President Trump took office, and issued a sweeping order freezing all pending regulations by executive departments and agencies.

PHMSA’s proposal would have strengthened standards for CO2 pipelines — including CO2 transported in a supercritical fluid state — and establish new standards for transporting CO2 in a gaseous state via pipeline.

Pipeline regulations are in further doubt following Trump’s executive order in February that targeted regulations deemed “unconstitutional” or that would “impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits.”

Despite changes to regulations, Shaw, of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said he expects the Trump administration to continue supporting carbon pipeline projects moving forward.

“Trump is the godfather of the carbon pipelines — he's the one that signed 45Q in the law in such a way that it was actually economically viable to do these projects,” Shaw said. “Biden further enhanced 45Q in the [Inflation Reduction Act].”

In March, South Dakota banned the use of eminent domain for CCS projects. This significantly threatens the future of Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed pipeline, which has its storage location in North Dakota. In April, the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission denied, for a second time, the permit for Summit’s pipeline route.The company said it is planning to reapply with a reduced scope.

Shaw said the ban on eminent domain is a de facto ban on the pipeline in the state and that it will hurt ethanol producers who can’t take advantage of the 45Q and 45Z tax credits for sequestering carbon.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/MDRM4QImtv9geujSEFIHv3BN-Go=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ConstructiononDakotaAccessPipeline-128983ee0e3b417f8d133d12fbbf395f.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:13:52.718635

This weekend, the quiet Gloucestershire village of Fairford transforms once more into the global heart of aviation, as the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT 2025) takes flight, blending aerial artistry with military might.

With over 250 aircraft expected from more than 25 nations, RIAT 2025 promises to be as spectacular as ever. But this year, there’s more than just engine roars and formation loops in the spotlight.

The RAF Red Arrows will fly their full display using 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a bold and symbolic nod toward a greener aviation future.

Whether you’re attending or following along from home, here’s a look at the stars of RIAT 2025 taking part in the flying displays.

RIAT 2025: Fast jet and tactical demonstrations

The highlight of any airshow, RIAT 2025 will see plenty of fast jet action.

F‑16C Tiger Demo: Poland’s precision and prowess

The Polish F‑16 Tiger Demo Team showcases the Lockheed Martin F‑16C Fighting Falcon Block 52+, known locally as the Jastrząb (“Hawk”).

In service since deliveries under the “Peace Sky” programme between 2006–2008, this advanced F‑16 variant features Pratt & Whitney F100‑PW‑229 engines, APG‑68(V)9 terrain‑mapping radar, and the ALQ‑211(V)4 electronic warfare suite, marking it among the most capable F‑16s in NATO service.

Since its formation in the early 2000s and official establishment as the Tiger Demo Team in 2015, the display team has built a reputation for high‑energy solo performances, tight manoeuvres, and crowd‑pleasing visuals, all inspired by Poland’s strength in NATO exercises such as the Tiger Meet.

The demo pilot for the 2025 season is Major Maciej “SLAB” Krakowian.

Saab Gripen E: Sweden’s agile next-gen multirole fighter

The Saab JAS 39 Gripen E is a light, single-engine multirole fighter developed by Sweden’s Saab. Introduced in 1996, the E variant represents its most advanced iteration.

Equipped with a General Electric F414-G engine and an ES-05 Raven AESA radar, the Gripen E delivers situational awareness and sensor fusion from its updated digital cockpit and multifunction displays. These attributes helped Saab’s test pilot André Brännström win the Paul Bowen Trophy for Best Solo Jet Demonstration at RIAT in 2023.

The Paul Bowen Trophy for the Best Solo Jet Demonstration is named in memory of one of the co-founders of RIAT. In 2022, Captain David Szentendrei from the Hungarian Air Force won the same award flying a Gripen C, marking two years in a row a Gripen fighter jet was awarded.

F‑35A Lightning II: Stealth power from the 495th Fighter Squadron

The F-35A Lightning II, flown by the 495th Fighter Squadron – the Valkyries – based at RAF Lakenheath, is the USAF’s cutting-edge fifth-generation stealth fighter.

With its internal weapons bays, sensor fusion, and unparalleled low-observability characteristics, the F-35A brings a new level of battlefield awareness and survivability.

The 495th FS is the first USAF squadron in Europe to operate the F-35A, having received its first jets in 2021.

At the show, the 495th’s aircraft are expected to demonstrate vertical climb, precision handling, and stealthy presence, showcasing fusion-based combat performance.

MC-130J Commando II: USAF’s special ops workhorse

The Lockheed Martin MC-130J Commando II, operated by the 67th Special Operations Squadron from RAF Mildenhall, is a tactical airlifter modified for special operations missions.

With enhanced avionics, aerial refuelling capability, and terrain-following radar, the MC-130J can insert or extract special forces in challenging environments. The MC-130J primarily flies missions at night to reduce probability of visual acquisition and intercept by airborne threats.

Its presence in the flying display at RIAT 2025 is rare and offers spectators a glimpse of precision, low-level flying that underscores the quiet power of USAF’s unconventional mission fleet.

The first MC-130J aircraft was delivered in September 2011 to Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, with final delivery expected in fiscal year 2025.

C-21A Learjet 35A: Compact, classic and nimble

The Learjet (now Bombardier Aerospace) C-21A twin turbofan-engine aircraft is the military version of the Learjet 35A business jet. It provides airlift for eight passengers and 3,153 pounds of cargo. During aeromedical evacuations, it can transport one litter patient or five ambulatory patients.

Though not a fast jet in the traditional sense, its appearance in the flying display showcases the agility and versatility of one of the USAF’s lesser-known but vital assets.

Its compact profile and swift manoeuvres provide a refreshing change of pace between heavier and more aggressive aircraft types.

RIAT 2025: Helicopter flying demonstrations

Whether you’re here for the thump of the Chinook or the blistering manoeuvres of the Black Cats demo team, RIAT 2025 is a treat for rotorcraft lovers.

RAF Chinook Role Demo: Power and precision from a battlefield legend

The RAF Chinook Display Team, based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, exists to demonstrate the Chinook Force’s capability.

The Boeing CH-47 Chinook, an icon of British air mobility, takes centre stage in a role demonstration that combines brute strength with tactical agility. Operated by 18 and 27 Squadrons from RAF Odiham, the tandem-rotor helicopter demonstrates troop insertion, underslung load carrying, and rapid extraction.

Its distinctive rotor “thump” and tight turns belie its size and payload capability, making the Chinook a perennial highlight at RIAT.

The Mark 6A are used for the display, and make up the bulk of the RAF’s fleet. The Chinook is forecast to remain in Britain’s inventory until at least 2060.

Royal Navy Black Cats: Wildcat HMA.2 pair’s aerial ballet

The Black Cats Helicopter Display Team fly two AgustaWestland Wildcat

HMA.2 helicopters from 825 Naval Air Squadron, based at RNAS Yeovilton.

Once seen as a nimble utility platform, the true character of the Wildcat helicopter is now coming into sharper focus, that of a fearsome maritime attack aircraft, fully equipped and combat-ready.

In its early years, the Wildcat often flew light, rarely armed with the kind of munitions that could threaten hostile ships or submarines. But that phase is firmly in the past.

Today, the Royal Navy’s Wildcat has grown its “claws and fangs.” Its stub wings now bristle with Martlet missiles designed to neutralise fast attack craft and boat swarms, Sting Ray torpedoes for submarine threats, and soon, the Sea Venom missile, a potent tool capable of disabling corvettes or even larger surface warships.

No longer a mere scout or spotter, the Wildcat has become a frontline force multiplier.

At RIAT, the Black Cats are expected to perform with sharp coordination and theatrical flair.

RIAT 2025: Aerobatic display teams

Everyone’s eyes turn skywards when the Red Arrows arrive, but RIAT 2025 brings more than just the UK’s own display team, with aerobatics from all over the world.

RAF Red Arrows: Flying history in greener skies

The Royal Air Force Red Arrows, Britain’s iconic nine-aircraft aerobatic display team, will make history at RIAT 2025 by performing their entire display powered by 100% SAF. It’s first such use of SAF for any national military aerobatic team during a public display.

The team’s signature coloured smoke trails are also now generated with Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) biofuel, making every plume a display of environmental commitment as well as performance.

This landmark initiative aligns with the RAF’s Defence Aviation Net Zero Strategy and highlights military aviation’s potential to reduce carbon emissions without compromising mission capability.

Patrouille Suisse: Swiss precision in F-5E Tiger IIs

The Patrouille Suisse serves as the official aerobatic display team of the Swiss Air Force, representing both the Swiss military and the nation itself.

For over six decades, this elite team has wowed spectators across Switzerland and beyond with their tightly choreographed aerial displays.

Flying the Northrop F-5E Tiger II, the six-ship Patrouille Suisse team, formed in 1964, represents the very definition of precision.

The Tiger II’s compact agility, delta-shaped canopy, and clean design make it ideal for tight, fast-moving formations.

Their red-and-white paint scheme complements the Swiss flag and their flying style: calm, measured and meticulously executed.

Saudi Hawks: Bold manoeuvres with a desert flair

Formed on January 24, 1999, the Saudi Hawks or the Green Hawks Team are the Royal Saudi Air Force’s official aerobatic team, flying seven green-and-white BAE Hawk Mk.65A aircraft.

Based at King Faisal Air Base, Tabuk, the team brings Middle Eastern precision and flair to European skies. Their routine combines loops, bomb bursts, and formation passes, projecting the Kingdom’s growing aviation professionalism and regional engagement.

Fursan Al Emarat: UAE’s golden knights of the sky

Flying seven Italian-built Aermacchi MB-339 NAT jet trainers, Fursan Al Emarat (“The Knights of the Emirates”) are the national aerobatic team of the United Arab Emirates.

Formed in 2010, they are known for elegant, choreographed routines punctuated by gold, red and black smoke trails. With a blend of showmanship and discipline, they reflect the UAE’s ambition and growing aerospace investment.

Reports have it that the Al Fursan aerobatic team has moved closer than ever to getting a new fleet of jets from China to replace their Aermacchi MB-339s, as the UAE reportedly signed a firm order for the Hongdu L-15 Falcon.

According to AVIC, the aircraft’s manufacturer, the UAE has signed a contract in 2023 for the purchase of 12 L-15 trainer jets, with an option for 36 additional aircraft.

Given that the UAE had been exploring replacements for Al Fursan’s fleet of 10 MB-339s by mid-decade, it is likely that the national aerobatic team will be the primary beneficiary of this initial order.

Royal Jordanian Falcons: Propeller-powered precision from the Hashemite Kingdom

Adding vibrant flair to RIAT’s jet-dominated skies, the Royal Jordanian Falcons soar in with their fleet of five Extra 330LX aircraft, one of the world’s most agile, high-performance aerobatic aeroplanes.

With razor-sharp loops, graceful barrel rolls, and seamless formation transitions, their performance showcases not only the aircraft’s astonishing roll rate and climb capabilities but also the elite flying skills honed by this celebrated team.

Founded in 1976 under the patronage of His Majesty King Hussein, the Falcons are more than an air display team – they are Jordan’s roving ambassadors. With each routine, they carry a message of pride, tradition, and modernity from the Hashemite Kingdom to audiences around the world.

Their presence at RIAT brings a distinctive regional flavour and a legacy of precision flying that spans nearly five decades.

As they carve arcs of smoke across the Cotswold sky, the Falcons offer a thrilling contrast to the thunder of fast jets, reminding crowds of the artistry and discipline embedded in propeller-driven aerobatics.

Their display is not only a visual spectacle but also a celebration of national identity, making them a perennial favourite among RIAT visitors.

What time is the flying display at RIAT 2025?

The 2025 edition of the Royal International Air Tattoo opens on Friday, 18 July, and runs through to Sunday, 20 July. Each day, the showground will open at 07:30 and close at 18:00.

The flying is scheduled to start at 11:00 on Friday, with displays running through to 15:00.

The bill extended the availability of the 45Z tax credit through 2029.
“That is really going to hinder the ability to take your ethanol and turn it into SAF,” Hora said.
In a press release following the passage of the reconciliation bill, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the bill “will not boost the ethanol-to-SAF market the way we hoped.
The closer a CI score is to zero, the better it is for the 45Z credit and for the potential financial share to the farmer.","In a virtual press conference, Mitchell Hora, CEO of Iowa-based soil health data intelligence company Continuum Ag, spoke to farmers for over an hour about the impact of the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill on 45Z for farmers, biofuel producers, and ag companies. The bill extended the availability of the 45Z tax credit through 2029.

Walking through some of the most important changes and unknowns still to be finalized after the bill’s passage, Hora thanked the Iowa Congressional delegation for “fighting for us” throughout the reconciliation process and focused his remarks on what farmers and producers can do in the coming years to make the most of these tax credits.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Loses Out

Hora called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a “major loser” of the reconciliation bill’s passage, as a previous tax credit of $1.75 per gallon of SAF under the 45Z rule was cut to $1 per gallon, in line with ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel.

“That is really going to hinder the ability to take your ethanol and turn it into SAF,” Hora said. “Under the current version of 45Z, the alcohol-to-jet pathway [is] not going to happen. Not at any type of real pace.”

Hora said that while ethanol is not being locked out as a feedstock, “the way that the rules are written doesn't provide the financial incentive to produce SAF using ethanol.”

He added that this could change in the future if the failed amendment introduced by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) is added to future legislation and adopted in some format. Ernst has introduced legislation seeking to protect SAF multiple times.

In a press release following the passage of the reconciliation bill, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said the bill “will not boost the ethanol-to-SAF market the way we hoped. We will continue to look for ways to restore that.”

The release called the move “unexpected” and claims that SAF has the potential to be a “100-billion-gallon-a-year market” by 2050.

Renewable energy law firm Frost, Brown, and Todd detailed the decision made by Congress on SAF here.

“The enhanced rates for sustainable aviation fuel are eliminated for fuel sold after December 31, 2025. In a move to standardize emissions accounting, the proposal bars the use of negative lifecycle emissions rates for most fuels starting in 2026, except in the case of animal-manure-based fuels,” the article reads.

Unknowns Remain, But Be Flexible

While there were important answers given by the reconciliation bill for 45Z, Hora said there are still questions that need answers for producers and companies alike.

One of the big questions remaining is whether the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will decide to have credits tracked with the book and claim, or mass balance methods.

The book and claim method allows farmers to sell their crop where they wish, and sell their low-carbon credit certificates as a new environmental asset to any buyer, regardless of location.

Mass balance, on the other hand, is a method in which low-carbon crops must be delivered to a biofuel producer. This means the bushels and low-carbon credit certificates stay linked.

Hora said that book and claim could be better for producers, but urged them to “prepare for mass balance” moving forward and to be adaptable into the future.

Knowing CI Scores is Key

One of the key elements of getting the most out of 45Z for farmers will be gathering and using data from their fields, Hora said. He said farmer data will be key to unlocking value and will be “what’s going to ensure that there’s an equitable share of the financial value.”

One of the crucial data pieces ethanol producers will need to know is the Carbon Intensity (CI) score of their farmers’ fields, Hora said. The closer a CI score is to zero, the better it is for the 45Z credit and for the potential financial share to the farmer.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/ZY6QxLKtoJFUEfoVkQdYryc8hwI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/54163679242_59f748f514_oSAFethanolplant-Iowa-d55130af73f44d9cb58b780fbdef60f2.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:21:04.761628

Special to The Digest

While the electrification of many industrial sectors is accelerating the energy transition, it is not a silver bullet that will get us to net-zero economies. From aviation to cement, industries reliant on fossil based-carbon need a sustainable substitute—not just to meet climate targets but to remain competitive. In these industries, decarbonization should not be the goal, but recarbonization with a sustainable substitute. That substitute is green syngas: a flexible, biomass-derived mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This article explores how syngas can power a new era of industrial recarbonization. We examine its feedstocks, conversion technologies, technical barriers, and real-world use cases—along with what it will take to scale this solution. For stakeholders across the bioeconomy, green syngas offers more than a molecule—it offers a market.

The Decarbonization Dilemma in Industry

Hard-to-electrify industries need green carbon. While electrification using renewables is driving the energy transition, it is not suitable for all use cases. High temperature industries, such as steel and cement, rely on direct fuel combustion and electrification solutions are immature or impractical. Further, in energy dense applications like aviation and maritime fuels the use of batteries fails due to weight and volumetric limitations. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, electrification will not be an option for many sectors that contribute significantly to carbon emissions. To meet decarbonization goals, replacing fossil-based carbons with green carbon is a lot more practical.

The Role of Syngas

Green syngas is a highly flexible, globally available resource that can drive the replacement of fossil carbon in multiple industries. Syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, is produced from biomass sources typically via gasification or pyrolysis technologies. Once produced, green syngas can be upgraded by one of four major processes (Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis, Water-Gas Shift, Synthesis, and Methanation) to produce a variety of products, including: aviation and marine fuels, hydrogen, renewable natural gas, and green chemicals. The versatility of syngas is a tremendous commercial advantage as it provides many potential end-product markets. Syngas should be regarded as a single commodity, but rather a platform technology that allows for customization depending on market demand and regulatory incentives.

Sources of Biomass

Syngas is valuable because it unlocks value from waste biomass. Broadly speaking, biomass is organic matter than can be used as a fuel. Popular sources of biomass include forestry and agricultural waste, animal waste, sewage, and municipal solid waste. Biomass is present world-wide in both rural and urban environments, making it a highly available feedstock. Traditionally biomass has been a viewed as a problem, as it needed to be collected and disposed in many cases. Syngas flips this paradigm on its head by providing a valuable use for these sources of waste. Further, this upgrading of biomass can support public policy goals such as landfill diversion, and creation of jobs in rural communities.

Sources of Biomass, Biomass as an Alternative for Gas Production (Canepa and Gonzalez, 2017)

Conversion Technology Overview

Biomass gasification is the technical pathway to producing valuable syngas from waste biomass. First, the biomass is pretreated, which includes drying the biomass and sizing it to achieve greater uniformity of the biomass. The dried biomass is then gasified in a reactor with oxygen and steam, typically in the 600 to 1200oC range to produce syngas. Depending on the completeness of the gasification, other products like bio-oil and biochar may be produced. If the gasification is incomplete, upgrading will occur to remove things like tars, particles, and inorganics. The purified syngas can then be upgraded into many valuable products, such as hydrogen, methanol, and Fischer-Tropsch fuels.

Source, Brandin, et al., 2015

Addressing Technical Challenges

There are several types of gasification technologies including fluidized-bed, entrained flow, and fixed bed with different temperature and pressure conditions. Several gasification technologies have already been proven at commercial scale and have been deployed in small to medium combined heat and power (CHP) systems. The use of biomass to produce the upgraded chemicals has largely been done at pilot and demonstration scale, though initial commercial plants for these products are underway.

Like many technologies, there are challenges associated with biomass gasification. First the biomass must be pre-processed prior to gasification. There are naturally occurring variations in things like particle size and moisture content that must be homogenized to achieve maximum yields. Processes to standardize biomass, like sizing and drying can be energy intensive. Further, the syngas must be cleaned up before use to remove impurities like tars and metals. Impure syngas can poison catalysts in further processing steps, hurting economics. Additionally, tars can accumulate over time, necessitating frequent cleaning of reactors that can result in frequent downtime for equipment. High temperature gasification methods, like plasma-arc, can offer complete conversion, reducing the impact of these issues. However, such technologies are still under development. Technical advancements and learning by doing will be needed to reduce conversion costs over time.

From Molecule to Market: Syngas Use Cases

Recently, moves to decarbonize economies has catalyzed many use cases where syngas derivatives can be used effectively. The demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is growing. The EU’s “Fit for 55” requires 2% SAF usage in 2025, growing to 50% by 2050. With limited availability of waste oils, biomass to jet pathways should grow in importance in coming years. The maritime industry too, is making strides in decarbonization. The international maritime organization (IMO) has set a goal of a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. The international shipping giant, Maersk, launched its first methanol powered ship in 2023 and seeks to be at net-zero emissions by 2040. Finally, green hydrogen demand is growing globally. 58 countries globally have produced hydrogen strategies/roadmaps with a mix of goals, requirements and incentives to increase the amount of clean hydrogen available. While many of these programs are electrolysis-focused, biomass-based hydrogen also meets most goals for carbon reduction in these programs.

Investment & Commercialization Outlook

As with any other emerging technology, the development of syngas presents challenges, but also opportunities. Companies entering the space will need to deal with the normal tests of scaling up to commercial scale, and the CAPEX associated with first of its kind technologies. Yet, there is also reason to believe that the pull from markets looking for low carbon products will create the basis for the industry moving forward.

There are multiple developing projects involving syngas production that are developing globally. For example, Haffner Energy has announced a biomass to hydrogen plant in Marolles, France expected to be commissioned by July, 2026. While Elyse Energy has announced its BioTJet project to produce 110,000 tonnes of e-fuels from end-of-life waste wood by 2029. Overall, the overall growth of the global syngas market is expected to reach USD $731B by 2031 with a CAGR of 11.3%, providing significant opportunities for companies working in the space.

Why Syngas Matters Now

As the global push to decarbonization intensifies, syngas is ready to play a significant role. Electrification can address several issues, but key industries will continue to rely on carbon-based fuels. Fortunately, syngas allows for recarbonization, replacing fossil-carbons with renewable sources of biomass. Biomass is globally available in large quantities and can be unlocked by conversion to syngas. Syngas enables the production of key chemicals like methanol, hydrogen, and Fischer-Tropsch fuels, which can address hard to abate sectors like aviation, maritime shipping, and steel manufacturing. The importance of syngas in reaching net-zero has begun and will only increase in the coming years.

Congress and several U.S. states are working together to grow the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry through tax incentives and legislative support.

This movement is seen as a step toward reducing airline emissions and opening new markets for agriculture.

The clean fuel tax credit, originally passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was set to end in 2027. However, a new Republican-led budget law, signed by President on July 4, 2025, extended it through 2029.

Although the law reduced some credits for SAF and reclaimed unused federal grants, the extension still offers vital long-term support.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” said Paul Greenough of Capstone DC, an energy policy advisor group.

Sustainable aviation fuel is critical to helping the airline industry achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. The International Air Transport Association says SAF could help reduce 65% of emissions.

Corn ethanol, often used in car fuels, is a key feedstock in making SAF, giving corn-producing states a new economic opportunity.

States like Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Washington have already passed SAF tax credit laws. New proposals in New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin are under consideration.

Wisconsin Rep. David Steffen introduced a bill requiring that SAF be made using only U.S.-sourced materials. He said, “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Despite federal credit reductions, analysts expect the SAF industry will still benefit. U.S. production grew from 5,000 to over 30,000 barrels per day in early 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Airlines continue to push for broader SAF access, and states may now create stronger local incentives to make up for federal policy changes. Together, these efforts could help scale up commercial production and support rural economies.

Initially a one-supplier-fits-all system, Avelia now enables businesses and airlines to purchase SAF from a variety of suppliers, bringing about more efficient and transparent fuel management throughout the sector.

This move is happening at a time when aviation companies are coming under pressure to lower their greenhouse gas emissions and meet a series of ambitious sustainability targets. Through the wider network, Avelia would look to increase the intake of SAF, giving companies the ability to demonstrably reduce their environmental footprints—forever changing how we think about the future of aviation.

Evolution to a Multi-Supplier Platform

The multi-supplier nature of Avelia supports the increasing need for SAF and accommodates wider industry involvement. This extends the reach of the benefits of greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. Customers can access GHG benefits from multiple SAF producers, making it easier for corporations, airlines, and freight forwarders to manage their SAF portfolios.

Key enhancements include

Independent Data Hosting: Accenture manages data processing and host environment activities for SAF-based transactions, creating a secure, auditable, and independently verified record of SAF’s environmental performance.

Bring Your Own SAF (BYOS) Model: This capability allows airlines to track SAF they’ve acquired outside of the Shell supply network within Avelia, giving them a complete picture of their SAF consumption.

Multilateral governance: Avelia is setting up a governance to bring about transparency and collaboration across multiple entities in the SAF space.

The improvements will simplify the administration of SAF and make the process of procuring SAF even easier and more attractive for companies that are already engaged in reducing their aviation-related emissions.

Impact on Aviation Decarbonization

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is pivotal, as it can reduce lifecycle GHG emissions from aviation by up to 80% when neat. Although it is environmentally friendly, the production of SAF is small, comprising only 0.7% of jet fuel worldwide production in 2025. Avelia’s expansion is in response to the gap it sees between corporate demand and a limited supply of SAF and will seek to aggregate demand from corporate customers to drive SAF production and use.

To date, 17 airport injection points globally have used Avelia to inject more than 33 million gallons of SAF into the world’s fuel supply since its introduction. This project has helped to remove more than 300,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, highlighting the platform’s capacity to fuel aviation decarbonisation.

Strategic Partnerships and Future Outlook

This joint effort from Shell, Accenture, and Amex GBT represents our shared ambition to drive sustainability in aviation. As a strategic advisor and technology partner, Accenture has helped guide the evolution of Avelia support, managing data processing and hosting to enable confidentiality and control for the customers of the platform. Through its broad base of clients worldwide, Amex GBT is significantly leveraged to aggregate SAF demand, a key factor in sustaining the scale and impact of the platform.

In the future, Avelia continues to scale the platform, adding new SAF suppliers and new functionalities to enable the aviation industry transition to net zero emissions. Through collaboration and technology, Avelia is designed to expedite the use of SAF and help air travel become part of a more sustainable future.

Conclusion

The development of Avelia rocks the post for the aviation industry to decarbonise. Developed to offer greater access to SAF across a range of suppliers and improve transparency, Avelia is expected to enable airlines and corporate customers to accelerate their sustainability initiatives.

Having built strong industry participation and a strong pipeline of innovations to come, Avelia is well placed to be at the cape of what promises to be a revolution in the reduction of aviation emissions and the integration of sustainable fuels in the aviation sector. As the industry nods towards sustainability as the main driver of growth, Avelia’s platform will undoubtedly play a major role in accelerating the transformation into greener and more efficient aviation.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/green-fuel-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 11:11:13.207325

Launched in 2022 with 1 million gallons of SAF, the Avelia program utilizes a book-and-claim model, enabling business travelers to pay for SAF and claim the environmental benefits, even if the SAF is not available at their departure airport. The solution was developed by Shell and Accenture, with the support of the Energy Web Foundation (EWF), and includes Amex GBT’s travel management services to aggregate global demand for SAF from its 19,000 global customers. To date, Shell is the sole SAF supplier for the platform.

In an update provided by the companies, Shell, Accenture and Amex GBT revealed to as of March 2025, more than 57 companies and airlines have joined the platform, contributing to the injection of more than 33 million gallons of SAF at 17 airport injection points globally, resulting in the abatement of more than 300,000 tonnes of CO2e on a lifecycle emissions basis, relative to conventional jet fuel.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

According to the companies, the evolution of the platform comes as SAF represents the most viable current solutions to reduce aviation emissions, yet SAF is still only produced in relatively small quantities, with the IATA recently estimating that SAF production in 2025 will account for just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption. Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.

Evan Konwiser, Chief Product and Strategy Officer, Amex GBT said:

“For the majority of companies, Scope 3 emissions represent the largest share of their total carbon footprint and reducing them can be challenging… As a partner in Avelia, we continue to grow and evolve the world’s first and now most established book and claim platform for SAF. Together we can accelerate its scale and increase customer access to its environmental benefits.”

Among the key changes announced to the Avelia platform is the evolution to a multi-supplier model, allowing users to access the GHG benefits of SAF from multiple suppliers, and to manage SAF from different suppliers within Avelia. The companies said that the platform is also looking to introduce a “Bring Your Own SAF” (BYOS) model, which would allow airlines to manage more of their SAF portfolio in Avelia, including fuel originally purchased outside of the Shell supply network as well as SAF that otherwise would have been tracked offline and not on a digital registry, with the move aimed at supporting the use of book and claim solutions for tracking SAF to help build credibility for the model at an industry level and accelerate SAF adoption.

Raman Ojha, President, Shell Aviation said:

“This moment marks a significant milestone not only for Avelia but for the aviation sector. Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF.”

The companies also announced that Avelia is in the process of setting-up a multilateral governance structure to enable multi-party involvement and more transparency information around its operating procedures, and that the platform data is now hosted and handled by Accenture, providing a blockchain-powered transparent, secure, reliable and externally verified platform for accessing and allocating the information for the applicable SAF offering.

Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg, Global Travel and Aviation Sustainability Lead, Accenture, said:

“As Avelia’s strategic advisor and technology partner, Accenture continues to shape its evolution while overseeing data processing, and hosting for Shell.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.

“This purported attempt to incentivize ‘clean fuels’ is little more than a giveaway to the conventional biofuels industry,” the organization said in a post on its website.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is gaining momentum in the U.S., with lawmakers at both federal and state levels supporting its growth through new tax policies and production incentives.

The federal government recently extended a key clean fuel tax credit through 2029, as part of a budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025.

The credit initially expired in 2027 but now offers extra years for producers to scale up SAF development. Though the law lowers the value of SAF-specific credits and removes some federal funding, it still provides a long-term signal to the industry.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects, so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy.

The aviation industry aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and SAF is expected to play a major role. The International Air Transport Association estimates SAF could contribute 65% toward the goal.

Currently, U.S. SAF production is growing, rising from 5,000 to over 30,000 barrels per day between early 2024 and February 2025.

States are also stepping in. Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Washington have already passed tax incentives. New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin lawmakers have proposed new bills to encourage SAF use.

In Wisconsin, Rep. David Steffen said he was inspired by a local company producing SAF and wants to support in-state jobs and farmers. His bill would require SAF materials to be domestically sourced.

“It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product,” Steffen said.

Some critics argue the new federal tax changes benefit older biofuels more than SAF. However, experts believe that state-level action and rising industry demand will keep SAF development moving forward.

ATJ fuel, produced from renewable alcohols like ethanol and isobutanol, presents a viable solution for the aviation sector to achieve these emission reduction targets.

In addition to environmental goals, significant investments are being made in bio-refineries and cutting-edge fuel processing technologies. Many nations are backing research and development (R&D) projects focused on next-generation biofuels, including ATJ, to enhance energy security and reduce reliance on traditional fossil fuels.

Revenue passenger kilometers rose by 10.4 percent compared with 2023 and by 3.8 percent compared with pre-pandemic 2019. Global airline revenues look set to surpass USD 1 trillion in 2025; not bad for an industry some predicted would not survive Covid-19.

“Looking to 2025, there is every indication that demand for travel will continue to grow, albeit at a moderated pace of 8 percent that is more aligned with historical averages,” said IATA Director General Willie Walsh in Business Travel News.

John Schmidt, Global Aerospace Lead at consultancy firm Accenture, shares the upbeat view: “We’re definitely beyond 2019, even if the rate of growth differs among regions. Growth and revenues are up for aircraft makers too and while fewer aircraft have been delivered, MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) drove year-over-year growth for 2024.”

Some observers have predicted that air travel will ultimately prove untenable given its current climate footprint. Schmidt, however, points out that “the sector only accounts for 2.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is a fraction of what the combined truck fleet emits.”

The industry has been striving to reduce CO₂ emissions since long before the climate change issue first surfaced, mainly because fuel consumption has always been the number one cost driver for airlines.

The global aviation industry has pledged to try to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, a goal to which Schmidt comments: “It’s a bit unlikely that we’ll get there, but the push is certainly there. The challenge is to continue to leverage the technology to be able to drive value in the industry while reducing costs and lowering carbon emissions to attain more sustainable operations.”

Advances in materials

Lower aircraft weight, improved fuel efficiency and a switch to non-fossil fuels or electric propulsion are contributing to more sustainable air travel. Advances in the aerospace industry are often linked to advances in materials – specifically the strength-to-weight ratio and the temperature resistance of new materials. The materials of choice these days for aerospace engines are heat-resistant super alloys, (HRSA) an advanced mix of specialty metals, nickel, cobalt, iron and some TiAl (titanium aluminide)-based alloys.

Digital manufacturing is a cornerstone in transforming the industry and reducing its sustainability footprint. Many non-structural aircraft body parts and engine components have complex forms and lend themselves to 3D printing.

Additive manufacturing underway

New materials and new manufacturing methods are key, according to Jeff Wheless, Growth & Strategy Research Leader at Accenture, who offers an example: “GE’s landmark 3D-printed fuel nozzle tips are 25 percent lighter and five times more durable than their conventionally manufactured counterparts. It’s not just a way of getting rid of weight but of designing things that can be manufactured more efficiently.”

Boeing has produced over 70,000 3D-printed parts across aerospace applications; a mix of thermoplastics and metallic parts. “The tolerance and quality demands of these new AM (additive manufacturing) materials are very high, often tighter than for conventional parts, which requires more precise machining tools for post-processing. That in turn creates new manufacturing opportunities and challenges for machine tool manufacturers such as Sandvik,” Wheless adds.

More efficient tools

Ramping up production is another key issue for an industry plagued by a massive backlog of orders. Besides more efficient tools, this calls for workforce reskilling to handle more automation, digitalization and new manufacturing methods. Continuous education and training will be essential to equip the workforce with the skills needed to navigate the future of aerospace manufacturing.

Britain is accelerating its transition to electric vehicles with a new £63 million investment from the UK Government. This funding aims to enhance the country’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure, supporting off-street home charge points, NHS fleet electrification, and expanded charging facilities for businesses. This strategic move not only reinforces the government’s commitment to building a cleaner, more sustainable transport network across the UK but also promises a future of lower emissions, reduced costs, and cleaner transport for all.

Improving the UK’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure

The investment package aims to drive down charging costs and improve electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

A £25m scheme will allow local authorities to expand access to cheaper at-home electric vehicle charging, providing households with lower rates, which could save up to £1,500 a year compared to running a petrol or diesel car. The cross pavement technology will allow cables to run safely beneath pavements, connecting homes directly to parked vehicles, enabling more families to tap into cheaper domestic electricity rates for as little as 2p per mile, offering significant cost savings and financial security, even if they don’t have a driveway.

The funding will extensively expand the UK’s electric vehicle charging network, which has currently reached 82,000 public charge points, with a further 100,000 expected to be installed as a result of the government’s local EV infrastructure fund and private investment.

Additionally, the UK Government is launching a significant new grant scheme to help businesses install charging points at depots nationwide, supporting the nation’s heavy goods vehicles, vans, and coach drivers in the transition to zero emissions.

Delvin Lane, CEO, InstaVolt, said: “We are pleased that the government has taken the crucial step of delivering official EV charging signage on the strategic road network – a move we believe will improve consumer confidence and bolster EV adoption. This marks a significant milestone for the EV industry and drivers across the UK.

At InstaVolt, we have been relentless in our campaigning and have built a strong, collaborative relationship with the government to push this initiative forward. Our opinion research suggests that the rollout of clear, official signage will make a significant difference, helping EV drivers easily locate public charging points while on the move, and reassuring those considering making the switch to electric vehicles.

For years, we have emphasised that the UK’s public EV infrastructure, so critical to mass adoption, is already primarily in place, and now this signage will finally showcase it to drivers in a visible, accessible way.

As the UK’s largest ultra-rapid public charging network with over 2,000 chargers nationwide, InstaVolt is proud to be at the forefront of this transformation and excited to see how these signs will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.”

Driving sustainability in the NHS

The NHS in England will also receive a major sustainability upgrade with an £8m fund for an electric fleet of ambulances and medical vehicles, which will be available across over 200 NHS sites. This significant investment, driven by the UK Government, is a testament to its commitment to public health and sustainability.

Health Minister Karin Smyth said: “This is a win-win: cheaper travel for the NHS and cleaner air for our communities.

As part of our Plan for Change, we’re investing in green energy to build an NHS fit for the future — cutting pollution and saving millions in fuel costs.”

NHS Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Gormley said: “The NHS has already implemented hundreds of projects that reduce emissions and drive significant cost savings, all while improving patient care.

This new £8 million investment, across 62 NHS Trusts and around 224 sites, supports the renewed commitment in the government’s 10 Year Health Plan to deliver a more sustainable NHS while also helping hospitals to save millions on fuel and maintenance costs and reducing air pollution. These savings can be reinvested directly into frontline care, ensuring the NHS continues to deliver for our patients and communities.”",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-1502846788-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:28.190708

The 2 million litres of unblended SAF were Australia’s largest ever commercial import of sustainable aviation fuel.
Demand for such low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF), from airlines and mining companies, is on the rise.
“Low carbon liquid fuels are a present-day necessity for sectors that can’t electrify”, says Ian Learmonth CEFC’s chief executive.
Scaling up Australia’s LCLF industry would require cautiously optimistic navigation of waters that are simultaneously risky and rewarding.","In May this year, when Qantas, Australia’s largest airline, along with Ampol, a fuel supplier, and Sydney Airport announced a large fuel import it was hardly atypical. Some 80% of Australian liquid fuel demand is serviced from overseas. Yet, this was no ordinary import. The 2 million litres of unblended SAF were Australia’s largest ever commercial import of sustainable aviation fuel.

Demand for such low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF), from airlines and mining companies, is on the rise. A new report from the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a government-backed investor, and Deloitte has found that Australia has a comparative advantage in capturing that demand. An advantage that, by 2050, could be worth $36bn.

First movers

32% of Australia’s national emissions are attributable to liquid fuel use. Over a third of that demand comes from road transport – where electrification is underway. Mining and aviation account for nearly a third of remaining demand and are harder to electrify.

For these industries, LCLFs are the next best hope. “Low carbon liquid fuels are a present-day necessity for sectors that can’t electrify”, says Ian Learmonth CEFC’s chief executive. “If we get the settings right, Australia can lead in clean fuels innovation and production - not just supply the feedstocks”, he adds.

In person: NZI Annual Conference | 21 October | London | Register here

Getting the settings right, the report says, could yield significant rewards that investors should take note of. “Policy accelerators, including mandates, certification schemes and offsets, are key components to assist the industry reach scale. The first movers will reap the rewards of this global market”, notes Learmonth.

Home advantage

The production of LCLFs relies on feedstock - things like waste, agricultural residue, biomass, sorghum and used cooking oils. This plays into Australia’s large agro-industrial footprint, the report claims. These industries provide feedstock such as tallow and canola – which are currently being exported for LCLF production.

“We export the raw materials but miss the opportunity to build the industry here at home. This is about regional development, national resilience, and emissions reduction, all at once”, says Rupert Maloney, CEFC’s executive director.

The report includes a production cost analysis as well as estimation of Australia’s LCLF cost curve. The findings highlight the importance of cost reductions in the years ahead – where LCLF innovation and lower feedstock costs could play a key role.

Demand, meanwhile, is expected to rise significantly as offtake mandates replace carbon offsets in industries such as aviation. Over 50% of LCLF demand under all modelled scenarios between 2030 and 2050 will come from aviation.

“Clean fuel plants could revitalise manufacturing hubs and create skilled careers in some areas hit hardest by the decline of fossil fuels. But we need investment commitments this decade to avoid missing the window”, said Maloney.

Investment risk

For investors this remains risky business. As the report highlights, LCLF market is still relatively immature. To be viable, projects require complicated supply chains and a steady roster of feedstock suppliers and offtake partners. In addition, the market itself is fragmented and the cost gap between LCLFs and traditional alternatives needs trimming.

These uncertainties add to the LCLF risk premiums, making capital more expensive.

Here, the report identifies seven ‘market accelerators’ that could pave the way for a LCLF boom down under. The use of concessional finance to de-risk private investments is one of the report’s key recommendations. The implication being that other forms of capital might need to take a seat at the table before institutional capital considers one.

As Australia decarbonises, its legacy industries -notoriously emissions-intensive - will come under stress. Somewhat unsurprisingly then, the country’s financiers might look for the next big thing. The report makes a convincing case for LCLF to be amongst the candidates, courtesy of a first mover advantage up for grabs. Its caveats, however, are noteworthy. Scaling up Australia’s LCLF industry would require cautiously optimistic navigation of waters that are simultaneously risky and rewarding.

These are among “common challenges and issues… that straddle both sectors”, said Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow. “To that end, we are looking at how we can train practitioners in both sectors to be able to look at these issues and to come up with innovative solutions to address them.”

For a start, Singapore will work with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to develop new joint training programmes on areas such as sustainability, safety and capacity building, he added.

This was at a press conference with ICAO’s secretary-general Juan Carlos Salazar and IMO’s secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez, held after the Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium.

The one-day event brought together more than 500 maritime and aviation leaders from over 60 countries and 90 organisations.

Collaboration between both transport sectors is not just possible, but necessary, said Dominguez. “Sometimes we’re portrayed as competing. But that’s not the case.”

One shared challenge is sustainability. Here, Siow noted, aviation has been focusing on sustainable aviation fuel due to its fixed infrastructure, while the maritime industry is exploring a broader mix of alternative fuels.

ICAO’s Salazar said that even as the aviation sector develops its own measures to cut carbon emissions, it is closely observing the IMO’s decarbonisation framework, which he described as “innovative”. As the aviation sector works towards a plan to address carbon emissions, it hopes to learn from the maritime sector’s experience after it rolls out its net-zero framework later this year, he added.

Safer skies and seas

Beyond emissions, aviation and maritime can work together in many other areas, noted Salazar. He named examples such as managing air and sea traffic in conflict zones, coordinating search and rescue operations, and improving crisis responses.

“Many of the challenges we face today are common: political instability, threats to security and safety of both maritime and aviation systems,” he said. “These present opportunities to exchange and learn from each other.”

His maritime counterpart Dominguez pointed out that safety challenges such as search and rescue, route disruptions, and safety equipment interference are shared across both sectors.

ICAO’s Salazar also said that international civil aviation has long drawn from the maritime sector, particularly in legal frameworks. “In that regard, I believe the cross-pollination… of experiences and best practices… is very important.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/bb77dce579a09e081de174d0c2e382611790506a8368555547b671b31cdfa0b5?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:37.515982

termination of 7 clean energy tax credits in 2025 or 2026

On July 7, 2025, the President issued a related Executive Order (the ""BOC Order"") regarding the rapid termination of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar. This client update will focus on the effect of the BBBA and the BOC Order on clean energy tax incentives. For our coverage of the general business tax provisions of the BBBA, click here.

1. Revision to the ITC and PTC

A. Rapid Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Wind and Solar

The eligibility of wind and solar projects for the ITC and PTC is being phased out rapidly. To be eligible for either credit, the wind or solar facility must either

begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA), or

be placed in service prior to January 1, 2028.

B. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Existing IRS guidance provides liberal rules for determining when construction begins for purposes of ITC and PTC phaseouts. Under the existing IRS guidance, a taxpayer can begin construction (""BOC"") by commencing physical work on the project (including certain off-site work on a component of the project) or incurring 5% of the cost of equipment for the project. Under a safe harbor in the existing IRS guidance, a project that begins construction in 2026 can be placed in service as late as December 31, 2030, or in some circumstances even later. However, unlike the beginning of construction principles applicable under the FEOC rules (discussed below), the applicable IRS guidance is not statutorily frozen as of January 1, 2025.

The BOC Order directs that ""[w]ithin 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the 'beginning of construction' are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

It seems likely that the new IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order will be more restrictive than existing IRS guidance. The scope and effective date of the new guidance is unknown.

C. Accelerated Phaseout of ITC and PTC for Other Technologies

For technologies other than wind and solar, the BBBA accelerates the phaseout of the ITC and PTC by eliminating the prong of the phaseout that was based upon the year that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production fall to 25% of 2022 levels. As a result, such projects that begin construction before 2034 will generally be entitled to the full ITC or PTC rate, but those rates will drop to 75% for construction begun in 2034, 50% for construction begun in 2035, and 0% thereafter. The scope of the BOC Order is limited to the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar, so it is not clear to what extent any IRS guidance issued pursuant to the BOC Order might apply to other technologies or for other purposes of the ITC or PTC (including, for example, the domestic content or energy community adders).

D. Increased Domestic Content Requirement to Qualify for ITC Adder

Under prior law, the level of domestic content required to qualify for the domestic content adder for the ITC was permanently set at 40% (or 20% for offshore wind), while the percentage required to qualify for the PTC version of the adder increased over time. Under the BBBA, property that began construction before June 16, 2025 will continue to require 40% domestic content; however, projects beginning construction in 2025 after June 16, in 2026, or in a later year must consist of 45%, 50%, or 55% U.S. components, respectively, to qualify for the domestic content adder. These required percentages are lower (20%, 27.5%, and 35%) for offshore wind facilities beginning construction before 2027, then 55% thereafter.

E. PTC Adder for Nuclear Energy Communities

The BBBA expands the energy community credit adder to apply to certain advanced nuclear facilities that claim the PTC, but not to any such facilities that claim the ITC. An ""advanced nuclear facility"" is defined as any nuclear facility for which either the reactor design was approved after December 31, 1993, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and such a design or a substantially similar one was not approved before such date, or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has authorized construction and issued a site-specific construction permit or combined license. To qualify for the energy community bonus credit on this basis, the advanced nuclear facility must be located in a metropolitan statistical area which has (or at any time after December 31, 2009, had) 0.17% or greater direct employment related to the advancement of nuclear power.

F. Leased Systems Formerly Eligible for Section 25D Credit for Solar Water Heating or Wind

The BBBA disallows the ITC and PTC for solar heating property and wind property that qualifies for the homeowner's credit under section 25D, as in effect prior to its repeal by the BBBA. This disallowance is limited to property that is leased to the homeowner. An earlier version of the BBBA would have extended this disallowance to leased rooftop solar systems, but that provision was not included in the bill as enacted.

G. ITC for Fuel Cells

The BBBA creates a 30% ITC specifically for qualified fuel cell property that begins construction after 2025. This credit is not subject to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, but it also does not benefit from other ITC adders. Fuel cells had previously struggled to qualify for the ITC after revisions in the IRA required property for which the credit is claimed to have an anticipated greenhouse gas emissions rate of no greater than zero. Under the BBBA, fuel cells qualify for the full 30% ITC regardless of technology, fuel type, or greenhouse gas emission profile.

2. Transferability (Sale) of Credits

Section 6418, allowing transfers (sales) of tax credits, has been revised to disallow the transfer of most clean energy tax credits to any entity that is a specified foreign entity (see the discussion of the FEOC rules below). This is an improvement over earlier versions of the bill that would have more broadly phased out the ability to transfer credits.

3. Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X)

A. Phaseout of Credit for Applicable Critical Minerals

Under prior law, the section 45X manufacturing credit for applicable critical minerals had no expiration date. The BBBA adds a phaseout that starts one year later than the pre-existing phaseout for other section 45X eligible components. The full credit rate is available for applicable critical minerals sold before 2031. Applicable critical minerals sold in 2031, 2032, or 2033 will be eligible for 75%, 50%, or 25% respectively of the currently allowable credit. Applicable critical minerals sold after 2033 will not qualify for a credit.

B. New Applicable Critical Mineral Category: Metallurgical Coal

The BBBA creates a separate category of applicable critical minerals for metallurgical coal, defined as coal suitable for use in the production of steel within the meaning of guidance published by the Department of Energy. Metallurgical coal produced before January 1, 2030, will qualify for a credit of 2.5% of the relevant production costs.

C. Changes to Rules Regarding Other Eligible Components

The credit for production of wind energy components will not apply to components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. The phase-out for other eligible components is unchanged.

An additional requirement was added for a component to qualify for the $10 credit for battery modules. The module must be ""comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and battery harnesses, or other essential energy collection equipment.""

D. Reduced Scope of Integrated Component Rule

The BBBA modifies the rule that deems one or more eligible components to be sold to an unrelated person (as required to qualify for the credit) if such eligible components are integrated, incorporated, or assembled into another eligible component that is produced and sold to an unrelated person. Under the BBBA, the integration, incorporation, or assembly into the second eligible component must occur in the same manufacturing facility, at least 65% of the direct materials costs for the second eligible component must be for components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States, and the credit is unavailable if the second component is integrated, incorporated, or assembled into a third component. This rule applies to components sold during taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

4. Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

The credit for carbon capture and sequestration was largely untouched by the BBBA and, in one respect, was significantly enhanced: the credit amount per ton of captured carbon oxide that is used in enhanced oil or gas recovery or for other commercial purposes, such as food and beverage, was increased from the current rate of $60 per ton to $85 per ton, the rate that was previously available only for carbon oxide disposed of by sequestration. This increase in the credit amount is equally available to carbon oxide captured from industrial emissions or direct air capture. The increased credit amounts apply to facilities or equipment that are placed in service after July 4, 2025; carbon capture projects already placed in service would not be able to claim the higher credit amounts for these uses. The requirement that construction of carbon capture projects begin before January 1, 2033, is unchanged. The FEOC rules also apply to the Section 45Q credit as covered below.

5. Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z)

The BBBA extends the availability of the Clean Fuel Production Credit under Section 45Z to fuel sold through December 31, 2029. However, qualifying fuels produced after December 31, 2025, must be exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada. Under prior law, there had been a question as to whether certain production processes could be considered to have a negative emissions rate for most fuels by resulting in an enhanced credit amount. The BBBA explicitly rules out application of a negative emissions rate by providing that, for purposes of determining the emissions factor, qualifying fuels may not be treated as having an emissions rate of less than zero. However, the BBBA offers a significant exception to this prohibition in allowing biofuels derived from animal manure (which is the fuel category most commonly assigned a negative emissions rate) to have a negative emissions rate. In a blow to the sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF"") industry, the BBBA reduces the per gallon credit for SAF from $1.75 to the amount available to other transportation fuels of $1.00, effective for fuel produced after December 31, 2025. As with other credits, these changes are in addition to the limitations under the FEOC rules covered below.

6. Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V)

The BBBA accelerates the date by which clean hydrogen production projects must begin construction to December 31, 2027. This is considered a win for the sector after earlier versions of the BBBA would have required a 2025 beginning of construction date. The sector also benefits from the continued availability of the investment tax credit for hydrogen storage, compression and liquefaction equipment under section 48E and, as discussed above, the investment tax credit for hydrogen fuel cell property.

7. Termination of Other Clean Energy Credits

The BBBA significantly accelerates the end date for various tax credits relating to the acquisition of clean energy-related property. These credits, and the new applicable end dates, are as follows:

Section 25E Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 30D Clean Vehicle Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 45W Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit—property must be acquired by September 30, 2025;

Section 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit—property must be placed in service by December 31, 2025;

Section 25D Residential Clean Energy Credit—expenditures must be incurred by December 31, 2025;

Section 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit—property must be placed in service by June 30, 2026;

Section 45L New Energy Efficient Home Credit—home must be purchased by June 30, 2026; and

Section 179D Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction—property must begin construction by June 30, 2026.

8. Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC)

With the exception of the Section 45V credit for hydrogen production, all IRA tax credits that survive beyond 2026 are subject to disallowance under new FEOC rules if the taxpayer, facility, or product has impermissible connections to China or other disfavored countries or entities. The FEOC rules may disallow the relevant tax credit to a ""specified foreign entity,"" a ""foreign-influenced entity,"" or an entity that receives ""material assistance"" from a ""prohibited foreign entity."" Each of those terms has a complex definition, as described below. The particular rules that apply, and the effective date of those rules, varies from credit to credit, as set forth in the table below.

A. Prohibited Foreign Entities, Specified Foreign Entities, and Foreign-Influenced Entities

1. Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE)

A ""prohibited foreign entity"" (""PFE"") is defined as either a ""specified foreign entity"" (""SFE"") or a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (""FIE"").

2. Specified Foreign Entities (SFE)

An SFE is defined as a ""foreign-controlled entity"" (""FCE"") or an entity designated as a bad actor under certain existing statutes, including designation as a ""foreign entity of concern,"" a ""designated foreign terrorist organization,"" or a ""Chinese military company operating in the United States."" An FCE is defined as any of (i) the government of a covered nation (including any level of government below the national level and any agency or instrumentality thereof), (ii) a person who is a citizen or resident of a covered nation (and not also a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States), (iii) an entity organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (iv) an entity majority-controlled by one of the preceding types of FCEs. A ""covered nation"" is any of China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea.

3. Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIE)

An entity is an FIE if it satisfies either

a direct control test for the current tax year, or

with respect to the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit, an ""effective control"" test for the preceding tax year.

Under the direct control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if (i) a single SFE has the direct authority to appoint a board member, executive level officer, or person with similar powers or responsibilities, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate at least 40% of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the debt of the entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs. Special rules apply for determining whether a publicly traded entity is an FIE.

Under the effective control test, an entity is classified as an FIE if it makes a payment to an SFE pursuant to an agreement that entitles the SFE or a related party to exercise effective control over (i) a facility with respect to which the ITC or PTC may be available or (ii) the production of an ""eligible component"" under the section 45X manufacturing credit. The statute sets forth thirteen different powers, any one of which alone will constitute ""effective control."" These powers generally relate to power over operations or output of a facility, including exclusive control over a critical system within the facility. Six of those specified powers are operative immediately; seven of those specified powers are only relevant to the extent provided in regulations to be issued in the future. The BOC Order directs that ""within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

B. Material Assistance Rules for ITC, PTC, and Section 45X Manufacturing Credit

1. General Rules

A taxpayer is not entitled to claim the ITC, PTC, or section 45X manufacturing credit with respect to property with respect to which it receives ""material assistance"" from a PFE. Whether ""material assistance"" has been received is determined by comparing the ""material assistance cost ratio"" for such property to a ""threshold percentage.""

The material assistance cost ratio (""Cost Ratio"") of a qualified facility (under the ITC or PTC) or energy storage technology (under the ITC) is the ratio of (i) the total costs attributable to manufactured products (as defined for purposes of the domestic content adder) incorporated upon completion of construction excluding costs of products that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total costs attributable to manufactured products incorporated upon completion of construction. The Cost Ratio for a facility that produces eligible components under the section 45X manufacturing credit is the ratio of (i) the total direct costs that are paid or incurred for the production of an eligible component excluding costs paid or incurred for production of such eligible component that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, to (ii) the total direct costs paid or incurred for the production of the eligible component.

Threshold percentages are established by statute and vary by the type of property with respect to which a credit is being claimed and the year in which such property begins construction or is sold. Generally, the threshold percentages range from 40% to 95% and increase over time.

The BBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables no later than December 31, 2026, which will identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or total direct material costs of any eligible component which are attributable to a PFE and provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer's material assistance from a PFE. As noted above, the BOC Order directs Treasury to provide guidance regarding FEOC matters within 45 days of the July 4, 2025 date of enactment of the BBBA. Until such safe harbor tables are issued, taxpayers may rely on tables issued in guidance on the domestic content adder (Notice 2025-08) and certifications provided by suppliers under penalty of perjury stating that property or direct material costs were not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

For purposes of the ITC and PTC, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, for use in a facility that begins construction before August 1, 2025 and is placed in service before January 1, 2030 (or January 1, 2028 for wind and solar facilities), will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

For purposes of the section 45X manufacturing credit, property acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025 and used in a product sold before January 1, 2027 will not be considered in the calculation of the Cost Ratio.

2. Beginning of Construction (BOC)

Within the definitions of a PFE and ""material assistance,"" the BBBA directly incorporates IRS Notice 2013-29 and subsequent related guidance addressing the beginning of construction of a project or facility for tax purposes, as in effect on January 1, 2025. The narrow context (PFE and material assistance) in which the BBBA adopts the BOC principles in effect on January 1, 2025, suggests that this ""freeze"" of BOC guidance as of January 1, 2025, does not apply in any other context. That appears to be the theory underlying the President's direction to Treasury in the BOC Order to provide ""new and revised"" guidance regarding the meaning of ""beginning of construction"" for purposes of the phaseout of the ITC and PTC for wind and solar.

3. Penalties and Statute of Limitations

The FEOC rules impose new or harsher penalties relating to the material assistance rule and a longer statute of limitations for IRS examination of material assistance issues.

A taxpayer that claims a credit which is later disallowed due to an IRS adjustment to the Cost Ratio of the underlying property may be liable for a substantial understatement penalty on understatements of tax greater than 1% of the true tax liability, as opposed to the normal 10%.

A supplier who makes a certification under the material assistance rules that it knows or reasonably should have known is false will generally be required to pay a penalty of 10% of the resulting underpayment of tax by its customer.

The period during which the IRS may assess additional tax for an error relating to material assistance from a PFE is extended to six years.

4. ITC Recapture Rule for FEOC Effective Control Payments

A taxpayer will be subject to recapture of 100% of the ITC claimed with respect to a property if within 10 years after the property is placed in service it makes a payment that would be deemed to provide an SFE with ""effective control"" over the taxpayer as described above. This rule applies to property placed in service in tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

5. Summary of Application of FEOC Rules to Surviving Tax Credits

The table below summarizes the applicability of the FEOC rules disallowing tax credits to specified foreign entities, foreign-influenced entities and taxpayers who receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.

Credit Restrictions on SFEs Restrictions on FIEs Restrictions on Property with Material Assistance from a PFE Section 45Q—Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but ""effective control"" test does not apply). None Section 45U—Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027, (but ""effective control"" test does not apply). None Section 45V—Clean Hydrogen Production Credit None None None Section 45X—Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. ""Eligible components"" do not include any property which includes material assistance from a PFE for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Section 45Y—Clean Electricity Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities do not include any facility the construction of which includes material assistance from a PFE, and which begins construction after December 31, 2025. Section 45Z—Clean Fuel Production Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (but ""effective control"" test does not apply). None Section 48E—Clean Electricity Investment Credit No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. No credit for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025. Qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology do not include property the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025, if such construction includes material assistance from a PFE.

In addition to the time pressure to implement begun construction strategies and understand the implications of the FEOC rules, the BBBA creates a number of significant changes to existing tax credits, as well as adding new uncertainties for credit qualification, which may affect tax equity and transferability strategies. We at Baker Botts would be pleased to assist you in these and other clean energy tax incentive matters.

Footnote

1 ""ITC"" refers to the clean electricity investment credit under section 48E. ""PTC"" refers to the clean electricity production credit under section 45Y. Apart from some changes affecting geothermal heat pump property, the BBBA did not impose new restrictions or limitations on the energy credit under section 48 or the renewable electricity production credit under section 45, both of which are generally available only if construction of the relevant property began before 2025.

FedEx (NYSE: FDX) has announced an agreement with Neste, the world’s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, securing more than three million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for delivery at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to the world’s largest express cargo airline.
Through this agreement, FedEx has purchased blended fuel from Neste, to include a minimum of 30% neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel.
Sustainable aviation fuel, explained Sustainable aviation fuel is a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel, largely driven by lower emissions from the feedstocks used in the fuel production process.
Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%** over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel.
Neste SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste.","MEMPHIS, Tenn. FedEx (NYSE: FDX) has announced an agreement with Neste, the world’s leading producer of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, securing more than three million gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for delivery at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to the world’s largest express cargo airline. Through this agreement, FedEx has purchased blended fuel from Neste, to include a minimum of 30% neat Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel. As used in its blended form, the fuel will account for roughly a fifth of all jet fuel consumed annually by FedEx at LAX* and is the largest SAF purchase executed by a U.S. cargo airline at LAX to-date. Delivery of the fuel began earlier this month and will continue over the next year.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years, and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” said Karen Blanks Ellis, chief sustainability officer and vice president of Environmental Affairs, FedEx. “Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions. As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial U.S. deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” said Richard Smith, chief operating officer, International, and chief executive officer, Airline, FedEx. “While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed—alongside other innovations—we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

“Neste is excited to work with FedEx and support their ambitious goal of reaching carbon-neutral operations by 2040 with our SAF. Recognizing the important role of air cargo in the global economy, FedEx is demonstrating how this industry can leverage available lower-emission solutions like SAF to reduce its environmental impact. We look forward to further strengthening our cooperation,” says Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste.

This fuel purchase by FedEx builds upon years of the company’s efforts to co-create innovative sustainable aviation technologies with other industry leaders, including the ecoDemonstrator flight-test program with Boeing—the world’s first commercial airplane flight using 100% SAF in both engines that was conducted in 2018. In addition to the procurement of SAF, FedEx is pursuing multiple avenues to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption in its aviation operations overall, including aircraft fleet modernization, fuel conservation initiatives, and flight planning optimization. Collectively, fleet modernization and fuel saving efforts enabled FedEx in fiscal year 2024 to successfully achieve its goal of a 30% reduction in aviation emissions intensity from a 2005 baseline. FedEx set its first aviation emissions intensity reduction goals back in 2008.

Sustainable aviation fuel, explained

Sustainable aviation fuel is a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel, largely driven by lower emissions from the feedstocks used in the fuel production process. Neat SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel before use and is considered a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works within existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure without any equipment updates.

Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%** over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste.

While SAF production continues to grow in the U.S. and internationally, SAF accounted for less than 1% of all global jet fuel production in 2024. Amid the need for greater alternative fuel availability and accessibility for all airlines, FedEx will continue to advocate for expanded production and highlight SAF’s potential environmental and economic benefits.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg announced that methane gas released from cow waste can be processed using clean technology to extract hydrogen, which can then be used as a renewable energy source. He said this approach aligns with Sarawak’s ongoing efforts to reduce waste and convert agricultural and livestock by-products into useful resources.

“If we have a lot of cattle, we also have a lot of waste. That waste emits methane, which contains hydrogen. From methane, we can extract hydrogen and turn it into energy,” he explained during the International Day of Forests 2025 celebration, themed ‘Forests and Foods’, held today.

He described the initiative as a clear example of the circular economy in action, where organic waste is not discarded but transformed into high-value products, supporting both environmental protection and economic development.

In addition to cow waste, the Sarawak government is investing RM30 million through the Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (SALCRA) for a pilot project in Lubok Antu. The project aims to convert oil palm waste into biomass and biofuel.

“For years, we’ve focused on palm oil but neglected the by-products. Now, we’re using that waste to produce biomass and biofuel,” Abang Johari said. He added that early trials of converting the biomass into animal feed have yielded promising results, with livestock showing improved health and weight gain.

He further noted that the biofuel derived from palm waste could eventually be refined into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), offering another green energy solution for the future.

Recalling his speech at the ASEAN Economic Leaders’ Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Abang Johari shared a simple but impactful message that has since become a cornerstone of Sarawak’s environmental policy: “Don’t waste the waste – monetise the waste.”

This philosophy, he said, captures the spirit of Sarawak’s green growth strategy, which is gaining attention beyond Malaysia as a model for sustainable and economically viable environmental practices.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Climate-image-Bioenergy-Times.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:54.593582

Gross-Wen Technologies' Revolving Algal Biofilm (RAB) system uses algae to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater, creating fertilizer.

The RAB technology is being used in several Iowa cities and in a large-scale project in Pasco, Washington.

Algae is the star behind a Slater-based business that is using the green goo to clean municipal and industrial wastewater.

The sustainable process was developed by Martin Gross, founder and CEO of Gross-Wen Technologies. His advancements in water treatment recently earned Gross an Entrepreneur Of The Year 2025 Heartland Award, an honor Ernst & Young has bestowed on entrepreneurs for the past 40 years.

The awards “celebrate ambitious entrepreneurs who are transforming industries, impacting communities, and creating long-term value,” a news release stated.

Gross said he was “incredibly honored” to receive the award and said it “reflects the dedication of our team and the innovative spirit that drives our mission to build sustainable wastewater treatment solutions.”

Using algae to transform an environmental challenge like wastewater cleanup can help strengthen communities and create a more resilient future, he said.

How does algae help clean wastewater?

Gross-Wen provides sustainable wastewater treatment solutions using the company’s Revolving Algal Biofilm (RAB) technology. The low-energy, cost-effective approach to nutrient removal contributed to cleaner waterways and stronger circular economies.

The company’s system uses vertical conveyor belts, about 6 feet tall and 3 feet wide, that move in a continual loop, cycling through the wastewater and air as multiple layers of algae grow on them.

As the algae grows, it consumes nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater. The nutrient-rich algae is then harvested and pelletized. The algae pellets are used for a variety of different applications, such as fertilizer.

Where is Gross-Wen’s technology being used?

Gross-Wen installed a “commercial demonstration” site about seven years ago in the city of Slater.

“Then about three years ago, Slater turned on the commercial system that’s designed to treat their water,” Gross told the Ames Tribune. “It’s a 20-year project, so it will be treating Slater’s water for the next 20 years.”

A similar project is currently under construction for the city of Creston.

“Story Construction is the general contractor on that project, so it has a nice local connection,” Gross said. “Creston is using our technology to meet their nutrient reduction strategy there for nitrogen and phosphorus removal.”

Another Iowa project is in Iowa City at its wastewater plant and is a collaboration between Gross-Wen, the University of Iowa and the city.

Gross-Wen’s largest project is in Pasco, Washington, where the Resource Recovery Center will use RAB to clean wastewater from seven food processors within the city. The project supports the growth of Pasco’s growing agribusiness sector while turning wastewater into clean energy and providing clean water and nutrients to irrigate and fertilize city-owned farmlands.

""We just installed the project in Pasco last year, and it's the largest algae-based wastewater treatment facility in the world,"" Gross said.

That project is enabling the reuse of about 1.5 billion gallons of wastewater per year and is estimated to produce enough renewable natural gas to supply more than 4,500 Washington residents with natural gas each year.

What is next for the Entrepreneur Of The Year contest?

As a Heartland Award winner, Gross is now eligible for consideration for the Entrepreneur Of The Year 2025 National Awards. The national award winners will be announced in November. The Entrepreneur Of The Year National Overall Award winner will then move on to compete for the EY World Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in June 2026.

NASA has tested a scale X-59 experimental aircraft at speeds of Mach 1.4 to validate its quiet supersonic technology.

In partnership with the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), NASA tested the model in a wind tunnel, measuring the shockwaves generated when breaking the sound barrier.

The tests allowed NASA to validate how closely real-world airflow matched predictions from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models.

The X-59 is part of NASA’s Quesst mission (Quiet SuperSonic Technology), which aims to make overland supersonic passenger flights possible.

The hand-sized NASA X-59 test model

The full size NASA X-59 will be over 99 feet long (30 metres), with a wingspan of almost 30 feet (9 metres). However, the test model used in the Japanese wind tunnel is just 1.6% of the size at around 19 inches from nose to tail.

The aircraft was exposed to airflow matching the jet’s planned cruising speed of Mach 1.4 (around 925 mph).

The series of tests performed at JAXA allowed NASA researchers to gather critical experimental data to compare to their predictions derived through Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling, which include how air will flow around the aircraft.

This is the third round of wind tunnel testing for the X-59 following another test at JAXA and one at NASA’s Glenn Research Center in Ohio.

NASA hailed the test as “an important milestone for NASA’s one-of-a-kind X-59, which is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound without causing a loud sonic boom.”

Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works has developed the X-59 for NASA’s Low-Boom Flight Demonstrator project. Work on the project has been ongoing since 2016. The first flight of the full size model is expected later this year.

Quesst: Lowering the noise of supersonic travel

When built, the X-59 is expected to cruise at Mach 1.42 at an altitude of 55,000 feet, and is designed to break the sound barrier without the hallmark ‘thump’ supersonic aircraft usually create.

The NASA X-59 does this by disrupting shockwaves to prevent them merging together, reducing the potential for a loud boom.

It could provide a breakthrough to open up supersonic travel around the world. Previous supersonic commercial aircraft like Concorde were banned from flying supersonic over land, limiting routes to over water.

Lockheed Martin writes that the experimental X-59 will help NASA provide regulators with the information needed to establish an “acceptable commercial supersonic noise standard to lift the ban on commercial supersonic travel over land.”

But regulators are moving ahead anyway, at least in the US. In June, President Trump signed an executive order encouraging regulators to fast-track the return of overland supersonic travel, potentially paving the way for lifting existing restrictions.

Supersonic passenger travel makes a comeback… quietly

With the X-59 paving the way for quiet supersonic flight, attention is also turning to commercial players. Chief among them is Boom Supersonic, a US company working towards bringing a supersonic passenger aircraft to market.

Earlier this year, Boom flew its XB-1 demonstrator at Mach speeds with zero audible noise on the ground. In what the company calls ‘boomless cruise,’ the aircraft uses altitude to ensure the sonic boom does not reach the ground.

This technology will be fundamental to its full size passenger aircraft, the Overture. The Overture is planned to have a range of 4,250 nautical miles and a cruise speed of Mach 1.7. It will have a seating capacity of 60-80 passengers.

United Airlines, American Airlines, and Japan Airlines have all placed orders and pre-orders for the Overture.

For now, it seems unlikely that supersonic travel will be viable on a large scale. The aviation industry is overwhelmingly focused on increased efficiency and reduced fuel consumption. The most economical speed for commercial aircraft is in the Mach 0.78-0.85 range.

Next-generation commercial aircraft are increasingly focussed on fuel savings rather than speed. JetZero’s revolutionary new Z4 Blended Wing Body aircraft is also subsonic and seeks to reduce fuel consumption by up to 50%.

While Boom says the Overture will be compatible with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, critics argue that high fuel burn rates may still make supersonic travel environmentally burdensome, even with SAF.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NASA-X-59.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 10:07:02.865747

Despite near-term challenges such as fluctuating refining margins and regulatory risks, the company's progress on critical initiatives—from the Wyoming refinery restart to its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ambitions—positions it for sustained outperformance. Let's dissect the catalysts, risks, and valuation dynamics to determine whether PARR deserves a buy rating.

Operational Catalysts: Turnarounds and Strategic Projects

1. Wyoming Refinery Restart: A Success Story

The company's flagship Wyoming refinery, which idled in February 2025 due to an equipment malfunction, returned to full operations by late April—a month ahead of schedule. This restart is a major win:

- Throughput Recovery: While Q1 2025 throughput dropped to 6Mbpd (vs. 17Mbpd in Q1 2024), the refinery's Adjusted Gross Margin (AGM) surged to $19.83/bbl, up from $14.84/bbl in 2024, driven by higher Wyoming Index prices ($20.31 vs. $17.23).

- Cost Management: Though production costs spiked to $34.35/bbl (vs. $7.86/bbl in 2024) due to incident-related expenses, the refinery's faster-than-expected ramp-up reduces long-term cash flow drag.

2. Montana Turnaround: Margin Improvements Ahead

The Montana refinery's ongoing turnaround is nearing completion. This project aims to:

- Reduce maintenance costs and downtime.

- Optimize utilization of the refinery's 52Mbpd capacity.

- Capitalize on the region's abundant Bakken crude supply.

In Q1 2025, Montana's AGM fell to $5.04/bbl (vs. $13.82/bbl in 2024) due to lower index prices, but post-turnaround efficiency gains should reverse this trend.

3. Hawaii SAF Project: A Climate-Resilient Growth Engine

Par Pacific's $300 million Hawaii SAF project—a first-of-its-kind in the Pacific—is on track to produce 12 million gallons/year of low-carbon fuel by 2026. This aligns with global demand for sustainable aviation fuels, which is projected to grow at 15% annually through 2030. The project:

- Leverages Hawaii's renewable energy infrastructure.

- Secures long-term contracts with airlines and the U.S. military.

- Enhances margins via premium pricing for SAF.

Financial Strength: Buybacks and Balance Sheet Flexibility

Share Repurchases: PARR repurchased $51 million of stock in Q1 2025, reducing shares outstanding by 5%. With a $525 million liquidity buffer (including $133.7 million cash), the company can continue buybacks to boost EPS.

Debt Management: Net debt/EBITDA improved to 2.5x at the end of Q1, down from 3.0x in late 2024, signaling financial discipline.

Valuation Dynamics: Undervalued Relative to Peers

PE Multiple: PARR trades at 6.2x 2024E EBITDA, below peers like Valero (8.5x) and Marathon Petroleum (9.0x).

Margin Recovery Potential: As refining margins normalize and turnarounds yield results, EBITDA could rebound to $400 million in 2025 (vs. $94.7M in Q1).

Risks to Consider

Overbought Technicals: PARR's stock has risen 25% YTD, raising short-term overvaluation concerns. Investors should monitor resistance at $22/share.

SRE Exposure: The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in Louisiana, which PARR operates under contract, faces political risk. A government sale of SPR crude could depress regional prices.

Regulatory Hurdles: The Wyoming refinery's 2025 incident underscores the need for ongoing compliance investments.

Investment Thesis: Buy with a 12-Month Horizon

Bull Case: If refining margins recover to 2024 levels and the Hawaii SAF project achieves commercial scale, PARR's EBITDA could hit $500 million by 2026. At 8x EBITDA, this implies a 2026 target price of $30/share.

Bear Case: Persistent weak refining margins or delays in the Montana turnaround could cap upside. However, the company's liquidity and buybacks provide a safety net.

Conclusion

Par Pacific's execution of turnarounds, strategic capital allocation, and long-term SAF opportunities create a compelling growth narrative. While risks like overbought technicals and SRE exposure exist, the company's operational resilience and undervalued stock price justify a buy rating. Investors should focus on margin recovery metrics and Hawaii SAF progress as key catalysts.

What the preliminary report does say What we know for certain is that the aircraft lost power in both engines just after takeoff.
The preliminary investigation suggests both engines shut down because the fuel flow stopped.
We don’t know what the pilots did Flight data recorders don’t capture pilot actions.
But the preliminary report is not the full story.","Over the weekend, the Indian Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau released a preliminary report on last month’s crash of Air India flight 171, which killed 260 people, 19 of them on the ground.

The aim of a preliminary report is to present factual information gathered so far and to inform further lines of inquiry. However, the 15-page document has also led to unfounded speculation and theories that are currently not supported by the evidence.

Here’s what the report actually says, why we don’t yet know what caused the crash, and why it’s important not to speculate.

What the preliminary report does say

What we know for certain is that the aircraft lost power in both engines just after takeoff.

According to the report, this is supported by video footage showing the deployment of the ram air turbine (RAT), and the examination of the air inlet door of the auxiliary power unit (APU).

The RAT is deployed when both engines fail, all hydraulic systems are lost, or there is a total electrical power loss. The APU air inlet door opens when the system attempts to start automatically due to dual engine failure.

The preliminary investigation suggests both engines shut down because the fuel flow stopped. Attention has now shifted to the fuel control switches, located on the throttle lever panel between the pilots.

Data from the enhanced airborne flight recorder suggests these switches may have been moved from “run” to “cutoff” three seconds after liftoff. Ten seconds later, the switches were moved back to “run”.

The report also suggests the pilots were aware the engines had shut down and attempted to restart them. Despite their effort, the engines couldn’t restart in time.

We don’t know what the pilots did

Flight data recorders don’t capture pilot actions. They record system responses and sensor data, which can sometimes lead to the belief they’re an accurate representation of the pilot’s actions in the cockpit.

While this is true most of the time, this is not always the case.

In my own work investigating safety incidents, I’ve seen cases in which automated systems misinterpreted inputs. In one case, a system recorded a pilot pressing the same button six times in two seconds, something humanly impossible. On further investigation, it turned out to be a faulty system, not a real action.

We cannot yet rule out the possibility that system damage or sensor error led to false data being recorded. We also don’t know whether the pilots unintentionally flicked the switches to “cutoff”. And we may never know.

As we also don’t have a camera in the cockpit, any interpretation of pilots’ actions will be made indirectly, usually through the data sensed by the aircraft and the conversation, sound and noise captured by the environmental microphone available in the cockpit.

We don’t have the full conversation between the pilots

Perhaps the most confusing clue in the report was an excerpt of a conversation between the pilots. It says:

This short exchange is entirely without context. First, we don’t know who says what. Second, we don’t know when the question was asked – after takeoff, or after the engine started to lose power? Third, we don’t know the exact words used, because the excerpt in the report is paraphrased.

Finally, we don’t know whether the exchange referred to the engine status or the switch position. Again, we may never know.

What’s crucial here is that the current available evidence doesn’t support any theory about intentional fuel cutoff by either of the pilots. To say otherwise is unfounded speculation.

We don’t know if there was a mechanical failure

The preliminary report indicates that, for now, there are no actions required by Boeing, General Electric or any company that operates the Boeing 787-8 and/or GEnx-1B engine.

This has led some to speculate that a mechanical failure has been ruled out. Again, it is far too early to conclude that.

What the preliminary report shows is that the investigation team has not found any evidence to suggest the aircraft suffered a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention or suspension of operations around the world.

This could be because there was no catastrophic failure. It could also be because the physical evidence has been so badly damaged that investigators will need more time and other sources of evidence to learn what happened.

Why we must resist premature conclusions

In the aftermath of an accident, there is much at stake for many people: the manufacturer of the aircraft, the airline, the airport, civil aviation authority and others. The families of the victims understandably demand answers.

It’s also tempting to latch onto a convenient explanation. But the preliminary report is not the full story. It’s based on very limited data, analysed under immense pressure, and without access to every subsystem or mechanical trace.

The final report is still to come. Until then, the responsible position for regulators, experts and the public is to withhold judgement.

This tragedy reminds us that aviation safety depends on patient and thorough investigation – not media soundbites or unqualified expert commentary. We owe it to the victims and their families to get the facts right, not just fast.

The scheme will arm consumers with accurate flight emissions data to make more informed decisions when they book flights, pay to offset carbon emissions, or use miles to purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credits.

Agreed by the European Commission in December 2024 as part of Regulation (EU) 2024/3170, the so-called EU Flight Emissions Label (FEL) is focused on providing a trustworthy framework for airlines to share flight emissions data with consumers. It will harmonise emissions calculation methodology, data reporting, and emissions display for all airlines in the EU. And when booking flights, passengers will be able to see standardised emissions information derived from data from actual flight performance.

To prepare for the FEL’s wider implementation, EASA has inked a new memorandum of cooperation with Air France-KLM that will see the airline group provide “valuable insights to help us shape, refine, and optimize the scheme,” EASA executive director Florian Guillermet explains. Air France and KLM will each assess and test EASA’s new FEL portal, provide emissions-related data and participate in an EASA-guided onboarding process, among other tasks, before formally participating in the FEL.

“Air France-KLM is committed to ensuring a true global level playing field,” says Air France-KLM CEO Benjamin Smith. “We are proactively collaborating with the European Commission and EASA, bringing our expertise to the forefront of initiatives like the EU Flight Emissions Label.

“Our early and active participation is designed to help shape a fair, transparent, and effective framework for all airlines. This initiative is a critical component of our broader strategy to lead the decarbonisation of our industry. We will continue to leverage every available tool to reduce our environmental footprint, and we believe that common, transparent standards are essential to support our collective journey towards sustainable aviation.”

By voluntarily participating early in the process, Air France-KLM will benefit from early access to the label’s results and methodologies, as well as reporting and validation processes, adds EASA.

Whilst airlines from both EU and non-EU countries are welcome to voluntarily join the FEL, only those airlines that have joined are allowed to display emissions to their passengers in the EU, under the law. As such, airlines are being encouraged to join the FEL if they want to display flight emissions and use these estimates when offering SAF or other emissions offsets to passengers.

A dedicated logo, displayed alongside flight emissions data, will guarantee that the information is reliable, helping to protect passengers from greenwashing claims, according to the EC. And since the estimations are based on actual consumption data, it will also encourage airlines to operate more efficiently and sustainably, it says.

This week, Geelong Refinery successfully processed 10 tonnes of tyre pyrolysis oil alongside crude oil toproduce a full range of fuels and products. This follows the refinery processing a similar quantity of pyrolysis oil derived from waste plastic in May, demonstrating its capability to process at scale oils made from waste and the critical role the facility will play in Australia's sustainable future.

The development is a significant step in plans to establish tyre-recycling in Melbourne. For this demonstration, the tyre pyrolysis oil was imported from Poland with appropriate approvals from the Australian Government - it is currently not available domestically.

Earlier this year, Viva Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with Klean Industries, a Canadian resource recovery and advanced recycling provider, to study the potential to create a tyre-recycling facility in Melbourne capable of processing up to 80,000 tonnes of used tyres per year.

The recycling facility proposed by Klean would extract three products from tyres: recovered carbon black (rCB), steel, and biogenic pyrolysis oil. Under the agreement, Viva Energy would take the biogenic pyrolysis oil for processing at Geelong Refinery, allowing it to create lower-carbon intensity fuels.

Viva Energy's successful processing of tyre pyrolysis oil not only signals progress for Australia's own sustainable fuel industry, but also brings the country in line with global efforts to advance circular economies.

Tyre pyrolysis oil is already recognised in the EU as a low-carbon alternative to traditional fuels and feedstocks. Australia currently does not recognise lower-carbon fuels made via co-processing, meaning the associated carbon reduction benefits cannot be claimed by Viva Energy's customers.

That is something that could change with the right policy settings, according to Viva Energy Chief Strategy Officer Lachlan Pfeiffer.

""The refinery's ability to process pyrolysis oil from both tyres and waste plastic demonstrates the versatility of our facility and our commitment to supporting a lower-carbon future,"" Mr Pfeiffer said. ""Viva Energy is proud to play a role in the production of lower-carbon fuels and products and reduce the number of tyres that go into landfill. The project can only proceed if the regulatory landscape encourages businesses to progress these important initiatives.""

It is a sentiment supported by Lina Goodman, CEO of Tyre Stewardship Australia, who said the processing of tyre pyrolysis oil at Geelong Refinery is a significant step forward in demonstrating the potential of end-of-life tyres as a valuable resource.

""Tyre pyrolysis oil is increasingly recognised internationally, particularly in the EU, as a low-carbon alternative,"" she said. ""We welcome initiatives that showcase the viability of these solutions at scale that extract value from end-of-life tyres and support the transition to a more sustainable, low-emissions future for Australia.""

Viva Energy's successful refinement of tyre pyrolysis oil, produced using Klean Industries' advanced thermal conversion technology, marks a significant milestone for the circular economy in Australia, according to Jesse Klinkhamer, Klean Industries Inc.

""This achievement not only confirms the quality and compatibility of our recovered oils with existing refining infrastructure but also demonstrates the commercial viability of converting end-of-life tyres into high-value, low-carbon fuels and chemicals. It's a crucial step forward in fulfilling Klean Industries' vision of establishing a fully integrated resource recovery and low-carbon fuel production facility in Melbourne, Australia,"" he said.

Стратегія декарбонізації авіації та відповідність вимогам ЄС

Запровадження SAF у портфелі ORLEN стало важливим етапом для досягнення цілей вуглецевої нейтральності в авіаційній галузі. Розширення асортименту продукції відображає зростаючий попит на декарбонізацію з боку авіаперевізників та відповідає сучасним викликам щодо зниження впливу на довкілля. Окрім цього, ORLEN дотримується положень Регламенту ЄС ReFuel, який передбачає, що вже у 2025 році частка біопалива в авіаційному секторі має бути не меншою за 2% від загального обсягу реактивного палива.

Масштаби впровадження SAF та міжнародна підтримка

Регламент ReFuel охоплює ті аеропорти Європейського союзу, які упродовж минулого року обслужили понад 800 тисяч пасажирів та опрацювали 100 тисяч тонн вантажу. Використання SAF у таких масштабах сприяє зменшенню вуглецевого сліду від авіаперевезень та відповідає сучасним екологічним стандартам.

“Як стало відомо раніше, не менше 43 авіакомпаній вже взяли на себе зобов’язання використати близько 13 млн тонн SAF у 2030 році, при цьому регулярно оголошується і про нові угоди щодо постачання”.

Основною сировиною для виробництва SAF залишається використана кулінарна олія, що підкреслює екологічність нового виду пального. Зростання кількості підписаних контрактів між постачальниками та авіакомпаніями свідчить про поступове впровадження сталих практик у сфері авіаційного транспорту.

This can be largely attributed to significant volatility in Brent crude prices due to substantial geopolitical tensions.

At the beginning of June, Ukraine conducted a surprise drone attack on several Russian airbases. Additionally, nuclear talks between the United States and Iran stalled, and Israel launched airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear sites. Iran retaliated with drone strikes, and Iranian parliamentarians started preparing a bill to withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, causing oil prices to rise.

Towards the end of the month, the US conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. But investors saw no immediate impact on physical oil flows, and the intensity of Iran’s response appeared to subside. On the 24 June, President Trump announced that a ceasefire had been agreed, and oil prices marked their sharpest two-day decline since 2022, at 13%.

GBP appreciated from US$1.355 to US$1.370 in June, reaching its highest level since October 2021. The US dollar continued to weaken after President Trump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from 25% to 50%.

Furthermore, he insisted that the US Federal Reserve must lower interest rates, but the central bank held them between 4.25% and 4.5%. Consequently, there has been speculation that Trump will announce a successor to Chair Jerome Powell by September.

Meanwhile, Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey suggested that Trump has “blown up” the multilateral trade system that underpins the global economy, stating that the path of interest rates remains uncertain. BoE opted to maintain rates at 4.25%, amid persistent inflation.

Recent economic data showed that the UK’s private sector is still expanding, albeit marginally, and the International Monetary Fund upgraded the UK’s 2025 growth outlook. Finally, the government released a new Industrial Strategy, including a decade-long plan to increase investment and support UK industries, causing the pound to strengthen further.

GBP closed over 1% higher than the beginning of the month, leading to a c.0.47ppl reduction in UK wholesale diesel.

Wholesale UK renewable diesel (HVO) prices increased from 109.5ppl towards 130ppl before closing the month at 121ppl (excluding duty and RTFC benefit), due to tightening supply and increased demand.

The US Energy Information Administration lowered its forecast for HVO production in 2025 from 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 210,000bpd. Additionally, US renewable diesel production declined, despite stronger exports to Canada earlier in June.

On the demand side, UK imports of used cooking oil (UCO) reached their highest level since December 2024, following increased inflows from the Netherlands. In China, UCO prices reached multi-year highs on sustained demand from domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers.

However, EU imports of UCO hit a five-month low as intake from China slowed, despite expectations that the US-China tariff announcements would increase flows to Europe.

In other news, the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification system has published 18 proposals for improving biofuel certification under the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive, after facing criticisms and widespread industry concern over the alleged fraud in the biofuel and feedstock supply chain.

Those previous complaints include the mislabelling of biofuels, including fake biofuels and biofuels made from virgin vegetable oil feedstocks but labelled as waste-based fuels. The EU has since launched the Union Database for Biofuels to track the supply chain from feedstock generation to end-use.

Finally, the cost of blending biodiesel to the UK B7 specification remained unchanged at just below 7.5ppl throughout the month, and thus the cost of Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation stayed the same.

Meanwhile, the price of Renewable Transport Fuel Certificates (RTFCs) declined fractionally from 25.7 pence per certificate to around 25p, slightly reducing the benefit that HVO consumers received (assuming 100% of the RTFC benefit is passed on the end-user).",https://www.route-one.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/07/Portland-column-July-2025-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:01:55.270543

As India emerges as a global logistics hub, forward-thinking leadership becomes critical in shaping resilient and digitally empowered air cargo ecosystems.","The Air Cargo Forum India (ACFI) concluded its annual conclave at the Taj Palace, New Delhi. The mega gathering consisted of delegates from leading corporations in Air logistics, policymakers, and prominent think tanks from India and abroad. The conclave was themed “Air Cargo Leadership in a Changing World.” It focused on four key themes: resilience through innovation, sustainable and green cargo infrastructure, express logistics and e-commerce acceleration, cargo security, regulations, and risk management.

Sanjiv Edward, President, ACFI and CEO – Cargo and Logistics, GMR Group, chaired the inaugural session. The other participants were Arun Kumar, Honorary Secretary ACFI and Managing Director, Infinity Supply Chain Solutions Pvt Ltd, Avinash Razdan, Honorary Treasurer, Group CEO – CSC Group (Delhi Cargo Service Center), Karanjit Singh Wadhwa, Chairman, ACFI Event Management and Director, Grace Group, Satish Lakkaraju, Board Member, ACFI and CEO, Nexgen Logistics Pvt Ltd, Glyn Hughes, Director General, TIACA, Piyush Srivastava, Senior Economic Adviser, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Dheeraj Rastogi, Principal Commissioner of Customs, Delhi Customs and Ramesh Mamidala, Head Cargo Commercial, Air India Ltd.

In his presidential address, Edward said the cargo stood at a pivotal historical moment. He said that India was no longer a silent facilitator of global trade. The air cargo industry has emerged as a strategic enabler of economic growth. India was at the forefront of this global transformation. India’s ambition in logistics has shifted from incremental change to leapfrogging for the future, where the Indian air cargo sector becomes an international benchmark. In concluding remarks, he said, “Together let us rise to this moment, when air cargo soars, India roars. And when India awakens, the world looks at us.”

The Chief Guest of Honour, Rastogi, emphasised the need to ensure compliance with a host of laws governing goods entering or exiting India, both speedily and efficiently. At the same time, measures should be taken to protect the country from unlawful intrusions of cargo. The strategy in the past decade had been to automate most of the tasks in the chain. The process started with digitalisation and graduated into the integration of stakeholders. Subsequently, there was the emergence of SWIFT, followed by eSANCHIT and the development of the risk management system. This ensured that we focused on noncompliance and, at the same time, facilitated the compliant trade.

The second Chief Guest of Honour, Srivastava, said that the global geopolitical situation would not improve for quite some time. India needed to be ready for this disruption through innovation and technology. He conceded that this change was difficult. The demand could be instant and unpredictable, but ramping up the supply took time. He felt it was necessary to concentrate on disruptive changes. They were inevitable and part of the system. The aviation sector is undergoing many changes and may not be the same 20 years down the line.

Glyn Hughes, Director General of TIACA, said that in 2025, the industry faced one of the biggest challenges as trade policy was dictated by the world’s largest economy, which sought to unravel the success of the last three decades. We could not afford to rewind the success, which was why the event’s theme was crucial and apt.

On this occasion, ACFI signed an MoU with TIACA to strengthen global collaboration and knowledge sharing.

Further, ACFI and ASCELA Insights released the knowledge paper ‘India’s Air Cargo Horizon—Seizing Global Reroutes, Regional Dominance and Resilience’, unveiling a transformative vision to position India as a global air cargo hub.

The first Business Session was themed, From Turbulence to Triumph – India’s Air Cargo Rise in a New World Order. Ramesh Mamidala moderated the session. The participants included Mark Sutch, Chief Commercial Officer – CarGo International, IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd), Suvendu Choudhury, Vice President, Operations Planning & Engineering, India, FedEx, and Rajkumar S, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Sequel Logistics Private Limited. Himanshu Pant, Managing Director & CEO, MGH Group, and Vineet Malhotra, Director, Kale Logistics.

Dwelling on the session’s theme, Sutch said that the next twelve months would be highly uncertain due to the regional geopolitical situation. But he felt that the air cargo industry was very resilient. The industry was able to tide over the Red Sea crisis, even though the crisis has not abated.

The second Business Session was on the Tech-Driven Cargo: Accelerating Express, E-Commerce & Data-Led Operations. The Moderator was Lakkaraju. The panellists were Joyce Tai, Executive Vice President, Freightos; Cyrus Katgara, Partner, Jeena & Company; Rajesh Menon, Regional Head of Cargo for South Asia, Middle East, and Africa, Cathay Cargo; Ravinder Kumar Pathri, Managing Director, Sales, FedEx, Alok Kumar Singh, Lead Logistics, Tata Electronics and Parvinder Singh, Managing Director, Hans Informatics.

Pathri discusses the progression of technology in his company. He explains that the device they had created measures the real-time visibility of sensitive cargo. It would give real-time information about the package to the minute. The device could monitor temperature, provide stock information, humidity, light exposure, and track compliance. FedEx was planning to be carbon neutral by 2040.

The third Business Session dwelt on Business Session Green Corridors & Sustainable Trade Lane – Air Cargo’s ESG Imperative. The session was moderated by Keku Bomi Gazder, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Aviapro Logistics Services Pvt Ltd. The engaging panellists were Anupama Kachhap, Head of Commercial, WFS Bengaluru Private Limited, Glyn Hughes, Director General, TIACA, and Kadhir Kadhiravan, Dy. Chief Executive Officer, GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd, Dinkar Singh, Director, Public Affairs, Indian Subcontinent, UPS, and Devi James Melchoir, Senior Vice President – Logistics, Indev Infra Private Limited.

Hughes, dwelling on the theme, said that five years ago, sustainability was a subject that was not talked about in conferences. This has now changed. There are now discussions on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The aviation industry is expected to be net zero by 2050. Globally, SAF production would account for about 1% of the fuel needs this year, costing more than 3 times the regular fuel. It was estimated that the world would need about 8000 refineries to produce the fuel required, which would require significant investments from the Government. It would also call for a firm commitment from the aviation sector.

The fourth and concluding Business Session was themed on Securing India’s Cargo Future: Compliance, Risk and Resilience by Design. The session was conducted by Yashpal Sharma, Chairman and Managing Director, Skyways Group. The participants in the discussion were Keku Bomi Gazder, Managing Director & CEO, Aviapro Logistics Services Pvt. Ltd, P Balasubramanium, Founder & CEO, Air Cargo Consultancy International Services (ACCIS), Rajesh Menon is the Regional Head of Cargo for South Asia, Middle East, and Africa (SAMEA), Dr Ravi Prakash Mathur, Head – Global Freight and Projects, Apollo Tyres Ltd, Kiran Jain, COO, Noida International Airport, Giridharan Srinivasan, Area General Manager – Indian Subcontinent, Commercial, Etihad Cargo and Faizabad Ahmed, Vice President, ICICI Lombard

Yash asked Giridharan about the risks involved in the logistics industry. He responded that new-age risks are constantly evolving. Today, cyber risk is one of the most significant risks encountered by the industry. Yet, people do not have answers to resolve this huge liability. India is the most susceptible country to cybercrimes.

Based on her experience in airports, Jain said that most airports worldwide focus on cargo, not passengers. However, the upcoming Noida Airport was a greenfield project, allowing them to focus on both. Whether it be sustainability, compliance, or risk management, it ultimately came down to proper airport design.

The conclave ended with the Innovation Awards Ceremony, recognising trailblazing innovations shaping the industry’s future. AFA focuses on a pivotal crossroads in a world marked by geopolitical shifts, technological disruption, and evolving consumer expectations. Leadership in this changing environment demands more than operational efficiency—it requires vision, agility, and collaboration across the entire value chain. As India emerges as a global logistics hub, forward-thinking leadership becomes critical in shaping resilient and digitally empowered air cargo ecosystems. The Air Cargo Forum India underscores this transformative journey, reminding us that authentic leadership is not just about navigating change but anticipating it, embracing innovation, and charting a bold path forward.",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ACFI.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:02:00.021286

The programme will focus on the unique challenges that small island states, like Singapore, face in the aviation and maritime industries, Mr Siow said at the opening of the Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium.
The collaboration recognises “increasing interdependencies between the aviation and maritime sectors, and the common challenges they face”, said Mr Siow.
“Because of Singapore’s connectivity, we can see and feel first-hand how global trends are shaping aviation and maritime,” Mr Siow said.
Safety the ‘foundation’ of aviation, maritime sectors Maintaining safety has become more demanding as air and sea traffic grows and operating environments become more complex, said Mr Siow.","SINGAPORE – More aviation and maritime officials from around the world will be trained here in Singapore, as the Republic launches and develops new training programmes in these two sectors.

The programmes support the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which Acting Transport Minister Jeffrey Siow said were examples of multilateral institutions that are “pillars of a rules-based international order”.

They are among efforts to cement Singapore’s position as an aviation and maritime hub.

The training programmes include one for transport officials from the Small Island Developing States (Sids), comprising states in the Caribbean and Pacific islands, among others.

The programme will focus on the unique challenges that small island states, like Singapore, face in the aviation and maritime industries, Mr Siow said at the opening of the Global Aviation and Maritime Symposium.

The first training programme for Sids will be in 2026, for officials from the Caribbean island states. Courses for the Pacific island states and others are in the pipeline.

Mr Siow also said Singapore will work with the ICAO and IMO on a new global initiative to develop and deliver specialised training programmes for officials and practitioners across both the aviation and maritime sectors.

The collaboration recognises “increasing interdependencies between the aviation and maritime sectors, and the common challenges they face”, said Mr Siow.

Mr Siow also announced the extension of the Singapore-ICAO Developing Countries Training Programme, funding 330 fellowships and 10 scholarships valued at US$1.8 million (S$2.3 million) over the next three years. This is aimed at supporting officials from developing ICAO member states in attending aviation-related courses.

The Republic has also committed a second tranche of US$3 million to the Enhanced Technical Co-Operation and Training Package for IMO and its member states, said Mr Siow.

These funds will support courses for seafarers on alternative fuels, digitalisation, marine casualty investigations and other areas. Singapore had already pledged US$5 million for a five-year period from 2024 to 2028.

To date, Singapore has run aviation and maritime training courses for more than 1,800 participants under the Singapore-ICAO Developing Countries Training Programme, and over 2,400 participants under the Singapore-IMO Third Country Training Programme, Mr Siow said.

He said at the symposium that Singapore has been “a strong supporter” of the ICAO and IMO since it joined both organisations in 1966, and served as a member of the ICAO and IMO councils since 2003 and 1993, respectively.

The event has brought the global aviation and maritime communities together for the first time, including the secretaries-general of the ICAO and IMO,

ICAO and IMO ‘pillars’ in unpredictable world

Mr Siow said Singapore remains committed to working with the ICAO and IMO.

“In an increasingly unpredictable global climate, multilateral institutions like the ICAO and IMO are pillars of a rules-based international order,” he said.

For example, their “clear, rules-based frameworks” allow the safe movement of people and goods by air and sea, even during crises.

And they provide “steadfast leadership” even in “periods of transition and turbulence”, serving as platforms for collective action and global cooperation, Mr Siow said.

To Singapore, “connectivity is existential”, Mr Siow said. “We are a major aviation and maritime hub, connected to around 170 cities by air and over 600 ports across 120 countries.”

Singapore is also a hub for international travel and trade, and has invested in upgrading its airport and seaport, as well as air traffic and vessel traffic management systems, he added.

“Because of Singapore’s connectivity, we can see and feel first-hand how global trends are shaping aviation and maritime,” Mr Siow said.

These trends include “more fragmented and volatile” economic and geopolitical environments, resulting in rising costs and heightened uncertainty, he said. This has had knock-on effects on freight networks and port operations worldwide.

At the same time, consumer demand for transport is growing faster than capacity, Mr Siow noted. As passenger and cargo traffic by air and sea continue to grow, “countries are striving to build infrastructure and capability to meet the rising demand”.

The aviation and maritime industries are also grappling with longer-term issues such as climate change and technology, he added.

In his speech, Mr Siow said two challenges that both industries must tackle are safety and sustainability.

Safety the ‘foundation’ of aviation, maritime sectors

Maintaining safety has become more demanding as air and sea traffic grows and operating environments become more complex, said Mr Siow.

For example, airspace for flights is tightly regulated, and maritime vessels in open waters sail without central traffic control, relying on onboard navigation systems and local guidance near ports to ensure safe passage.

New technologies are being used in both sectors to improve operations, “but they also bring new risks”, Mr Siow noted, such as cyber security threats and system vulnerabilities.

“We must ensure that our people are well-equipped to use these technologies safely, and make the right decisions even under pressure,” Mr Siow said. “This is why training remains critical.”

As for sustainability, Mr Siow noted that the aviation and maritime sectors each contribute about 3 per cent of global emissions, adding that aviation and maritime decarbonisation must be balanced against economic development.

The ICAO and IMO have adopted 2050 net-zero carbon emissions goals.

For aviation, the key is the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel which can reduce emissions by up to 80 per cent, compared with fossil jet fuel on a life-cycle basis.

Importantly, sustainable aviation fuels can be used with existing aircraft engines and airport infrastructure.

This is not the case for the maritime sector.

While there are various alternative marine fuel options – such as liquefied natural gas, biofuels, methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen – the availability of infrastructure for these fuels varies across shipping routes.

“The maritime community is therefore preparing for a multi-fuel future,” Mr Siow noted.

More than 500 delegates, including transport ministers, senior officials, regulators and industry leaders and experts from more than 80 countries are in Singapore to attend the symposium, which runs until July 18.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/80b777c84f0c5b8bda2da8b6c67ea60b872bc89b06fb867a3eba136e839bc4bf,N,,2025-07-14 00:01:14.108217

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.

“This purported attempt to incentivize ‘clean fuels’ is little more than a giveaway to the conventional biofuels industry,” the organization said in a post on its website.",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2472/2025/07/13053002/y-s-9diw3tvlfnw-unsplash-1024x819.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 23:01:32.905562

A new high of 72 M&A transactions and 55 partnerships were executed in 2024, representing the third consecutive year of record activity involving Japanese companies.
Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) into Australia reached yet another record high of $141.1 billion representing 11.95% of all FDI into Australia.

“Japanese companies have been very cautious about investing in greenfield projects or in companies without cash flow.","Australia’s attractiveness as an investment destination for Japanese companies and government institutions continues to strengthen and grow.

A new high of 72 M&A transactions and 55 partnerships were executed in 2024, representing the third consecutive year of record activity involving Japanese companies.

Amid an increasingly uncertain economic environment with disruptive US tariffs, strategic competition between China and America and geopolitical headwinds, Australia offers a lower-risk and higher-reward market for Japanese companies, which are cash-rich but face a shrinking domestic customer base.

In its Japan-Australia Investment Report 2024, law firm Herbert Smith Freehills notes while the trend was temporarily stalled by the pandemic disruption, Japanese investors continue to show enormous confidence in the economic future of Australia and Japan’s role in its development.

Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) into Australia reached yet another record high of $141.1 billion representing 11.95% of all FDI into Australia. Japan ranked third in terms of cumulative FDI into Australia, and the country remains the only foreign investor to have increased its FDI into Australia in every single year over the past 11 years.

Comparatively, Australia accounted for 8.3% of all Japanese FDI.

Two-way trade between Australia and Japan was in 2024 valued at $113.4 billion, making Japan Australia’s second largest trading partner and second-largest export destination at $80.5 billion.

For many years, there have been increasingly diverse sectors in which Japanese companies invest in Australia. From traditional sectors such as mining, energy, and agriculture, investment has now become well established in sectors including real estate, life insurance, and financial services.

Herbert Smith Freehill reports further diversification in 2024 is building on a trend from recent years shows the growing strength of new market sectors like sustainable aviation fuel, transport and logistics, data centres, pension, and share administration services platforms, food technology, AI, and enterprise IT services.

Japanese strategies: Bolt-on to take off

Takeovers of listed Australian companies by way of a scheme of arrangement are becoming increasingly common for larger transactions, with three occurring in 2024. These include Renesas’ (TYO:6723) $9.1 billion acquisition of Altium; Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Bank’s $1.2 billion acquisition of Link Group; and J-POWER’s $380 million acquisition of Genex Power.

“Under a scheme of arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated by the bidder with the board of the target company and is almost always approved by shareholders, which gives certainty of timing and budget to the Japanese acquirer,” Herbert Smith Freehill says.

Japanese businesses already well-established in Australia such as in beverages (ASAHI Group (TYO:2502) and Kirin (TYO:2503)), paper (Kokusai Pulp & Paper/Spicers Paper11 and Japan Pulp & Paper/Ball & Doggett), technology (Fujitsu, Fujifilm, Fujifilm Business Innovation (formerly Fuji Xerox), Hitachi, NEC and NRI), automotive (Optimus (TYO:9268) and IDOM (TYO:7599)), industrial gases (Nippon Sanso (TYO:4091)) and residential housing (Sumitomo Forestry and Asahi Kasei Homes) are growing market share and margins by acquiring “bolt-on” businesses to provide scale and achieve economies of scale.

There have been close to 200 partnerships between Japanese and Australian companies and institutions since 2019, and 55 in 2024.

The number of partnerships demonstrate the deep connection and mutual trust that exists between partners and they can form the economic foundation of future collaboration and cooperation, and ultimately new investment opportunities.

“Their increasing popularity with Japanese companies over the traditional minority interest in unincorporated joint ventures demonstrates an increasing sophistication amongst Japanese operators, and their understanding of and confidence in the Australian market,” Herbert Smith Freehill reports.

“Clean energy-related partnerships in sustainable aviation fuel, carbon capture and storage and renewable energy have been the most prominent and are likely to continue to grow.

“Science, technology and innovation is another area with trend growth in partnerships and large potential for future investments. There were only some partnerships in sports, defence, agriculture and space with each of these areas likely to see more partnerships in the future.”

Green energy direction unchanged

Divestments of thermal coal, which have risen to prominence in recent years, have slowed as Japan needs to secure energy for its industrial base, as well as coal production being very profitable.

Exports of coal were close to the record volumes of 2022 that were generated by restrictions on the importation of Russian coal and exceeded 2023’s export figures.

Major metallurgical coal acquisitions are back and more are likely in the near future as Japan needs to secure key minerals for its industrial base.

Iron ore continues to be a massive contributor to the economic wealth of Australia and an essential to Japan’s economic future.

Australia supplies 51.6% of Japan’s metallurgical coal and 55.1% of iron ore imports. Mitsui’s (TYO:8031) $8.4 billion acquisition of a 40% interest in the Rhodes Ridge iron ore project announced in early 2025 highlights this.

“Japanese companies have been very cautious about investing in greenfield projects or in companies without cash flow”

According to Herbert Smith Freehills, the direction of the green energy transition is unchanged but timing is being delayed. The commercial and technical challenges Australia needs to overcome in order to become a green hydrogen and green ammonia export superpower have become apparent.

“There are producers and buyers but not yet a ‘market’ that can support the increasing construction and renewables cost and allow for project financing. Unfortunately for Australia, unlike LNG and coal which are in limited supply globally, many countries have sun and wind and less red and green tape,” the firm says.

“Japanese companies have been very cautious about investing in greenfield projects or in companies without cash flow.

“There is a disconnect between the Japanese and Australian Governments’ geopolitical concerns about critical and strategic mineral supply chains and the risk and return for investors.

“Mining project development takes an average of 15 years to move from mineral discovery to commercial production and mineral market prices are volatile. The forces of demand do not align with the supply-side timing.”

Trade missions

The Queensland Government is launching a new Queensland-Japan Trade and Investment Strategy 2025-2028 to deepen ties with one of the state’s significant economic partners, as reported by this news service.

This is backed by a $18 million investment over four years, which is poised to turbocharge Trade and Investment Queensland’s market strategies and deliver real outcomes for exporters, innovators, and investors.

For the year ending May 2025, Japan was Queensland’s second-largest goods export market, with total exports valued at $14.4 billion.

The government’s new strategy addresses expanding international education, research, and innovation partnerships; growing Queensland’s food, agriculture, and agritech exports; boosting the State’s innovation, creative, and tech sectors; and, attracting investment into major infrastructure projects.

Meanwhile, Western Australian Premier Roger Cook last week visited Japan for high-level talks for continuing collaboration on the clean energy transition. The meetings with government and industry stakeholders aims to also reinforce Western Australia’s longstanding relationship with Japan.

The trade mission comes ahead of his visit in September to World Expo 2025 Osaka, where the Western Australian Government joined the Commonwealth Government as a Gold Partner at the Australian Pavillion.

In early October 2025, Western Australia will host the 62nd Australia Japan Business Co-operation Committee (AJBCC) Annual Joint Business Conference with the theme: Navigating New Realities – Turbulence, Transition and Technology, as reported by Mining.com.au.

BOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES, July 13, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a year marked by turbulence and technological upheaval, Boston Brand Research & Media’s Global Brand Frontier Awards 2025 are rewriting the narrative of corporate achievement. With fewer than 2% of brands reviewed earning a place on the winners’ list, this invitation-only recognition has become one of the most selective and influential accolades in international branding and innovation.

The 2025 edition has progressed with remarkable momentum, casting a wide net across sectors as varied as banking, consulting, healthcare, fintech, education, real estate, and emerging tech. What sets this year apart is the unrelenting focus on two imperatives: resilience in a post-pandemic economy and bold, operationalized AI integration. Winners are no longer just market leaders — they are adaptive, intelligent systems of excellence. These are the brands rewriting global business models by embedding AI in core workflows, improving decision-making precision, automating risk, and elevating customer experience at scale.

At the heart of this transformation is a new standard of brand integrity — one that blends data fluency with human values. The Global Brand Frontier Awards are structured not to reward the biggest balance sheets, but the brands building long-term value in smart, ethical, and inclusive ways. The judging panel — comprising data scientists, strategic consultants, branding experts, and economists — evaluates entries with a rigor and transparency that is unmatched in the global awards landscape.

Behind the prestige of these awards lies a multi-dimensional assessment model. The evaluation process combines precision analytics with deep qualitative inquiry. Proprietary scorecards track metrics like revenue growth, ESG compliance, digital maturity, customer experience, and innovation output. But data alone doesn’t dictate the results. Real-time sentiment analysis, stakeholder interviews, and peer evaluations shape a richer view of impact. Statistical models — such as regression analysis, factor analysis, and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) — identify brands that are outperforming expectations in volatile, high-risk environments. These brands are not just surviving — they are thriving by creating adaptive systems, resilient value chains, and predictive models that help anticipate and respond to disruption.

“We’re not just awarding success. We’re benchmarking the future,” said Shivakumar, President & CEO at Boston Brand Research & Media. “The 2025 awards reflect a tectonic shift in what leadership means — resilience, digital fluency, and human-centered AI are no longer add-ons. They’re prerequisites.”

This year’s awards are also more geographically inclusive than ever before. With entries and winners from over 60 countries, the 2025 edition has spotlighted high-performing brands from not just the expected financial capitals but also from rising economies and underserved markets. From Southeast Asia’s fintech disruptors to West Africa’s microfinance innovators, the winners’ map spans five continents and includes regional champions and multinational titans alike.

In banking, DBS Bank was named Asia’s Most Admired Banking Brand for building a frictionless digital ecosystem at scale. Ant Group redefined fintech with AI-powered financial services reaching millions, earning it the Most Innovative FinTech Company title. In Egypt, Banque Misr took home twin honors for Best CSR Bank and Best IT Bank, while Senegal’s CBAO Groupe Attijariwafa Bank was recognized for catalyzing access to finance across Francophone Africa. United Bank for Africa Ghana emerged as a dual winner for sustainability and CSR, setting the bar for ethical finance in West Africa. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America both took home top North American distinctions for customer experience and financial inclusion, respectively.

Consulting powerhouses like Tata Consultancy Services (Asia) and McKinsey & Company (North America) stood out for their strategic foresight and digital agility. Meanwhile, Europe’s Elixirr was dubbed Most Disruptive Consulting Startup, proving that boutique can still mean bold. Accenture, another heavyweight, was recognized for its commitment to sustainable transformation and multi-sector digital enablement.

In the education sector, Duolingo and Coursera led the charge in democratizing learning. Their platforms have not only scaled across borders but also contributed to significant upskilling in underserved communities. The University of Oxford held its ground as a global research benchmark, while institutions like King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia and the University of Sydney showcased new models of interdisciplinary excellence. These are not just educational institutions — they are knowledge engines driving next-generation innovation.

Energy and sustainability categories saw pioneers like Ørsted, Brunei Shell Petroleum, and Saudi Aramco taking home top honors — not just for output, but for shifting paradigms in renewable energy, advanced drilling, and regional empowerment. Ørsted’s long-term investments in offshore wind have made it a global symbol of renewable commitment. Aramco, often associated with scale, has demonstrated surprising agility in green hydrogen and digital infrastructure deployment.

In insurance and InsurTech, AXA, Gulf Insurance Group (GIG) and Bupa Arabia reinforced their reputations with models that blended risk intelligence, AI-enhanced underwriting, and hyper-personalized customer service. State Farm (North America) earned distinction as the Most Customer-Centric Insurance Provider — not just for its massive reach, but for its commitment to using AI and data-driven tools to tailor claims processing, reduce fraud, and enhance the speed of service delivery across its extensive policyholder network.

Technology and cybersecurity were another battleground of brilliance. Canva, Darktrace, and Jumio emerged as the vanguard of scalable creativity, digital identity, and proactive AI defense systems. Their stories read more like Silicon Valley origin myths than corporate case studies. Darktrace, in particular, has been praised for its self-learning neural networks that detect cyber anomalies without human input — a revolutionary leap in enterprise risk management.

In the airline sector, while award winners have not yet been officially announced, this year’s invitees include some of the most prestigious and forward-thinking names in global aviation. Among them are Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, and Etihad Airways — all of whom are currently under active pre-evaluation. These carriers have been selected not only for their operational excellence and premium customer experiences but for their pioneering work in sustainable aviation fuel adoption, AI-enabled maintenance protocols, and next-generation inflight technologies. The aviation segment at the 2025 Global Brand Frontier Awards captures the renewed momentum of an industry embracing digital transformation and climate responsibility while continuing to connect the world.

The awards also celebrated excellence in real estate and infrastructure. Frasers Property (Singapore) was lauded as the Real Estate Sustainability Champion, while Prologis, Inc. (USA) earned top marks for redefining industrial logistics spaces with smart IoT integrations. India’s Godrej Properties and L&T Realty were both recognized for their roles in driving sustainable and community-centered urban planning in one of the world’s most populous nations.

And yet — the awards are far from over.

This final phase is arguably the most critical. Boston Brand Research & Media confirms that evaluations are still underway in some of the most competitive and future-defining categories: Banking, Retail, Technology, Real Estate, and beyond. This isn’t just the conclusion of an awards cycle — it’s the culmination of a global conversation about what excellence truly looks like in 2025 and beyond.

If your organization has received an invitation, this is your moment. The Global Brand Frontier Awards are not a popularity contest — they are a rigorous, research-led, peer-evaluated distinction that marks a brand’s lasting contribution to innovation, customer trust, and sectoral leadership.

This is the final opportunity to step forward and be evaluated alongside the world’s most adaptive and high-performing organizations. The nomination process is clear, guided, and designed to bring out the best of your impact story. If your company has been shortlisted or directly invited and is waiting on final internal approvals, now is the time to act!

For any single project receiving over £30 million, approval from the House of Commons is required. The recent practice is for the Government to table a motion outlining the proposed financial assistance, and for the House to treat the motion as a Statutory Instrument. In this case, the Government is seeking approval to provide up to £1 billion in grants by 2030, to support zero-emission vehicle manufacturers and the automotive supply chain.

LROs are a rare type of Statutory Instrument used to remove or reduce regulatory burdens, or change the way in which regulatory functions are carried out. They are subject to an enhanced parliamentary procedure – the super-affirmative procedure – which is the most rigorous level of scrutiny currently applied to delegated legislation. When Ministers lay a draft LRO before Parliament, they must also lay an explanatory statement setting out which level of parliamentary scrutiny they believe should apply. A select committee in each House then has 30 days to consider the instrument and if appropriate recommend that it be upgraded to a higher scrutiny procedure. There are three levels of scrutiny procedure available, ranked from lowest to highest: (i) the negative procedure – the LRO becomes law automatically when the Minister makes (signs) it, unless either House objects within 40 days; (ii) the affirmative procedure – the LRO requires the approval of both Houses before it can become law; or (iii) the super-affirmative procedure – both Houses have 60 days to consider the draft proposal and recommend changes, after which the Minister must decide whether to make the changes and the LRO must be approved under the affirmative procedure.

The F-22 Raptor ban on exports helped the United States safeguard its most advanced technology.
Meanwhile, both the United States' F-22 Raptor and China's J-20 Mighty Dragon have been banned by those countries for export.","The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is regarded as the world's first fifth-generation fighter jet and was built to take command of the skies as the world's air-dominance fighter jet. It was designed to overmatch and replace the F-15 Eagle family, although the Air Force continues to rely on that older fighter. However, the F-22 fighter jet was never sold to export customers.

In the end, the program was canceled due to its immense cost and lack of a perceived need. Exports would have helped sustain the program and made it more affordable, much like how exports help sustain the now-successful F-35 program. However, it is unclear how many countries would have had the requirement and a sufficiently deep budget to acquire the Raptor.

Pinnacle Of American Engineering

The F-22 Raptor entered service in 2005. Soon reports emerged of it acing exercises, emerging victorious again and again against both other US fighter jets and allied fighter jets like the Eurofighter Typhoon. The rare occasion that an F-22 is defeated in air-to-air exercises tends to turn heads, being the exception that proves the rule. One example is when a German Eurofighter reportedly took out a Raptor with guns during an exercise.

When the Raptor entered service, it combined the bleeding edge of advanced technology, including stealth and sensor fusion. This combines to produce superb situational awareness. Adding to that, the Raptor's airframe is highly maneuverable and has the ability to supercruise or fly at supersonic speeds without the need for afterburners. While the Cobra Maneuver may have little to no real-life tactical value, the Raptor is one of the few US fighter jets able to pull it off.

The F-22 is able to carry a lethal suite of missiles for use in both with-visual-range and beyond-visual-range engagements. The aircraft is also able to carry two 1,000-lb GBU-32 JDAMs or eight 250-lb Small Diameter Bombs for close air support or precision strike missions. While it is best in its air-to-air role, it is able to carry out air-to-ground missions. In the unlikely event that an old-fashioned dogfight were to take place, it comes with 480 rounds for its M61A2 20-millimeter cannon.

US Ban On Exports

According to Sandboxx News, Israel, Japan, and Australia repeatedly asked the United States for permission to purchase the Raptor. However, in 1998, Congress explicitly coded into law that the Raptor was not for sale. The F-22 was only designed for the United States. This is in contrast to the F-35, which was built by the United States in cooperation with other nations that participated in the program. Notably, the United Kingdom contributes around 15% to every F-35 produced.

The Raptor is packed with classified technology that the United States wants to remain the sole proprietor of. Once an aircraft is sold, even to a trusted ally like Australia or Japan, then the US has less control over it. The risk is that technology will fall into the wrong hands or enemy nations will learn to exploit any weaknesses. The best way to keep a secret is always to not share it with anyone else.

It is not uncommon for countries to limit the export of their top-tier military equipment. Currently, there is debate over whether the US will be willing to export its new high-end combat aircraft like the B-21 Raider and F-47. It is common for countries to downgrade the capabilities of high-end equipment somewhat in the export market. President Trump recently stated the US would export the F-47 to allies, adding (seemingly arbitrarily) that it could be downgraded by 10% for export.

Trade-offs Of The Export Ban

Initially, the Pentagon had intended to purchase 750 F-22 Raptors. After the Cold War ended and the United States became more focused on counterinsurgency operations, the procurement of the jet was progressively scaled back until finally, only 187 examples were purchased. The Raptor is regarded as the best in the world in its intended role - air dominance. However, it is ill-suited for various other missions. The F-35, by contrast, is designed as a multi-role fighter.

Of the 187 Raptors produced, at least five have been lost to accidents over the years, meaning there are at most 183 usable airframes in Air Force inventory. Of these, 32 are Block 20 training variants that can't be used for combat. According to reporting by Sandboxx News, only around 130 Raptors were ever operational. The actual number of currently operational Raptors is classified, but the publication suggests fewer than 100 Raptors are likely combat-ready at any given time.

The export ban has had major implications for the US Raptor fleet. Not only was the per-unit cost higher due to a lack of economies of scale, but it also meant its production line was shuttered by Lockheed Martin after the Pentagon stopped ordering the jet. Today, that former F-22 production line is supporting the F-35 program. With production shuttered, there is a lack of spare parts, making it more and more difficult for the Air Force to keep its modest fleet of Raptors in the air.

Onto The F-35

By the time Washington may have been open to exporting the F-22, it was already too late. Countries were already moving on, looking to purchase the more versatile F-35 Lightning II. Few countries have the ability to sustain multiple types of high-end fighter jets, much less a dedicated air-superiority fighter like the F-22. The F-35 is a better fit for countries looking for aircraft able to fill multiple roles.

Today, the United States benefits from many countries around the world ordering the F-35. Even if the US were to slash its orders for the jet, these exports would keep the production line humming and ensure the US Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy will have access to a steady stream of new spare parts and components.

While Israel, Australia, and Japan may have liked to have the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 Lightning II also excels in the air superiority role. The capabilities of the F-35 to kick in the door, punch holes in an air defense system, and secure air superiority were recently on full display by Israel over Iran. Iran had been equipped with advanced Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile air defense systems.

Different Levels Of Export Restrictions

All US fighter jets face varying levels of export restrictions, which tend to be relaxed as the jets age and their technologies become less sensitive. There was a time when the US prohibited all Latin American countries from purchasing its F-16 Fighting Falcon. Although this didn't last, it soon sold the jet to Venezuela and Chile. Today, the US is willing to sell the F-16 to almost any ally or partner nation.

The US was more restrictive with F-15 exports. During the Carter Administration, the US refused to sell the F-15 to any non-NATO nation or outside a select group of allies like Japan, Israel, and Australia. The F-15 is the larger, more expensive, and more capable counterpart to the smaller F-16. In the end, only Japan and some Middle Eastern countries purchased the F-15. In Europe, countries chose to invest in their own programs like the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale.

The F-35 is widely exported to US allies, although the US is very restrictive about whom it sells the aircraft. The US has refused sales to Turkey, Egypt, the UAE, Thailand, Taiwan, Qatar, and other nations, often after agreements to sell the jet were made. That said, the current Trump Administration is willing to sell it to more countries. The US often imposes ""onerous"" conditions on countries purchasing the jet. For example, Israeli pilots with dual passports are banned from flying it.

5th Gen Fighters: To Export Or Not To Export?

The F-22 Raptor ban on exports helped the United States safeguard its most advanced technology. At the same time, the ban aided in dooming the project as there was just less money and orders to sustain it. The decision to ban exports was a calculated trade-off.

While the United States sells its other fighters, it remains selective about which countries it sells them to. The US may be relaxed about the now-aging F-16, but it is highly protective of its F-35s. It does not tolerate other countries modifying the aircraft or its software. The US does not allow export countries to operate the F-35 around advanced Russian and Chinese systems that could gather information on it, including Russian-made S-400 SAMs and Chinese-made Huawei 5G networks.

Among fifth-generation fighters, the F-35 and Russia's Su-57 were designed with the intention of export. Russia's Su-57 has only found a single buyer, Algeria, while the list of countries ordering the F-35 continues to grow. Meanwhile, both the United States' F-22 Raptor and China's J-20 Mighty Dragon have been banned by those countries for export. There is speculation that China will export its new J-35 fighter, possibly as an alternative to countries unable to purchase the US F-35.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-the-f-22-is-banned-from-being-sold-to-other-countries.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 13:03:06.152813

By combining Sunoco's U.S. retail and wholesale networks with Parkland's Canadian and Caribbean infrastructure, the deal promises to create a vertically integrated powerhouse. For investors, the transaction's 25% premium, $250 million in synergies, and immediate distributable cash flow (DCF) accretion highlight compelling upside. Yet risks like regulatory hurdles and integration complexity loom large. Here's why this deal is a high-reward, high-stakes opportunity.

The 25% Premium: A Bold Move or Fair Value?

The premium—calculated against a 7-day VWAP—reflects Sunoco's confidence in Parkland's asset base, including its 200,000-barrel/day Burnaby refinery and Caribbean terminals. While critics may argue the premium overpays for Parkland's Canadian operations, the structure offers flexibility: shareholders can elect cash (C$44/share) or SUNCorp units (0.536 per share), mitigating perceived overvaluation risks.

This flexibility, coupled with the SUNCorp unit's dividend-equivalent structure (matching Sunoco's distributions for two years post-closing), should stabilize investor sentiment. The dividend mechanism also aligns with Sunoco's history of robust payouts, a critical hook for income-seeking investors.

Synergies and DCF Accretion: The Financial Engine

The $250 million in annual synergies—realized by Year 3—will stem from operational efficiencies:

- Cost Reduction: Consolidating back-office functions and optimizing logistics across 300+ retail sites in Canada and the U.S.

- Margin Expansion: Leveraging Parkland's low-carbon fuel expertise to command premium pricing in regulated markets like California.

- Capital Allocation: Redirecting free cash flow toward high-return projects, such as Parkland's proposed $1 billion expansion of the Burnaby refinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

The immediate 10%+ DCF per unit accretion is a game-changer. Sunoco's leverage ratio, which had ballooned to 6x pre-deal, is expected to normalize to 4x within 18 months—a critical step toward restoring credit ratings and lowering borrowing costs.

Geographic Diversification: A Hedge Against Regional Volatility

Sunoco's U.S.-centric model has historically exposed it to regional fuel demand swings. Parkland's Canadian operations, including 1,500 retail sites and 40% of the country's propane distribution, diversify revenue streams. Equally vital is Parkland's Caribbean terminal network, which provides access to high-margin international trade routes.

This diversification isn't just about geography—it's about resilience. In a world where climate policies and energy transitions are reshaping demand, SUNCorp's dual focus on conventional fuels and low-carbon innovation (via Burnaby) positions it to thrive across regulatory regimes.

Risks: Regulatory Hurdles and Integration Headwinds

The deal's success hinges on navigating two major barriers:

1. Regulatory Approvals: The Investment Canada Act review could delay closing beyond late 2025, especially if Canadian authorities demand concessions on jobs or the Burnaby refinery's emissions.

2. Cultural Integration: Merging Sunoco's U.S. corporate culture with Parkland's Canadian management—while retaining Calgary's HQ—will test leadership. Missteps here could erode synergies and employee morale.

Investors should monitor the June 24 shareholder vote closely. A failure to secure the 66⅔% majority would force a messy takeover bid, potentially triggering break fees and legal battles.

Investment Takeaway: A Buy with a Buffer

The SUNCorp structure offers a compelling entry point for investors willing to accept short-term volatility. Key catalysts include:

- Synergy Realization: Track the first $100 million in synergies by Year 1.

- Dividend Stability: Ensure Sunoco maintains its distribution rate as leverage improves.

- Regulatory Clearance: A positive Investment Canada ruling by Q4 2025 would remove a major overhang.

Risk-Adjusted Positioning:

- Bull Case (20% Upside): Synergies exceed $250M, leverage drops to 3.5x, and SUNCorp's stock trades at 12x EV/EBITDA.

- Bear Case (15% Drawdown): Delays in integration, regulatory fines, or a drop in U.S. fuel demand stifle DCF growth.

Recommendation:

Investors with a 2–3 year horizon should accumulate SUNCorp units at current prices, with a 10% buffer for regulatory risk. Pair this with a put option on SUN LP to hedge downside exposure. For income investors, the dividend-equivalent structure makes this a must-watch play in the energy midstream sector.

The acquisition is far from a sure bet, but in an era where scale and diversification define survival, SUNCorp's vision could ignite a renaissance in North American fuel distribution—if execution matches ambition.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:03:08.880296

Over the last 25 years, aviation has laid the groundwork for its sustainable transition, marked by increasing collaboration between governments and the industry.","The SAF bottleneck

It is a chicken-and-egg problem. While there may be demand for SAF from airlines, supply is limited and prices are projected to remain two to three times higher than jet fuel until 2030. However, it will be hard to boost production and reduce production costs without reaching greater scale.

SAF producers need to be confident that demand will continue to grow and need long-term offtake agreements to obtain the necessary funding to build production facilities from financiers.

According to Paul Griffiths, chief executive officer of Dubai Airports, “The global jet fuel market is worth around $254 billion per year, with SAF representing just 0.7% of total fuel production.”

If SAF production doubles every two years, he says, it would still take over seven and a half years for 10% of total jet fuel to come from sustainable sources.

“It’s a very big problem. It needs a big solution, and it needs huge investment,” says Griffiths.

“Industry and governments have got to work together to create a level playing field of investment that doesn’t incentivize poor behaviour.” He notes that one solution would be a levy on aviation fuel or ticket prices, such as the scheme recently applied in Singapore, where just under $2 per passenger is channelled towards SAF production.

Although it would result in “justifiable” costs being passed on to the consumer, he says “We could actually solve the problem if that was applied on a global basis.” Recently, the UK government also proposed a levy on fossil jet fuel to fund local SAF production.

High-stakes need for policy alignment

The introduction of new measures and regulations to support SAF by an increasing number of countries strengthens the importance of international standards and policy consistency.

To encourage investment and consistent SAF adoption worldwide, SAF policies benefit from international alignment and any subsidies to incentivise their production must provide long-term clarity to investors. If countries don’t act in unison in these areas, policy effectiveness will suffer.

Ayesha Choudhury, chief commercial officer at Infinium – a market leader in ultra-low carbon synthetic efuels – says “policy certainty” is key: “predictable revenue… that’s enabled by policy certainty… is really important for off-takers to be able to commit to the long- term agreements that are necessary to get the plants built.”

A great risk is that geopolitical headwinds can slow down aviation decarbonization efforts. Increasing protectionism and tariffs are sparking particular concern among aviation executives.

Geopolitical tensions are destabilizing exports of feedstock, the raw material for SAF, as well as fuelling domestic energy security concerns. With supply chains under stress, feedstock prices are rising, further squeezing the margins of active SAF plants and affecting their production outlooks.

In addition to political risks, magnified by last year’s “super elections” that threaten to shift government priorities and lead to policy reversals, there are also economic ones.

Despite lower inflation and strong growth in the aviation sector, with revenues exceeding $1 trillion for the first time this year, the global economic outlook remains a concern for aviation executives, particularly in emerging markets.

Net zero is within reach

Route closures, rising labour costs, supply chain bottlenecks and regulatory uncertainty are impacting profitability and could divert the sector’s focus from the net-zero agenda.

This is a critical moment for the aviation industry. Updated state action plans for decarbonization are due to be submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organisation by September, as stakeholders try to walk the fine line between accelerating decarbonization and boosting the sector’s growth in the wake of COVID-19.

Actions taken now will determine the viability of internationally agreed targets, such as reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5% by 2030.

Achieving net-zero aviation by 2050 is well within our collective grasp. SAF will undoubtedly play a key role in this journey, especially in the short to medium term. But it will not, by itself, be enough.

As other technologies become increasingly available, swift and concerted action – from governments and regulators to airports, airlines and businesses along the wider value chain – will be critical.

Over the last 25 years, aviation has laid the groundwork for its sustainable transition, marked by increasing collaboration between governments and the industry. This must continue to help aviation reach net zero by 2050.

SAF, czyli Sustainable Aviation Fuel, to paliwo, które w przeciwieństwie do tradycyjnej ropy naftowej, powstaje z surowców odnawialnych lub odpadowych. Mogą to być np. oleje posmażalnicze, odpady rolnicze, komunalne, a nawet resztki z przemysłu drzewnego.

Brzmi jak coś, co normalnie trafia na wysypisko? Zgadza się. Ale nowoczesne technologie pozwalają zamienić te niepozorne surowce w pełnoprawne paliwo lotnicze, które może być używane w takich samych silnikach, jakie dziś napędzają Boeingi czy Airbusy.

SAF to konkretna odpowiedź na potrzeby współczesnego świata, paliwo, które redukuje emisje CO2 nawet o 80 proc. w całym cyklu życia, czyli od momentu produkcji, przez transport, aż po spalenie w silniku samolotu. To właśnie dlatego Unia Europejska tak mocno naciska na jego wdrożenie.

SAF nie wymaga przebudowy samolotów. To mieszanka odnawialnego komponentu z klasycznym paliwem typu JET-A1. Dzięki temu linie lotnicze mogą z dnia na dzień zmniejszyć emisję swoich operacji, bez kosztownych inwestycji w nowe technologie.

A korzyści są konkretne i globalne. Lotnictwo odpowiada za około 3 - 4 proc. światowej emisji gazów cieplarnianych. Wydaje się niewiele? Może. Ale problem w tym, że emisje z tego sektora bardzo trudno ograniczyć, bo trudno przecież zasilić samolot z gniazdka, jak samochód elektryczny.

Dlatego SAF to dziś jeden z niewielu realnych sposobów na dekarbonizację lotnictwa.

Nowe paliwo dostępne jest już na trzech polskich lotniskach: w Warszawie (Lotnisko Chopina), Krakowie (Balice) oraz Katowicach (Pyrzowice). Dlaczego akurat tam? To właśnie te porty przekraczają wymagane przez Unię Europejską progi obsługiwanych pasażerów i cargo odpowiednio 800 tys. pasażerów i 100 tys. ton towarów rocznie.

Rozporządzenie ReFuelEU Aviation, które weszło w życie w 2025 r., zobowiązuje duże lotniska i operatorów paliw do wprowadzania SAF do swojej oferty. Na start minimum to 2 proc. całkowitej sprzedaży paliwa.

Ale to dopiero początek. Do 2030 r. udział SAF ma wzrosnąć do 6 proc., w 2035 r. do 20 proc., a w 2050 r. aż do 70 proc. Ambitnie? Owszem. Ale niezbędnie, jeśli chcemy zatrzymać zmiany klimatyczne.

Więcej o paliwach lotniczych na Spider's Web:

Aktualnie komponent SAF wykorzystywany przez Orlen pochodzi z zagranicy. Ale to rozwiązanie tymczasowe. Koncern buduje właśnie w Płocku nowoczesną instalację HVO (uwodornienia olejów roślinnych), która pozwoli na lokalną produkcję paliwa lotniczego z używanych olejów spożywczych, dokładnie takich, jakie wylewamy po smażeniu frytek.

To nie tylko ekologiczne, ale i gospodarczo uzasadnione: mniejsze uzależnienie od importu, większa kontrola nad jakością i kosztami.

Orlen nie poprzestaje na biopaliwach. W ramach europejskiego projektu HySPARK koncern planuje budowę stacji tankowania wodoru przy warszawskim Lotnisku Chopina. Wodorowe pojazdy będą wykorzystywane przez naziemną obsługę lotniska.

Mowa m.in. o ciągnikach bagażowych, autobusach i pojazdach technicznych. To kolejny krok w kierunku pełnej dekarbonizacji transportu lotniczego nie tylko w powietrzu, ale i na ziemi.

Choć SAF to nie lekarstwo na wszystkie bolączki klimatyczne, to ważny i konkretny krok naprzód. I choć dziś mowa tylko o trzech lotniskach i kilku procentach udziału w rynku paliw, za kilka lat ta technologia może być standardem, a nie wyjątkiem.

I właśnie takie zmiany chcemy widzieć częściej.",https://cdn-sw.spidersweb.pl/2025/07/orlen-paliwo-lotnicze.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 11:13:19.671624

The Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), a major addition to India’s aviation infrastructure, is all set to launch its first commercial passenger flight in just two months—a milestone expected to reshape the region’s connectivity and play a key role in supporting India’s growing aviation demands. Maharashtra’s Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis confirmed that the inaugural flight from NMIA is scheduled for September 30, 2025, marking a crucial step in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region’s ambition to become a global aviation hub, complementing the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM).

Aviation Expansion in Mumbai Metropolitan Region

The Navi Mumbai International Airport represents a significant milestone in the region’s aviation infrastructure expansion. Situated in Navi Mumbai, the airport aims to relieve pressure from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, which currently handles the majority of Mumbai’s air traffic. The launch of NMIA will introduce a second major airport to serve the region, providing passengers with more flight options and relieving congestion at BOM.

With 94% of the construction work completed, the airport is on track for a September debut, with the final interior and facade works nearing completion. NMIA is expected to become one of the most technologically advanced airports in India, focusing on high-speed operations, sustainability, and smart passenger services.

Navi Mumbai International Airport: A Modern Airport for the Future

The Navi Mumbai International Airport is being built with the latest technologies, making it one of the most advanced airports in India. Its standout feature will be a high-efficiency baggage handling system, which incorporates 360-degree barcode scanners to speed up baggage claim processes, with the goal of becoming the fastest baggage claim system in the world. This technology will enhance accuracy and speed, significantly reducing wait times for passengers.

NMIA’s design includes two parallel runways, designed to handle 90 million passengers annually, a massive expansion compared to Mumbai’s current airport capacity. The airport’s terminal building is almost complete, with only final interior finishes and façade work left. Over 13,000 workers have been employed to meet the September deadline, with additional labor being brought in to ensure the remaining tasks are completed on time.

Sustainability at the Core of NMIA

The development of NMIA is being carried out with a strong commitment to sustainability. The airport will be a green airport, generating 37 MW of its own renewable energy, ensuring that its operations are environmentally responsible. The goal is for the airport to be powered using electric vehicles and alternative fuels. Furthermore, the airport will serve as a major hub for sustainable aviation fuel, contributing to the aviation industry’s efforts to reduce its environmental impact.

The airport is built on 1,160 hectares of land, with significant pre-development work, including river diversions and land preparation, managed by CIDCO (City and Industrial Development Corporation). Financial closure for the project was achieved in March 2022, with ₹12,770 crore funded by the State Bank of India, out of a total project cost of ₹19,647 crore.

Connectivity: A Key Priority for NMIA

Connectivity is one of the most critical factors in ensuring the success of NMIA. To ensure that passengers have seamless access to the airport, infrastructure projects are being fast-tracked. Atal Setu, which connects the airport to the Coastal Road, and the proposed elevated expressway from Thane, will provide swift connectivity. Four-directional access via suburban rail, metro lines, highways, and water transport will make NMIA highly accessible to passengers from all corners of the region.

One of the most innovative features of NMIA will be its remote baggage check-in system, which allows passengers to check in their bags at multiple remote locations before they even reach the airport. This system will ensure that passengers can enjoy a hassle-free, baggage-free journey to the airport. Moreover, NMIA will introduce an underground terminal train system in its second phase, allowing passengers to move between terminals quickly and without the use of vehicles.

Final Preparations and Inauguration

The Maharashtra government has already submitted a naming proposal for the new airport to the Central Government. The final name of the airport is expected to be confirmed before its official inauguration. Chief Minister Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde are set to meet with the Prime Minister’s Office to finalize the name before the airport opens to the public.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who performed the foundation ceremony for the airport, is expected to inaugurate the NMIA, underscoring the project’s national significance and the government’s commitment to improving India’s aviation infrastructure.

A Boon for India’s Tourism and Economy

The opening of NMIA is expected to have a significant impact on India’s tourism and economy. The airport will serve as a critical hub for both domestic and international flights, easing the pressure on Mumbai’s existing airport and boosting connectivity across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. As India continues to expand its tourism sector, NMIA will be a crucial player in accommodating the influx of international visitors.

Moreover, the new airport will open up economic opportunities by creating thousands of jobs, improving infrastructure, and supporting aviation-related industries. NMIA is also expected to drive growth in the hospitality, retail, and transportation sectors, supporting the economic development of Maharashtra and India as a whole.

The Future of Navi Mumbai International Airport

Looking to the future, NMIA is designed to grow in stages, with the second phase set to introduce even more advanced technologies and facilities. The final configuration will include two parallel runways and the ability to handle over 90 million passengers annually, making it one of the largest and most sophisticated airports in India. The addition of the second runway will allow NMIA to handle more international flights, including connections to Europe, North America, and East Asia.

With its focus on sustainability, advanced technologies, and seamless connectivity, NMIA will play a crucial role in supporting India’s growing aviation demands, making Mumbai one of the top aviation hubs in Asia.

Challenges and Final Push

While NMIA is slated to open on September 30, 2025, the final phase of construction is still underway. The challenge now lies in ensuring that the remaining work—particularly in areas such as security procedures, passenger flow, and operational testing—is completed smoothly and on time. Authorities are actively conducting final inspections to ensure that everything is in place for a safe and smooth launch.

As the airport prepares for its first passenger flight, India’s aviation industry eagerly anticipates the opening of NMIA. The arrival of this new airport marks a major step forward in improving aviation infrastructure, supporting the tourism sector, and contributing to the country’s economic growth.

Inisiatif ini berlanjut pada 9 Juli 2025 dengan penanaman 2.000 pohon tambahan untuk membuka tahun kedua. Kegiatan ini melibatkan 83 peserta dari berbagai unsur, termasuk dinas pemerintah, aparat desa, masyarakat, serta beberapa supplier Apical Group, seperti PT Bima Palma, PT Anugrah Energitama, dan PT Kutai Balian Nauli.

“Kami tidak hanya berhasil memenuhi target tahun pertama, tetapi justru melampauinya. Dari penanaman 30.000 pohon hingga pelatihan ratusan petani kelapa sawit, ini mencerminkan besarnya komitmen dan partisipasi masyarakat dalam mewujudkan desa yang berkelanjutan.” ujar CSR Manager Apical Group Agus Wiastono.

“Capaian ini menjadi fondasi kuat bagi langkah kami ke depan untuk menciptakan dampak yang lebih luas dan berkelanjutan di tahun-tahun berikutnya” tambahnya.

Selain aksi lingkungan, program ini juga memberikan perhatian besar pada peningkatan kapasitas petani kelapa sawit. Sepanjang tahun pertama, sebanyak 459 petani swadaya telah mengikuti pelatihan Best Management Practices (BMP), jauh melampaui target awal sebanyak 150 petani.

Tahun kedua dimulai dengan pelatihan lanjutan di Desa Tepian Indah pada 8 Juli, di mana 26 petani mempelajari teknik memilih bibit unggul dan metode pembibitan sawit yang tepat bersama mitra utama Earthworm Foundation.

Kemajuan juga terlihat dalam aspek legalitas. SLV turut mendampingi petani untuk memperoleh Surat Tanda Daftar Budidaya (STDB) sebagai pengakuan formal atas usaha mereka. Hingga kini, sebanyak 88 STDB telah diserahkan dari target 500 selama tiga tahun pelaksanaan. STDB ini penting untuk memberikan akses pembiayaan dan mendukung proses sertifikasi keberlanjutan seperti Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) dan Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).

Mendukung keberlanjutan ekonomi, program SLV juga mengembangkan alternatif mata pencaharian. Salah satu dari dua demonstration plot (demplot) kakao telah selesai dibangun dan mulai difungsikan sebagai lahan percontohan budidaya kakao yang baik.

Secara keseluruhan, seluruh rangkaian kegiatan dalam program SLV menunjukkan bahwa keberlanjutan tidak hanya berbicara tentang pelestarian lingkungan, tetapi juga menyentuh langsung kesejahteraan sosial dan ekonomi masyarakat.

Program SLV di Kutai Timur menjadi perwujudan nyata dari filosofi 5C Apical Group—Community, Country, Climate, Customer, dan Company—yang mendorong sinergi antara perusahaan, pemerintah, dan masyarakat dalam membangun desa yang tangguh serta masa depan yang lebih hijau dan berkelanjutan.

Menggoreng tentu tidak terlepas dari penggunaan minyak goreng, dimana selalu digunakan untuk menggoreng dan biasanya minyak yang digunakan untuk menggoreng ikan itu tidak akan digunakan lagi.

Minyak goreng biasanya setelah digunakan menggoreng ikan, ataupun daging maka tidak akan lagi digunakan karena warna gosong kehitaman akan merusak warna, sehingga biasanya minyak goreng bekas pakai, atau jelantah itu biasanya dibuang.

Setiap kali kita menyalakan wajan untuk menggoreng, kita tak hanya memasak makanan, kita sedang menciptakan peluang energi bersih yang selama ini terbuang sia-sia. Padahal, jika dikelola dengan benar, jelantah dapat menjadi fondasi bagi upaya Indonesia membangun industri bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan, yaitu Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang kini menjadi kebutuhan global.

Riset Traction Energy Asia memperkirakan, rumah tangga Indonesia membuang sedikitnya 1,2 juta kiloliter minyak goreng bekas setiap tahun. Jumlah ini belum termasuk dari sektor komersial seperti restoran, industri makanan, serta hotel, yang jika ditotal dapat mendorong volume realistis hingga sekitar 3 juta kiloliter per tahun.

Angka tersebut kini berpotensi meningkat seiring peluncuran program Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG) yang digagas pemerintah, melibatkan sekitar 32.000 dapur umum untuk menyajikan makanan setiap hari kepada lebih dari 82 juta siswa. Jika satu dapur umum menggunakan rata-rata 800 liter minyak per bulan, maka program MBG sendiri dapat menambah sekitar 300 ribu kiloliter jelantah setiap tahun.

Dengan demikian, potensi minyak goreng bekas yang dapat dikumpulkan secara nasional dapat mencapai 4,5 juta kiloliter per tahun. Angka ini tidak lagi dapat diabaikan, khususnya dalam konteks pencarian sumber energi rendah karbon yang tidak berbasis lahan baru.

Teknologi pengolahan jelantah menjadi SAF, seperti proses hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), telah terbukti mampu mengonversi satu liter jelantah menjadi sekitar 0,8 liter bahan bakar jet rendah emisi. Artinya, hanya dengan memanfaatkan separuh dari total jelantah nasional, Indonesia dapat menghasilkan hingga 1,8 juta kiloliter SAF per tahun. Perlu dicatat juga bahwa lebih dari separuh kebutuhan avtur domestik tahun 2023 yang tercatat sebesar 3,5 juta kiloliter.",https://assets.pikiran-rakyat.com/crop/0x0:0x0/1200x675/photo/2025/07/13/488398041.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 13:03:23.156367

He confirmed that the first commercial flight is expected to depart from the airport by September 30. The inauguration will be led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had earlier laid the foundation stone for the project. CM Fadnavis emphasized that NMIA will be the most advanced and well-equipped airport in the country, with instructions given to ensure the baggage handling system is the fastest globally, matching international standards.

Construction Progress of Navi Mumbai International Airport

According to Chief Minister Fadnavis, nearly 94% of the airport construction is complete. The runway is ready for operation, and most of the terminal building construction is done, with interior finishing work currently in progress. Only the external ceiling and façade work are pending and are being expedited. Other supporting infrastructure activities are moving ahead at full speed to meet the September deadline. The CM highlighted that all involved agencies are working in coordination to ensure the airport is ready for operations and inauguration without delay.

World-Class Baggage Handling System in the Works

Fadnavis stated that the airport will feature an advanced baggage-handling system using 360-degree barcode scanners to ensure accurate and quick sorting. He said efforts are being made to create the world’s fastest baggage claim system. Once both runways are functional, the airport will be capable of handling up to 90 million passengers annually. The airport will surpass the current Mumbai airport in size and functionality. By 2032, it is expected to handle up to 2.5 million tonnes of cargo. The domestic cargo terminal will cover 360,000 sq ft, while the international one will span 255,000 sq ft.

Infrastructure, Terminals, and Capacity Highlights

CM Fadnavis mentioned that more than 13,000 workers are currently on site, and more manpower will be deployed to meet the ambitious September deadline. All commercial licensing work is progressing simultaneously to ensure that operations can begin immediately after inauguration. The airport will have two runways and four terminal buildings, capable of parking 350 aircraft at once. Despite having multiple terminals, passengers will be able to access their flights easily from any terminal. The internal design ensures smooth and efficient passenger movement across the facility.

Project Timeline and Development Background

Located in Ulwe within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, planning for the Navi Mumbai airport began in 1990 and gained momentum in the 2000s. The foundation stone was laid by PM Modi in February 2018. The project is spread over 1,160 hectares. CIDCO (City and Industrial Development Corporation) handled pre-development work, including river redirection, power line relocation, and land preparation. The airport is being developed by NMIAL (Navi Mumbai International Airport Limited), a joint venture between Adani Airport Holdings Ltd (74%) and CIDCO (26%).

Funding and Eco-Friendly Airport Design

The financial closure of the project occurred in March 2022, with the State Bank of India sanctioning Rs 12,770 crore out of the total project cost of Rs 19,647 crore. The airport features a distinctive lotus-inspired architectural design, paying tribute to India’s national flower. It is being built as a green airport, with 37 MW of renewable energy integrated into its functioning. Only electric or alternative-fuel vehicles will be used within the premises. There are plans to scale up the use of sustainable aviation fuel, making the airport a significant hub for eco-friendly air travel.

New-Age Baggage and Passenger Experience

Fadnavis stated that plans are underway to introduce city-based baggage check-in facilities so that travelers can arrive at the airport baggage-free. This initiative will significantly enhance the overall passenger experience. A massive 1,630,000 sq ft fuel farm and three aircraft hangars will also be part of the airport infrastructure. These advanced features reflect the airport’s goal of becoming a future-ready aviation hub. The CM assured that every element of the airport is being designed to set a benchmark in both efficiency and passenger convenience.

Seamless Multimodal Connectivity

The airport will be just 10 minutes from Panvel and easily accessible via roadways, metro lines, and suburban railway systems. It will be linked to Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1 and Mumbai’s Metro Line 8 (Gold Line). It will also serve as the starting point for the proposed Mumbai-Hyderabad high-speed rail line. Connectivity will further be strengthened by the Sewri-Nhava Sheva Trans-Harbor Link (MTHL), and the Coastal Road connection via Atal Setu is expected to finish by March next year. A direct elevated road from Thane is also under consideration.

Advanced In-Airport Transportation Plans

In the second phase of development, a metro-style train will operate within the airport premises, connecting all four terminals. This will eliminate the need for passengers to walk long distances or deal with vehicle congestion. The internal system will include travelators and will be designed to ensure no terminal is more than 500 meters from any gate. Fadnavis stated that the planning is already in motion for these features. Additionally, the airport will be linked to India’s upcoming bullet train network and the city’s expanding metro rail infrastructure.

The knowledge paper was released today at the 4th ACFI Annual Conclave in New Delhi. With India’s air cargo volumes projected to triple to 10 million metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) by 2030, the paper highlights the sectors rapid evolution, driven by the e-commerce boom, policy momentum, greenfield infrastructure and rising demand for high-value cargo, such as pharmaceuticals and perishables.

As part of the strategic roadmap for the air cargo industry, ACFI is proud to announce landmark partnership with The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) that will significantly bolster both regional connectivity and global knowledge sharing. Also, soon ACFI will be signing MoU’s with Government of Tripura and Government of Madhya Pradesh.

Speaking at the launch, Mr. Sanjiv Edward, President, ACFI, said, “The Indian air cargo sector is at a pivotal inflection point and undergoing rapid transformation. At this crucial juncture, this knowledge paper outlines the strategic roadmap until 2030, infrastructure requirements, policy reforms, and the initiatives by the air cargo industry to achieve the ambitious target of 10 MTPA of air cargo volumes set by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India. This paper has laid down a clear action plan for all stakeholders of the industry. India is uniquely positioned to redefine global cargo corridors. With bold policy reforms and strategic investments, we can build a resilient, digitised, and world-class logistics ecosystem.”

Shri. Piyush Srivastava, Sr. Economic Advisor, Ministry Of Civil Aviation said, “Air infrastructure today faces key global dichotomies-demand is rapidly growing in the Eastern Hemisphere, while critical services like manufacturing and MRO remain concentrated in the West. This imbalance is bound to shift. As demand grows, supply will follow. Its not just about Made in India; its about Make in India-a strategic priority for us moving forward.”

He further added, “The Aviation sector is highly sensitive to global geopolitical shifts. While events like the Red Sea crisis have offered temporary advantages for the Indian air cargo system. But prolonged airspace closures over Pakistan and over three years of the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, have significantly disrupted operations and increased costs. These challenges are not only unpredictable but inevitable. The only sustainable path forward lies in embracing technology, innovation, and disruption.“

Speaking at the launch, Dheeraj Rastogi, Principal Commissioner Customs, Delhi, “India’s customs operations have undergone a significant transformation-from early digitization efforts to the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and risk-based segmentation,” stated Mr. Dheeraj Rastogi. These innovations have contributed to a substantial reduction in transaction costs and improved the overall efficiency of cargo processing.”

He further added, “Currently, 52% of air cargo is cleared on the same day, with average clearance time at Delhi Air Cargo reduced from 41 hours to 35 hours. The department remains committed to maintaining a fine balance between revenue mobilization, national security, trade facilitation, and legal compliance. Given the increasing complexities introduced by e-commerce, a collaborative, data-driven approach between industry stakeholders and regulatory authorities is imperative. Our collective goal must be to build a seamless, AI-enabled ecosystem that supports India’s emergence as a global leader in air cargo logistics.”

According to Mr. Glyn Hughes, Director General, TIACA, “With TIACA representing the entire air cargo supply chain and ACFI representing the Indian air cargo industry, it is crucial we work together so that the world can receive Indian exports efficiently and bring the best practices achieved in other countries. Globally, every year, goods worth US$9 trillion are transported through air cargo, accounting for one-third of global trade. India is at the heart of the growing global trade, and we will work toward making air cargo an integral part of it. TIACA, with its global memberships, would be able to act as a support to the Indian air cargo industry in the fields of digitalisation, enhanced usage of modern technology, including AI and adoption of other global standards.”

Together with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, ACFI is shaping a forward-looking roadmap to meet the growing demands of domestic and international logistics. These partnerships reflect ACFI’s unwavering commitment to building a resilient, efficient and globally competitive air cargo ecosystem that supports India’s economic aspirations.

Key findings of the knowledge report

Capacity Concentration: 82% of air cargo is currently handled by just six airports (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata), amplifying concentration risk and operational inefficiencies.

Growth Enablers: Digitisation, strategic airport locations in India, integrated multimodal corridors (PM Gati Shakti), and emerging connectivity in tier-2 cities.

Regulatory Gaps: Scalability of the sector is hindered by fragmented clearance systems, high dwell times (almost 12 hours for exports and 48 hours for imports) and limited transhipment readiness.

Investment Heatmap: High potential in cold-chain operations, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, automation and freighter fleet expansion.

The secondary airports have the potential to play a critical role. The Government of India’s initiative to significantly enhance air connectivity across India will give the required boost to the air cargo sector. At present, these secondary airports are underutilised due to poor infrastructure and limited airline networks.

The report highlights the strategic action areas to triple air cargo handling to 10 MTPA by 2030. These strategic actions include:

Creation of transhipment hubs with 24×7 clearance and zero rescreening

National Unified Digital Clearance Window and Cargo Command Centres

Freighter acquisition incentives and plug-and-play terminals across regional hubs

ESG integration via green infrastructure, SAF blending, and inclusive workforce practices

Global Inspiration, Local Action: Drawing on best practices from Singapore, Frankfurt and Dubai, the report advocates for modular warehousing, predictive slot allocation, and unified cargo community systems to manage rerouted and time-sensitive freight.

The paper serves as a call to action for industry, government, and private stakeholders to forge collaborative pathways and enhance India’s role in international trade and economic growth.

There should be hydrogen planes perhaps, and hybrid solutions will also have a role to play.” Global Progress on Electric Aviation Electric aviation is not just a phenomenon in Europe.
With governments and companies across Europe ploughing money into sustainable aviation technologies, cleaner, quieter and cheaper flying might soon be a reality.","Aviation remains one of the largest sources of carbon emissions, and given the rise of electric cars, electric flight has become a viable solution for the sector. This week, Beta Technologies took a big step forward when it completed the first-ever test flight of an electric plane in Denmark. Named ALIA CTOL, or Conventional Take-Off and Landing, the electric fixed-wing aircraft flew 200 kilometers between Sønderborg and Copenhagen airports, illustrating the potential for electric air travel on regional routes.

The US-based Beta Technologies created the ALIA CTOL as a small, energy-efficient plane, with a wingspan of only 15 meters, which is roughly the same size as a Sprinter van. Not as a big, but it can fly at a speed of 281 km/h. The most striking thing about this flying machine, though, is just how green it is: it generates up to 84% less carbon dioxide than a comparable conventional helicopter. This makes lighter-than-air a great choice for both passengers and cargo, with the added bonus of lower noise levels and a lower price point.

The future has started,” said Jákup Sverri Kass, the director of Sønderborg Airport, at the launch event. This is not just a test. This is the beginning of something new.” In fact, the accomplishment of ALIA CTOL’s flight marks for the major breakthrough for the electric aviation industry, which already kicked off on its journey through Europe. The aircraft is now on the European leg of its tour which started in May at Shannon Airport in Ireland. It would still display its all-electric services and charging infrastructure at several airports on the continent.

The Challenges of Electric Aviation

The positive news from Denmark for aircraft may be a good thing, but the industry is far from in the clear, and one of the biggest issues for them is charging infrastructure. As things stand, ALIA-CTOL uses truck car batteries and stops frequently to recharge at airfields. “There’s no infrastructure already on the ground in Europe like we have today in the United States,” said Shawn Hall, the chief revenue officer of Beta Technologies. That should change as airports, including Copenhagen Airport, move to suit the requirements of electric aviation. Christian Poulsen, CEO of Copenhagen Airport, noted that the airport will also have to be able to charge conventional and electric aircraft.

A second big hurdle for electric aviation is battery expense. The same concerns expressed about electric cars, around pricey batteries and lightweight materials, persist. Jørgen Mads Clausen, the chair emeritus of the Danish battery systems giant Danfoss, recently predicted that computer battery technology could support more significant electric aircraft in ten years. But he added, “You need to be ready when things take off. For when things do move quickly, with ripe technology.

The Future for Sustainable Aviation

The swift progress of electric aircraft is part of a wider European ambition to shrink the carbon footprint of aviation. Denmark is one of the trendsetters, it is planning to create its first sustainable domestic flight route by 2025, with an ultimate goal of making all domestic flights fossil-free by 2030. The Danish government, seeking to finance a move to green aviation, has proposed a flat fee of 13 Danish kroner (€1.74) per passenger for the same cause. Other Nordic countries are making similar inroads, with Norway planning for all domestic flights to be electric or hybrid by 2040 while Sweden hopes to have fossil-free domestic flights in place by 2030.

Sweden’s Heart Aerospace is also working on an electric plane, the ES-30, a 30-passenger plane with a fully battery-powered range of 200 kilometers. Although the range of electric planes is on limited area flights at this point the technology is more suited for short-haul transport within Europe. However, while electric flight is a positive step, it’s believed that other technologies including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and hydrogen fuel may still also be needed for countries to reach their sustainability targets.

Lasse Stenhøj Ingvardsen, team manager at Renewable Energy Systems at the Danish Technological Institute, stressed that multiple technologies were needed to provide a sustainable future for aviation. “We don’t have to stick to just one,” he said. “Electric will be one tool. There should be hydrogen planes perhaps, and hybrid solutions will also have a role to play.”

Global Progress on Electric Aviation

Electric aviation is not just a phenomenon in Europe. Electric aircraft are also being developed in the United States. Companies such as Joby Aviation and Electra. aero are developing similar aircraft for urban air mobility and regional commerce. Improvements in battery technology, too, could make electric-powered planes a more practical option for commercial aviation in the future.

Still with a way to go, the success of ALIA and CTOL based engines in Denmark is a watershed for the industry. With governments and companies across Europe ploughing money into sustainable aviation technologies, cleaner, quieter and cheaper flying might soon be a reality.

A Green Future for Aviation?

As electric planes advance, the opportunity to shave emissions from aviation is unmistakable. There are still obstacles, battery expenses and infrastructure requirements among them, but the growing number of tests and even successful launches of electric planes demonstrates the image of a greener future for aviation is closer than we think. The increasing number of successful projects, among them the Beta Technologies’ ALIA CTOL, leaves us optimistic that sometime in the near future, we might behold a world where electric planes are as ordinary as their fossil-fueled equivalents.

So in conclusion, the electric aviation revolution is only getting started, and the first test findings show the first steps in a more climate friendly future beneath us in the air.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__53483-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 04:02:57.267131

The target for commercial operations has been firmly set for September 30, 2025, with final inspections and preparations currently underway.

The airport is expected to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who also performed its foundation ceremony.

NMIA will become one of the most technologically advanced airports in India, with a focus on high-speed operations, sustainability, and smart passenger services.

A standout feature is its high-efficiency baggage handling system, using 360 degree barcode scanners to enhance speed and accuracy, with the goal of becoming the fastest baggage claim system in the world.

Advanced Infrastructure

NMIA is designed to eventually operate with two parallel runways and will be capable of handling up to 90 million passengers annually, a significant expansion compared to Mumbai’s existing airport.

The terminal building is nearly complete, with final interior and facade works ongoing. Over 13,000 workers are currently deployed to meet the September deadline, with an additional workforce planned to accelerate remaining tasks.

In terms of scale and technology, the airport will surpass most in India, offering ultra-modern facilities, sustainable fuel operations, and passenger-friendly systems.

Authorities are actively securing final commercial licenses in parallel with construction completion.

The NMIA project is being developed as a green airport, using 37 MW of renewable energy, with a commitment to operate all vehicles on electric or alternative fuels. Plans are also in place to make NMIA a major hub for sustainable aviation fuel.

The airport spans 1,160 hectares, with pre-development works such as river diversion and land preparation managed by CIDCO (City and Industrial Development Corporation).

The project secured financial closure in March 2022, with ₹12,770 crore funded by the State Bank of India out of a total cost of ₹19,647 crore.

Seamless Access

Connectivity is a top priority for NMIA. Infrastructure projects linking Atal Setu to the Coastal Road, and a proposed elevated expressway from Thane, are being fast-tracked.

Additionally, passengers will benefit from four-directional access via suburban rail, metro lines, highways, and water transport.

Innovative features such as remote baggage check-in in multiple cities are being introduced, allowing travelers to reach the airport baggage-free.

Internally, the airport will deploy an underground terminal train system in its second phase, ensuring easy and vehicle-free transit within terminals.

Naming Approval

The Maharashtra government has sent a naming proposal for NMIA to the Central Government.

Chief Minister Fadnavis and Deputy CM Eknath Shinde plan to follow up with the Prime Minister’s Office to finalize the airport’s official name before its inauguration.

The flight from Chicago to Los Angeles used aviation biofuel, a critical component of airlines’ goal of reaching a net-zero carbon goal by 2050. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.

“This purported attempt to incentivize ‘clean fuels’ is little more than a giveaway to the conventional biofuels industry,” the organization said in a post on its website.",,N,,2025-07-13 11:14:07.834386
