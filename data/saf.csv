SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.
The new consultation follows the launch in January by the government of the SAF Mandate, requiring the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK’s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025, and ramping up to 22% by 2040.
The government stated that the mechanism allows the cost to be spread across the supply chain, ensuring that it is borne by those benefiting from the supply of fossil aviation fuel.
Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said: “We are committed to building the technology and fuel supply that will see greener flying become a reality in a way that protects consumers.","The UK Government’s Department for Transport announced the launch of a new consultation on an initiative aimed at supporting producers of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through the establishment of a “revenue certainty mechanism” (RCM) to be funded by jet-fuel suppliers.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

The new consultation follows the launch in January by the government of the SAF Mandate, requiring the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the UK’s jet fuel mix, starting at 2% in 2025, and ramping up to 22% by 2040.

Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.

Among the key barriers to ramping up SAF production is the high start-up cost, with the government estimating investments of £600 million to £2 billion for new commercial plants to reach economies of scale, with new plants struggling to secure investments due to risks such as revenue uncertainty and fluctuating fuel prices.

According to the Department for Transport, the new RCM plan will help to reduce risk by introducing an industry funded price guarantee to ensure steady income flow for producers, even if SAF prices fluctuate, and giving investors confidence to invest in SAF plants in the UK.

The consultation outlines the government’s position that the RCM should be funded by industry, with a preferred approach to introduce a variable levy on suppliers of jet fuel. The proposal follows the “polluter pays principle” for hard to abate sectors, and is consistent with existing schemes for renewable electricity and hydrogen. The government stated that the mechanism allows the cost to be spread across the supply chain, ensuring that it is borne by those benefiting from the supply of fossil aviation fuel.

Aviation Minister, Mike Kane, said:

“We are committed to building the technology and fuel supply that will see greener flying become a reality in a way that protects consumers.

“As part of our Plan for Change, these proposals will power up SAF production in the UK, support thousands of green jobs and bolster expansion plans.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Airport-Heathrow.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 10:51:06.540547

REOLUM, a Spanish company specialized in innovative solutions for decarbonization and energy transition, has awarded a consortium formed by Técnicas Reunidas and Siemens Energy the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) of the La Robla Green project, which aims to develop what will be one of Europe’s largest renewable methanol plants in the municipality of La Robla, in the Spanish province of León.

The facility, with a production capacity of 140,000 tons per year, will combine biogenic carbon from a biomass cogeneration plant with renewable hydrogen to produce e-methanol.

The project is at the forefront of the e-methanol production technologies. E-methanol is a product that will play a very important role in the decarbonization of maritime transport in its direct use as a fuel and as a raw material for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Furthermore, methanol produced from low-emission feedstocks and technologies is a key product to facilitate the decarbonization of industrial sectors that currently have high levels of emissions, such as the chemical industry or air and maritime transport.

In addition to Reolum, the project brings together the services, knowledge and capabilities of four large companies with strong specialization in decarbonization: Siemens Energy, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., Johnson Matthey and Técnicas Reunidas.

According to the scope of the contract, Siemens Energy’s work will focus on the renewable hydrogen unit and Técnicas Reunidas’ work will focus on the biogenic carbon capture and e-methanol production units. In turn, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. will be the CO2 capture licensor and Johnson Matthey the supplier of a proprietary technology, called eMERALD™, which makes possible the direct hydrogenation of captured CO₂ to methanol.

This project is part of track, Técnicas Reunidas’ strategy for decarbonization, one of the main pillars of SALTA, the strategic program that Técnicas Reunidas launched last May.

The development of this engineering phase will be the previous step for the material execution of the plant, which will be carried out through an EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contract.

On last February 21, the Spanish Ministry for Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge allocated 180 million euros to the project, from NextGenerationEU funds, in the provisional resolution of the call for aids to create seven large renewable hydrogen clusters, located in the territories of Aragon, Andalusia, Castile and Leon, Catalonia and Galicia, which make up the H2 Valles Program.

Eco-Airline of the Year

Sustainability is at the core of Cathay’s purpose — to move people forward in life. In line with this ethos, Cathay has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions in its operations by 2050 and transitioning towards more sustainable use of resources and circular solutions along the way.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: “At Cathay, we believe that sustainability issues are complex and require collective effort. This recognition highlights the power of collaboration and our commitment to bringing together our people, customers, suppliers, business partners, regulators, and communities for a more sustainable future.”

To accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Cathay launched its Corporate SAF Program in 2022, enabling corporate partners to reduce their indirect emissions associated with air travel and airfreight services. In 2024, the programme firmly established its leading position in Asia, with the introduction of new members and a record commitment of over 6,050 metric tonnes of SAF. Cathay has also successfully conducted SAF uplifts at both Hong Kong and other airports worldwide.

Last year, Cathay also co-initiated the launch of the Hong Kong SAF Coalition together with the Business Environmental Council (BEC). Joining hands with partners from across the value chain, Cathay has taken concrete steps in promoting the development of a supportive SAF policy at its Hong Kong hub.

In addition to addressing climate change, Cathay has made great strides in adopting sustainable and circular solutions for resource use. In particular, Cathay Pacific has committed to reducing its reliance on single-use plastics (SUP), with a pledge to cut the use of passenger-facing SUP items from 7.7 pieces per passenger in 2019 to 1.5 pieces by the end of 2025. As of the end of 2024, Cathay Pacific’s SUP usage had been reduced to 2.6 pieces per passenger.

To further mitigate the impact of SUP, Cathay has introduced enhanced approaches to boost inflight recycling of water bottles — the largest SUP item by volume onboard — by improving procedures and partnering with the Airport Authority Hong Kong on a pilot scheme to enhance the collection and sorting process in 2024. Additionally, from July 2024, all bottled water uplifted from Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific’s flights is packaged in 100% recycled plastic (rPET) bottles, marking another step towards mitigating SUP usage.

Navigating complexities

The SAF supply chain remains fragmented, with key challenges arising from feedstock availability, production capacity, logistical infrastructure, and policy inconsistencies across jurisdictions. Current SAF production primarily relies on waste-based feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and municipal waste. However, the availability of these resources is constrained, raising concerns over long-term scalability.

Emerging technologies, including power-to-liquid and biomass-based SAF, offer promising alternatives but require significant investment and regulatory approval before they can be commercialised at scale. There is an urgent need for coordinated investment in refining capacity and transportation logistics to support SAF distribution. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF production facilities are not yet integrated into existing fuel supply chains, requiring additional infrastructure development. Transportation bottlenecks, particularly in regions lacking pipeline connectivity, further complicate large-scale SAF deployment.

Policy and regulatory considerations

Regulatory frameworks play a crucial role in SAF market expansion, but disparities between regional policies create operational and financial challenges. The European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) and the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offer contrasting approaches to incentivising SAF adoption, leading to market fragmentation. While the EU has mandated binding SAF blending quotas, the US relies on tax incentives and carbon credit schemes to drive investment. This lack of regulatory alignment complicates international SAF trade and creates uncertainty for investors and suppliers.

The establishment of a globally recognised SAF certification standard, potentially under the oversight of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), was a key recommendation to ensure compliance with sustainability criteria while reducing administrative burdens on producers and air cargo operators.

Growing demand for SAF

Air cargo operators are among the stakeholders pushing for expanded SAF availability, given the sector’s reliance on airfreight and its exposure to carbon reduction mandates. With global SAF demand projected to rise exponentially as governments enforce stricter emissions targets, industry leaders are looking at the necessity of de-risking investments through long-term commitments and financial incentives. One proposed solution is the establishment of SAF offtake agreements, whereby airlines and logistics companies commit to purchasing specific SAF volumes over extended periods.

Such agreements provide financial security to producers and encourage further investment. Additionally, industry stakeholders have advocated for the development of SAF-specific trading platforms to enhance market transparency and liquidity.

SAF supply chains

There are challenges remaining when it comes to the scaling up of SAF production to meet industry demand. While technological advancements and investment strategies continue to evolve, the pace of deployment remains contingent on policy alignment, infrastructure development, and financial backing. To accelerate progress, industry leaders urged governments to establish clear long-term policies, reduce regulatory barriers, and facilitate cooperation in SAF certification and distribution. For the air cargo sector, the transition to SAF is both an operational necessity and a regulatory imperative. As SAF projects move from concept to execution, ensuring a stable and efficient global supply chain will be paramount in achieving aviation’s long-term decarbonisation targets.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-10-at-15.39.16-1080x712.png,N,,2025-03-10 09:50:26.071475

The University of Kentucky (UK), has secured $2.3 million (£1.78m) in funding to develop advanced materials for commercial fusion energy. The project, part of the CHADWICK initiative, aims to create first-wall materials capable of withstanding extreme temperatures and radiation inside a fusion reactor.

Professor John Balk, leading the multi-institutional team, is focused on designing tungsten-based alloy reinforced with high-thermal-conductivity ceramics.

“We’re going to make materials that are based on porous tungsten-based alloys, but they’re optimised for the mechanical and thermal properties we want,” said Balk.

Fusion power, which mimics the sun’s energy generation, offers a clean and limitless energy source.

However, materials that can endure plasma temperatures exceeding 100 million degrees Celsius are yet to be developed.

Balk’s team will leverage machine learning to identify alloys that balance durability and efficiency.

There are few companies that understand this imperative as well as BGN International, which has made clear its aim of guaranteeing energy security while mitigating financial and geopolitical risk.
The idea for traders like BGN International, is to actively reduce global reliance on high-emission fuels while guaranteeing global energy security.
BGN International understands those risks and subsequently takes a different approach - it doesn’t rely on a single technology.
Winston Churchill famously held that the key to energy security was diversity in sources of supply.","As the energy transition steams ahead, the international community faces the crucial question of how to effectively and responsibly gravitate towards low carbon energy. There is an understanding that this must be done in a way that does not trigger economic instability, blackouts and ultimately social backlash.

Many challenges already weigh on energy markets, from the war in Ukraine to Middle East instability so the last thing the world can afford is a sudden, wholesale shift to renewables. Texas’ power crisis in 2021, South Australia’s in 2016, and California’s infamous 2020 blackout are all examples of millions being left without power because of an overzealous rush to renewables.

The key to this puzzle lies in transition fuels that bridge the gap between the energy realities in today’s market and a sustainable future. There are few companies that understand this imperative as well as BGN International, which has made clear its aim of guaranteeing energy security while mitigating financial and geopolitical risk.

There are many lofty visions for the energy transition which focus on an idealist all-renewable clean future, although realists, like BGN International, are aware that there is no such thing as an immediate, perfect solution. Rather, getting to a clean and sustainable future requires a number of steps. Immediate ‘low hanging fruit’ solutions to cut emissions, followed by the expansion of transition fuels to keep powering the economy all the while aspiring to incorporate other clean energy sources into the global supply chain. This has been the basis of the company’s heavy investment in Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—all of which BGN International sees as critical bridging, or transition, fuels.

These fuels offer steep emissions reductions compared to traditional fossil fuels like oil and coal. LPG, for example, emits 50% less CO₂ than coal and 20% less than heating oil, making it a cleaner alternative for heating and industrial applications. LNG boasts a 30% greenhouse gas reduction compared to conventional marine fuels (used for both shipping and power generation).

SAF, which is created from biofuels and synthetic processes, offers a whopping 80% lower lifecycle emissions than traditional jet fuel. Those who dream of a decarbonized aviation sector cannot do so without relying on such solutions. The idea for traders like BGN International, is to actively reduce global reliance on high-emission fuels while guaranteeing global energy security.

Indeed, energy security is a major concern as we shift away from fossil fuels. Relying too heavily on any single solution—say battery storage or solar power—causes grid chaos and supply chain issues. California is a prime example - while its policies encourage electrification and reduced emissions, its residents face regular brownouts, blackouts and energy shortages. Strangely, the state often has a surplus of solar power highlighting the inconsistency and inefficiencies of its energy mix.

BGN International understands those risks and subsequently takes a different approach - it doesn’t rely on a single technology. Rather, the company works with governments, industries, and infrastructure partners to facilitate a slow, steady and balanced transition that mitigates the risks of both energy shortages and subsequent economic dislocation. Its core model is paring LPG and LNG investments with renewables, encouraging a transition which does not disrupt activity in an economy that still depend on fossil fuels.

This collaborative approach echoes a principle that has long underpinned energy security. Winston Churchill famously held that the key to energy security was diversity in sources of supply. “Safety and certainty in oil lie in variety and variety alone,” he told Parliament in 1913. His argument has been brought back into sharp focus this year, as geopolitical instability constrained by the world’s reliance on its oil, gas, and coal. The lesson is clear: the more diversified the energy mix, the greater the resilience in times of geopolitical and economic instability.",https://www.gulftoday.ae/gulftoday/uploads/images/2025/03/10/939969.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 07:50:07.230172

“The overall proceeds for Eni group, after accounting for cash adjustments and other items, amount to 2.967 billion euros [$3.2 billion], including a capital increase in Enilive of 500 million euros to support the company's growth plan”, Italy’s state-backed Eni said in an online statement.

“Enilive, with its integrated business model, represents a prime example of the progress of the business satellite model, further confirmed by a post-money valuation of 11.75 billion euros of Equity Value for 100 percent of Enilive's share capital and KKR's commitment to strengthen its role as a key partner through an agreement, announced to the market on 18 February, to increase its stake in Enilive by a further 5 percent”.

Eni’s satellite model involves “creating focused and lean companies able to attract new capital to create value through operating and financial synergies and the acceleration of growth”, in the company’s words.

On February 18, 2025, New York City-based KKR said it has entered into another agreement to acquire a further five percent in Enilive for EUR 587.5 million.

“Having first signed our investment in Enilive in October last year, this transaction reiterates our confidence in the business’ ability to provide innovative and effective emission-reducing technology solutions, in line with our strategy to support transformative energy projects across Europe”, KKR managing director for European infrastructure Marco Fontana said in a statement. “We’re excited to continue working alongside Eni to further establish Enilive as a market leader”.

Enilive produces biomethane, sustainable aviation fuel and other biofuels, as well as offers electric vehicle charging and car sharing.

For Versalis, which makes basic chemicals, chemical products including plastics and biochemical products such as biolubricants, Eni has finalized a plan involving an investment of about EUR 2 billion. The plan “aims to reduce emissions by approximately 1 million tonnes of CO2 [carbon dioxide], currently about 40 percent of Versalis' emissions in Italy”, Eni said last year.

“It includes the set-up of new industrial plants consistent with the energy transition and decarbonization of industrial sites across sustainable chemistry, as well as biorefining and energy storage”, Eni added. “To enable the construction of the new plants, activity at the cracking plants in Brindisi and Priolo, and the polyethylene plant in Ragusa, will be phased out”.

“Eni aims to significantly reduce Versalis' exposure to basic chemicals, a sector that is facing structural and irreversible decline in Europe, and which has led to economic losses that have been close to 7 billion in cash terms over the last 15 years, 3 billion of which was in the last five years”, the company said.

Eni expects to complete the plan by 2029.

Microsoft’s 2023 report, “Accelerating Sustainability with AI”, laid out five steps the world needs to take to unlock its full potential:

Invest in AI for sustainability

Develop infrastructure for the inclusive use of AI for sustainability

Minimise resource use in AI infrastructure

Advance AI policy principles and governance

Build workforce capacity to use AI for sustainability.

The company has released another report, titled “Accelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future”, exploring progress on each of these steps.

The foreword, written by Microsoft’s Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President, and Melanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer, says: “At Microsoft, we believe the world needs AI that is broadly accessible and trustworthy, this also includes addressing the sustainability challenges associated with this technology.

“Across our sustainability work, we regularly assess our progress and adjust our strategies for greater impact.

“One lesson from this last year is that minimising the sustainability impact of AI operations requires more than minimising resource use in datacenter operations; it also requires supporting the communities where data centres are located and expanding access to zero carbon electricity.”

Investing in AI for sustainability

Microsoft says that AI can help to accelerate the transition to net zero energy which will support the decarbonisation of AI data centres.

More than 40% of global CO₂ emissions come from the burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation.

LineVision, a company Microsoft has invested in, is working with National Grid in Upstate New York to deploy dynamic line rating technology on transmission lines that can help to unlock the power of renewables.

In some regions, this technology has increased transmission capacity by up to 60%.

Microsoft is also working directly with renewable energy companies to optimise energy production.

It says the use of reinforcement learning and Microsoft Azure high-performance computing can help to optimise wind farm performance, predict maintenance needs and enhance energy production efficiency and reliability.

Microsoft’s investments extend beyond the energy transition too.

The loan, disbursed by the Loan Programs Office under the Inflation Reduction Act, would allow manufacturer Calumet to expand a sustainable aviation fuel refinery in Montana. Currently, the facility produces 140 million gallons per year of biofuels; the expansion would more than double production to 315 million gallons and generate 500 jobs.

Biofuels have been in development for decades but have recently come to the fore as an alternative to dirty fossil fuels used in the aviation industry. Biofuels are made from plant and animal material, which is often waste from food production, and making and using these fuels generates less heat-trapping air pollution than collecting and using the same amount of fossil fuels.

Unlike making aircraft electric — which requires extensive modifications to the equipment — biofuel can be used in the same engines as traditional fuel. That makes it an easy change to make immediately.

That's good news for the planet because excess heat-trapping gases from air pollution are overheating the Earth.

That causes damage to the environment and crops and leads to dangerous natural disasters. Much of that air pollution comes from the aviation industry — 2.5% of global heat-trapping gas emissions in 2023, per the International Energy Agency. Reducing that pollution is one of the necessary steps in getting the world's temperature in check.

Like everything else around us, aviation is changing too, and it does so at a rapid pace. From new ways to power the planes to new and more efficient shapes of airplanes' bodies, the biggest players in the industry are working head-to-head with startups to advance their goals.

One way the industry plans to evolve is to turn to a blended wing body (BWB) design. That's a type of aircraft that integrates both wings and body into a seemingly unique design, allowing it to use a larger surface to generate lift.

It's an idea that has been tested before, but because of its limitations, including the fact that the plane's shape could prove a nightmare for the evacuation of the occupants in case of an emergency, it never stuck.

The first time somebody tried to design a blended wing body was in the 1920s, when something called the Westland Dreadnought came to be. Many decades later, in the 1990s, McDonnell Douglas and NASA created something called the BWB-17. Research into this was also conducted by Airbus and Bombardier.

And now a California startup called JetZero believes it has what it takes to create the world's first passenger blended wing body aircraft. It doesn't have a proper stage name yet (as far as we can tell it is known internally as the Z5), and the full details on it are not entirely known, but the pieces are slowly falling into place.

Photo: JetZero

JetZero says it will fly a demonstrator of its BWB as soon as 2027, and last week it gave us a few details on what to expect in terms of the engines powering it and some of the other systems that will be used.

As far as the engines are concerned, the company settled on the PW2040 made by Pratt & Whitney. It's the same powerplant that powers the Boeing 757 aircraft (including the military C-32A version), and from which the F117 deployed in the C-17 Globemaster III aircraft is derived. It comes with a power output of between 37,000 and 43,000 pounds of thrust, but we're not told how much it will spit out in the JetZero BWB.

Another company, Collins Aerospace, has been tasked with making the nacelle structures for the engines, including the inlet, fan cowl, fan duct, fairings, and the engine support structure.

The demonstrator plane will be used by the company to validate the key technologies that will go into the final design. When ready to be made, the BWB will be offered in three main variants, namely jetliner, freighter, and trainer. A fourth application, aerial refueling tanker, is also being considered.

As far as the passenger BWB is concerned, we're told it should provide the same capabilities as that of a widebody aircraft, meaning a capacity of about 250 passengers. Because the engines will be installed on top of the aircraft, it should also be a lot quieter that existing designs.

Photo: JetZero

The BWB will be capable of flying on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but it will also burn about half the amount the comparable planes (meaning conventional tube-and-wing ones) of today are burning. That's because of its design, which creates less drag, increases the lifting surface area, and provides even load and lift distribution. On top of it all, the entire plane should be lighter than existing planes in the same class.

Because of all of the above, but also thanks to the fact the BWB could easily use existing airport infrastructure, some of the aviation industry's biggest players have already been drawn to the idea. Delta Airlines, for instance, joined the party back in 2021, looking at ways of ""how to best commercialize the aircraft.""

The U.S. Air Force (USAF) is interested in the technology as well, and back in 2023 it granted JetZero an award to help it build its full-scale demonstrator. As a side note, these guys are not the only ones the USAF is looking at in its quest to find a suitable BWB, with a total of $235 million on the military branch's table to get to the right solution.

It was almost one year ago to the day when JetZero announced it had received an Airworthiness Certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The certificate was awarded back then for a scale model of the blended-wing prototype called Pathfinder, a rather small machine by comparison with the final design – it only comes with a wingspan of 23 feet (seven meters).

JetZero is not the only company presently looking at blended wings as a potential solution for an aviation revolution. The same can be said for a crew called Natilus, which is working on a large variety of cargo drones that have been designed in such a way. It's unclear exactly when these guys will fly their creation for the first time.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/first-blended-wing-body-aircraft-in-decades-to-fly-with-pratt-whitney-engines-248176_1.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 05:50:17.027951

Q. DHL has been a steadfast supporter of SMEs over the years. Can you share some specific ways in which DHL has helped SMEs navigate the challenges of global trade?

A. We have always believed that SMEs are the backbone of the economy. Today,India has 633.9 lakh registered MSMEs, contributing 30% ofits GDP and over 40 per cent ofits exports. Despite this, the most reported challenge for MSMEs, particularly in Asian countries, has been the limited information on international markets and lack of understanding of foreign traderegulatory requirements apart from the gap in skillsets. Hence,we see our global initiative, DHLGoTrade, as an important initiative to empower entrepreneurs from developing countries to access global markets.DHL Express in India has been working with non-profits to skill and enable women entrepreneurs and MSMEs to take their first steps into e-commerce and eventually equipping them to become proficient in cross-border trade.

In India, we have signed an MoU and are working with our government through the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), under the Ministry of Commerce, to equip Indian MSMEs with the necessary tools and knowledge to thrive in the international e-commerce market. The objective is to build a start-up kitfor first-time MSMEs by handholding them through the process of going global. It will cover 76 districts in three phases, and DHL is providing capacity-building sessions, training, and workshops to make these Indian MSMEs export-ready. This collaboration was recently extended via the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) to Indianjewellery exporters. Here we aim to make the jewellery exporters more competitive in the global arenaby leveraging our time-definite solutions, which in turn leads to faster customs clearance processes and less paperwork, resulting in shorter transit times.

We also have severalIT tools such asMy Global Trade Services (MyGTS), MyDHL+, and services like On-Demand Delivery (ODD) that are incredibly beneficial for our customers, are particularly useful for SMEs. For example, using MyGTS, an AI powered tool, a small business or a growing e-commerce merchant can instantly calculate the estimated duties and taxes for the shipment, the landed cost, compare differences across international trade lanes, and help one comply with import and export regulations easily.

Q. Please tell us more about the Go Trade initiative—what are its core objectives and key elements? Are there any success stories that demonstrate the lasting impact of this program on SMEs?

A. DHL GoTrade helps us foster international trade and promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth by empowering SMEs to engage in cross-border commerce. Our expertise lies in logistics,customs, and trade. Leveraging this, we aim to educate SMEs on the strategic advantages of global trade and equip them with the necessary tools to access international markets. Having said that, this is only one part of the GoTrade story.

One of DHL's signature programs under GoTradeis a collaboration with Prayatna NGO to establish Enterprise Resource Centres that providetrainers, machines, raw materials, and other necessities. This resource centre model aims to provide new skills or improve existing ones, allowing beneficiaries to start their own businesses eventually.We are extremely happy to share that the women beneficiaries we trainedhave experienced a 178% increase in their income. 25 of our beneficiaries have also established independent micro-businesses, investing in their own business transactions.

Additionally, we are working with Vrutti NGO on an accelerator program that will bring 200 MSMEs on board the government-approved ONDC e-commerce platform. The collaboration aims to boost growth and foster sustainable local economies.

Q. Sustainability has become a critical focus for businesses worldwide. How is DHL Express embedding sustainability into its operations and services?

A. Sustainability has been a fundamental pillar of the DHL Group. We understand that our decisions today have a lasting impact on future generations; therefore, our corporate social responsibility is not only a business mandate but our purpose. This purpose drives our actions, aligning them with our values and goals.

At DHL, our purpose – ‘Connecting People, Improving Lives’ is deeply ingrained in our DNA. It influences our decision-making process, as we consciously consider the world we operate in. Our current goals are closely aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

To ensure progress, we have integrated social, environmental and governance goals into our Corporate Strategy 2030. Our bottom lines, which reflect our commitments, include being an employer of choice, a provider of choice, an investment of choice, as well as being a green logistics of choice. Through this framework, we measure our progress and focus our efforts on achieving these commitments. For instance, we have added the GoGreen Plus service to our product portfolio to enable customers to leverage sustainable aviation fuel and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of their international deliveries. We are also set to lead the way in sustainable aviation, aiming to have at least 30% of our operations powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. Our journey towards sustainability is not isolated.We also believe in actively involving our people as the foremost flag bearers of our sustainable programs. For example, our Global Volunteer Day' (GVD) is our year-long approach towards volunteerism with a two-week action period. Today, we encourage our employees to volunteer for the communities or causes they support, wherever they can.

Q. DHL aims to achieve ambitious sustainability targets, such as electrifying last-mile deliveries and increasing the use of sustainable fuels. What progress has been made so far, and what challenges remain in achieving these goals?

A. The most notable progress is that we are one of the few organisations worldwide and the first in logistics to take a stand in reducing our Scope 1,, 2, and 3 emissions. We are doing what is technically feasible and commercially viable right now.

We have set milestones to focus our efforts and measure our progress. These transparent, time-bound targets and KPIs are integral to our strategic planning and decision-making processes, much like our financial goals. By 2030, over the base of 2021, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

- Reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to <29m metric tons of carbon* by doubling down and accelerating decarbonization measures across all operations.

- Target >30% Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) blending in our Express and Global Forwarding businesses.

- Electrify 66% of our last-mile delivery vehicles.

- Leverage a carbon neutral design for all new buildings.

As of 2023, DHL Group is incredibly proud that we have made significant headway against these targets. In 2021, GHG emissions stood at 40 million metric tons. Comparatively, in 2023, this was reduced to 33 million metric tons CO2e.In 2023, we sourced 14% of global SAF supply for our own aircrafts, achieving a ratio of 3.2% – the highest of any global airline.By 2023, over half of our 66% last-mile electrification target was already achieved, as 37.6% of our pickup and delivery vehicles were electrified.

The primary challenge we face in our journey toward sustainability is the commercial viability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). While SAF and other sustainable fuels are available, their high price point presents significant barriers to scaling their use effectively. To successfully transition to an electrified delivery fleet in India, it is essential to establish a robust charging infrastructure and ensure the ongoing availability of electric heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs), which are still in the process of expanding. Nevertheless, DHL remains unwavering in its commitment to decarbonization, recognizing that collaboration with our customers and suppliers is essential to make sustainable solutions commercially viable. With our global reach and innovative approach, we are dedicated to leading the logistics industry toward a more sustainable future.

Q. India is a cost-sensitive market. How is DHL ensuring that its sustainable logistics solutions remain accessible and affordable for Indian SMEs? What advice would you give to SME leaders who are skeptical about its ROI or view it as a secondary priority- particularly in markets like India and China?

A. We recognize the cost-sensitive nature of the Indian market and have designed our sustainable logistics solutions, including the GoGreen Plus program. Our goal is to remain as ‘insanely customer centric’ as possible. Therefore, the right of choice remains with the customer. While booking a shipment, customers will have two options to select the GoGreen Plus service with DHL Express: either on a contractual basisor by choosing shipping service through MyDHL+, DHL Express’ online shipping and tracking platform. Via the contractual model, the customer decides how much they would like to reduce their CO2e and how much to invest in SAF. Complete flexibility is offered in this case. DHL Express uses the contribution to invest in SAF.

Sustainability has become a strategic imperative for SMEs, significantly influencing their long-term value and credibility. To better understand the growing prioritization of sustainability across the supply chain operations, DHL Express conducted an in-depth survey of 5,000 SME decision makers across 11 markets: the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, China, Singapore, Japan, Mexico, Canada and India. Findings show that SMEs in India and China are leaning towardsustainable logistics practices. 72% of Chinese SMEs and 59% of Indian SMEs said that sustainability is “extremely important” to their business – versus a global average of 35%. Globally, SMEs are not confident their customers are on board with paying extra for sustainable shipping options: across all countries, most SMEs said their customers would only be “slightly willing” to pay. In contrast, 51% of SMEs in India and 47% of SMEs in China think their customers would be “extremely” or “very” willing to pay more for sustainable shipping – versus a global average of 29%.

We believe that embracing sustainable practices not only strengthens brand reputation and fosters customer loyalty but also equips businesses to adapt to future regulatory changes and evolving market preferences that prioritize green operations. Through DHL's diverse initiatives and tailored solutions, we empower SMEs to make gradual yet impactful strides toward integrating sustainability into their operations, helping them stay competitive while contributing to a more sustainable future.

Q. What role do you see the government playing in steering the logistics industry toward a more sustainable future? Are there any policy interventions or incentives that you think are critical to this transition?

A. Sustainability is becoming an important focus for businesses across industry segments. We see this daily as more customers from different industries sign up for our GoGreen Plus service. The DHL Global Sustainability Survey also supports this claim with real data. The government is already making significant strides in sustainability, from expanding renewable energy and implementing the National BiodiversityAction Plan to advancing the Smart Cities Mission. Government involvement will help guide sustainable logistics progress, and we look forward to seeing what the upcoming union budget has in store for us.

Q. What role do consumers play in driving sustainable practices across the logistics chain?

A. Customers need to have a similar interest in making a drastic difference in the way they operate. With the introduction of GoGreen Plus in the market, we realised that the demand for the service was always there. Our customers too want to be more socially and environmentally responsible. To date, over 6000 customers have signed up with us for our GoGreen Plus service, highlighting their commitment to sustainability as well as their demand driving us to do better.

Q. With the rise of e-commerce, how is DHL addressing the challenge of scaling operations sustainably to meet the growing demand for fast and green delivery services?

A. We are consciously making an effort to incorporate responsible practices into our systems and processes. For example,through GoGreen Plus, we leverage SAF to “inset” greenhouse gas emissions while also meeting customer demand. While GoGreen Plus is the first-of-its-kind service in the industry, we also are amongst the largest users of SAF in the world.

Q. Looking ahead, what are the key trends you foresee shaping the logistics sector in the next five to ten years?

A. The logistics industry is on the cusp of significant transformation over the next five years. Trends shaping the industry over the next decade would include:

- Sustainability: Sustainability is at the top of everyone's agenda. The emerging trends carry a significant impact on decarbonization, alternative energy solutions, circularity, and environmental stewardship. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are becoming a priority in the express logistics industry to promote the global harmonization of sustainability. The express industry will also see a rise in investments in e-cargo planes.

- Digitalization: Digitalization has created exciting and endless possibilities and coupled with automation we are witnessing a rapid transformation in express logistics to set us up for the next decade, enabling growth across the world, especially for India for our largeSME market. Digitalization and automation solutions have helped supply chains to become more streamlined and ensured durable sustainability for businesses even when faced with interruptions. The operations playbook in express logistics is now enriched with rapidly evolving technologies such as blockchain for secure transactions and across-the-supply-chain visibility, Internet of Things for real-time visibility and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning to minimize manual intervention and leverage our skilled labour for more strategic tasks.",https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/DHL RH Subramanian Cover.JPG,N,,2025-03-10 05:50:58.063884

""This eliminates the usual separate hydrogen production with downstream synthesis gas production, which significantly increases the efficiency of the overall process towards synthetic fuels.""
The product, which is further processed into synthetic kerosene, will then be used in engine tests by turbine manufacturers and research partners.","In order to achieve the climate targets, Europe needs green alternatives for applications that are difficult to electrify. ""Air traffic in particular will be dependent on sustainably produced kerosene for the foreseeable future,"" says Professor Roland Dittmeyer from the Institute of Micro Process Engineering (IMVT) at KIT. ""Synthetic fuels that are produced using power-to-liquid processes withCO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water and green electricity are particularly suitable."" Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernikus project P2X and leads the corresponding research work at KIT. The project has now reached an important technological milestone on the way to sustainable aviation fuel: the globally unique coupling of the innovative and highly efficient water vapor/CO2 ""Co"" electrolysis technology of industrial partner Sunfire on an industrially relevant scale (220 kilowatts of electrolysis power) directly with synthesis.

Co-electrolysis makes power-to-liquid more efficient

Synthetic kerosene is produced at the KIT Energy Lab in a multi-stage process in modular plants. First, synthesis gas - a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide - is produced fromCO2 and water. In principle, the synthesis gas can be produced in various ways. In the new configuration, a co-electrolysis module with an output of 220 kilowatts from industry partner Sunfire is used, which simplifies this process step and, above all, makes it more efficient. ""The special thing about co-electrolysis is that it electrochemically and highly efficiently converts water vapor andCO2 directly into synthesis gas in a single step. Up to 85 percent of the electrical energy used for this is recovered as chemical energy in the synthesis gas. In addition, the coupling demonstrated that our co-electrolysis has very high system availability and reliability and was therefore able to deliver synthesis gas of the desired quality at all times,"" says Hubertus Richter, Senior Engineer R&D Project Management & Process Engineering at Sunfire. ""This eliminates the usual separate hydrogen production with downstream synthesis gas production, which significantly increases the efficiency of the overall process towards synthetic fuels.""

For the coupled operation of co-electrolysis and fuel synthesis, the researchers also integrated a compressor with safety devices into the process chain, with which the synthesis gas is brought to reaction pressure. The synthesis gas is then converted into long-chain hydrocarbons - known as syncrude - in a microstructured reactor using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which can be used directly to produce fuels such as kerosene or other chemical products. This reactor technology was developed by scientists at KIT and is already being commercialized by INERATEC, a spin-off from KIT. In the future, the heat generated during synthesis will also be used in the form of steam for co-electrolysis. This would further reduce the energy requirement of the entire process and demonstrate the product preparation for the target product kerosene on this scale. The combination of these process steps allows optimum utilization of the carbon dioxide used and the greatest possible energy efficiency, as the material flows within the process chain can be efficiently recycled in addition to the energy flows.

One ton of kerosene per day in the next step

Researchers at KIT successfully tested the integration of co-electrolysis in campaign operation under real conditions, producing up to one hundred liters of syncrude per day. The coupled operation marks an important milestone in the second funding phase of the Kopernikus project P2X. The plant is now being expanded for a capacity of up to 300 liters of syncrude per day. In the third and final funding phase, the research team is building a larger Fischer-Tropsch production plant in parallel through INERATEC in the Höchst Industrial Park near Frankfurt. ""Production on a ton scale will be realized there for the first time,"" says Dittmeyer. The product, which is further processed into synthetic kerosene, will then be used in engine tests by turbine manufacturers and research partners. Accompanying analyses will ensure that the fuel meets the strict aviation standards.

About the Kopernikus project P2X

In the Kopernikus project P2X, the partners Climeworks, Sunfire, INERATEC and the Institute of Micro Process Engineering at the KIT Energy Lab are setting up and operating an integrated process chain. Following the ""power-to-fuel"" concept,CO2-neutral fuels, also known as e-fuels, can be produced in this way. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding the project. The project involves 18 partners from industry, science and civil society organizations.","https://img.chemie.de/Portal/News/67ca9b043b5dc_U-XdrUzB1.jpg?tr=w-3004,h-2250,cm-extract,x-313,y-0:n-xzoom",N,,2025-03-10 01:51:14.439494

El futuro del SAF y la disputa por el cultivo múltiple La aviación enfrenta el enorme desafío de reducir sus emisiones sin comprometer la eficiencia del transporte aéreo.
El rechazo de Estados Unidos a la propuesta de ICAO parece más una maniobra de defensa de su industria agrícola que un verdadero argumento ambiental.","El crecimiento de la aviación y su impacto en el cambio climático han llevado a la Organización de Aviación Civil Internacional (ICAO) a buscar estrategias para reducir las emisiones de carbono en los vuelos comerciales. Entre sus últimas recomendaciones, aprobadas en el Comité de Protección Ambiental de la Aviación (CAEP), se encuentra el impulso del cultivo múltiple para la producción de Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

ICAO es el organismo especializado de las Naciones Unidas encargado de establecer estándares y regulaciones para la aviación global. Su objetivo es garantizar la seguridad, eficiencia y sostenibilidad del transporte aéreo, incluyendo iniciativas para reducir las emisiones de carbono.

En la lucha contra el cambio climático, ICAO lanzó en 2016 el programa CORSIA (Esquema de Compensación y Reducción de Carbono para la Aviación Internacional, por sus siglas en inglés), diseñado para mitigar el impacto ambiental del sector. CORSIA establece que las aerolíneas deben compensar sus emisiones de CO₂ a través de distintas estrategias, como el uso de biocombustibles sostenibles (SAF, por Sustainable Aviation Fuel), inversiones en eficiencia energética y adquisición de créditos de carbono. Su meta es lograr un crecimiento neutro en emisiones a partir de 2027 y reducir significativamente la huella de carbono de la aviación hacia 2050.

Para cumplir con estos objetivos, ICAO busca expandir la producción de materias primas elegibles para SAF, incluyendo residuos agrícolas, aceites usados, biomasa lignocelulósica y cultivos específicos producidos utilizando prácticas agrícolas de bajo impacto ambiental. Dentro de estas se encuentran el cultivo múltiple o multicropping como se lo conoce en inglés.

La encrucijada del SAF: el fallo de la corte europea que redefine el futuro de la aviación sostenible

El cultivo múltiple

El cultivo múltiple es una técnica agrícola que consiste en cultivar dos o más cosechas en la misma superficie en un mismo año, optimizando el uso del suelo sin necesidad de expandir la frontera agrícola. En el caso de los biocombustibles, esto permitiría aprovechar cultivos de invierno como la colza, la carinata y la camelina sin desplazar la producción de alimentos.

Países como Brasil, Argentina y Uruguay han adoptado esta práctica con éxito, promoviendo la siembra de oleaginosas invernales en campos que de otro modo quedarían improductivos entre cosechas principales. Sin embargo, la iniciativa ha encontrado un fuerte opositor: Estados Unidos.

La objeción de Estados Unidos: ¿preocupación técnica o interés económico?

El gobierno estadounidense ha expresado su rechazo a la recomendación de ICAO, argumentando que la propuesta es “prematura y carece de justificación técnica o científica suficiente”. Según Washington, su implementación podría perjudicar a los agricultores estadounidenses y otorgar una ventaja competitiva injusta a Brasil, un gigante en la producción de materias primas para biocombustibles.

Los biocombustibles en el transporte marítimo: un potencial inmenso con desafíos a superar

Pero, ¿hasta qué punto esta oposición se basa en fundamentos técnicos? En el fondo, la disputa parece tener un fuerte componente geopolítico y comercial. Estados Unidos ha apostado históricamente por cultivos tradicionales como la soja y el maíz para la producción de biocombustibles, con subsidios y regulaciones que favorecen a su propia industria agrícola. El avance de cultivos invernales en Sudamérica podría desafiar su hegemonía en el sector.

Además, el argumento de que la medida incentivaría la deforestación de bosques tropicales es cuestionable. La carinata, la colza y la camelina se cultivan en tierras ya utilizadas para la agricultura y no requieren expansión de la frontera agrícola. Por el contrario, al aprovechar tierras ociosas en invierno, el cultivo múltiple podría reducir la presión sobre los ecosistemas naturales.

Sudamérica avanza en la producción de oleaginosas para SAF

Mientras Estados Unidos bloquea la iniciativa en ICAO, Sudamérica avanza con fuerza en la incorporación de cultivos de invierno en sus esquemas productivos. En Argentina, la carinata y la camelina han despertado el interés de productores y empresas biotecnológicas, impulsadas por la creciente demanda de SAF.

Una alianza japonesa suma a la industria forestal en la carrera por el SAF

Brasil, con su histórico liderazgo en biocombustibles, ya ha comenzado a integrar cultivos de segunda siembra dentro de su rotación agrícola, aprovechando la infraestructura existente para procesar aceites vegetales en combustibles sostenibles. Uruguay, por su parte, también ha dado pasos firmes en la adopción de estos cultivos, incentivando su producción con políticas alineadas a la reducción de emisiones.

El futuro del SAF y la disputa por el cultivo múltiple

La aviación enfrenta el enorme desafío de reducir sus emisiones sin comprometer la eficiencia del transporte aéreo. En este contexto, el SAF emerge como una de las soluciones más viables, y el multicropping podría ser una estrategia clave para garantizar su producción sin competir con los alimentos.

El rechazo de Estados Unidos a la propuesta de ICAO parece más una maniobra de defensa de su industria agrícola que un verdadero argumento ambiental. En un mundo donde la transición energética es inminente, la pregunta no es si el multicropping será una alternativa viable, sino cuándo terminará de consolidarse a nivel global.

Sudamérica ya está dando los primeros pasos, mientras Washington se mantiene firme en su posición. ¿Se trata de una legítima defensa de sus agricultores o de una estrategia para preservar su dominio en los biocombustibles? El tiempo y las políticas internacionales darán la respuesta.",https://i0.wp.com/www.bioeconomia.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Estados-Unidos-desafia-la-propuesta-de-ICAO-sobre-doble-cultivo-para-SAF-proteccion-agricola-o-estrategia-geopolitica.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 01:51:29.033950

The facility proposes to turn residual waste into usable products, including bio-naphtha for use in sustainable available fuel, hydrogen and solid carbon.
The proposed facility will take residual waste, as shredded waste flock, from local waste sources, to produce a source of fuel and solid carbon.
The applicant says the creation of bio-naphtha as a product of the process also helps to support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector as it can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel.","The Government has stepped in on whether to allow West Berkshire Council to decide whether the first hi-tech waste recycling plant in the country producing aviation fuel can go ahead in Theale.

The scheme could be a £100m investment in the district, and is said to set new sustainability standards for treating waste in the UK in a flagship scheme announced for West Berkshire.

The site, at Theale Quarry, aims to use a process called pyrolysis – the chemical decomposition of organic material with heat in the absence of oxygen.

But the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government has called the application in, so it can decide instead of the council.

No reason has been given.

“No one thinks of waste treatment as sexy or fun, but when it comes to carbon removal I am really rather proud there is a site being considered here in West Berkshire,” said Vicky Poole (Lib Dem, Burghfield and Mortimer) at Wednesday’s eastern area planning committee, which was in favour of the scheme.

The facility proposes to turn residual waste into usable products, including bio-naphtha for use in sustainable available fuel, hydrogen and solid carbon.

There is no burning or combustion and therefore there are no emissions.

The process proposed for this site is protected by patent.

It results in a controllable process and produces a high-quality fuel gas, bio-naptha, and the proposed facility will be the first full-scale commercial operation of its type in the country.

The feedstock for the process will come from non-recyclable, non-hazardous residual waste that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated.

The planned development consists of two large single-storey industrial buildings, with two two-storey buildings for staff welfare.

The proposed facility will take residual waste, as shredded waste flock, from local waste sources, to produce a source of fuel and solid carbon.

The applicant says this will help to reduce the environmental impacts associated with landfilling and incineration, as well as reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

The process also has the capacity to achieve highly significant levels of carbon capture with the whole process calculated to be overall carbon negative. and can play an important part in meeting the council’s climate change targets, as well as supporting the UK’s aims to be carbon net zero by 2050.

The applicant says the creation of bio-naphtha as a product of the process also helps to support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector as it can be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

The development is expected to provide jobs for approximately 36 people, working a three-shift system.",https://www.newburytoday.co.uk/_media/img/U2QLU66VGI0X0H7GWT95.jpg,N,,2025-03-10 01:51:36.012149

Global air transport data base provider : Statista projects that private aircraft market size is expected to see strong growth in the next few years.

According to Statista data , private jet operations will grow to $39.62 billion in 2029 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1per cent.

It projected growth in the forecast period as attributable to expansion of on-demand private jet services. It cited the anticipated growth to be triggered by technological advancements in aircraft efficiency and safety, growing emphasis on personalized travel experiences occasioning increase in private jet usage, increasing number of high-net-worth individuals in emerging economies.

The data listed other drivers to include : technological advancements by major companies that will introduce more efficient and eco-friendly private aircraft models, increased adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the rise of hybrid and electric private aircraft , which is expected to transform the industry, growing demand for customized and luxury interiors.

Only last week, Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Mr Festus Keyamo vowed to tackle all illegal chartered operations and related matters in Nigeria.

Keyamo spoke while receiving the report of the seven-member committee on illegal chartered operations and related matters at the ministry’s headquarters in Abuja.

The minister said the issue of illegal charter operations by private jets and private aircraft owners has been besetting Nigeria’s aviation sector.

He said those who obtain licences under the permit for non-commercial flight (PNCF) use the aircraft for other illegal transactions.

Keyamo said the federal government is poised to mitigate the acts, pledging that his ministry will not fail to safeguard the aviation industry in line with its mandate.

“This practice has been going on for many years before I became Minister, but I thought there was a need to confront it headlong,” he said.

“When you cannot track them, it leads to money laundering, drug trafficking, illegal entry and exits into the country and all kinds of illegal activities.”

Keyamo commended the efforts of the task force in producing the report and outlining recommendations to tackle the challenge.

He assured that the ministry would critically examine the report and its recommendations, stressing that it would not be swept under the carpet.

Meanwhile, during the presentation of the report, Ado Sanusi, chairman of the task force, said the committee conducted a thorough investigation into illegal private charter operations in Nigeria and identified critical challenges which include regulatory weaknesses, loopholes in the PNCF system, inadequate oversight, security vulnerabilities, and significant revenue losses to the government.

Sanusi said the findings pose risks to aviation safety and also create an uneven playing field for legitimate operators.

He said part of the committee’s recommendations is that the government should strengthen regulatory oversight, enhance security measures, improve compliance with aviation laws, and ensure that private charter operations are conducted transparently and in line with international standards.

He appealed to the minister to ensure a quick implementation of the suggestions, saying they would create an economically viable aviation industry in Nigeria.",https://cdn.thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/26202351/Charter-jets.jpg,N,,2025-03-09 21:50:51.739266

“The Farm to Fly Act will provide access to new markets for our nation’s farmers, drive rural economic development, and strengthen our domestic energy resources,” said Congressman Miller. “I’m grateful for the close collaboration between my colleagues, Ohio and American agricultural producers, and the aviation industry. I look forward to seeing this through to lift American farmers to new heights and strengthen our nation’s energy supply.”

“Expanding opportunities for biofuels will not only help family farmers across the country but will also help connect more American businesses with homegrown clean energy,” said Congressman Flood. “Making the eligibility criteria for Sustainable Aviation Fuels at the U.S. Department of Agriculture clearer is a great step forward on this journey. Thank you to Congressman Miller for your leadership on the Farm to Fly Act, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move this commonsense legislation quickly.”

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel continues to be a promising market for our ag producers and brings greater opportunity for U.S. farmers to partner with the aviation sector,” said Congressman Finstad. “I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this bipartisan legislation, which develops new markets for Minnesota farmers, opens the door to future opportunities for rural economic development, and strengthens American energy independence with fuel grown right here at home.”

“By utilizing sustainable aviation fuel, we can cut harmful emissions, support family farmers and reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I’m proud to join Congressman Max Miller in introducing the bipartisan Farm to Fly Act that will allow homegrown biofuels to power our aviation sector while supporting growth in rural economies. With this bill we can empower the USDA to drive a sustainable future for our aviation industry.”

“This bill will make SAF production eligible for existing biofuels programs at USDA, providing a burgeoning market for Nebraska’s producers during this time of economic uncertainty in the agricultural industry,” said Congressman Bacon. “I look forward to working with Rep. Miller to make this bill a reality.”

“Homegrown biofuels are critical to American energy independence and sustainable aviation fuel is vital to the future of air travel. By converting agricultural biomass into airplane fuel, Iowa farmers and producers will benefit from new markets, and we can use domestic energy – instead of foreign oil – to power our planes,” said Congressman Feenstra. “I’m glad to work with my Ways and Means colleague, Rep. Max Miller, to introduce the Farm to Fly Act to include SAF in USDA bio-energy programs and promote the use of SAF for airline fuel. Representing the top biofuel-producing district in the nation, our farmers and producers will play a pivotal role in the future of air travel powered by homegrown American fuels.”

Support for Farm to Fly from Industry:

“The Farm to Fly Act creates new opportunities for Ohio’s corn growers. Investing in SAF solutions strengthens Ohio’s agricultural economy and enhances national security. We look forward to collaborating with policymakers to support the ongoing partnership between Ohio’s corn growers and the aviation industry.” — Tadd Nicholson, Executive Director of Ohio Corn & Wheat.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is rooted in America’s agricultural sector. The Farm to Fly Act expands opportunities for U.S. farmers and strengthens USDA’s role in SAF development—enhancing our energy dominance, driving rural economic growth, and reinforcing American innovation in fuel production. We commend Representatives Miller, Flood, Finstad, Budzinski, Tenney, Mann, Bost, Bacon, Feenstra, D. Johnson, Alford, Sorensen, Miller-Meeks, and Fischbach for their commitment to advancing policies that support SAF and the agricultural communities that make it possible.” — Alison Graab, Executive Director of the SAF Coalition

“The Farm to Fly Act is a win-win-win: The bill supports America’s farmers, bolsters energy independence, and incentivizes production of SAF for the aviation sector. Congressman Miller continues to be a strong advocate in this space, and we appreciate his foresight, commitment, and leadership. We are encouraged by the additional bipartisan support of Reps. Flood, Finstad, Budzinski, Tenney, Mann, Bost, Bacon and Feenstra and others.” — Airlines for America

“The Farm to Fly Act is a game-changer for American agriculture, creating new economic opportunities while strengthening our nation’s energy security. By recognizing Sustainable Aviation Fuel as an eligible resource under USDA bio-energy programs, this legislation will empower farmers, ethanol producers, and rural communities to lead in the next generation of clean energy solutions.” — Tom Buis, CEO of American Carbon Alliance

“Gevo is thrilled to see the reintroduction of the Farm to Fly Act, a positive step forward for economic opportunity, agriculture, and securing American energy independence. This legislation will be critical to helping diversify domestic fuel production while creating new opportunities for our nation’s farmers and rural communities. We’d like to extend a special thanks to the bill’s House sponsor Representative Max Miller (R-OH) for his continued support of American farmers and the domestic SAF industry.” — Lindsay Fitzgerald, Gevo VP of Corporate Affairs

“The Renewable Fuels Association thanks Rep. Miller, as well as cosponsors Reps. Flood, Finstad, Budzinski, Tenney, Mann, Bost, Bacon, Feenstra, D. Johnson, Alford, Sorensen, Miller-Meeks and Fischbach for the reintroduction of the Farm to Fly Act. RFA supports this important legislation, which would bring clarity and stability to the future of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) made from U.S. crops. By affirming SAF’s inclusion in USDA programs and ensuring the best science is used, this bill empowers domestic agriculture to participate in the emerging SAF market.” — Geoff Cooper, RFA President and CEO

Specifically, the Farm to Fly Act would:

Clarify eligibility for Sustainable Aviation Fuels within current U.S. Department of Agriculture Bio-Energy Programs expanding markets for American agricultural crops through aviation bioenergy;

Provide for greater collaboration for aviation biofuels throughout U.S. Department of Agriculture agency mission areas, increasing private sector partnerships; and

Affirm a common definition of SAF for USDA purposes, as widely supported by industry and congressional leaders to enable U.S. crops to most effectively contribute to aviation renewable fuels.

Some people take years to decide what they want to do when they grow up. Others figure it out by the 5th grade. That was the case for Ryan Martin, Chief Meteorologist at the Ohio Ag Net and Ohio’s Country Journal. “In 5th grade we were supposed to get up and everybody in the class had to choose a day when we had to get on the PA speaker and read the weather,” said Martin. “My day came, and I got all the weather information for the day’s weather forecast and I stood up on that podium, and into the receiver said I’m meteorologist Ryan and here’s the weather for today. I decided right then that I wanted to be a meteorologist, so I passed up some full ride football scholarships to go and get a degree in agricultural meteorology at Purdue.” Martin has been forecasting the weather for a number of different organizations since the late 1990’s.

Martin’s passion for weather forecasting came from growing up on a farm in New Paris, Indiana. “I just wanted to be able to tell folks when to cut hay. It seemed like when I was growing up if we had a day to cut hay it would rain, so I wanted to be able to do that,” said Martin.

Martin is also a farmer and grain marketer. “I ended up getting into futures and options trading,” said Martin. “I guess that I was good enough at it, that someone gave me a job. I’m self-taught on futures and options. It is a lot like meteorology, it involves recognition, seeing what’s going on, and using theory. I had a chance to move into the physical grain buying side about 10 years ago, and I haven’t looked back since.” Along with grain origination and marketing, Martin also teaches an undergraduate grain marketing course at Huntington University.

Over the years, Martin has observed several interesting developments in the production and marketing of soybeans. “Over the years, it has been really interesting to watch the development on the demand side of the equation for soybeans. As I teach my students, it really boils down to supply and demand. So many times, when I am out talking about weather and markets, someone will ask me about what they have read or heard from the experts about resistance and a bunch of technical stuff. They want to know where the market will go. It really boils down to supply and demand. Look at all the new demand channels that have come online over the years. I was doing a 30-year retrospective for my marketing class this past week. We discussed the way the markets move, and the market volatility in the 70’s, the 80’s, the 90’s, the early 2000’s and the 2010’s. You could tell exactly when China became a force in the market on soybeans. You could tell again the next time that the big market shift came. It wasn’t on the demand side; it was on the supply side. You can see it in the volatility when Brazil came online. The same when other countries in South America came online as a huge force in soybean production.

“When I’m looking at trends I’m looking at when the next big supply or demand hiccup that we see may be coming,” said Martin. “We are seeing some of that occur this year. Regionally, bird flu can be a fairly significant demand impact on a local scale and it is something that the industry tries to pay attention to. There is also the talk about tariffs and what that does to our demand profile in the global marketplace. I think the shift that we have seen, from the market out your back door to market on a global scale, has been the biggest shift in the past 25-30 years in this industry.”

The renewable fuels industry has had people talking about creating demand for several years. “I had farmers approach me at the Fort Wayne Farm Show back in 2018 or 2019 telling me exactly what I was going to have to pay them for their soybeans because of sustainable aviation fuel,” said Martin. “Here we are 5-6 years later, and we are still just talking about it. Besides soybeans, sustainable aviation fuel can also be made from used cooking oil and other feedstocks.”

Another topic related to renewable fuels is the carbon industry and the connection to agriculture and sustainability practices. “This is scary to me,” said Martin. “I can put on the grain originator hat and look at it from that perspective, but I prefer to put on the farmer hat as I shape my thoughts. We have been talking about carbon sequestration since the 90’s when I was in school and nothing has changed. We have been talking about no-till and cover crop farming for years. There are a lot more people that no-till, especially soybeans, now than ever did before, and it’s great. It’s great for soil. It’s great for our Earth in general. But these are not new practices or conversations. The problem with the carbon industry as it sits right now, is we are trying to assign values of who is farming better or farming worse based on their carbon capture. This all comes back to data, and that is what scares me. Suddenly, every single scrap of data that goes into your farming of a crop in a field is going to need to be captured, and it’s going to have to be given to somebody, most likely your grain buyer. They are going to have your field shape file and will need to have data on every single pass that you made across that field. They are going to need access to your yields, and access to all sorts of things.”

“If this part comes to fruition, then you have to deal with data audits,” said Martin. “The party that has that data is going to get audited. If you get a 45Z tax credit, or if you get some kind of carbon kickback, then you are opening yourself up to be audited.”

Harkening back to his 5th grade weather days, Martin is often asked to look ahead to what the coming growing season has in store. “When we look at long term weather, we look at patterns,” said Martin. “What I have found is the times that we have come out of an exceptionally dry fall, like what we just did, I looked at 6 years or similar patterns, and I ended up with four of those years leading us to a dryer spring, one of them was super wet, and one was normal.”

“It is worth stating, that it has never been any dryer over a 5 month stretch, August through December, than what we put together last year,” said Martin. “We cannot just come into 2025 and say, 2025 looks a lot like 2008. We can’t say that, but what I can say is that I don’t have a huge concern about planting progress getting delayed this year. I don’t think we’re looking at a scenario where we get into late May, and we are only 40% planted. I think we are better than that this year. I also think that we are going to be seeing a mild year again for spring. We dealt with a bit of a cold snap as we went through that week of Valentine’s. Overall, temperatures will be trying to move up and stay about two to five degrees above normal as we get started into March. With that in my mind, we probably are looking at some early plant opportunities, especially given the not super wet status of the soil. I’m not going to say dry. However, I don’t think that we are as far in a drought scenario as many folks think we are. I think planting looks O.K.”

“I am concerned when it comes to the summer dry period again,” said Martin. “Over the last 4-5 years we have not seen a consistent, steady, timely rainfall. We have really spread these things out. If you look at it in the realm of what normally happens in May, June and July, we have hit the averages each month, just not as we would like to. It seems to be happening more and more each year, when it is so dry, but then for the month it is recorded as normal rainfall because we got it all in one event and then we are dry again for a while and then get another big one. That’s something that I fear is going to continue in 2025.”",https://ocj.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/future-of-agriculture-article-revised.png,N,,2025-03-09 16:50:27.282456

Călin Georgescu, the far-right, Russia-friendly politician who surprisingly emerged as the first-round winner of last year’s annulled presidential elections, officially submitted his candidacy for the repeat presidential election on Friday, March 7.

BEC's rejection can still be overturned. According to the presidential election calendar, the registration or rejection of candidacies takes place within a maximum of 48 hours from the submission of the candidacy, but no later than March 17. Parties and candidates can appeal to the Constitutional Court regarding the registration or rejection of candidacies by March 18. The Constitutional Court resolves appeals through final decisions, which are immediately communicated to the Central Electoral Bureau and published in the Official Gazette.

“A direct blow to the heart of democracy worldwide! I have one message left! If democracy in Romania falls, the entire democratic world will fall! This is just the beginning. It’s that simple! Europe is now a dictatorship, Romania is under tyranny!” said the pro-Russian politician on X after the decision.

The post is in English and may signal Georgescu's intention to gain support from outside Romania, particularly the Trump administration and Elon Musk. The latter posted several messages in support of the pro-Russian candidate, despite never showing any interest in or knowledge of Romanian politics.

Several supporters of candidate Călin Georgescu gathered in front of the BEC headquarters and forced the barriers installed by the gendarmes in protest. Security forces intervened, removed the protesters with tear gas, and reinstalled the protective barriers. One gendarme, however, was hit with a blunt object by the protesters.

According to a BEC statement, the candidacies of two other independents, Maria Marcu and Ion Popa, were also rejected. However, the registration of Bucharest mayor Nicușor Dan as a candidate was approved.

Leaders of far-right opposition parties, such as AUR president George Simion and POT leader Ana-Maria Gavrila, protested Georgescu’s rejection. Both parties had gathered signatures in support of the pro-Russian candidate.

Meanwhile, Călin Georgescu is facing a criminal probe, being investigated under judicial supervision. On February 26, the General Prosecutor's Office announced that legal proceedings had been initiated against him for multiple offenses, including incitement to actions against constitutional order, spreading false information, falsifying financial disclosure statements regarding campaign funding, initiating or supporting fascist, racist, or xenophobic organizations, and publicly promoting the cult of individuals convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

According to a recent poll, Georgescu remains the favourite in the presidential elections, followed by the ruling coalition's candidate, Crin Antonescu, and Bucharest mayor Nicușor Dan.

BITE-SIZED UPDATES FROM AROUND THE WORLD

INTERNATIONAL

UK-Japan offshore tie-up – The UK and Japan have struck a memorandum of cooperation for offshore wind energy development, the UK announced on Friday. The deal was agreed between the UK’s Department for Business and Trade and Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. It builds on workshops the two sides have held on offshore wind, as well as ongoing collaboration on floating offshore wind technology development, technology standardisation, and supply chain development. Now, the two governments plan to exchange policy experiences and best practices, encourage the build-up of sustainable supply chain capabilities, support bilateral investment between the two countries, and encourage business-led initiatives.

EMEA

For sale – Five bidders have submitted non-binding offers for a minority stake in Eni’s carbon capture and storage (CCS) business, Reuters reported, citing two sources. The suitors include financial investors GIP, HitecVision, and Macquarie, alongside industrial players Snam and Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production Public Company. Eni plans to sell up to 49% of its CCS unit to fund growth, with investor talks set to intensify in the coming months.

State aid – The EU Commission has approved a €279 mln Czech scheme to support investments in electricity storage facilities to foster the transition towards a net-zero economy. The purpose is to reduce the reliance of Czechia’s electricity system on fossil fuels imports and at facilitating a smooth integration of renewable energy sources in the energy mix. Under the scheme, the aid, fully financed through the Modernisation Fund, will take the form of direct grants, to support the construction of at least 1,500 MWh of new electricity storage capacities. The measure will be open to all storage technologies directly connected to the transmission network or distribution network.

Funding cuts – The UK Treasury is drawing up plans to cut the funding for GB Energy in June’s spending review, the FT reports. The Labour government set up GB Energy as a publicly-owned company to invest in clean energy and accelerate grid decarbonisation, initially pledging it £8.3 bln in taxpayer money over the five-year parliament. But the organisation was only given an initial £100 mln in October’s budget for the first two years, and now ministers are reconsidering whether they can afford the full £8.3 bln, amid mounting pressure on government finances and defence spending. Some of the funds previously set aside for GB Energy may now go towards funding low-interest loans for rooftop solar and shared-ownership wind projects. Questions also exist over whether a previous pledge will be met to provide £13.2 bln for energy efficiency schemes over this parliament.

NO CBAM – The Norwegian government aims to introduce a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) from 2027. CBAM, also adopted by the EU, applies carbon pricing to imported goods such as electricity, cement, aluminium, iron and steel, hydrogen, and fertilisers to prevent carbon leakage and encourage emissions reductions in third countries. Norway plans to align with the EU regulation, with CBAM declarations expected to begin in 2026 before full implementation in 2027. The EU has recently proposed simplifying the regulation and may expand it to cover more goods. Norway’s Climate and Environment Minister Andreas Bjelland Eriksen said this week that the CBAM will ensure a uniform carbon price for goods produced in Norway, the EU, or imported from other countries, benefiting Norwegian industry and jobs. The Norwegian government decided last autumn to implement a CBAM, with the Ministry of Climate and Environment and the Norwegian Environment Agency (Miljodirektoratet) overseeing its introduction. Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg said CBAM could help maintain Norwegian industry’s competitiveness while incentivising emissions reductions globally. The Norwegian Environment Agency will take the lead in implementing CBAM, coordinating efforts with the Tax Administration (Skatteetaten) and Customs (Tolletaten). The Tax Administration will authorise importers and collect penalties, while Customs will conduct border checks. The Ministry of Climate and Environment invites stakeholders to an information and consultation meeting on CBAM on Mar. 13.

PRA probe – Germany’s antitrust watchdog, the Federal Cartel Office (FCO), has launched an investigation into the impact of price information services provided by Argus Media and S&P Global on the oil wholesale market. This follows an initial inquiry that raised concerns about pricing transparency and competition. Price-reporting agencies (PRAs) such as S&P Global Commodity Insights (Platts) and Argus Media provide price quotations based on reported transactions, which influence wholesale procurement contracts and, indirectly, retail fuel prices. The FCO previously found that oil price quotations relied on limited data, making them susceptible to manipulation, and called for stronger regulations. FCO President Andreas Mundt stated that there were signs of structural competition disruptions in the fuel wholesale trade. In response, both Argus Media and S&P Global defended their methodologies, claiming their assessments reflect market value and promote competition. Argus emphasised that the FCO report did not allege wrongdoing, manipulation, or collusion but rather highlighted concerns about market structure and its effect on fuel prices. The investigation comes amid volatility in European fuel prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the EU’s subsequent ban on Russian refined petroleum products in early 2023. The FCO will use new regulatory powers introduced in 2023 to determine whether significant competition disruptions exist and, if confirmed, address their root causes. Both PRAs have pledged to cooperate with the investigation. (Reuters)

ASIA PACIFIC

Pakistani pushback – Pakistan is resisting the IMF’s proposal to impose a carbon levy on petroleum products, coal, and internal combustion engine (ICE) cars, aimed at discouraging fossil fuel use. The IMF suggested raising the petroleum levy from Rs60 ($0.21) to Rs70 ($0.25) per litre over three years, starting with an initial Rs3 increase. The additional revenue would support green energy initiatives. During discussions on Friday, Pakistani officials expressed concerns over fund allocation and jurisdictional issues, particularly regarding coal, which falls under provincial authority. Unlike taxes shared with provinces, levy collections remain outside the distributable pool, though half of a carbon levy’s revenue would be allocated to provinces. The IMF has also recommended increasing federal excise duty on ICE cars as a form of carbon levy, a proposal supported by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Cars in Pakistan already face high taxation, accounting for 36% to 45% of their total price. The carbon levy was previously discussed during negotiations for the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), from which Pakistan seeks over $1 bln. Disbursements from this facility will be tied to actual climate-related spending. The government estimates that 10% of Pakistan’s carbon emissions come from transport, necessitating substantial investment in cleaner vehicle alternatives. A five-year New-Energy Vehicles (NEVs) policy is being developed, estimating at least Rs155 bln in additional funding by 2030 for the transition. Pakistan’s transport sector consumes 80% of imported oil, and shifting to cleaner vehicles could save foreign exchange reserves. However, the transition is costly, requiring subsidies, tax incentives, and infrastructure development. The IMF suggests using revenue from the carbon levy to subsidise electric two- and three-wheelers, which remain significantly more expensive than traditional models. The government aims for 90% of new two- and three-wheeler purchases and 30% of four-wheelers to be based on renewable energy by 2030. It is also planning National Vehicle Emissions Efficiency Standards to encourage more efficient vehicles. The World Bank also supports the idea of a carbon tax, highlighting Pakistan’s reliance on costly energy imports as a factor in its fiscal challenges. Meanwhile, Pakistan recently secured a $1.2 bln deferred payment oil deal with Saudi Arabia to manage its balance of payments. (Express Tribune)

Gas collab – Australian Woodside Energy and US service firm Baker Hughes will develop a joint initiative to, they said, “develop a lower carbon power generation technology solution” which will use technology from the New York Stock Exchange-listed Net Power designed with the oil and gas industry in mind. The power platform uses gas as power but captures the resulting CO2 emissions. The two plan to bring in other partners at a later date.

Orica on demand – Australia’s Orica, a chemicals and explosives manufacturer, has announced after-tax write-downs of up to A$350 mln ($220 mln) due to impairments and restructuring in its Latin American and EMEA businesses. This will reduce its first-half statutory net profit by A$300-350 mln, primarily from A$290-335 mln in Latin America and A$10-15 mln in EMEA. Despite this, Orica expects stronger-than-anticipated earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the first half, with momentum expected to continue. Separately, Orica announced that it has installed emissions-reducing technology at its Kooragang Island chemicals site in Australia, cutting emissions by 1 Mt. The site, which produces ammonia, nitric acid, and ammonium nitrate, previously released N2O into the atmosphere. The newly implemented EnviNOx process, developed by thyssenkrupp Uhde, converts over 99% of N2O into harmless nitrogen and oxygen. The Kooragang Island site’s emissions have been reduced by 567,000 tonnes of CO2e annually, cutting its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 48%. A similar installation at Orica’s Yarwun plant has reduced emissions by 50%, saving around 200,000 tonnes of CO2e per year. The project, supported by A$13 mln from the New South Wales government and A$25 mln from Orica via green investment financing, earns Australian carbon credits for each tonne of emissions avoided.

Clearing the way – Japan’s Cabinet has approved a bill amending the law on marine renewable energy to expand offshore wind projects into the country’s exclusive economic zone, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry. The amendment aims to support Japan’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and grants the government authority to conduct environmental surveys before issuing permits for offshore renewable projects. It also establishes a system for designating development zones and granting provisional status to project developers. Japan targets 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 and up to 45 GW by 2040.

Partners – The Nishiaizu Town Forestry Association, Toho Bank, and project developer Bywill have signed a partnership agreement aimed at achieving carbon neutrality and ensuring the sustainable management of forests for future generations. Under the agreement, Bywill will handle the application process for J-Credit generation from forests managed by the Nishiaizu Town Forestry Association. Toho Bank and Bywill will work together to find buyers for these credits, helping to promote regional decarbonisation and forest conservation. The initiative aligns with Nishiaizu’s efforts to maintain sustainable forestry, particularly following its post-earthquake forest restoration efforts. It builds on an earlier collaboration between Bywill and Toho Bank, which introduced Bywill to the forestry cooperative. The three parties said they will enhance cooperation by sharing information on environmental values and expanding initiatives supporting carbon neutrality and a circular economy. The revenue from J-Credits will help fund forest conservation and the broader goal of passing down healthy forests to future generations.

Tax me later – Indonesia recently sought France’s support for a technology transfer deal to help green its industries ahead of the EU’s incoming carbon border tax on imports such as fertilisers and aluminium. Coordinating Minister Airlangga urged France to conclude the long-delayed Indonesia-EU trade pact, citing benefits for exports and investment, according to a press release from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. He also pushed for cooperation on hydrogen technology and green financing under the Just Energy Transition Partnership to aid Indonesia’s industrial transition. The I-EU CEPA talks have dragged through 19 rounds over nine years amid rising global trade protectionism.

Fryer to flyer – Cosmo Energy Holdings will launch Japan’s first domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production in April at its Sakai refinery, using used cooking oil, Reuters reported. The refiner aims to supply 300,000 kilolitres of SAF annually by 2030 through domestic production and imports, meeting 10% of its jet fuel sales. It plans to produce 30,000 kl at Sakai, expand output at Sakaide by 2029, and import from Thailand’s Bangchak and others. Japan targets 1.7 mln kl of SAF by 2030.

Sustainability platform – Malaysian project developer Karbon Hero has launched a platform Sustainability AI, designed to help businesses better understand and improve their sustainability reports. Powered by Google’s Cloud AI and machine learning solutions, the AHMAD.02 Model analyses corporate sustainability reports and provides companies with clear insights on how to improve and achieve compliance with sustainability frameworks. This will empower corporations, governments, and other organisations to accelerate their sustainability goals, the developer said in a statement.

AMERICAS

Domain denied – Gov. Larry Rhoden (R) signed HB 1052 into law today, prohibiting the use of eminent domain for CO2 pipeline projects in South Dakota. In a letter explaining his decision, Rhoden emphasised that the legislation does not halt proposed projects but aims to encourage voluntary easements, rebuild trust, and foster productive discussions between developers and landowners.

Ahoy, truckers – The Trump administration is reported to have stalled a $1 bln initiative aimed at electrifying trucking at the Port of Los Angeles, which was intended to reduce diesel pollution and improve air quality, E&E News said. The region relies heavily on diesel vehicles that contribute significantly to smog and health issues. Experts have estimated that losing EPA funding could delay the transition to electric trucks by five years, leading to increased health risks and allowing China to gain a stronger foothold in the industry.

Setting sail for cleaner seas – Royal Caribbean Group, a global cruise company, has joined the Methane Abatement in Maritime Innovation Initiative (MAMII), a cross-sector effort to reduce methane emissions in the maritime industry. Established in 2022 by Safetytech Accelerator, MAMII focuses on developing technologies to monitor, measure, and mitigate methane emissions from LNG-powered ships. Royal Caribbean joined other members, including BP, Shell, and Chevron, to support methane reduction across the sector.

Permitting power push – Several Republican lawmakers, including Representatives Crenshaw, Weber, Pfluger, and Goldman, requested that US EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin expedite the review of the Texas Railroad Commission’s (RCC) application for primary enforcement authority over Class VI underground injection control wells. In their letter last week, they stated that granting Texas this authority under the Safe Drinking Water Act would improve the permitting process for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) projects. The lawmakers cited the RRC’s regulatory experience and argued that state-level management could improve efficiency while maintaining environmental protections.

Turbine timeout – On Mar. 6, the governments of Canada and Nova Scotia announced a moratorium on offshore wind development in Georges Bank, prohibiting the issuance of submerged land licences for wind projects in the area. The decision, announced by federal Energy Minister Jonathan Wilkinson and Nova Scotia Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau, aims to protect the region’s marine ecosystem and the commercial fisheries that rely on it.

Put a number on it – The Canadian government is working with cement producer Heidelberg Materials to finalise negotiation on a contribution agreement regarding the company’s CCUS plant, the Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Industry announced this week. The announcement builds on a 2023 MoU between the Government of Canada and Heidelberg Materials to provide up to a total of C$275 mln for the company’s demonstration plant. The Canadian government has already entered into a C$49 mln contribution agreement to support the first phase of the project.

Cleaner campus – The Government of Canada announced C$1.4 mln ($974,000) in funding for McMaster University to support two clean energy projects through the Decarbonisation Incentive Program. The university will receive C$500,000 to transition two buildings from natural gas heating to air-to-water heat pumps and C$923,000 to implement reactor heat reclaiming for the AN Bourns Science Building. The projects are expected to reduce over 2,600 tonnes of GHG by 2030.

New Canadian OECM parks – Five parks have been added to Canada’s Other Effective area-based Conservation Measure (OECM). The OCEMs protect nature by recognising areas that help conserve biodiversity, even if they’re not officially protected parks or reserves, according to the federal government. Ontario’s Navy Island National Historic Site, Fort George National Historic Site, and Rideau Canal National Historic Site, alongside Quebec’s Grosse-Île and Irish Memorial National Historic Site and Alberta’s Ya Ha Tinda Ranch are now recognised for their contributions to conservation.

Chunk of change – Fuel distributors associated with the Brazilian Institute of Oil and Gas (IBP) invested around R$4 bln ($690 mln) in CBIO biofuels credits under the national RenovaBio biofuels carbon market throughout 2024, according to Brazilian paper Veja Negocios. This investment translated into more than 46 mln CBIOs acquired. For 2025, the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP) has established a preliminary goal for fuel distributors to purchase 40 mln CBIOs. A Dec. 31 law moreover imposes harsher penalties, including a maximum fine of R$500 mln, for non-compliant firms. RenovaBio has in the past faced criticism for appearing to place smaller fuel distributors, which may have more difficulty weathering CBIO volatility, at a competitive disadvantage relative to their larger peers.

VOLUNTARY

SBTi outreach – The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has partnered with Climate Action for Associations (CAFA) in an effort to provide trade associations with the tools and guidance needed to drive emissions reductions, the standard setter announced on Friday. The two sides plan to create a programme of outreach, engagement, and education with trade associations, with SBTi helping to educate associations on setting science-based targets and CAFA increasing its outreach through meetings, workshops, and webinars. The aim is to identify ways in which trade groups can engage with the SBTi.

SCIENCE & TECH

Fusion partners – The UK’s Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has partnered with Eni to jointly conduct R&D on fusion energy. The partnership will kick off with construction of the world’s largest and most advanced tritium fuel cycle facility, a vital fuel for future fusion power stations. The “UKAEA-Eni H3AT Tritium Loop Facility”, located at Culham Campus near Oxford, will be complete in 2028. Tritium recovery and re-use will play a key role in the supply and generation of the fuel in future fusion power plants and will help to make the technology efficient. The partnership combines UKAEA’s expertise in fusion R&D with Eni’s established industrial-scale capabilities in plant engineering, commissioning, and operations.

Rock on – Rockfuel has unveiled a carbon-negative cement process by way of its carbon-neutral lime kiln, which efficiently produces quicklime (calcium oxide) while capturing CO2 emissions. The renewable-powered kiln works by heating limestone to produce quicklime while collecting and storing more than 500 cubic metres of hot CO2 per cubic metre of rock in a tank, reported agg-net. The captured CO2 is then repurposed within RockFuel’s carbon-negative cement production process. And once used in construction, the cement actively absorbs CO2, the company claims. Cement production accounts for an estimated 8% of CO2 emissions globally.

AND FINALLY…

Butterfly blues – A recently published study found a 22% decline in butterfly populations across the continental US from 2000 to 2020, based on data from over 76,000 surveys. Led by researchers from Michigan State University and the US Geological Survey Powell Centre, the study analysed records of more than 12.6 mln butterflies from 35 monitoring programmes. The findings indicate widespread declines across 554 species, with 107 species losing over half their populations. Scientists warn that this trend threatens biodiversity and essential ecosystem services, including pollination and nutrient cycling. The authors stress the urgent need for conservation measures at both local and national levels to reverse the decline.

The schools were joined by 170 other participants, including representative of the many different segments of aviation and business.
Shannon Chamber president, Eoin Gain, said that the Chamber is equally passionate about aviation, particularly the role it can play in attaining balanced regional development in Ireland.
“This can be done by raising the threshold to three million passengers, as is permitted under EU legislation.
Supporting a regional airport, such as Shannon, would enable it to invest in infrastructure and technology that align with its climate change targets, ensuring that growth in air travel in the regions is sustainable,” he stated.","STUDENTS from St Caimin’s Community School in Shannon were given a taste for the high life at a sumptuous lunch in Dromoland Castle recently, along with advice that a career in the heights of aviation is well worth considering.

The school was one of four schools hosted by Shannon Chamber in Dromoland Castle Hotel, where the executive chairman of Emerald Airlines and Dublin Aerospace, Conor McCarthy, was keynote speaker, and the general counsel of High Ridge Aviation, John Ludden, was posing the questions.

The schools were joined by 170 other participants, including representative of the many different segments of aviation and business.

Mr McCarthy responded to questions on a wide range of topics such as the traits needed to be a successful aviation entrepreneur; his future plans for Emerald Airlines and Dublin Aerospace; sustainable aviation fuel and the industry’s carbon reduction commitments; and what aviation might look like in 100 years.

He said aviation is one of the most exciting industries in the world, requiring dedication, faith, and trust and, while there may be many challenges, it’s a sector that offers enormous potential to anyone with a passion and interest in it.

Commenting on his future plans and whether Shannon features in those plans, he described Shannon as “an amazing airport that has achieved so much, not just in terms of the airport but in the cluster of aviation businesses now operating from Shannon”.

Responding to a question on the cap on passengers at Dublin Airport and the ability of Shannon and Cork airports to absorb the passenger overflow, he said that it would be “an extremely short-sighted strategy to build an airport on the back of another airport’s inability to cope in the short-term”.

“Shannon has amazing strengths, with great tourism products and

experiences on its doorstep. It has the capacity to drive its own future and should focus on this to continue to build on its success.” he stated.

He said that while the company has no plans to fly out of

Shannon, should an opportunity arise in the future to consider a poorly served airport in the UK, it would not be ruled out.

Shannon Chamber president, Eoin Gain, said that the Chamber is equally passionate about aviation, particularly the role it can play in attaining balanced regional development in Ireland.

He noted Shannon Airports critical link to economic activity and growth in the Mid West, and said the Chamber will “continue to call on the government to undertake a review of national aviation policy, and to permanently include Shannon Airport in the Regional Airports Programme”.

“This can be done by raising the threshold to three million passengers, as is permitted under EU legislation. Supporting a regional airport, such as Shannon, would enable it to invest in infrastructure and technology that align with its climate change targets, ensuring that growth in air travel in the regions is sustainable,” he stated.",https://www.limerickpost.ie/site/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/11022025_Shannon_Chamber_Conor_McCarthy_Dromoland_0768-captioned-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-09 11:50:35.921464

As we strive toward decarbonizing multiple sectors, aviation is one of the most challenging industries to decarbonize, also known as a sector that is hard to abate. In 2023, aviation was responsible for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, growing faster between 2000 and 2019 than rail, road, or shipping, totaling almost 950 million metric tons of CO2. The aviation industry’s rapid growth in the face of increasing demand, along with the limitations of current technological advancements, means that its emissions continue to rise. Despite new aircraft being up to 20% more efficient than their predecessors, the sector’s growth consistently outpaces these improvements. Decarbonizing aviation to meet global climate goals requires stakeholders to significantly ramp up the adoption of low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), improve airframe and engine design, optimize operational efficiencies, and even explore demand restraint solutions [i].

Concentrating on technical solutions and given that retrofitting airplanes to run on electricity or batteries seems far from feasible in the near future, the quest for alternative fuels is essential. Key measures must be prioritized when seeking viable alternative/sustainable aviation fuels. High energy density can help meet lightweight requirements for aviation fuel and reduce refueling constraints for long air travel [ii]​. Engine and infrastructure compatibility can help ensure alternative fuels can blend with conventional jet fuel for widespread adoption. Lower emissions could allow SAFs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% [iii]. At the same time, flexibility could allow diverse feedstocks and production technologies to operate on the aviation fuel space [iv]; while safety [v] and cost-effectiveness are other pressing priorities [vi].​ Lastly, the availability and scalability of SAF fuels will be critical for a sector-wide change [vii].

Various production routes are being explored as the search for alternative fuels continues. These routes include the reverse water–gas shift, Fischer–Tropsch (RWGS-FT), methanol, and CO2 electrolysis routes. Each method utilizes intermediate compounds like syngas, methanol, and ethylene. Research indicates that the methanol route holds promise due to its relatively low energy intensity and high CO2 efficiency, achieving up to 92% CO2 efficiency when including recycle streams. The CO2 electrolysis route, while promising near 100% CO2 efficiency, faces significant challenges due to its high energy demands [viii].

Although these routes show promising potential, the journey towards sustainable aviation fuels is far from complete. There is still much to innovate and optimize, and each step forward requires collaboration between governments, industries, and researchers. Several members of the Green Chemistry for Sustainability network are helping lead innovation in this space.

Twelve, Air Company, and Infinium Holdings, Inc. are each developing SAF technologies. Twelve is developing CO₂ electrolysis-based fuels. Air Company is innovating in this space as well, using a non-toxic, non-rare Earth minerals catalysts for its CO₂ electrolysis based fuels, now working on scaling and looking at SAF applications. Infinium Holdings is innovating with three fuel types. The eSMR Reform™ solution uses electrification instead of gas-fired heat for steam methane reforming (SMR). The Synthesize™ system converts syngas into fuels and chemicals using a proprietary catalytic process reactor technology, and their proprietary catalytic. Finally, the React Syngas Solution turns CO₂ and green or blue hydrogen into low-carbon syngas.

The future of aviation will rely heavily on the development of these types of innovative SAFs that can meet the performance demands of flight and contribute to a more sustainable world. The potential for this sector to meet global emissions reduction targets is vast—but only if we continue to push the boundaries of innovation.

JetZero, a California-based company, is on a mission to develop a revolutionary blended-wing-body (BWB) aircraft that promises to slash fuel consumption, curb emissions, and quiet the roar of jet engines.

Unlike traditional aircraft, which have distinct cylindrical fuselages and protruding wings, BWB designs merge the two into a seamless, aerodynamic structure. The result? Reduced drag, greater fuel efficiency, and a significant step toward decarbonizing air travel.

While Delta isn’t injecting direct funding into JetZero, the airline offers something just as valuable—its vast operational expertise. Through its Sustainable Skies Lab incubator, Delta’s engineers will provide critical insights to support the design, development, and eventual test flight of JetZero’s demonstrator aircraft, targeted for 2027.

This collaboration aligns with Delta’s more significant environmental commitments. In 2020, the airline pledged $1 billion toward sustainability initiatives, aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Two years later, Delta refined its mission, shifting focus from neutrality to full-scale decarbonization.

The advantages of BWB aircraft extend far beyond aesthetics. JetZero asserts that its cutting-edge design could cut emissions by up to 50%—all while utilizing existing engine technology and fuel infrastructure. The secret lies in its physics:

✔️ Less drag – A sleek, continuous body eliminates many inefficiencies in tube-and-wing airframes.

✔️ More lift, less weight – A broader surface area means improved lift distribution, allowing for a lighter airframe.

✔️ Quieter flights – With engines mounted on top rather than underneath, noise pollution is dramatically reduced.

Founded in 2021, JetZero envisions a next-generation 250-passenger aircraft comparable to midrange international jets. The startup has already secured a $235 million grant from the U.S. Air Force, teaming up with Northrop Grumman and Scaled Composites to construct and test the full-scale demonstrator.

Despite its promise, the BWB concept faces formidable hurdles. Emergency evacuations remain a concern—without the standard tube-and-row layout, ensuring quick and safe exits could be complex. Additionally, seating in a theatre-style arrangement may limit the number and placement of exit doors, raising regulatory questions.

While aerospace giants like Boeing, Airbus, and NASA have all experimented with BWB prototypes, none have successfully reached production. FAA certification remains a wild card, with regulatory unknowns looming over the aircraft’s future.

But Delta believes JetZero’s design presents a solution “within reach.”

“Working with JetZero to realize an entirely new airframe and experience for customers and employees is bold and important work to advance the airline industry’s fuel-saving initiatives and innovation goals,” said Amelia DeLuca, Delta’s chief sustainability officer, in a statement.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_32eebc5830a346f2bc1905d76fc3b40a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_815,h_503,al_c,lg_1,q_85/becc64_32eebc5830a346f2bc1905d76fc3b40a~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-03-09 11:50:51.118532

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a renewable alternative to traditional jet fuel, produced from sources such as biomass, waste oils, municipal waste, and even carbon capture. SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional aviation fuel, making it a key component in decarbonizing the aviation industry. Read on to learn more about sustainable aviation fuel investment in 2025.

A Brief History of SAF

The concept of biofuels for aviation has been around since the early 2000s, with test flights using bio-based fuels as early as 2008. Over the past decade, airline commitments and government incentives have accelerated SAF adoption. In 2021, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) set a goal for the aviation industry to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, with SAF expected to account for 65% of the reduction. Today, major airlines, fuel producers, and governments are investing heavily in SAF production and infrastructure.

Why Invest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in 2025?

Regulatory support and incentives – Governments worldwide are introducing tax credits, carbon pricing mechanisms, and blending mandates to boost SAF production.

Growing airline demand – Carriers such as United Airlines, Delta, and British Airways have signed long-term SAF supply agreements.

Technological advancements – New processes, including power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels and waste-to-fuel conversions, are making SAF production more scalable and cost-effective.

Carbon reduction commitments – Global climate targets are forcing airlines to integrate SAF into their fuel supply chains, driving long-term demand growth.

Key Investment Opportunities in SAF

The rapid expansion of the SAF sector has created compelling investment opportunities in companies developing innovative biofuel technologies and scaling production. Several key players are at the forefront of this transition, securing significant funding, government support, and airline partnerships to accelerate SAF adoption. Below are some of the most promising companies driving the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

Twelve

Twelve has pioneered a process that converts carbon dioxide, water, and renewable electricity into eFuels, including jet fuel. The company recently secured $645 million in funding from investors such as TPG and Alaska Airlines, reaching a valuation of over $1 billion.

Gevo

Gevo specializes in producing cleaner jet fuel from renewable sources and received a $1.46 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy to construct a facility in South Dakota. The plant is set to produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually.

Calumet

Expanding its Montana facility, Calumet secured a $1.44 billion loan to boost production capacity to 300 million gallons of SAF per year, reinforcing its position in the biofuels market.

These companies represent some of the most promising investments in the SAF sector, each leveraging unique technologies and strategic partnerships to scale production. As demand for sustainable aviation fuel continues to rise, early investors in SAF production and infrastructure could benefit from long-term growth, supported by airline commitments, government incentives, and advancements in fuel technology. However, market conditions, policy changes, and technological developments will continue to shape the landscape, making it essential for investors to stay informed.

Key Considerations for SAF Investors

While the SAF market presents significant growth potential, investors should carefully evaluate the factors that could impact profitability and long-term viability. Government policies, market dynamics, and technological advancements all play a critical role in shaping the industry. Understanding these key considerations will help investors make informed decisions and navigate potential risks.

Government Policies and Regulatory Impact

The biofuel industry is heavily influenced by policy incentives such as tax credits and low-carbon fuel standards. For instance, the Pine Bend Refinery in Minnesota plans to produce 1 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2025, but this hinges on continued government support. Investors should monitor potential policy shifts that could impact profitability.

Market Dynamics and Competitive Pressures

Regional supply and demand fluctuations can influence returns. In Canada, for example, an influx of U.S. renewable diesel imports has reduced domestic producer margins, demonstrating the importance of understanding regional and global market conditions.

Technological Innovations and Future Scalability

Advancements in waste-to-biofuel technology are expanding SAF production capabilities. Companies like Enerkem are developing facilities that convert biomass and non-recyclable materials into biofuels. Enerkem’s Varennes Carbon Recycling plant in Quebec, expected to be operational in 2025, will produce 125,000 tonnes of biofuels annually from 200,000 tonnes of waste.

Investing in SAF requires a strategic approach that takes into account policy shifts, market fluctuations, and emerging technologies. While government incentives and airline commitments are driving demand, challenges such as regulatory changes and supply chain disruptions could impact returns. By staying informed and monitoring industry trends, investors can position themselves to capitalize on the growing SAF market while mitigating potential risks.

Looking Forward: Sustainable Aviation Fuel Investments in 2025

Investing in SAF and biofuels presents a compelling opportunity in 2025, with Twelve, Gevo, and Calumet leading the charge. Government support and technological innovation continue to drive growth, but investors should remain vigilant about policy shifts, market fluctuations, and evolving competitive landscapes to make informed decisions.

We are five years into the critical decade in the fight against climate change and the fashion industry’s impact on the environment is growing.

Worldwide the fashion industry is responsible for 2%-8% of global greenhouse gasses, the United Nations reports, and last year the fashion sector emitted around 959 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents, Statista states. This is forecast to rise to more than 1.2 billion metric tonnes by 2030 without a concerted effort to reduce it.

As the third-largest clothing market in the world behind the US ($358.7bn/£293.2bn) and China ($328.5bn/£268.5bn), the UK plays a significant role: consumers spent $75.6bn (£61.8bn) on clothing in 2023 – up from $75.3bn (£61.6bn) in 2022.

Fashion retailers, brands and suppliers are rising to the immense challenge before them: sustainability now forms a vital part of businesses’ strategies, but as they battle increased costs and subdued consumer spend, there is a danger of it falling down the priority list. In our March issue, our conscious fashion special, we investigate how businesses are tackling a slew of new sustainability regulations, reducing the carbon footprint of their supply chains and adapting their strategies to build a responsible future, despite the wider economic headwinds.

Retailers are grappling to comply with a growing list of sustainability regulations. Three incoming European Union-wide regulations are the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). Conforming to these – whether sooner or later – will be unavoidable for retailers and suppliers that trade in or with the bloc.

With this, and more, regulation coming in, retailers need to focus on improving supply chain traceability and data gathering as first steps. The UK is also expected to develop regulations that many in the industry hope will help level the playing field with the EU. As retailers put plans in place, some see upsides in greater transparency, but many say that more guidance and support is urgently needed from the government.

Freight and supply chain is another pain point for businesses aiming to reduce their carbon footprint as the methods retailers select to get their goods to, from and around the UK has huge implications for the environment. Shipping emits 10-40 grammes of carbon per metric tonne per kilometre, while air freight produces 500 grammes and is considerably more expensive. However, sometimes retailers have little choice: the Red Sea attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels from Yemen, which began in November 2023, have hit fashion retailers far and wide, including Matalan, Boohoo Group, Asos and Shoe Zone, causing many to switch to longer sea routes or air freight.

Despite rising costs, retailers are focused on working with partners to reduce carbon emissions and extending lead times to provide greater wriggle room in the face of disruptions. John Lewis, Primark and Marks & Spencer are among those investing in “greener” fuels for road fleets, while sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is an emerging technology for shipments that have to come by air.

While a sharp increase in defence spending has won the Government political capital, few people have asked what it hopes to buy with the money.
The Government is acting as if reaching a spending target is a worthy achievement in itself.
On current trends, the extra 0.2 per cent of GDP that will take us to the 2.5 per cent target in 2027 equates to £6 billion.
As Healey pointed out in his dossier, the waste he identified in the MoD budget for 2019-20 alone would have paid for 79 extra tanks.","Even Labour's pacifists and nuclear disarmers have been mostly silent over Sir Keir Starmer's promise to boost Britain's defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 and to three per cent at some point in the next Parliament.

Russian aggression in Ukraine and Trump's seeming capitulation to Putin has meant that pacifism has gone out of fashion, with near universal agreement that the Armed Forces must now be rebuilt.

But does anyone really have confidence that the extra billions will be wisely spent? Not Defence Secretary John Healey, surely.

Speaking at the Institute for Government last month, he lamented that 'defence is mired in process and procedure', explaining: 'In procurement, we've got a situation where we employ 11 checkers for every one decision-maker, so no wonder it takes on average six years for a large programme simply to get onto contract.'

Three years ago, when he was shadowing his current post, he published a dossier exposing what he claimed to be £13 billion worth of waste by the MoD between 2010 and 2021.

He said that this 'uniquely failing department' had overspent £1 billion on four Astute nuclear submarines and a further £1 billion on a nuclear warhead assembly and disassembly plant near Reading.

Citing National Audit Office reports, he pointed out that the MoD had written off £595 million on a cancelled project to modernise and extend the life of 1980s Warrior armoured vehicles, managed to lose £21 million selling a mine hunter ship to Lithuania and wasted £4 million on an abandoned IT project.

It had even blown £5.7 million buying ear plugs, which turned out to be useless on the battlefield.

To his credit, Healey is clearly aware of the wastage, but it is far from clear what plans, if any, he has up his sleeve to ensure that the extra billions earmarked for the MoD do not similarly vanish down the plughole.

While a sharp increase in defence spending has won the Government political capital, few people have asked what it hopes to buy with the money.

Will it focus on more tanks, more aircraft, more submarines, more personnel? Is there going to be money for defending ourselves against cyber warfare? So far, there have been few answers.

The Government is acting as if reaching a spending target is a worthy achievement in itself. But by this thinking, there is no better way to ensure that money is wasted.

David Cameron's Coalition Government proved that when it set out to spend 0.7 per cent of UK GDP on international aid, a target that was supposed to boost our soft power. Soft in the head, more like.

It didn't take long before examples began to emerge of how the extra billions were being frittered – such as £13 million supporting a pop band called Yegna, otherwise known as the Ethiopian Spice Girls, who were supposed to be boosting women's rights in developing countries.

Charged with ensuring that the 0.7 per cent target was reached, civil servants in the now-defunct Department for International Development ended up shovelling money out of the door on whatever daft projects were dangled before them.

Similarly, there will be no shortage of snouts in the trough as the defence budget is increased.

On current trends, the extra 0.2 per cent of GDP that will take us to the 2.5 per cent target in 2027 equates to £6 billion.

That is a substantial sum, yet one that could easily be soaked up by a few pet projects that do little or nothing to keep the country safe.

There is, for example, the RAF's efforts to reach Net Zero by 2040. Why does the air force feel it necessary to eliminate its carbon emissions in just 15 years' time – a decade ahead of Britain's overall, reckless target to reach Net Zero by 2050? It is certainly spending many millions on the project.

The RAF boasts a Guinness World Record for the world's first light aircraft flight using only synthetic fuel, manufactured from hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

That was in 2021. Two years later, it started trials fuelling transport planes with a mixture of 50 per cent ordinary jet fuel and 50 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

It is racing ahead of the airline industry's own efforts to reduce its carbon emissions.

The MoD's annual report doesn't reveal how much the RAF is spending on this noble-sounding exercise, but according to Johnson Matthey – a UK chemical company which manufactures SAF – such fuels cost between two and seven times as much as ordinary jet fuel.

Given that the Armed Forces spent a combined £445 million on fuel in 2023-24, it could end up costing well over an extra billion pounds a year if all our defence equipment was to run on sustainable fuels.

A House of Commons defence committee report in 2023 revealed that the Army had already spent £14 million on 'battlefield electrification' and had committed itself to spend a further £13 million on the cause.

It seems to mean building hybrid tanks and armoured vehicles rather than outright electric ones.

I am sure they are terribly clever, but still you wonder at the wisdom of it. Is, for example, the Army going to have stop an advance in order to recharge its tanks?

The US army has already experimented with a hybrid tank, which has ended up being the heaviest in the world, due to the weight of the battery.

The performance of the few that were sent to Ukraine was mixed, with some getting bogged down in mud and unable to cross bridges. Easy pickings for the Russians, who destroyed two-thirds of them.

Maybe synthetic fuels are the future and there is a case for the UK Government investing in their development. But why are our Armed Forces the guinea pigs for this research, and why is it being financed out of the defence budget?

The Government is effectively plundering money set aside for tanks, guns and soldiers to further its broader policy of tackling climate change. One thing is for sure: you can bet that Putin isn't diverting his military budget to Net Zero projects.

There is another voracious beast sure to poke its snout deeper into the MoD's trough: the equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) industry.

While Donald Trump has freed the US military – along with other federal departments – from having to bear of the cost of a battalion of EDI officials, the UK military has no such luck.

Just last week, the MoD was advertising for a 'diversity and inclusion learning and development professional' on a salary of £38,790, plus an extra 28 per cent in pension contributions.

A Freedom of Information request revealed that the MoD spent £2 million in 2023 on the salaries of EDI staff, more than double what it was spending four years earlier.

There is no greater danger in politics, the late Chancellor Lord (Nigel) Lawson once warned, than when a consensus emerges. It ensures that tricky issues are no longer debated, governments are not properly challenged. That is what we have at the moment.

There is widespread support for increasing the defence budget, but that shouldn't be allowed to detract from the need to ensure value for money.

As Healey pointed out in his dossier, the waste he identified in the MoD budget for 2019-20 alone would have paid for 79 extra tanks.

Without better procurement and a keener focus on what is important, there is no guarantee that an extra £6 billion will buy us more effective forces.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/08/22/95990403-0-image-a-93_1741471975932.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 21:50:09.267476

Without intervention that share will be 27 per cent by 2040 and aviation will be the nation’s top polluter.
There’s only one plant in the UK and its 50-million-litre output represents less than 0.5 per cent of the aviation fuel required this year.
Alternatively, the government could charge duty on fossil fuel — as crazy as it seems, Jet A-1 fuel is tax free.
The ICCT study concludes that 81 per cent of FFL revenues would come from this cohort.","That’s exactly the reaction that the Climate Change Committee (CCC) is seeking. The statutory body, established to advise the government on emissions reductions, now believes that the introduction of an incremental tax targeting those who fly the most is one of the best ways for aviation to achieve net zero by 2050.

In its Seventh Carbon Budget, published last month, the CCC says that “the cost of decarbonising aviation should be reflected in the cost to fly”, and while no nation has yet imposed an FFL, a model proposed by researchers at the London School of Economics offers an idea of what we can expect.

Your first flight in any year would be exempt from the levy and your second flight would incur an FFL of, say, £50 per tonne of CO₂ emitted. So if that second flight of the year was an economy return to Marrakesh, for example, emitting 0.86 tonnes of CO₂, you would expect to pay an FFL of £43 in addition to the airfare — adding £172 to the bill for a family of four, but not dissimilar to a voluntary offsetting fee.

For your third flight in any 12-month period you’d pay £100 per tonne — adding, for example, £1,100 to the cost of a business-class return to Cape Town, rated at 11.1 tonnes. Your fourth flight would be chargeable at £150 per tonne, and so on.

While previous administrations have acted upon much of the CCC’s advice, there is no obligation to do so. This is a proposal, and there’s no indication for when this could be introduced. But the recommendations could herald the dawn of a long-dreaded day of reckoning for the airline industry.

Aviation is now the sixth worst UK offender in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions after road transport, construction, industry, agriculture and electricity supply. But while those sectors are decarbonising fast, airlines remain dependent on fossil fuels.

• How to book holidays like a travel expert

At present flying accounts for 8 per cent of total emissions. Without intervention that share will be 27 per cent by 2040 and aviation will be the nation’s top polluter. For a government that launched the Jet Zero strategy in January — committing to reduce aviation emissions to net zero by 2050 — then embarked on an airport expansion spree in the naive belief that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a magic potion allowing growth at no environmental cost, this is more than a bit awkward. It shows just how far Labour’s view of the airline industry is from reality.

The snake-oil promises that technology would provide a painless transition to zero-carbon travel are unravelling fast, and now the CCC is saying what scientists and analysts already knew: that “managing forecast demand growth” — that is, putting us off flying — is now the most effective way of keeping a lid on spiralling emissions.

That’s because SAF is nothing like the “game changer” that the chancellor has told us it is. First, jet fuel made from biomass, recycled chip oil or electrolysed CO₂ is not emission free. Yes, the manufacturing process involves reduced greenhouse gas, but when it’s burnt in a jet engine SAF releases climate-changing carbon into the atmosphere just like fossil fuels.

Second, a Norwegian study shows that SAF will account for only 12 per cent of global aviation demand by 2050, so it can only supplement rather than replace kerosene. The UK government, though, expects biofuels to comprise 22 per cent of what’s in the tank by 2040, and if that target is reached overall emissions could drop by 16 per cent based on 2024 levels. But according to the CCC, passenger traffic will be up by the same amount by then, so net emissions will remain the same — and 78 per cent of them will still be from fossil fuels.

Third, growing feedstock for biofuels takes land away from food production. Ploughing up new areas to grow food crops releases stored carbon, and a 2021 study by the International Council on Clean Transportation concludes that these emissions “undermine any greenhouse-gas savings from these fuels”.

• British Airways frequent flyer scheme changes: everything you need to know

As for all-electric flights, trials will begin within five years, using light aircraft on multiple-stop, short-haul routes. Battery-powered long-haul is at least a generation away.

In the meantime, beating us away from airports with a blunt financial instrument seems to be the best way to reduce emissions, although the CCC offers four options.

Airlines could be told to invest more in SAF production. There’s only one plant in the UK and its 50-million-litre output represents less than 0.5 per cent of the aviation fuel required this year. If airlines can’t find enough SAF to meet government requirements they face fines of £4.70 per litre for any shortfall.

Alternatively, the government could charge duty on fossil fuel — as crazy as it seems, Jet A-1 fuel is tax free. Air-passenger duty could be also increased to the point of deterrence. But all the above mean higher prices for all flyers, regardless of how many flights we take per year.

The FFL is the fourth option, and even the fiercest defenders of gold-card status would be hard-pressed to disagree that this scheme is the most just. The UK Civil Aviation Authority estimates that only 51 per cent of the country’s population flies in any year and 59 per cent of those passengers take three flights or fewer a year.

Internationally, research by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) notes that the 2 per cent who take more than six overseas flights a year are responsible for 40 per cent of emissions. The ICCT study concludes that 81 per cent of FFL revenues would come from this cohort.

So it seems fairest that those who can afford to fly the most should pay the most, while the families taking one flight a year for the summer holidays should remain exempt.

What happens to the frequent flyers’ clubs in this scenario remains to be seen. Members — or their employers — already pay handsomely for points and privileges, but how much more would they be willing to cough up?

DOTr said the country has sufficient agricultural waste feedstock to meet all its own jet fuel consumption needs with potential for exports.

“The success of the Philippines SAF Forum underscores our commitment to a sustainable aviation sector. By fostering innovation and partnerships, we are paving the way for the Philippines to become a leader in SAF production and usage,” DOTr said.

The SAF innovation and partnerships also result in job generation and opportunity to acquire know-how of the initiative, DOTr added.

The forum pushed to fast-track aviation’s carbon footprint reduction through SAF, which is a key lever to decarbonizing aviation. SAF has the potential to lower emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, according to industry experts.

Boeing Southeast Asia President Penny Burtt cited the Philippines’ relations with the global aerospace company and shared the common goal of advancing aviation decarbonization.

“Boeing has a long-standing relationship with the Philippines and its aviation industry. We’re committed to continuing our work with the Philippines Department of Transportation and multi-industry partners to accelerate aviation decarbonization and capacity building locally,” said Burtt.

“The Philippines has sufficient agricultural waste feedstock to cater to all of its jet fuel needs, helping the country do its part as commercial aviation pursues its net-zero goal by 2050,” she added.

Fostering the agriculture, technology, and energy sectors must be a priority, as these three industries will dominate global markets and shape the future of business. Pakistan, with its immense potential, must seize opportunities by developing pragmatic strategies without delay, energy scientists and economic experts said.

Speaking to The Express Tribune, they said that economic development is impossible without promoting these three vital sectors. Agriculture plays a crucial role in human survival, strengthening food securityan issue far more critical than border security. It also generates employment in rural areas, preventing mass migration to urban centres.

Technology enhances communication, efficiency, innovation, connectivity, and overall quality of life while driving advancements across all industries. Meanwhile, the energy sector powers homes, offices, industries, and transportation, reducing inefficiencies and improving productivity.

To address economic and labour challenges through technological advancements, DHA Suffa University Karachi's Dean of the Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, Professor Dr S Zafar Nasir, stated that Pakistan can leapfrog into the global technological landscape by leveraging its young workforce. This can be achieved through internet-based connectivity and knowledge-sharing with professionals and experts from universities worldwide.

He highlighted that Artificial Intelligence (AI) adoption could transform Pakistan's economy, provided there are AI-focused education and training programmes. Encouraging AI startups through funding, incubation, and mentorship opportunities could further accelerate progress.

""Our agriculture sector has been a major source of foreign exchange for some time. By utilising data analytics techniques, we can significantly enhance per-acre yields through soil analysis while conserving precious water reserves in delta regions,"" Nasir explained. ""Additionally, AI-based solutions can improve traffic management and energy efficiency.""

He also underscored the importance of incentivising Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption by offering tax breaks and subsidies while investing in EV infrastructure. Encouraging ride-hailing services to transition to EVs and attracting foreign investment in local EV production would further boost the sector.

Other innovative ideas include prioritising renewable energy by investing in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, thereby reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Additionally, fintech and digital payment systems, including online banking, should be promoted alongside local e-commerce platforms and digital marketplaces. ""Informed decision-making is the key to unlocking potential markets and capitalising on market dynamics,"" he added.

Nasir urged the government to support and finance startups and entrepreneurs through funding, mentorship, and incubation programmes.

""By adopting dynamic strategies, Pakistan can harness technological trends to drive economic growth, improve living standards, and emerge as a significant global player,"" he said.

Energy scientist Dr Adeel Ghayur, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Allied Biorefinery, Australia, pointed out that reliable and affordable energy is crucial for attracting foreign investment, boosting industrial output, and fostering technological advancements. A stable energy sector can help resolve Pakistan's chronic power shortages, which frequently disrupt economic activity and daily life.

He highlighted the job creation potential of the energy sector across industries such as construction, maintenance, manufacturing, services, and research & development (R&D).

""In its transition towards energy security and renewable energy sources, Pakistan should prioritise the development of biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, green diesel, and bio-dimethyl ether (a viable LPG replacement),"" Dr Ghayur suggested. ""Additionally, the country should explore distributed energy, which involves generating electricity from decentralised sources closer to the point of use, reducing transmission losses and costs.""

He also noted that AI and data centreswhich require substantial energyare increasingly prioritising renewable sources. Pakistan has a prime opportunity to capitalise on this demand by promoting green energy, positioning itself as a key player in the AI sector while simultaneously strengthening its renewable energy industry.

Veteran agriculturalist Nabi Bux Sathio urged the government to end the exploitation of farmers by establishing a transparent pricing mechanism to ensure stability and a 15-20% profit margin beyond production costs for every crop.

""Local growers are being deprived of fair compensation for their produce. Agriculture is the only sector that guarantees 100% food security,"" Sathio stated. ""If farmers are assured they will recover their costs and earn reasonable profits, they will naturally work toward increasing crop yields. Higher yields will not only benefit the country's food supply but also boost exports.""

He warned that food insecurity would cause people to prioritise purchasing essential commodities over other expenses, leading to panic buying and economic disruption.

""Investing in agricultural R&D is no longer an optionit is a necessity,"" he asserted.

Sathio stressed that developed countries are achieving higher crop yields by focusing on safe and sustainable food production, ensuring pest-free, disease-free, and 100% hygienic food for their populations. Pakistan must follow suit to secure its agricultural future.",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/smart-farming1741470041-0/smart-farming1741470041-0.jpeg,N,,2025-03-08 17:50:16.844037

By encouraging environmentally friendly travel, Vietnam Airlines' choice of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) significantly increases Vietnam tourism business.","Established in 1956, Vietnam Airlines has evolved from a regional operator into a prominent global carrier. The airline was the first in Southeast Asia to introduce the Airbus A350 XWB in 2015, demonstrating its commitment to modernizing its fleet and enhancing passenger comfort.

Vietnam Airlines has implemented various initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint in line with global environmental standards. Notably, in the first nine months of 2024, the airline reduced CO₂ emissions by 75,000 tons through fuel-saving measures.

The aviation industry is increasingly adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to mitigate environmental impacts. SAF, derived from sources like waste oils and non-food crops, can reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 80%. This shift reflects a broader trend toward greener practices in air travel.

Sustainable Fuels Initiative At Vietnam Airlines

Vietnam Airlines has become the first Vietnamese carrier to implement sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on all flights departing from Europe, starting 1 January 2025. This initiative begins with a minimum 2% SAF blend to enhance air quality and support global sustainability goals.

The airline plans to increase SAF usage to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050. For flights from the United Kingdom, a 2% SAF blend will start in 2025, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. This strategy aligns with Vietnam's commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

While SAF is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuel, Vietnam Airlines is committed to absorbing the additional costs, estimated at approximately $4.8 million annually, for its European network. This investment reflects the airline's dedication to environmental responsibility and providing eco-friendly travel options for passengers.

Impact of Vietnam Airlines Sustainable Fuels Application

By committing to sustainable fuels, Vietnam Airlines is raising the standard. This project increases its environmental credentials and follows international green aviation patterns. Find out how this innovative action is changing the travel and aviation sectors.

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by Vietnam Airlines helps strengthen its standing in the international aviation sector. By incorporating SAF into its European flights, the airline demonstrates its dedication to environmental responsibility and aligns with international sustainability criteria. This proactive approach raises its brand image and sets standards for other regional competitors.

Although SAF has more expenses, its use helps Vietnam Airlines to stand out in the very competitive aviation industry. The airline expects SAF use on European flights to cause an annual rise in running expenses of about $4.8 million. However, this expenditure shows a calculated response to changing customer expectations and environmental rules, therefore guaranteeing long-term operational sustainability.

By encouraging environmentally friendly travel, Vietnam Airlines' choice of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) significantly increases Vietnam tourism business. Attracting environmentally conscious tourists and improving the nation's reputation as a green destination, this project fits the worldwide trend toward low-carbon travel.

By up to 80% throughout the lifetime of the fuel, SAF lowers carbon emissions, improving the air quality and the surroundings. This environmental dedication draws visitors looking for eco-friendly travel choices and motivates nearby businesses to follow green policies, promoting a sustainable tourism industry.

Prices two to six times greater than those of conventional fuels make sustainable fuels still expensive. Vietnam Airlines still invests in environmentally friendly solutions that might have long-term advantages. More foreign guests and green tourism investment follow from a stronger dedication to sustainability.

The green shift of aviation depends critically on Vietnam Airlines' choice of sustainable fuel. This program helps environmentally friendly travel and lowers emissions. Sustainability is likely to become the norm as airlines choose greener energy sources, therefore transforming the global aviation sector by responsibility.

The company aims to scale its user base and technological capabilities globally.

MENA funding grows fivefold in Feb

Investment in MENA startups surged nearly fivefold in February, reaching $494 million across 58 deals, according to Wamda.

The sharp increase was driven by a shift from debt financing, which fell to 15 percent of total funding compared to 90 percent in January. Excluding debt, equity investments rose 371 percent month-on-month.

Saudi Arabia led with $250.3 million across 25 deals, followed by the UAE with $203.5 million from 15 deals and Egypt with $27.5 million across eight transactions. Smaller investments were recorded in Oman, Morocco, and Jordan, as well as Tunisia, Bahrain, and Qatar.

Fintech dominated with $274 million across 15 deals, followed by insurance tech with $55 million, and logistics with $28.5 million.

Marketing tech, education tech, AI, and clean tech also saw significant funding.

Later-stage rounds gained traction, with Tabby securing $160 million in Series E funding, Flow48 raising $69 million, and Applied AI closing $55 million.

Despite the funding surge, gender disparity persisted, with female-founded startups receiving just $200k — 0.04 percent of total investment — while male-led ventures secured 86.7 percent of funding.

RIYADH: From advanced technology to bustling tourism, Saudi Arabia is witnessing a labor market transformation that is reducing its reliance on oil and creating jobs in construction, green energy, and beyond.

Government initiatives such as the Saudi Nationalization Scheme and Nitaqat initiative have played a pivotal role in shaping the labor market landscape.

These policies have encouraged private sector employers to hire more of the Kingdom’s nationals across various industries, leading to a significant reduction in unemployment rates.

The commitment to enhancing workforce participation has also contributed to a more inclusive job market, while a strategic focus on developing a knowledge-based economy has led to increased investments in education and vocational training programs.

These initiatives are equipping the local workforce with the skills required to thrive in sectors such as advanced manufacturing, healthcare, and financial services, further accelerating employment growth.

Construction boom fuels job creation

The construction and infrastructure sector has experienced exponential growth in recent years, underpinning the Kingdom’s economic expansion, with contract awards in 2024 reaching $146.8 billion, a record high as it overtook 2023’s figure of $118.7 billion, according to Kamco Invest’s GCC Projects Market Update.

The report added that Saudi Arabia accounted for over 53.8 percent of total project awards across the Gulf Cooperation Council in 2024.

Sachin Kerur, managing partner of Middle East at Reed Smith, told Arab News that this boom is leading to a rise in the opportunities for project managers, designers, architects and many other construction professionals.

“Anyone studying Vision 2030 or visiting the important cities of the Kingdom will be very aware of the construction of large-scale housing, rail and road networks, new airports, infrastructure for major sporting events and industrial production plants,” Kerur said. Tourism-related construction has also seen a surge, with new hotels and resorts hiring more Saudi nationals. “Anyone visiting the Kingdom’s hotels of late will have noticed the number of Saudi nationals employed,” Kerur added.

Major projects such as the Rua Al-Madinah and Qiddiya are further fueling demand for skilled labor in the sector.

Tourism as a booster

The tourism sector continues to play a pivotal role in shaping Saudi Arabia’s labor market, and is only set to grow as the Kingdom pushes ahead with its aim to attract 150 million visitors annually by 2030. As a result, the demand for hospitality, transportation, and cultural service jobs is rapidly increasing.

“With millions of visitors anticipated to visit Saudi each year, tourism has one of the fastest growing and elastic demand for employment,” Kerur said.

From religious tourism initiatives in Makkah and Madinah to entertainment-driven projects such as the Red Sea Project, the sector’s expansion is creating thousands of jobs for Saudis.

Technology and green energy sectors see expansion

On a tech front, Saudi Arabia’s technology sector is experiencing unprecedented growth, driven by the government’s investments and incentives for global tech firms.

“Foreign investments are driving significant job creation in Saudi Arabia’s emerging industries, particularly technology and innovation, aligning with Vision 2030’s goals of economic diversification and private sector growth,” said Faisal Al-Sarraj, Saudi Arabia’s deputy country senior partner at PwC Middle East.

He continued: “PIF’s focus on technology and innovation has bolstered local employment, particularly in AI, digital transformation, and data analytics. Its support for startups and partnerships with global tech firms is strengthening local expertise.”

Initiatives such as the $100 billion AI and data analytics initiative, known as Project Transcendence, as well as smart city projects including NEOM, are fostering high-skilled employment in advanced fields.

Faisal Al-Sarraj, Saudi Arabia’s deputy country senior partner at PwC Middle East.

Citing media outlets Bloomberg and CIO, Al-Sarraj said: “This $100 billion plan positions Saudi Arabia as a global AI and data analytics hub, creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and rivaling regional tech leaders.”

The green energy sector is also taking off in Saudi Arabia, bringing a fresh wave of job opportunities and supporting the Kingdom’s sustainability goals.

Solar and wind farms are being developed across the country, creating thousands of new roles and giving locals the chance to dive into the world of clean energy.

Kerur also cited the life sciences and food industries as other sectors that have seen employment growth.

Saudi welcoming the world

The government’s Saudization initiatives, particularly the Nitaqat program which was established in June 2011, have played a crucial role in increasing the number of nationals in the private sector.

“Many commentators regard Saudization as having been most successful in the retail and tourism and hospitality sectors,” Kerur said.

He continued: “Perhaps less success has been achieved in areas such as life sciences, medicine and design and construction where more skilled resources are needed. That is certainly an area of development for the next few years.”

Moreover, the drive for greater workforce inclusion is also reflected in the increasing focus on supporting female participation in the labor market.

As more opportunities arise in flexible and remote work arrangements, women are stepping into roles across diverse sectors, contributing to the Kingdom’s broader economic transformation goals.

Figures released by the General Authority for Statistics showed that by the end of the third quarter of 2024 the labor force participation rate of Saudi females reached 36.2 percent — well above the original Vision 2030 target of 30 percent, with that goal now upped to 40 percent by the end of the decade.

Kerur added: “Saudi Arabia’s labor market reforms and initiatives are successfully reducing unemployment levels and so much credit must go to Vision 2030 as economic diversification develops at pace. However, this is not merely labour economics.”

He went on to say: “As with other GCC countries like the UAE, there are social and cultural norms that have to be assessed to ensure they are maintained whilst at the same time ensuring unemployment is minimised and the national workforce is equipped for the challenges of the next three decades.”

Regional Headquarters Initiative and FDI

One of the biggest wins for Saudi Arabia in 2024 was the success of its regional headquarters initiative, which has drawn in over 540 multinational companies to set up shop in the Kingdom.

This surge in corporate presence is not just about numbers — it is about turning Saudi Arabia into a thriving business hub, buzzing with new ideas and opportunities.

Companies such as Amazon, Google, PwC, and Deloitte have relocated their regional headquarters, leading to job creation in professional services, consulting, and administrative roles.

“This achievement is having an employment impetus as more and more companies are employing Saudi nationals in line with the Kingdom’s status as a developing business hub,” Kerur said.

The Kingdom’s push to attract foreign investment has not only created job opportunities but also fostered knowledge transfer and skill development among the local workforce.

With multinational firms bringing global best practices and expertise, Saudi nationals are gaining invaluable exposure to international business operations, positioning them competitively in the job market.

Another key initiative was the Golden Visa, which allows foreign nationals to live, work, and own property in the Kingdom without a sponsor,

In order to qualify, applicants must meet specific criteria such as significant investments in real estate or business ventures.

Al-Sarraj said the visa “incentivized” highly skilled professionals and entrepreneurs to relocate to Saudi Arabia, and has expanded employment in sectors such as healthcare, education, and technology, and fostered a knowledge-based economy.

He added: “Reforms like the Labor Reform Initiative improved mobility and flexibility for expatriates, making Saudi Arabia a more attractive job market. This policy also encouraged Saudization, driving the hiring of skilled nationals.”

Challenges and the road ahead

Despite the progress, challenges remain in bridging skill gaps and positioning manual labor or skilled trades as a viable career path for Saudis.

“Education and training will be vital all round for the labor market. Indeed more labor capacity is required to implement Vision 2030 projects and this provides Saudi nationals a significant opportunity to develop blue collar skills,” Kerur said.

He continued: “Of course the private sector, both national and international, will have a key role to play to train, develop and employ nationals. The issue will be the stick or the carrot.”

Kerur further explained that the private sector in Saudi Arabia will require support and assistance, particularly in areas where their capacity to operate or expand is currently limited, and where significant financial investment is needed.

“Saudi Arabia has shown a willingness to enable public private partnership in their labor market and more will be expected in this regard,” he said.

According to Al-Sarraj, one of the key issues is that many workers may not have received the necessary training and or hold the qualifications required by employers.

“Despite significant progress, challenges remain, including skill gaps among the workforce, the need for enhanced educational and vocational training programs, and ensuring sustainable employment opportunities for the growing local population,” he said.

Al-Sarraj added: “Employers often cite skill gaps and higher wage expectations as reasons for not hiring Saudis, highlighting the need for enhanced educational and vocational training programs.”

As Saudi Arabia’s labor market continues to evolve, the combined impact of strategic government initiatives, foreign investment, and workforce development efforts will be key to sustaining momentum.

With significant achievements in 2023 paving the way, the Kingdom is well-positioned to achieve its ambitious Vision 2030 objectives and create a dynamic, diversified workforce that meets future economic demands.

JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia’s unveiling of a new symbol for the riyal has been dubbed a “visionary maneuver” that will enhance the currency’s global recognition, strengthen investor confidence, and signal a commitment to financial modernization, Arab News has been told.

As the Kingdom seeks to position itself as a global financial hub, this new symbol, inspired by Arabic calligraphy, reflects a seamless blend of tradition and progress — key to the nation’s ongoing economic reform efforts, according to experts.

It was announced on Feb. 20 that the symbol had been approved by King Salman, a move dubbed as marking “a new chapter in the evolution of our national currency” by the Saudi Central Bank.

The symbol, which blends Arabic calligraphy with the name of the national currency, will be used in financial and commercial transactions both within the Kingdom and internationally.

According to the central bank, also known as SAMA, the symbol will be rolled out immediately, with its integration into financial and commercial transactions, as well as various applications, occurring gradually in coordination with relevant entities.

Tamer Al-Sayed, chief financial officer at FII (Future Investment Initiative) Institute, told Arab News the timing aligned with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030-driven economic transformation to become a global financial hub.

“This announcement comes at a time when the world is facing economic volatility — rising inflation, shifting interest rates, and evolving global trade dynamics. In such an environment, having a distinct and recognizable currency identity is more important than ever,” he said.

In response to a question about how the new symbol might impact its recognition and credibility in global financial markets, Youssef Saidi, a research fellow at the Economic Research Forum and former senior economic adviser at the Gulf Monetary Council, said that the introduction of the symbol was a “visionary maneuver.”

He added that a modern symbol could present Saudi Arabia as a forward-thinking nation, positively influencing both the country’s image and the perception of its currency globally.

This could increase investor confidence in the Saudi market, potentially leading to greater foreign direct investment.

Youssef Saidi, research fellow at the Economic Research Forum

For foreign investors, Saidi said, the introduction of a new symbol may signal Saudi Arabia’s commitment to aligning its financial practices with international standards. “This could increase investor confidence in the Saudi market, potentially leading to greater foreign direct investment,” he said.

Saidi noted that a single, recognizable symbol would streamline monetary transactions, reduce errors, and boost global awareness of the Saudi riyal.

“Just as the dollar, euro, and yen are instantly recognizable, a unique symbol design for the Saudi riyal, ingeniously inspired by authentic Arabic calligraphy, could help it stand out in financial documents, trading platforms, and media coverage,” Saidi added.

FII Institute’s Al-Sayed agreed, stating that the symbol comes as Saudi Arabia is making significant investments in its financial infrastructure, from digital payment systems to foreign investment attraction.

“A strong, well-defined riyal symbol reinforces these efforts, signaling economic stability and modernization to global investors,” Al-Sayed said. Commenting on incorporating Arabic letters in the design, the FII Institute official emphasized that this was an important point because the use of the calligraphy is more than just an artistic choice — it’s a message.

“Saudi Arabia has always played a central role in the Arab and Islamic world, and its leadership understands that its identity is not separate from its economic growth,” he said.

Al-Sayed noted that using Arabic script in the riyal’s symbol is a statement that modernization does not mean abandoning tradition.

“In fact, the most successful economies balance heritage with progress. Take Japan, for example — it leads in global innovation while maintaining its cultural identity. Saudi Arabia is following a similar path, blending financial modernization with deep-rooted traditions,” he added.

He further said that the new riyal symbol is not just a visual element, claiming that it is a declaration that Saudi Arabia’s financial identity is “here to stay — both locally and globally.” Asked how the symbol can help Saudi Arabia strengthen its position on the global economic stage, Al-Sayed said that the world was moving toward a more digital and borderless economy and currencies were no longer just physical notes. “Currencies are financial identities recognized across global markets, digital transactions, and potential future digital currencies,” he added.

Tamer Al-Sayed, chief financial officer at FII Institute

Al-Sayed noted that a strong riyal symbol is a strategic move because it boosts global confidence in Saudi Arabia’s economy, particularly among foreign investors and financial institutions that rely on strong monetary symbols to assess stability.

He continued: “It also increases the riyal’s visibility in global trade and financial markets, potentially enhancing its role in international contracts and energy deals — an essential factor given Saudi Arabia’s influence in oil and renewable energy markets.”

Al-Sayed added that the symbol strengthens the riyal’s presence in the digital financial ecosystem, emphasizing that digital payments and the potential adoption of cryptocurrency make distinct monetary symbols increasingly important.

“This is not just a branding exercise — it’s a step toward redefining Saudi Arabia’s financial standing in a rapidly changing global economy,” he said.

The Economic Research Forum’s Saidi agreed that a distinct currency symbol had an important role to play in today’s digital and globalized economy.

Saidi pointed out that the digitalization of currencies had transformed the traditional concept of money, with currency symbols now representing both physical and digital forms of legal tender.

“In the digital economy, currency symbols aren’t just graphic representations but additionally play a pivotal part in easing trades, ensuring financial sovereignty, and affirming financial stability,” he added.

He said that the design of the new symbol highlighted Saudi Arabia’s rich cultural heritage. This not only fosters national pride and cultural affiliation but also strengthens confidence in the riyal as a stable and influential currency on the global stage.

“Domestically, the introduction of a new Saudi riyal symbol could foster a sense of national pride and unity around the currency. This could translate into greater public support for economic reforms and policies aimed at strengthening the riyal,” Saidi added.

JEDDAH: Franchises are proving increasingly vital to Saudi Arabia’s economic development, driving employment, government revenue, and cultural transformation in a youthful nation.

Economic experts have told Arab News that the introduction of a law in 2019, followed by expansion of regulations the following year, helped open the Kingdom up to international businesses, as well as strengthened the relationship between franchisors and franchisees.

These moves, together with the economic expansion of Saudi Arabia as part of the Vision 2030 initiative, means the Kingdom now accounts for nearly half of the $30 billion franchise market in the Middle East and Africa, according to Yaseen Ghulam, associate professor of economics at Riyadh-based Al-Yamamah University.

He told Arab News there is consensus among researchers and industry observers that franchise businesses are expected to grow by more than 20 percent per annum for the coming five years and beyond.

“This presents an exceptional opportunity for international brands to enter the Kingdom through franchising, given the fact that European and North American consumer markets are struggling due to economic uncertainty, unemployment, and higher cost of living,” Ghulam said.

He added that franchise registrations in the Kingdom stood at 1,788 by the end of the third quarter of 2024, up from just 185 three years earlier.

With 1,232 entries, the accommodation and food services sector — which includes lodging facilities, dining establishments, and enterprises associated with tourism — led the registrations, the associate professor said.

He added that the wholesale and retail division came in second with 689, and the transport and storage sector with 257. An important element of this development, he noted, is more widespread activity, covering almost all major cities, rather than clustered around one particular region or sector.

“With 647 franchise registrations, Riyadh has led the field, followed by Makkah with 363, and the Eastern Province with 225. According to some estimates, over 1,200 brands are available for franchising, and the franchising sector in Saudi Arabia is offering over 10,000 business opportunities.”

Ghulam noted that more than 600 international and 380 local franchise brands are present in the Kingdom, according to the Small and Medium Enterprises General Authority, known as Monsha’at.

Abdullah Al-Maghlouth, a member of the Saudi Economic Association, told Arab News that government support for SMEs through streamlined processes and a business-friendly environment has helped drive the franchise sector.

He added that the 2019 law bolstered the Kingdom’s business ecosystem, attracting local and international investments through a clear legal framework.

“The 2020 executive regulations complement this by providing a comprehensive legal environment that facilitates franchise operations and ensures guarantees for all parties involved. This enhances transparency between franchisors and franchisees, making the Saudi market increasingly appealing to investors,” Al-Maghlouth said.

Reflecting on the key factors driving growth in the sector in the Kingdom, Ghulam said Monsha’at’s Franchise Center is “aggressively advancing entrepreneurship” through different programs, such as Tomoh.

He added that trademarks are now fully protected thanks to the Kingdom’s recent successful implementation of an intellectual property rights plan, with online portals making trademark registration and protection simple and accessible.

Financial guarantees provided by the Kafalah program are also proving to be a factor in sourcing finance from local investors, Ghulam said, and he noted that the Social Development Bank has played a significant role in advancing franchising in the Kingdom.

The institution provides financing solutions ranging from SR150,000 ($40,000) to SR4 million with a maximum financing length of 8 years as part of its program to assist new franchise developments and expansion.

“Another significant step in bolstering the franchise community is the founding of the Saudi Franchise Association, the Kingdom’s first specialized association. It has worked to promote the idea and culture of business excellence since its foundation. Additionally, it has organized numerous seminars and workshops and signed various partnerships with colleges and chambers of commerce,” said Ghulam.

Arrangements are also in place in Saudi Arabia to support franchise business and provide consulting. For both domestic and international businesses, Arab Franchise Marketing Corporation provides media platforms, administrative and legal services, and new franchise opportunities. “Through useful solutions, they work with a profit system to grow the franchise market in the MENA area, especially in Saudi Arabia,” said the associate professor.

Highlighting how Saudi Vision 2030 has influenced the development of the franchise market, Ghulam said that the objectives of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 are to invest in globally competitive industries, diversify the country’s economy, boost the private sector, and create jobs.

“Following this, one important economic area that is highlighted in Vision 2030 is franchising. For the success of the Vision, a comprehensive legal, regulatory, financial, and economic set up was needed and has been established for the promotion of the private sector to diversify the economy and reduce dependence on the oil sector,” he said.

The development, he added, of the basic and changed framework has indeed helped the private sector grow in the last few years.

Ghulam said that the franchising industry has greatly benefited from Vision 2030, with support mechanisms, new institutions, and financial aid serving as key enablers.

He added that investment in mega projects, sports events, and facilities has created youth employment, raised real wages, and driven demand for sectors like education, health, dining, beauty, and fitness.

This has attracted international franchisors and local investors, fueling significant growth in the sector.

Ghulam emphasized that Vision 2030 has also shifted the mindset of Saudi youth, encouraging private sector roles and self-employment through franchising, offering substantial returns on investment.

He advised foreign brands seeking to expand into the Saudi franchise market that there is significant potential in sectors such as food, retail, and education, as well as health, fitness, and sports.

“More specifically, customers are quite fond of education franchises, including both domestic and international franchises that focus on training, early childhood care, development centers, and tutoring,” Ghulam said.

He continued that Saudi Arabia’s focus on health-related industries has driven high demand for gyms, nutritious food franchises, and medical services, adding that loosened social regulations, particularly for women, and government support for regional designers have boosted the retail sector, particularly fashion.

Al-Maghlouth agreed that beyond traditional sectors like tourism, hospitality, and food, the Saudi franchise market will continue to expand into emerging fields such as technology, education, and healthcare.

“The supportive legal framework will continue to enhance market transparency and drive growth in economic activities, fostering a sustainable investment environment. This will not only benefit all stakeholders but also solidify Saudi Arabia’s position as a leading investment destination in the region.” he said.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s corporate venture capital arms are playing a pivotal role in driving innovation and advancing economic diversification by aligning their investment strategies with both national and corporate objectives.

Between 2020 and the third quarter of 2024, corporate investors accounted for 27 percent of the 1,361 unique investors in the Middle East and North Africa region, deploying approximately $380 million, according to a report by MAGNiTT.

Saudi Arabia saw the highest ratio, with CVC’s making up 30 percent of local unique investors.

Funds such as Aramco Ventures and stc’s tali ventures exemplify this dual-purpose approach. By leveraging their resources and expertise, these CVCs are fostering startups that align with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 agenda while simultaneously advancing the strategic and operational goals of their parent companies.

According to Stephane Ulcakar, associate director and head of corporate and government financial services at Arthur D. Little, these funds stand out due to their scale and strategic scope.

“Aramco Ventures recently secured an additional $4 billion in funding, raising its total capital to $7 billion,” Ulcakar noted in an interview with Arab News, adding that stc has also collaborated with global players like SoftBank and the Saudi Public Investment Fund to broaden its reach.

This alignment extends to specific investment sectors. In an interview with Arab News, Arjun Singh, partner and global head of fintech at ADL, explained: “These arms — and their affiliated funds — are not just looking for the next big thing but also for startups that can integrate seamlessly into their parent companies’ operations.”

Stc’s tali ventures prioritizes fintech, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, reflecting both the nation’s and its parent company’s ambitions to champion Saudi Arabia’s digital economy.

Similarly, Aramco’s Wa’ed Ventures focuses on startups that advance the Kingdom’s digital transformation while complementing Aramco’s strategic objectives.

Beyond funding, Saudi CVCs bring a distinct set of advantages to startups by leveraging industry expertise, supply chain networks, and expansive ecosystems.

Ulcakar highlighted the role of national initiatives such as the PIF’s National Development Strategy in addressing supply chain gaps and reshaping logistics.

Startups backed by these CVCs gain access to infrastructure and pilot programs within large ecosystems, which help refine their offerings.

“Certain well-known national players have partnered with startups to integrate advanced technologies into their supply chain operations, testing solutions like automation and predictive analytics,” Ulcakar stated.

Singh emphasized how this approach accelerates innovation, particularly in regulated industries like fintech and healthcare.

“Startups backed by corporate investors show stronger performance, as these partnerships can significantly accelerate regulatory approval processes and market entry,” he said.

Saudi National Bank’s venture capital arm is an example of an organization enabling fintech startups to scale efficiently by offering regulatory navigation support and access to a large customer base, he added.

“The Saudi VC market is undoubtedly burgeoning, with abundant demand for bankable capital and distinct funding and technical advantages brought by various players on the supply side,” Ulcakar said.

The market’s maturation is evident, with funding reaching $987 million in 2022, and CVCs accounting for 32 percent of all deals — a significant rise from less than 15 percent in 2018.

This growth is not limited to Aramco and stc — banks including SNB Capital, Riyad Bank and SAB are emerging as key players, further diversifying the funding landscape.

Additionally, Saudi Venture Capital continues to act as a catalyst for the ecosystem, having deployed over SR3.4 billion ($905.7 million) through direct and indirect investments.

This has propelled Saudi Arabia to capture the highest share of total VC funding in the MENA region, reaching 54 percent in the first half of 2024, up from 38 percent during the same period in 2023.

The Kingdom’s VC ecosystem is marked by a collaborative dynamic between corporate and traditional VCs.

Singh highlighted that “87 percent of CVC-backed deals in 2022-23 included traditional VC participation.”

This high rate of co-investment reflects a complementary relationship, where both types of investors contribute to building a more sophisticated, institutionalized ecosystem.

Singh noted that this coordinated evolution spans multiple sectors and is essential to creating a sustainable innovation landscape aligned with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.

Looking ahead, the key question is how this ecosystem will consolidate further, potentially positioning the Kingdom as a global private capital hub.

“The diversity of approaches — from direct CVC arms to partnerships with established VC firms — demonstrates the market’s growing maturity and suggests a sustainable growth trajectory,” Ulcakar stated.

This progress is a critical component of the Kingdom’s strategy to establish itself as a leader in technology and innovation.

In sectors such as energy and logistics, Saudi Arabia’s CVCs are playing a pivotal role in driving innovation.

Ulcakar explained that the Kingdom is leveraging its global footprint to balance present needs with future aspirations.

Investments in fossil fuel infrastructure, for example, are complemented by efforts to localize electric vehicle technologies and pioneer nuclear fusion projects. These investments often blend incremental improvements with disruptive technologies, creating a dual pathway for transformation.

CVC arms are distinctive in their dual mandate to achieve financial returns while pursuing strategic objectives for their parent companies.

This dual focus shapes their investment and risk management philosophies, setting them apart from independent venture capital firms.

Singh said: “Unlike traditional VCs, which prioritize financial exits and short-term gains, Saudi CVCs often adopt a longer-term, patient capital strategy.”

This approach allows them to align their investments with their parent companies’ strategic goals, even if such opportunities involve higher initial risks or extended timelines.

For instance, Aramco Ventures invests in clean energy and carbon capture technologies, aligning with the parent company’s energy transition and sustainability goals.

These investments represent long-term bets with strategic implications, demonstrating a willingness to prioritize alignment with corporate objectives over immediate financial returns.

Similarly, tali ventures focuses on digital innovation while reinforcing stc’s leadership in telecommunications and digital services.

By investing in startups, tali ventures not only targets financial returns but also strengthens stc’s digital payments ecosystem, creating synergies that benefit the parent company’s broader ambitions.

Singh highlighted this dual approach as a key differentiator, noting that these capabilities enable Saudi Arabia CVCs to pursue opportunities that might otherwise be deemed too risky by independent VCs.

Ulcakar emphasized the nuanced nature of this approach. “The ability to generate both financial and strategic returns represents a unique advantage and a complex challenge in this growth market. There is no one-size-fits-all answer,” he said.

Ulcakar also noted that Saudi Arabia is one of the few growth markets that has successfully financed its own development, with investor preferences gradually evolving.

“We observe a gradual shift toward prioritizing financial returns over strategic ones, aligning with the Kingdom’s evolving investment goals,” he added.

NEW DELHI: Oil prices were little changed on Friday but were set for their biggest weekly decline since October as the uncertainty around US tariff policy is creating concerns about demand growth at the same time major producers are set to increase output.

Brent futures rose 17 cents, or 0.24 percent, to $69.63 a barrel by 6:15 a.m. Saudi time. US West Texas Intermediate futures rose 12 cents, or 0.18 percent, to $66.48 a barrel.

However, for the week Brent is down 4.9 percent, set for its biggest weekly decline since the week of Oct. 14. WTI is set to drop 4.8 percent, also its biggest weekly fall since that week.

Markets, including oil, have been whipsawed by fluctuating trade policy in the US, the world’s biggest oil consumer.

“It looks like the financial markets are in full panic mode, no longer easily pacified by Trump’s one-month postponements and exemptions on import tariffs,” said Vandana Hari, founder of oil market analysis provider Vanda Insights.

“That leaves crude stuck around four-month lows, albeit vulnerable to further slides,” she added.

On Thursday, US President Donald Trump suspended the 25 percent tariffs he had imposed on most goods from Canada and Mexico until April 2, although steel and aluminum tariffs would still go into effect on March 12 as scheduled.

The amended order does not fully cover Canadian energy products, which are under a separate 10 percent levy.

The tariffs themselves are considered a drag on economic growth and therefore oil demand growth. But the uncertainty over the policy is also slowing business decisions, which is also impacting the economy.

“The risks to oil prices remain tilted to the downside with new supply from OPEC+ and non-OPEC producers expected to push the market well into an oversupply,” Fitch’s research unit, BMI, said in a note.

Brent prices on Wednesday fell to their lowest since December 2021 after US crude inventories rose and in the wake of the decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, to increase their output quotas.

The group said on Monday that it had decided to proceed with a planned April output increase, adding 138,000 barrels per day to the market.

Some of the downward momentum in prices has eased as the US is looking at steps to halt exports from key OPEC producer Iran.

“We are going to shut down Iran’s oil sector and drone manufacturing capabilities,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in his first major speech to Wall Street executives.

Reuters reported on Thursday that Trump is considering a plan to inspect Iranian oil tankers at sea using an accord aimed at weapons of mass destruction, according to sources, part of the US president’s “maximum pressure” to drive Iranian oil exports down to zero.",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/03/08/4581108-1451646102.jpg?itok=7Th6z3IG,N,,2025-03-08 18:50:54.311669

A pipeline is a pipeline is a pipeline. Or is it? There are over 2.6 million miles of oil and gas pipelines in the US, according to the Department of Energy. How did they all get there? Largely because of a legal principle called eminent domain, which allows governments to expropriate private property rights for public purposes such as building or widening roads or extending runways at airports. The theory is that the public good should prevail over private property rights if the ability to meet needs of the community at large is strong enough. Governments must compensate property owners, but legal wrangling over what is fair compensation is common. There are attorneys, accountants, and engineers who make entire careers out of litigating such disputes, and they seldom go hungry.

But there is a sting in the tail of this particular legal principle. Often, private companies prevail on state or local governments to take land by eminent domain for quasi-public purposes that directly benefit private interests. Sports stadiums are a classic example, but there are many others, one of which is building more pipelines, because 2.6 million miles of them is clearly insufficient for America’s needs. But not all pipelines are the same. If those underground highways carry petroleum or methane gas, that is ipso facto a matter of vital national interest. Those pipelines must get built to support America’s need for energy dominance. But if the stuff moving through a proposed pipeline is not a fossil fuel, then stop the presses! All bets are off.

Anti-Pipeline Law In South Dakota

South Dakota has 304 miles of transmission and 5,367 miles of distribution pipelines. Summit Carbon Solutions plans to construct an $8.9 billion, 2,500-mile pipeline to carry carbon dioxide from the dozens of ethanol facilities in the Midwest to sites in North Dakota, where it will be injected deep underground to be stored for millions of years — or a least a few weeks — thereby keeping it out of the atmosphere, where it might contribute to global overheating. The problem is, to get from the Midwest to North Dakota, conveniently, one needs to go through South Dakota and that state, which never met a pipeline it didn’t like, has suddenly developed an aversion to carbon dioxide.

In fact, according to the Associated Press (we prefer to use news sources that refuse to knuckle under to fascists), Larry Rhoden, that state’s Republican governor, last week signed a new law that bans the taking of private property for building carbon dioxide pipelines. “I made my decision based on my own consideration of the facts, the policy arguments, legislative history, my own opinions and experience, and my judgment about what is best for South Dakota,” Rhoden said. It is not immediately clear how Summit can move forward with its project if it cannot build in South Dakota.

Summit Carbon Solutions, predictably, was not pleased, claiming South Dakota “changed the rules in the middle of the game.” In other words, they thought the fix was in and were sad to see the economic rewards they expected to gain from their endeavor slipping through their fingers. “This kind of regulatory uncertainty creates real challenges — not just for our project, but for the ethanol plants in South Dakota that now face a competitive disadvantage compared to their counterparts in neighboring states,” the company said. “While this presents obstacles, our project moves forward in states that support investment and innovation, and we will have more news on that soon.”

In South Dakota, the pipeline for carbon dioxide has drawn intense opposition from landowners who fear a taking of their land for the pipeline and the dangers of a potential pipeline leak. Property rights are a passionate issue in South Dakota, where voters last year rejected a suite of regulations that opponents said would deny local control over such projects and consolidate authority with state regulators. Supporters called it a “landowner bill of rights.” The new South Carolina law contains this rather specific language: “Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, a person may not exercise the right of eminent domain to acquire right-of-way for, construct, or operate a pipeline for the preponderant purpose of transporting carbon oxide.” Summit says it has approvals for its pipeline in Iowa and North Dakota, a leg in Minnesota, and the underground storage piece of the puzzle.

Supporters of the pipeline see carbon capture projects such as the Summit pipeline as a way to fight climate change and to help the ethanol industry. Opponents question carbon capture’s effectiveness at large scale and say it allows the fossil fuel industry to continue unchanged. In actuality, it is more like 2% fighting climate change and 98% helping the ethanol industry. Carbon capture projects are eligible for lucrative federal tax credits intended to encourage cleaner burning ethanol. Potentially ethanol from corn could be refined into sustainable aviation fuel — and someday pigs will have wings.

Political Sparks Fly

Karla Lems, a Republican, introduced the law the governor just signed in the last session of the South Dakota legislature. She welcomed the signing and criticized Summit’s “heavy hand” toward landowners, claiming its project is all about tax credits. She is not wrong. Iowa Renewable Fuels Association executive director Monte Shaw fired back, saying South Dakota’s action is unfortunate for neighboring states and “an unnecessary roadblock” between “Midwest corn farmers and much needed new markets. The demand for ultra-low carbon ethanol around the globe is so massive that, at the end of the day, no one state will be able to stop the ethanol industry from accessing that market,” he said in a statement.

Some opponents argue the amount of greenhouse gases sequestered through the process would make little difference and could lead farmers to grow more corn despite environmental concerns about the crop. The cynical among us might suggest that the ethanol program that requires at least 10% of all gasoline sold in the United States has been a multi-decade boondoggle cooked up by Big Ag to divert federal funds into its overflowing coffers. Others disagree, sometimes vehemently.

A farming website that calls itself the New Roots Institute lists a number of concerns people have with growing corn. It says, “There are many environmental harms associated with modern forms of farming, and the same is true of modern corn farms.” Here are a few of the points made by New Roots. It says industrialized corn farms use a lot of water, which is draining groundwater in the middle of the US. The excessive fertilizer from corn farms runs into rivers and oceans, causing dead zones that are harmful to marine life. There is now a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico which threatens animals, plants, and whole ecosystems. Pesticides used on the farms are said to directly harm insects, honey bees, and birds.

In addition, two centuries of industrial agriculture in the United States have led to soil erosion and degradation. Rather than growing corn in polycultures as Native Americans did, US farmers grew corn in monocultures and decimated their topsoil with similar environmental effects to clear-cutting a forest. Soil can store nearly three times the carbon of forests and other types of vegetation, but injecting it with fertilizers makes it hard for living beings to survive. This contributes to long term damage to soil structure, which may make it hard to grow food in the future. In other words, short term thinking focused on greed has long term consequences that are harmful to the human community.

In addition, New Roots says applying fertilizer, using diesel to run tractors, kicking up dust while tilling the land, and pesticide production are all major contributors to air pollution from corn farms, which has been linked to 4,300 premature deaths a year in the US. Applying ammonia is a key culprit in the air pollution created by corn farms. This pollution includes significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. That’s not all. As well as being a mainstay of intensive crop agriculture, the production of cheap corn is a component of industrial animal farming. It enables concentrated animal feeding operations to confine and feed livestock for part or all of their lives in a way that harms the animals and the environment.

Greenwashing For Fun & Profit

Moving our focus outward, it is intuitively obvious to the most casual observer that this is all part and parcel of the carbon capture scam promoted by Big Oil for decades. It doesn’t work, it has never worked, and it never will work at sufficient scale to amount to more than a pisshole in the snow when it comes to addressing humanity’s penchant for polluting the environment for financial gain. Regular reader Dan Allard, who is an actual farmer and knows a thing or two about farming, alerted me to this story in an email that included this (lightly edited) message. “Pipelines crossing entire states to pump CO2 into the ground means insane amounts of energy wasted. Using ethanol as a fuel additive was always a stupid idea to subsidize the over-production of corn. It is a hard crop to grow anyway since it requires tons of chemical pesticides, so over-production is doubly stupid.”

We can be certain South Dakota’s new law has little to do with the environment and everything to do with the state government picking winners and losers in the marketplace, something Republicans say they hate when others do it. Take that for what it’s worth.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corn.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 12:50:33.913966

As Boom Supersonic gets ready for ultra-fast flights from London to New York, President Donald J. Trump has recently shown off designs for the “Son of Concorde” supersonic jet.

The President beamed as he posed with an Overture model, of a plane being built by Boom Supersonic – presented to him by the firm’s CEO.

As noted by The Sun, the photo was proudly posted on X by Boom Supersonic chief Blake Scholl.

Scholl suggested that Boom Supersonic should manufacture Air Force One – the President’s personal plane – and took a cheeky dig at China.

He wrote: “Air Fore Once should be supersonic. Xi [President of China] can keep his 747-8.”

Overture is dubbed the “Son of Concorde” because it will fly faster than the speed of sound – as the original Concorde did.

The company has built a plane called Boom XB-1 – known as “Baby Boom” – which first flew on Mar. 22, 2024 and is a one-third scale model of the Overture airliner design.

XB-1 is history’s first independently developed supersonic jet and supersonic demonstrator built by Boom Supersonic, the aerospace company building Overture, the world’s fastest airliner. XB-1 provides the foundation for Overture.

Boomless Cruise

Additionally, XB-1 also provided confirmation of no audible sonic boom during its recent supersonic runs proving that quiet supersonic flight (AKA Boomless Cruise, where no audible boom reaches the ground) is possible on Overture.

When in Boomless Cruise, speeds are 40-50% faster than conventional airliners. This means a flight from New York to Los Angeles can be up to 90 minutes shorter. Hybrid routes with overland and overwater segments, such as Chicago to Frankfurt, will also see incremental time savings.

Unlike “low boom” designs, Boomless Cruise does not require extensive aircraft shaping. Instead, it relies on the ability to break the sound barrier at a high enough altitude where the boom refracts harmlessly away from the ground.

On Overture, Boomless Cruise is specifically enabled by the Symphony engines. These engines feature enhanced transonic performance compared to commercially derived engines, allowing Overture to efficiently transition to supersonic speeds at altitudes above 30,000 feet.

Additionally, Boomless Cruise is enabled by an advanced autopilot which uses current weather conditions and software algorithms to automatically select the optimal speed for Boomless Cruise.

Noteworthy, boomless and low boom are distinct concepts. In Boomless Cruise, Overture’s sonic boom does not reach the ground. However, at its full Mach 1.7 speed over water, Overture will generate a sonic boom.

Book of 130 orders and pre-orders

Overture is designed to be most efficient at high subsonic speeds of Mach 0.94 and supersonic speed of Mach 1.7. As aerodynamic drag increases closer to speed of sound, there is a modest increase in fuel burn at low supersonic speeds. Even with this drag penalty, Overture still has plenty of range to fly the longest transcontinental routes, such as Vancouver-Miami.

According to Boom Supersonic, the initial Overture is not designed as a low-boom aircraft, and the company does not expect to certify it for unrestricted supersonic flight over land.

Overture has an order book of 130 orders and pre-orders from American Airlines, United Airlines, and Japan Airlines. In 2024, Boom completed construction on the Overture Superfactory in Greensboro, North Carolina, which will scale to produce 66 Overture aircraft per year.

With the unveiling of its ultra-high-speed private jet concept, comparisons to the legendary Concorde are inevitable. Promising to revolutionize private aviation in the same way Concorde redefined commercial supersonic travel, Virgin Galactic’s private jet aims to offer an unparalleled experience in speed, efficiency, and luxury. But does it truly live up to the legacy of Concorde? Let’s examine its technological advancements, market potential, and the broader implications for the future of high-speed travel.

The legacy of the Concorde

The Aérospatiale/BAC Concorde, introduced in 1976, was the pinnacle of commercial supersonic aviation. Capable of reaching Mach 2.04 (about 1,354 mph), it could transport passengers across the Atlantic in just over three hours—less than half the time of conventional jets. Despite its technological marvel, Concorde faced several hurdles, including high operational costs, limited seating capacity, and environmental concerns, particularly regarding noise pollution from its sonic booms. After 27 years of service, the Concorde was retired in 2003 due to economic unfeasibility and declining demand following the tragic Air France Flight 4590 crash in 2000. However, it remains a symbol of innovation and ambition in aviation history.

The Concorde was a technological marvel, but its supersonic capabilities were limited by the restrictions imposed on it. Due to its intense sonic boom, many countries banned it from flying over land, forcing it to operate almost exclusively on transatlantic routes. Its fuel consumption was also exorbitant, making it financially unsustainable for commercial airlines. Despite these challenges, the Concorde’s unique design and incredible speed made it an icon of luxury and prestige.

The culture of the Concorde

Aside from the mechanical capabilities of the Concorde, it represented the blending of European and American cultures. In short, to be a passenger on the Concorde (at any time during its operating history) was a vibe. Even though modern day air travel advancements has made getting to Europe from New York only slightly longer than a flight from to Los Angeles, it's b no means a commuter flight. Most commercial passengers wouldn't consider going over to London for two or three days, return to New York and then repeating the same trip a few days later. With the Concorde, the travel was cut down to less than half of a workday. This ease of sophistication is something that hasn't really been replicated.

Virgin Galactic’s private jet: The Concorde reborn?

Technological advancements and speed

Virgin Galactic’s private jet, currently in development, is designed to fly at Mach 3, exceeding even the Concorde’s top speed. The aircraft is being developed in partnership with Rolls-Royce, a company with deep expertise in supersonic propulsion systems, including its work on the original Concorde’s engines. Unlike the Concorde, which relied on turbojet engines with afterburners, Virgin Galactic’s jet is expected to utilize advanced turbofan technology to enhance fuel efficiency and reduce noise.

Moreover, modern aerodynamics and lightweight composite materials allow the aircraft to overcome many of the limitations that plagued Concorde. Advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and wind tunnel testing ensure an optimized fuselage that minimizes drag and maximizes fuel efficiency. This results in a more sustainable approach to supersonic flight compared to its predecessor.

Another significant improvement over the Concorde is the potential for variable-cycle engines that can adjust between subsonic and supersonic flight modes. These engines would provide greater fuel efficiency while enabling quieter takeoffs and landings, a major issue that restricted the Concorde’s operations.

Luxury redefined

The Concorde, despite its groundbreaking speed, had a relatively small and cramped cabin, accommodating just 92 to 128 passengers. Virgin Galactic’s private jet, on the other hand, is designed for an elite clientele, offering a spacious and customizable interior. The cabin will include lie-flat seating, private suites, and cutting-edge entertainment systems, catering to high-net-worth individuals, business executives, and government officials.

With luxury in mind, the jet’s interior will be designed to rival the most opulent private aircraft in the world. Features such as panoramic windows, AI-assisted flight experiences, and personalized in-flight services will create a unique, high-end experience. Unlike Concorde, which was designed for commercial airline use, Virgin Galactic’s jet is tailored to serve the exclusive needs of ultra-high-net-worth individuals.

In addition, the aircraft will feature climate-controlled zones, a dedicated conference area, and a high-tech galley for gourmet dining. It will redefine the concept of luxury air travel by merging high-speed capabilities with the comfort of a five-star hotel.

Overcoming Concorde’s limitations

Despite on the surface being a fantastic and convenient way to travel, the Concorde was not without its issues. The sonic boom it produced, massive amounts of jet fuel and other factors made it a challenging aircraft to operate. These factors eventually made it so operating the Concorde was no longer economically feasible.

Environmental and regulatory considerations

One of the primary reasons for Concorde’s demise was its environmental impact, particularly its fuel consumption and sonic boom issues. Virgin Galactic’s design team is actively working on mitigating these concerns. The jet is expected to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hybrid-electric propulsion elements to reduce carbon emissions.

To address noise pollution, Virgin Galactic is exploring “boomless” supersonic flight technology, allowing for quieter operation over land. Unlike the Concorde, which was restricted to transoceanic routes due to noise regulations, this jet may have the potential to operate more flexibly across global air routes.

Another key aspect of the aircraft’s environmental strategy is its focus on aerodynamics. Its sleek, ultra-efficient design will enable it to reduce drag and minimize fuel consumption, ensuring that supersonic travel becomes more environmentally responsible than it was in the past.

Market viability and economic sustainability

The Concorde’s downfall was partly due to its limited market appeal and high operational costs. Virgin Galactic’s private jet is positioned differently—targeting a niche but highly profitable segment of private aviation rather than commercial air travel. With a business model focused on high-net-worth individuals, sovereign clients, and corporate jet services, the aircraft has a better chance of financial sustainability.

Additionally, advancements in manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing of aerospace components and AI-driven maintenance systems, will help lower operational costs, making supersonic travel more financially viable than it was in the Concorde era.

Supersonic travel for commercial passengers was never financially sustainable, but by focusing on private clients, Virgin Galactic’s jet will be able to charge premium prices for unparalleled speed and comfort. This could allow it to succeed where the Concorde failed.

The viability of hypersonic travel

Hypersonic travel—speeds exceeding Mach 5—represents the next frontier in aviation. While Virgin Galactic’s private jet is currently designed for supersonic speeds, the potential for hypersonic private aviation remains an open question.

Technological and economic challenges

The primary obstacle to hypersonic flight is the extreme heat generated at such speeds. Materials must withstand temperatures exceeding 3,000°F, requiring advanced thermal shielding and specialized engineering. This significantly raises production costs and complexity.

Furthermore, fuel efficiency becomes an even greater concern. Hypersonic aircraft would require high-energy fuel sources, potentially driving operational expenses to unsustainable levels. Unlike supersonic travel, which is becoming more economically feasible due to advancements in aerodynamics and materials science, hypersonic travel still faces substantial cost barriers.

Market demand and potential solutions

For hypersonic private jets to become viable, demand must justify development costs. While governments and defense agencies have significant interest in hypersonic technology for military applications, commercial interest remains limited due to cost and regulatory challenges.

However, breakthroughs in propulsion—such as scramjet technology and advancements in hydrogen fuel—could eventually make hypersonic private jets more feasible. If costs decline and regulatory hurdles are overcome, hypersonic travel could revolutionize international business by reducing intercontinental flight times to under two hours.

The future of supersonic private travel

Virgin Galactic’s private jet represents a very bold step toward making supersonic travel a reality for an elite few. Unlike the Concorde, which aimed to democratize high-speed air travel for commercial passengers (but ultimately fell short due to costs), this aircraft embraces exclusivity as its primary advantage.

If successful, it could pave the way for a new generation of supersonic and even hypersonic private jets, redefining business travel and international connectivity. With industry leaders like Boom Supersonic, Aerion, and even NASA working on similar projects, Virgin Galactic’s venture is a significant piece of the puzzle in the resurgence of high-speed aviation.

Virgin Galactic is also exploring future possibilities such as hypersonic travel, which could further shrink travel times. If technology and regulations allow, we may eventually see private jets capable of reaching speeds above Mach 5, making intercontinental travel nearly instantaneous.

While it may never achieve the same cultural impact as Concorde, Virgin Galactic’s private jet is poised to fulfill a long-held dream: flying at supersonic speeds with all the convenience and comfort of private aviation. The age of the Concorde may be over, but its spirit of innovation lives on in the skies of the future.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supersonic.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 10:50:05.912416

These projects are crucial for boosting domestic SAF production and meeting Japan’s estimated SAF demand of 1.7 million kiloliters by 2030.","Tokyo: Cosmo Energy Holdings is set to begin Japan’s first domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in April, a crucial step towards the nation’s goal of replacing 10% of conventional jet fuel with this cleaner alternative by 2030, reports Reuters.

Cosmo Energy, the country’s third-largest oil refiner, will produce SAF from used cooking oil at its Sakai refinery in western Japan.

“Our goal is to increase SAF supply to 300,000 kiloliters by 2030 through both domestic production and imports,” stated Takeshi Takada, general manager of new business development at Cosmo Energy.

Japanese refineries are mandated to supply SAF equivalent to 10% of their aviation fuel sales by 2030, aligning with Japan’s efforts to combat climate change and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from air travel.

A company official confirmed that 300,000 kiloliters would be sufficient to meet 10% of Cosmo’s jet fuel sales.

Cosmo Energy plans to produce 30,000 kiloliters of SAF annually at Sakai, source 150,000 kiloliters from its Sakaide site using bioethanol, and import 120,000 kiloliters from Thailand’s Bangchak and other Asian suppliers, according to Takada.

The refiner aims to establish expertise and customer relationships by launching production and sales before competitors, despite ongoing challenges in reducing costs, securing raw materials, and finalizing purchase agreements.

The Sakai project, targeting production of 24,000 kiloliters in fiscal year 2025 after accounting for site maintenance, has already secured major customers, including Japan Airlines, ANA, and DHL.

Cosmo’s next goal is to initiate SAF production at Sakaide by around 2029, with a final investment decision expected in fiscal year 2026. Both projects have received government subsidies, covering approximately half of their capital expenditures.

Cosmo declined to disclose production costs or SAF prices for the Sakai facility but anticipates profitability with government subsidies. It is estimated that SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel.

While increased production volume could potentially reduce distribution costs, significant cost reductions are unlikely due to raw material constraints, which constitute a large portion of expenses, Takada explained.

“Japan’s subsidy program is at a moderate level compared to global standards. Countries will compete to offer attractive subsidy schemes for SAF deployment to maintain hub airport status,” Takada said.

Recently, the Sakaide plant and three other projects received part of 340 billion yen in government subsidies over five years to support domestic SAF production.

These projects include Eneos’ 400,000 kiloliter facility in Wakayama, Idemitsu Kosan’s 250,000 kiloliter plant in Yamaguchi, and Taiyo Oil’s 200,000 kiloliter project in Okinawa, all currently in the design phase.

Idemitsu has also received a separate subsidy for a 100,000 kiloliter project at its Chiba refinery near Tokyo.

These projects are crucial for boosting domestic SAF production and meeting Japan’s estimated SAF demand of 1.7 million kiloliters by 2030.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SAF-Bioenergy.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 12:50:39.566998

Carbon Market ""The U.S. carbon market has taken a step back,"" Meyer said.
The Global Carbon Market The U.S. has a voluntary carbon market with three states that have a mandatory carbon program through their low carbon fuel standard: California, Oregon, and Washington.
""We estimate that the U.S. carbon market is worth $2–3 billion and that may stretch to $5 billion,"" Meyer said.
Program Qualifications There are a variety of products and practices that farmers can employ that will make them eligible for carbon market programs.","Low commodity prices are driving interest in carbon market programs, according to Jarod Creed, owner of JC Ag Financial Services, and owner and partner of Elite Ag Insurance. That was evident at the 2025 Commodity Classic as farmers packed into the Successful Farming Main Stage to attend the panel “Finding the Right Carbon Program.”

In addition to Creed, panelists included Kelly Garrett, Pete Meyer, and Kaylynn Henkenius.

In 2020, Garrett, a sixth-generation Iowa farmer with a 7,000-acre no-till operation, became the first farmer in the nation to sell carbon credits to a corporate buyer. In 2024, Garrett teamed up with Creed, Meyer, and Mike Busing to launch Regenerative Roots Solutions to help farmers navigate the different carbon market programs available. Meyers is a principal economist and partner at Regenerative Roots and Muddy Boots Ag. Busing is an agronomist who owns an ag retail business where Henkenius works as a sustainability adviser. The panel covered the state of the U.S. carbon market, the need for better data collection, eligibility qualifications, as well as the opportunities for farmers in the global market and the potential financial impact of signing up for a program.

The U.S. Carbon Market

""The U.S. carbon market has taken a step back,"" Meyer said. ""A lot of that has to do with the uncertainty with the Trump administration. We heard from USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins on Sunday beating up again on some of the programs that were in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which included 45Z for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).""

Section 45Z of the IRA provides a tax credit for production of clean transportation fuels, including for SAF. There are three buckets for how that credit could be divided up: the sustainable aviation fuel producer, the ethanol company, and the farmer for producing corn with a lower carbon intensity (CI) score. ""A year ago, I was more excited about the financial possibilities for a farmer because it was going to be a dollar or 50 cents a bushel for a CI score of zero,"" Meyer said. ""But the fact of the matter is, once you get down to that third bucket, I'm not sure how much of it is going to end up in the farmer's pocket.

“I think we have to focus less on how much money could possibly come to a farmer from 45Z and focus more on the demand for corn, which we are in desperate need of,"" he continued. ""The airlines are committed to net zero emissions by 2050 and SAF needs to be part of that program. It's consumer driven, and it creates more demand.""

The Global Carbon Market

The U.S. has a voluntary carbon market with three states that have a mandatory carbon program through their low carbon fuel standard: California, Oregon, and Washington. In Europe, business owners must buy a carbon credit for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted.

""We estimate that the U.S. carbon market is worth $2–3 billion and that may stretch to $5 billion,"" Meyer said.

How does that compare to Europe? ""The European market last year was about a trillion dollars,"" Meyer added. ""When you combine the U.S. corn and soybean crop, that's worth maybe $125 billion.""

The reason for that is, global buyers, whether it's in Europe or Asia, ""are very interested in the type of credits that the U.S. farmer produces by sequestering carbon in the soil,"" Meyer said.

Regenerative Roots connects U.S. farmers with those global buyers.

Better Data Collection

One key part of enabling these carbon credit transactions is ensuring accurate data collection from the farmers. Regenerative Roots facilitates this by taking a more hands on approach.

""We make a connection to the farmer's data platform of choice. John Deere Operations Center and Climate FieldView are the two main ones,"" Henkenius said. ""From that platform, we're able to get 60-80% of the grower's data in most cases. Then I have a conversation with the farmer to go back and fill in any gaps.""

That could include adding in if a field has tile or irrigation or making sure that fertilizer passes from ag retailers are included. ""Once data collection is complete, farmers move into contracting and payment,"" Henkenius added.

That is the reason Regenerative Roots exists, Garrett explained. ""Creed is going to make fun of me when he talks and tell you that I don't even know how to log into my John Deere Ops Center, but Kaylynn does. And that's the reason for that,"" Garrett said. ""None of our data is perfect, and it needs to be to go into these programs.""

Meyer added to that point: ""The strongest carbon credits command a premium, and the strongest carbon credits are the ones with the cleanest data that can be verified in the shortest period of time.""

Program Qualifications

There are a variety of products and practices that farmers can employ that will make them eligible for carbon market programs. Those differ by region and should still be grounded in what agronomically makes sense for a grower, Garrett said.

""Sustainability means different things in different parts of the country. In the hills of western Iowa, no-till and cover crops are the first two that come to mind,"" he said. ""In southeast Arkansas, it's water usage."" Other practices include variable rate fertilizer applications, integrating livestock, plant growth regulators, stress mitigation products, and nitrogen use efficiency products to name a few.

Financial Impact

In 2025 so far, Regenerative Roots has distributed $10 million to farmers from various programs. ""It's not chump change,"" Creed said. ""I wonder if there are going to be situations in the next couple of years where 10–20% of overall revenue on a farm is going to come from carbon farming.

""There are situations where we could be talking about $100–200 an acre based on practices,"" he continued. ""In an environment when we're looking at $100–200 negative margins, it's simple math.""

Garrett participates in Truterra's carbon program and is waiting on his credits from 2022, 2023, and 2024 to go through their model, which should be done in a few weeks. He estimates that he nets a little over $30 an acre selling carbon credits.",https://www.agriculture.com/thmb/IYvWY9tHdt_mwKKeX8a7vN9VXTY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/commodity-classic-carbon-d3623ca2fb0d40ab956cf5e62b742677.JPG,N,,2025-03-08 09:50:07.827805

With its groundbreaking “Boomless Cruise” technology, Boom Supersonic aims to revolutionize air travel, including to Hawaii—but not everyone is convinced this vision will take off.

Boom’s ambitious plans have drawn strong opinions from aviation enthusiasts, skeptical industry veterans, and Hawaii travelers. Some see this as a game-changer, while others doubt it will ever take off. With Overture now in development, the real question is whether Hawaii will see supersonic flights or if this is another Concorde-style dream.

The flight gathered critical data on aerodynamics, acoustic impacts, and the ability to achieve supersonic speeds without generating the dreaded audible sonic boom on the ground.

With these tests complete, Boom is shifting focus to Overture, the aircraft designed to bring commercial supersonic travel back to the skies.

Some travelers already imagine the possibilities, with one reader saying they would “sign up for supersonic Hawaii-to-Paris in six hours.” Others remain skeptical, questioning whether shaving two hours off a flight from San Francisco to Honolulu is worth the cost.

Boomless Cruise redirects the sonic boom upward into the atmosphere, preventing it from reaching the ground. This innovation could allow Overture to achieve supersonic speeds over the U.S. without the noise disruptions that grounded past overland flights. For Hawaii, this could extend beyond typical West Coast routes. Boom claims it can cut travel times from the U.S. West Coast to just three hours—if regulatory and logistical hurdles can be overcome.

A former Concorde ground school attendee dismissed the idea entirely, calling XB-1 “a vanity project” and predicting it “will never make scheduled flights to Hawaii in our lifetime.” Not everyone is ready to rule it out. Some see a strong opportunity here. “If you can get from Oakland to Honolulu gate to gate in two and a half hours, I will be in love with Boom,” wrote another traveler.

From test jet to airliner: the real challenge.

Making the jump from their single-pilot test jet to a commercial airliner remains a massive challenge. Commenters pointed out that XB-1 at just 68 feet long is a fraction of the size and complexity of the planned commercial aircraft. Jon questioned whether Boom could scale up successfully, saying, “Scaling from a single-seat demonstrator to a passenger jet is an entirely different engineering challenge. They’re not even close to proving that part yet.” Others echoed concerns about the leap in engine requirements, manufacturing, and certification. DICKIE_D dismissed the XB-1 as “a publicity stunt,” adding, “Show me a full-size prototype, and then we’ll talk.”

The regulatory hurdles ahead.

While Boom’s technology is promising, FAA regulations remain a significant barrier. Current U.S. aviation law prohibits all supersonic flight over land, regardless of noise impact. Government regulators, often cautious about tourism-related advancements, may resist such a significant change. However, some believe Hawaii’s unique geography makes it an ideal candidate for supersonic travel, even under current rules.

Some readers think Hawaii state officials would try to stop Boom. One commenter argued, “The backwards Hawaii government will never allow Boom. They’d rather force tourists to arrive by outrigger than approve a technological step forward.”

Others believe a policy shift is possible. An aviation enthusiast pointed out, “Hawaii is being used as an example because once you are feet wet off the west coast, you can punch through the number and not worry about sonic boom fines.”

FAA regulations, not Hawaii lawmakers, will ultimately determine if Boom can proceed. Regardless, Hawaii remains one of the few viable U.S. destinations where supersonic travel is possible even under current rules.

Who will fly supersonic to Hawaii?

Even if Boom overcomes regulatory challenges, the question remains about who will pay the price for supersonic travel. Many doubt the average traveler will afford it.

“Another giveaway to the ultra-wealthy,” one commenter wrote. “Rich people don’t care that a ticket will cost upwards of $5,000… If they did, they’d just fly first class on a regular jet with the rest of us.”

Others see the value in speed. A longtime Hawaii traveler pointed out that “we fly first class 97% of the time anyway. If costs are about the same, we’d definitely fly the SST.”

Industry experts also raise concerns about commercial viability. One reader questioned the financial model, asking, “Would you rather get there four hours faster in a cramped aircraft or pay for a more spacious first-class experience? Comfort over speed every time.”

Boom’s vision, whether realistic or not, aligns with Hawaii’s evolving tourism model, where fewer visitors are expected to spend more per trip. If airlines see demand from high-spending travelers willing to pay a premium for speed, supersonic flights to Hawaii could become part of this shift.

Overture’s timeline and what’s next.

With XB-1’s test program complete, Boom is moving full speed ahead with Overture. The company expects its supersonic airliner to roll out by the early 2030s, with test flights targeted before commercial service begins. More precise dates haven’t been provided.

Boom claims Overture will run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel and be far more efficient than Concorde. However, skepticism remains about whether the necessary engines will even exist. One critic dismissed the project outright, saying, “The airplane will never exist, not least of which is because its engine will never exist. The project is a scam.”

Despite these doubts, airline interest continues. United Airlines has ordered 15 Overture aircraft, and Japan Airlines has invested in Boom’s development. Whether those planes will serve Hawaii remains unknown.",https://beatofhawaii.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/1000011163.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 09:50:26.315738

Here’s how: ✈️ Aviation is going green, but it won’t be cheap. The UK government is rolling out a Revenue Certainty Mechanism to support so called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production. The goal? Make it financially viable for investors and position the UK as a leader in green aviation. ✅ Key moves to make SAF take off: • SAF Mandate starting in 2025 • Airspace modernization projects • £63 million boost through the Advanced Fuels Fund But here’s the real game-changer: a guaranteed strike price model. Think of it like this: • If SAF prices fall below a set price, the government steps in to cover the difference. • If prices rise above that threshold, producers pay back the surplus. 💡 Who’s paying for this? Not taxpayers. The aviation industry itself will foot the bill via a levy on fuel suppliers—a “polluter pays” principle in action. 🚨 Why does this matter? Because SAF production isn’t easy—or cheap. • Plants cost £600M-£2B to build. • There’s no global price benchmark for SAF. • Investment is competing with other low-carbon tech. 💰 Breaking down the cost: • A single SAF plant could cost £2B over 15 years. • Industry-wide costs to meet 2035 targets? £10B over 15 years (but £7B could be repaid if SAF prices rise). • Minimal impact on ticket prices, since fuel price stability could balance things out. 📅 What’s next? • Consultation runs March 3 - March 31, 2025. • A Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill lands in 2025, with full legislation by 2026. • Industry input will shape the levy structure.

The Fargo Job Service office will also be open later hours — 5 to 7 p.m. — on April 8 and 9 for CNH employees, Lacher said.
Mahoney, who was out of the office when reached, said he did not recall seeing a WARN notice yet.","FARGO — The Case New Holland plant in Fargo will be laying off nearly 200 hourly workers, a company spokeswoman confirmed Friday, March 7.

“CNH has announced workforce reductions at its Fargo, N.D., facility due to current and anticipated market conditions,” Kristina Post, a communications specialist with CNH said in an emailed statement.

“Employees were notified earlier this week, with approximately 198 hourly positions affected,” Post said. “CNH is dedicated to supporting these individuals during their transition.”

The Fargo Case New Holland plant is at 3401 1st Ave. N. Workers at the plant build tractors and loaders for the agriculture and construction industries.

Carey Fry, the workforce center manager at the Fargo Job Service North Dakota office, said workers have begun inquiring about unemployment benefits, and that Job Service is in contact with CNH “to help their employees that are going to be let go.”

Fry said her office has been informing CNH employees about what services Job Service provides, and how to file for unemployment insurance if necessary.

Fry said that when a company does a significant layoff, Job Service will provide services on site.

“This is a big one (a layoff). This is a major one, right, then we will go on site and help them with whatever needs they have in terms of getting a new job and applying for unemployment,” she said.

Large layoffs often require the filing of a notice under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining (WARN) Act.

Job Service North Dakota did not get an official WARN Act notice, said Ruth Lacher, the Bismarck-based manager of the agency’s workforce programs division. However, CNH “made us aware of the layoff. They were in contact with Job Service,” Lacher said Friday.

Lacher said Job Service will be holding a job fair at the plant for CNH employees on March 18, inviting local employers to meet with individuals being laid off.

The Fargo Job Service office will also be open later hours — 5 to 7 p.m. — on April 8 and 9 for CNH employees, Lacher said.

Employees entitled to notice under WARN include managers and supervisors, as well as hourly and salaried workers. WARN requires that notice also be given to employees' representatives, the local chief elected official and the state dislocated worker unit.

The Forum contacted Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney on Friday. Mahoney, who was out of the office when reached, said he did not recall seeing a WARN notice yet.

“I don’t remember reading it up to this date. You are right, I should get a notice if they are going to have that many people laid off,” Mahoney said. “It’s unfortunate. We love that team.”

“To our knowledge, we have not seen anything yet,” said Fargo’s City Administrator Michael Redlinger. However, he added that the notice could still be in the mail.

The Forum has also reached out to Jeff Hoopman, directing business representative for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace workers, for comment on the layoffs.

In early February, the West Central Tribune reported that CNH Industrial America was permanently laying off 175 people in April at its Benson, Minnesota, facility.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, WARN protects workers, their families and communities by requiring employers with 100 or more employees (generally not counting those who have worked less than six months in the last 12 months and those who work an average of less than 20 hours a week) to provide at least 60 calendar days advance written notice of a plant closing and mass layoff affecting 50 or more employees at a single site of employment.

Regular federal, state, local and federally recognized tribal government entities that provide public services are not covered.

Not all dislocations require a 60-day notice, according to the Department of Labor. The WARN Act makes certain exceptions to the requirements when employers can show that layoffs or worksite closings occur due to faltering companies, unforeseen business circumstances and natural disasters. In such instances, the WARN Act requires employers to provide as much notice to their employees as possible, according to the department.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/ed9cd67/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4431x2954+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcc%2Fd5%2F64a8f9bf49fba95ec80d1950b94e%2F030825-n-ff-cnhlayoffs-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 09:50:32.712611

Abstract

This paper investigates stakeholders’ motivations and barriers within emerging Future Flight business models. Aviation is vital for developing economies, and the urgent need for a transition towards more sustainable practices is gaining prominence. Hence, understanding the factors shaping Future Flight technology’s adoption is crucial. Drawing on ten interviews with pioneering Future Flight-related technologists, business leaders, social entrepreneurs, and policymakers, we employed the Technology-Organisation-Environment framework and Transaction Cost Economics theory to analyse critical factors influencing Future Flight business models. We show participants are concerned about sustainable aviation fuel availability and Future Flight technologies’ readiness. We emphasise the importance of technology maturity and commercial viability for successful Future Flight implementation. Smaller start-ups are poised to lead such development because of their nimbleness and sustainability focus. Concurrently, larger companies face challenges transitioning from traditional business models. We identified regulatory frameworks, social acceptance, and public demand as key drivers. Finally, we show how entrepreneurs desire standardised global regulations to support sustainable aviation practices.

(Brazil Ministry of Foreign Affairs) Brazil welcomed with great satisfaction the technical recommendation on sustainable aviation fuels made during the 13th triennial meeting of the Aviation Environmental Protection Committee (CAEP) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

The recommendation, which will be submitted for confirmation by the ICAO Council in June, addresses multiple or sequential cropping for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. The practice, which involves growing two or more annual crops on the same land, is common in agriculture in tropical and subtropical regions.

Based on technical, scientific and environmental aspects, the CAEP recommendation will allow ICAO methodologies to consider the specific realities of tropical and subtropical regions. This is a long-standing request from Brazil and other countries interested in contributing to the decarbonization goals of the aviation sector.

By recognizing a greater number of sustainable practices and raw materials as eligible for large-scale SAF production, ICAO is acting in line with its mandate under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to promote emissions reductions in the international aviation sector. Although SAF production is still at very low levels globally, it will be essential for international aviation, currently a major emitter of greenhouse gases, to achieve the global goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-03-08 05:50:21.573848

“The National Rural Health Association (NRHA) applauds Representatives Budzinski, Finstad, Davis, and Taylor for their introduction of the Rural Wellness Act.
We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to address the behavioral health shortage in rural areas,” said Alan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Health Association.
The Rural Wellness Act is also endorsed by the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors (NACBHDD) and the National Association for Rural Mental Health (NARMH).","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Nikki Budzinski (IL-13), Congressman Brad Finstad (MN-01), Congressman Don Davis (NC-01), and Congressman Dave Taylor (OH-02) introduced the bipartisan Rural Wellness Act to expand access to quality health care in rural communities by providing competitive grants for telemedicine projects, with an emphasis on projects focused on substance use disorder treatment.

“No one should have to travel hours just to visit the doctor, and telemedicine is an efficient way to reduce the barriers to care so often faced by rural communities,” said Congresswoman Budzinski. “I’m proud to be working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce legislation to expand access to this technology while prioritizing care for mental and behavioral health, as these challenges impact countless folks across the country – no matter where you live. I’ll always fight to ensure that rural residents can receive the high-quality, accessible care they deserve.”

“Access to telehealth in rural communities has been life-changing for those who would otherwise have a difficult time traveling long distances to the nearest medical facility,” said Congressman Finstad. “I joined Congresswoman Budzinski in reintroducing the Rural Wellness Act to ensure residents of southern Minnesota have access to timely, high-quality healthcare through expanded telemedicine services.”

""Community mental health services in rural America must be more accessible and available, as they are in other areas of the country,"" said Congressman Davis. ""The Rural Wellness Act prioritizes behavioral and mental health services for rural communities and ensures we are not leaving behind those who need and seek help.""

“There is a devastatingly high rate of mental health challenges and substance abuse in our Nation, and living in a rural area shouldn’t be a barrier to accessing critical health care services,” said Congressman Taylor. “I am proud to help lead the reintroduction of the Rural Wellness Act with Congresswoman Budzinski to increase rural Americans’ access to behavioral telehealth and substance abuse treatment.”

The Rural Wellness Act would reauthorize USDA Rural Development's Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program through Fiscal Year (FY) 2029, including a 17 percent set-aside for telemedicine projects that provide substance use disorder treatment. Moreover, this legislation would improve the program by including language prioritizing behavioral and mental health treatment services.

Eligible areas include communities with populations of 20,000 or fewer, and funds may be used for telemedicine equipment, broadband facilities, and technology. Awards range from $50,000 to $1 million with a minimum 15 percent match requirement.

“The National Rural Health Association (NRHA) applauds Representatives Budzinski, Finstad, Davis, and Taylor for their introduction of the Rural Wellness Act. This bill would prioritize grant applications that address behavioral and mental health in critical Rural Development programs and help to ensure that rural communities have adequate access to local, much needed behavioral health services. We look forward to continuing to work with Congress to address the behavioral health shortage in rural areas,” said Alan Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of the National Rural Health Association.

The Rural Wellness Act is also endorsed by the National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors (NACBHDD) and the National Association for Rural Mental Health (NARMH).

Council delegates will decide whether to move forward with the new name via a majority vote on Aug. 1 during its 65th Annual Board of Delegates Meeting in Grand Rapids, MI as the organization celebrates its rich history in supporting the U.S. agricultural industry over the past 65 years.

“The reality is we are now not just limited to taking meetings within the global ethanol space, we are interfacing with players in the broader energy industry,” said Ryan LeGrand, USGC president and CEO, during remarks in Austin. “Ethanol and related products have become part of our identity in practice, but not in name, and it is time to signal to these new audiences that we have something to offer.”

The Council has undergone this process before, when it changed its name from the original U.S. Feed Grains Council to its current title in 1998.

“We are at an inflection point for our organization – one that requires our members’ consideration of an amended organizational name that carefully balances and maintains the 65 years of brand equity we’ve built but also is broad enough to reflect what the organization is about as a whole and where we are going in the future,” LeGrand said.

The change will require three separate changes to the organization’s bylaws, and if approved by delegates during the Council’s summer meeting, updates to the Council’s online presence and physical signage to match the amended name will be gradually implemented.

This week a new state economic forecast confirmed that there is a decrease of the surplus, which includes the uncertainty of a federal funding freeze. With President Trumps’s off and on again tariffs, pausing of grants, and threats to cut Medicare, inflation is up and the growth on domestic products (GDP) is down.

Last November, the state budget forecast showed a $3.7 billion surplus over the current budget cycle, a $616 million positive balance in the upcoming biennium, and our highest budget reserve fund ever–all due to responsible DFL governance. But as of today, Minnesota’s projected positive balance has shrunk to $456 million.

Instead of bringing down prices as they promised on the campaign trail, President Trump and Republicans in Congress are on the verge of enacting a sweeping tax cut for corporations and the top 1% of earners, and they’re going to pay for it by slashing Medicare which is the largest portion of the federal investments in health care for children, families, seniors, and people with disabilities. We receive $128 billion dollars from the federal government; that is 1/3 of our state budget. If even one fourth of those cuts happen, it could blow a huge hole in our state budget.

This latest budget forecast means that the Legislature must be laser-focused on working together to set a balanced state budget by the time session ends on May 20.

As your state representative, I’m committed to fighting for an economy where everyone in Hopkins, St. Louis Park, and Edina can get ahead. I will continue to oppose bills to place barriers to healthcare access, cut education funding, and repeal policies that help Minnesotans thrive like Paid Family and Medical Leave.

Despite the devastating, proposed cuts at the federal level, we did receive some good news in Minnesota reflecting our commitment to deliver reliable investments into our state’s schools. In the 2023-2024 biennium, DFLers delivered an education budget that updates Minnesota’s general education formula to be indexed to inflation. In previous years, Minnesota schools have needed to wait until the legislature passes the biennial budget to know whether or not the education funding formula would be increased. The Minnesota Department of Education recently shared with Minnesota school districts, due to indexing, the new increase to the per-pupil formula allowance taking effect for the 2025-2026 will translate to a new investment of $7,481 per student which is a $200 per pupil increase.

You can read my press release for more details here.

Floor Action

On Monday, the Minnesota House debated House File 12, a Republican-sponsored bill that would exclude our transgender athletes from playing sports in our schools. This is in direct conflict with our Minnesota Human Rights Act, as well as the Minnesota State High School League's policy that has been in place for the last ten years with no issues. I spoke on the House Floor about the dangerous path this bill would take us on if passed. History has shown us that once you start excluding a group of people just because of who they are, it doesn’t end there, and it never ends well. You can view my floor remarks here. House Democrats were unanimous in their opposition to the bill, which did not receive enough votes to pass the Minnesota House.

On Thursday, we voted down HF 13, a ‘Shoot First’ bill which would remove Minnesota’s duty to retreat, allowing Minnesotans to use deadly force when they feel any level of threat in our public spaces. When this policy has been put in place in other states, it has been shown to lead to even more gun violence victims and more loss of life. Minnesota continues to make progress on reducing gun violence. The bill failed to reach the 68 votes needed to pass on a party line vote. I was glad we were able to pass two bipartisan bills to address sex trafficking in Minnesota and will continue to work across the aisle with my colleagues on setting our state budget for the next two years.

Committee Work

Committees are starting to get busy as the GOP continues to move their agenda through committees without hearing many of our bills.

On Monday in the Ways & Means Committee, we heard a Rep. Baker (R) bill to delay the implementation of Paid Family & Medical Leave (PFML). This program is on track to be implemented in 2026 and to delay it would cost Minnesotans money and valuable time.

On Tuesday in Taxes we heard change market value exclusions on home day care properties and a tax credit for remodeling underutilized buildings which Hopkins Mayor Patrick Hanlon testified in support of. I am excited to have my first bill up this session in the Tax committee next week to provide non-profit daycares a break on property taxes. In Education Finance, we heard a bill to expand non-public pupil aid to counselors to K-6 students. Current law allows for counselors in non-public schools in grades 7-12.

Wednesday in the Taxes Committee, we heard a variety of interesting proposals including one that provides a $9 billion dollar tax cut to benefit those in our higher tax brackets. We also finished our discussion around tax exemptions for data center purchases.

On Thursday, the Tax committee heard bills to increase funding for Soil and Water Conversation Districts, tax exemptions on particular properties, and a bill to provide a tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel. We finished up the week of hearings in Education Finance with an informational hearing on two bills that would allow school districts to ignore any of the initaitives we put into place to help our schools and students, including how they are able to allocate funds within the school district.

Constituent Visits and Events

Saturday, Jacques and I attended the Hopkins Education Foundation Gala. It was fun to spend time with friends while supporting the Hopkins School District. We also got to see the new mascot costumes for the Hopkins Royals.

This week was very busy at the Capitol with multiple groups of constituents and organizations visiting to advocate for a variety of legislative policy. A group of developers and contractors met with me to talk discuss the 'Homes for All' bills.

A big thank you to Rep. Julie Greene for organizing a group of students to come to the Capitol and learn about it’s inner workings. They met with legislators, a lobbyist, our House Chief Clerk Patrick Murphy, took a tour of the Capitol, and sat in on the House Education Finance Committee.

Community Education is a very important part of our public schools. I had the opportunity to meet with a group of community education leaders to discuss some of the challenges they are facing with programs across the state and how legislators can help.

I had a chance to meet with an amazing group of U of M pharmacy students, as well as two practicing pharmacists. We discussed the barriers to patient care and the need for increased reimbursements for our pharmacies all over the state.

As the Lead on the House Education Finance Committee, I frequently meet with school districts across Minnesota. I had a great conversation this week with members of the South Saint Paul school district: Superintendent Brian Zambreno; School Board Chair Kim Humann; School Board Member Paul Cummings; Representative Rick Hansen and Mary Frances Clardy. They were asking for additional Compensatory Aid so they can help their students thrive.

The Full-Service Community Schools model is an incredible program providing state funds for districts to develop public private partnerships so they can provide wrap around services to our students and families in our public schools. Thank you to Craig Sweet for the visit to talk about the increased funding needs for full-service community schools to expand across Minnesota.

Constituents David Homans with the Citizens Climate Lobby and Karin Cotter with the Center for Energy and Environment met with me during the Clean Energy Business Day. Thank you for all you are doing to make sure we leave the planet a little better for the next generation.

Some of Minnesota's finest from the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees met with me on Thursday. These are the folks that work in every one of our state agencies in areas from cybersecurity, public safety, healthcare, and more. Thank you for your service to our state!

It was great to see Hopkins Councilmembers Heidi Garrido and Brian Hunke who were visiting the Capitol with the League of Minnesota Cities.

I also had visits from our incredible school social workers, the Minnesota Catholic Conference, and the PACER Center. It is wonderful to see the Capitol full of folks who want to have their voices heard. As we continue our work to produce a balanced two year state budget, we will continue to hear from groups from all over the state.

No others would face the same results,” Buis said. He warned that the decision puts major economic opportunities for the state at risk. “The governor and legislature talk about being open for opportunity, but two of the biggest economic opportunities ever proposed for South Dakota are now at risk based on what they just passed.” Buis contrasted South Dakota’s approach with North Dakota, where leaders have embraced carbon capture as a strategy to support ethanol and agriculture. He emphasized the need for expanding demand in the farming sector, arguing that carbon capture could be a key driver. “Every year our corn yields go up, every year the efficiency of ethanol plants goes up, but we’ve basically been running in place on the demand front,” he said. “Capturing carbon and creating a low-carbon feedstock like ethanol for sustainable aviation fuel or higher blends is absolutely a winner—and something we desperately need.”",,N,,2025-03-07 17:53:45.303223

CCS Pipelines: Silver Bullet or Misfire?

In 2022, former President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which created the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and upped the benefit for the 45Q tax credit for carbon sequestration.

The year before, the federal government announced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge to escalate SAF’s market share in fueling American aircraft. SAF can be made from ethanol and is seen as a potentially immense new market for that cornstarch-based fuel. However, in order for a SAF producer to claim the 45Z credit, they must use ethanol with a carbon intensity (CI) score much lower than the current Midwest average of 55.2.

These factors, combined with growing societal interest in lowering carbon emissions and the looming existential threat of electric vehicles, signaled to the ethanol industry it needed to find a way to lower CI. CCS pipeline projects emerged as a favored solution.

Capturing CO2 from the fermentation process of ethanol production is estimated to reduce ethanol’s CI by roughly 30 points, according to a study commissioned by Growth Energy, a national ethanol trade association.

Growth Energy’s study looked into the various ways ethanol producers and corn farmers could help lower ethanol CI. Among the many steps a plant could take, the study showed CCS had the best balance between CI reduction and cost of implementation.

Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA), put the benefits of CCS this way: “There’s lots of things you can do to reduce your carbon score. If you don’t do CCS, you almost have to do everything else, and you still may not get there, depending on your facility, and it would be infinitely more expensive.

“If you’re a standard Iowa plant at a 55 CI score and you do CCS alone, you’re probably attractive for SAF. If you do a couple of the other things, you’re going to be really attractive for SAF. So that is why we are focused on CCS. It’s the affordable thing that literally unlocks the market.”

However, from environmental groups to landowners, CCS pipeline projects have faced opposition that jeopardizes their success. It begs the question: What viable alternatives are there?

On-Site Sequestration

Some plants, such as Red Tail Energy in Richardton, North Dakota, may be able to sequester their own CO2. However, CO2 cannot be sequestered just anywhere; the proper geology must exist underground to hold the CO2 in place. Successful Farming compared ethanol plant locations in the middle of the country, where most plants are located, with areas identified by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to have large-scale CO2 storage potential. Many plants do not overlap with the areas USGS identified. (See map.)

Shaw also noted that even if a plant were advantageously located for CCS, it may still need to pipe the CO2 to an appropriate location off the plant’s property.

Alternative Uses for CO2

Ethanol producers may choose to find an alternative use for CO2. That’s exactly what Adkins Energy, an ethanol plant in Lena, Illinois, is seeking to do.

Bill Howell, chief operating officer of the plant in northwest Illinois, said Adkins Energy is working with another company, Real Carbon Technology, to convert captured CO2 into green methanol.

“I want to make something out of a raw material that I’ve been given, and frankly, I don’t look at CO2 as a waste; I look at it as a raw material,” he said. “And I think in the future, it’s going to become a very valuable raw material, particularly if we can figure out how to convert it to clean fuels.” According to the Methanol Institute, a methanol industry trade association, methanol can be used as a fuel and to make hundreds of products, including plastics, paints, and car parts.

The company expects to have a demonstration production process running by late summer and be fully operational by late 2027. Howell said he expects the project to reduce the CI of Adkins Energy’s ethanol by 25 points.

CO2 can also be captured and sold for a variety of uses, including livestock processing and water treatment. But IRFA’s Shaw argues this is not a realistic alternative to sequestration.

“The industrial CO2 market includes using carbon dioxide to preserve food safely such as frozen food products,” he said. “That market has been longstanding for many years now, and a handful of ethanol plants supply it. So that’s not a viable market opportunity for plants not already doing it. It’s saturated.”

Plant Energy and Farmer Practices

Joe Kakesh, general counsel at Growth Energy, said if CCS pipeline projects don’t pan out, the industry would look to strategies that fall into one of two major categories: plant energy use and on-farm practices.

Growth Energy’s study found ethanol plants that use combined heat and power (CHP) systems can reduce CI by nearly 20 points if the systems are fueled with biomass such as corn stover.

“Currently, about 20% of the existing 187 U.S. ethanol plants already have CHP systems,” the study said. “Although most of the systems use natural gas, biomass can be mixed with natural gas in many CHP boiler systems at biorefineries.”

Kakesh said corn grown on farms that plant cover crops will be attractive; the association’s study attributed a nearly 24-point CI reduction to cover crops. However, Kakesh pointed out they cannot be planted in every environment. There is also a cost to the farmer.

Concerning the cost barrier to some ethanol plant innovations and farm practices, Kakesh said: “The cost issue only highlights the importance of continuing the incentives for the development of these technologies, in particular through the section 45Z tax incentive that was passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act…. That tax incentive can be a powerful means to invest in a diverse portfolio of technologies, both from the perspective of the biorefinery, and from the perspective of the farmer, because the way the farmer gains value is that they … are able to sell their corn at a premium.”",,N,,2025-03-07 17:53:50.935627

This funding, comprised of a €40 million venture debt loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a €30 million grant from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, marks a pivotal step in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, particularly aviation.

The announcement, made at the EIB-Group-Forum in Luxembourg, underscores the strategic importance of e-fuels in achieving net-zero emissions. INERATEC's innovative Power-to-Liquid technology, which converts green hydrogen and CO2 into synthetic aviation fuel, is central to this initiative. The Frankfurt plant will utilize CO2 from a local biogas plant and hydrogen from an existing chlorine production facility, demonstrating a circular economy approach to sustainable fuel production.

INERATEC's process involves combining hydrogen with CO2 from biogenic sources, such as biogas plants or industrial emissions, to produce synthetic crude oil. This oil can then be refined into various synthetic fuels, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marine fuels, and e-Diesel. By utilizing captured CO2, the plant significantly reduces the carbon footprint of these fuels, contributing to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

The new funding will enable INERATEC to scale up its production capacity and commercialize its reactor technology. The Frankfurt plant is expected to produce up to 2,500 tons of e-fuel annually, contributing to the aviation sector's transition to sustainable alternatives. With a single long-haul flight between Frankfurt and New York consuming approximately 80 tons of kerosene, the plant's output has the potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of numerous flights.

The project aligns with the European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which mandates a minimum e-SAF blend of 1.2% by 2030, creating a substantial market opportunity for INERATEC. The collaboration between INERATEC, the EIB, and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst exemplifies how public-private partnerships can drive the commercialization of clean climate technologies.

EIB Vice-President Nicola Beer emphasized the bank's commitment to a competitive net-zero economy, particularly in sectors like aviation. Mario Fernandez, Head of Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, highlighted the importance of real-world projects in driving down costs and attracting investment in e-fuels.

The EIB's venture debt loan is supported by the InvestEU programme, which leverages private and public funds to support EU policy priorities, including the European Green Deal. The Innovation Fund, financed by the EU Emissions Trading System, provides a top-up guarantee to the InvestEU programme, further bolstering support for innovative climate technologies.",,N,,2025-03-07 14:36:36.401871

Japan targets to replace 10% of jet fuel with SAF by 2030

Cosmo Energy Holdings is set to launch Japan's first domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel in April, a step toward the country's goal of replacing 10% of jet fuel with a cleaner alternative, though cost-cutting challenges remain.

Cosmo, the nation's third-largest refiner, will produce SAF from used cooking oil at its Sakai refinery in western Japan.

""Our goal is to boost SAF supply to 300,000 kilolitres by 2030 through domestic production and imports,"" Takeshi Takada, general manager of new business development, said.

Japanese refiners must supply SAF equivalent to 10% of their aviation fuel sales by 2030, as Japan works to combat climate change and aligns with global efforts to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from airplanes.

A company official said 300,000 kl (1.89 million barrels) would be sufficient to meet 10% of Cosmo's jet sales.

Cosmo plans to produce 30,000 kl of SAF annually at Sakai, supply 150,000 kl from its Sakaide site in western Japan using bioethanol and import 120,000 kl from Thailand's Bangchak and other Asian suppliers, Takada said.

The refiner aims to build expertise and customer relationships by launching production and sales ahead of competitors, despite challenges in reducing costs, securing raw materials and locking in buyers, he said.

The Sakai project, targeting production of 24,000 kl in fiscal 2025 after accounting for site maintenance, has already secured most customers, including Japan Airlines (JAL) and DHL.

Cosmo's next goal is to start SAF production at Sakaide by around 2029, with a final investment decision expected in fiscal 2026. Both projects have secured government subsidies, covering about half of capital expenditures.

Cosmo declined to disclose Sakai's production costs or SAF prices, but the company expects to turn a profit with the help of subsidies. SAF is estimated to cost three to five times more than conventional jet fuel.

While higher production volume could lower distribution costs, significant cost reductions are unlikely due to raw material constraints, which make up a large portion of expenses, Takada said.

""Japan's subsidy scheme is at a medium level by global standards ... Countries will compete to offer attractive subsidy schemes for SAF deployment to maintain hub airport status,"" Takada said.

Recently, the Sakaide plant and three other projects secured part of 340 billion yen ($2.3 billion) in government subsidies over five years to support local SAF production.

The projects include Eneos' 400,000-kl facility in Wakayama, Idemitsu Kosan's 250,000-kl plant in Yamaguchi and Taiyo Oil's 200,000-kl project in Okinawa, all still in the design phase.

Idemitsu has also secured a separate subsidy for a 100,000-kl project in its Chiba refinery near Tokyo.

These projects are key to boosting domestic production and meeting Japan's estimated SAF demand of 1.7 million kl by 2030.

Pages on the federal government’s SAF Grand Challenge were also updated to reflect the new name. The challenge is a multi-agency effort by DOE, the Department of Transportation and USDA. The grand challenge sets a goal of 3 billion gallons per year of domestic SAF production by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050.

The move follows a larger push by the Trump administration to remove some climate-related initiatives from agency websites and halt funds for climate measures.

In January, USDA and other agencies began removing some climate-related content from websites. This included information from the Natural Resources Conservation Service page on climate-smart mitigation activities.

Early in the Trump administration, the White House ordered agencies to review programs to ensure they are in compliance with efforts to rid the government of “green new deal” spending.
