On the one hand, the US has moved with remarkable aggression to block the International Maritime Organization’s attempt to impose a global carbon pricing mechanism on shipping.

The rhetoric has been theatrical, casting the proposal as an inflationary “global tax” that would ultimately land on American consumers. Threats of retaliation, ranging from tariffs to port fees and even visa measures, have hovered over the negotiations, turning what is usually a technocratic UN forum into something closer to a trade skirmish. The message is clear: global levies dreamed up in London and Brussels will not be allowed to dictate costs to US industry.

Yet step away from the IMO chamber and the picture looks rather different. Domestically, the US is hardly in denial about the need to decarbonise shipping. The proposed Clean Shipping Act of 2025, with some remants of its National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonisation, would push the sector towards net zero by mid-century through fuel carbon-intensity standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Washington is also enthusiastic about alternative fuels, particularly those that can be produced at home. Biofuels, including ethanol, are politically attractive because they align climate goals with farm-state economics, even if questions about scalability and lifecycle emissions remain.

Synthetic e-fuels sit comfortably within the US narrative of technological prowess, while green hydrogen and ammonia are treated as long-term strategic bets rather than near-term fixes. American diplomats are perfectly happy to champion green shipping corridors and initiatives such as the Clydebank Declaration (albeit a signatory before Trump’s inaugration) so long as they are framed as partnerships and pilots rather than tax regimes.

What looks like incoherence is better understood as a preference for control. The US is not rejecting decarbonisation; it is rejecting the idea that decarbonisation should be enforced through a global price signal beyond its influence. Washington would rather see markets shaped at home, innovation subsidised domestically and exporters given the chance to turn climate policy into an industrial opportunity.

The irony is that parts of the US fuel industry see the IMO framework as a gift, a ready-made global market for American low-carbon fuels. But that kind of opportunity only appeals if it comes without a supranational cashier.

To facilitate this transition, the availability of clean fuel supplies, along with adequate storage and bunkering infrastructure, is crucial. Transparency and stability in regulations will be essential for both producers and consumers of green fuels to ensure compliance with EU targets.

Madoqua, a Luso-Dutch company, is making strides in the Power-to-X (PtX) sector, aimed at producing and marketing hydrogen and its derivatives such as green ammonia and e-methanol. Central to their efforts is the Madoqua Green Fuels Terminal, a key infrastructure component designed to connect Portugal with Northern Europe.

In late 2024, Madoqua partnered with the Ports of Sines, Rotterdam, and Duisport to establish a green fuels corridor. They are collaborating with industry partners, including Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, to explore innovative business models and share risks in this energy transition. The company is open to partnerships that contribute socio-economic value and foster sustainable coexistence.

Current progress in developing the green fuels corridor includes the creation of an Ammonia Bunkering Operations Manual to facilitate the safe adoption of ammonia in marine fuel. Madoqua is concluding a feasibility study on the green fuels terminal in Sines, for which they have received support from the EU via the Connecting Europe Facility. While the ammonia storage component is advancing, the project faces challenges related to ensuring continuous product flow to stimulate demand.

Madoqua’s terminal will initially focus on ammonia storage and is based on an open-access model to unlock regional green fuel projects. Their green ammonia project has a phase one target of 500 MW of electrolysis capacity, with additional grid access secured for expanded production.

Regulatory frameworks such as the upcoming FuelEU Maritime regulation are poised to impact green fuel production and bunkering infrastructure significantly. A future demand for renewables in maritime fuels mandates a substantial acceleration in production capacity, as establishing new facilities is time-intensive.

Looking ahead, Madoqua sees opportunities for more green fuel corridors arising, particularly as EU support increases for public-private collaborations. The Global South is identified as a potential source for green fuel supply, particularly in regions like Morocco and Namibia, although core infrastructure development remains a barrier.

Challenges such as price discrepancies and regulatory inadequacies can hinder the maritime industry’s transition to green fuels.

Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said.
The ship departed the Philippines on 15 January and will bunker green methanol in Singapore, then proceed to Western Australia before sailing onward to Europe.
“We know the road to low carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman continued.
Methanol orders fell to 61 from 149 in 2024, while ammonia and LPG saw only limited order uptake.","Baltic Exchange on Tuesday (13 January) released an article by Carly Fields discussing methanol as a marine fuel, availability of low-GHG methanol and challenges in the development of e-methanol:

In the race to re-fuel the shipping industry with environmental alternatives to heavy fuel oil, methanol has its staunch supporters. The greener, leaner fuel also has a firm foundation to build on.

Marius Leisner, senior principal consultant in the Environmental Advisory unit at DNV, said methanol boasts a “ten-year track record as a marine fuel”, which provides a level of comfort that other alternatives, such as ammonia or hydrogen, currently lack. This equates to a robust technological foundation, with ship designs and fuel-system integration strategies having matured significantly through the recent influx of methanol-capable vessels in the global order book.

One of the primary drivers behind the mounting interest in methanol is its relative ease of handling. In a world where gaseous fuels present significant logistical and safety hurdles, methanol’s liquid state is a distinct advantage, Leisner notes.

“Being a liquid, methanol is simpler and, I would say, safer to store, transport, and bunker than gaseous fuels such as LNG, ammonia, and hydrogen.”

Furthermore, its volumetric energy intensity compares favourably to other green alternatives, being “similar to ammonia and higher than hydrogen”.

Historically, the adoption of methanol has been driven by local environmental compliance rather than global carbon reduction. Early pioneers used it to meet stringent sulphur and nitrogen oxide standards. As Leisner explained: “Methanol is sulphur-free and fully complies with MARPOL Annex VI SOx standards”.

Low-GHG methanol drive

But while it burns cleanly, generating “very little soot or particulate matter,” it is not a silver bullet for greenhouse gases in its conventional form. When produced from fossil sources, methanol’s “total well-to-wake GHG intensity is generally worse than fuel oil, Leisner said. The true promise lies in the transition to bio-methanol and e-methanol, which “can be produced from non-fossil sources with near-zero well-to-wake emissions”. However, the current landscape reveals a significant gap between capability and practice. Leisner points out that “most vessels capable of using methanol today still operate on fuel oil or fossil methanol, with only limited uptake of low-GHG methanol”.

The availability of low-GHG methanol is currently the bottleneck of the movement. While the world’s production capacity for green methanol sits at approximately 2.2 million tonnes per year—98% of which is bio-methanol—the actual bunkering volumes reported since 2023 remain “far lower” than this capacity. This suggests that while the fuel exists, the market mechanisms to put it into tanks are lagging. There is, however, cause for optimism on the horizon. If current investment decisions hold, “production capacity could increase to around 14 million tonnes by 2030, mainly driven by projects in China”, Leisner said.

Infrastructure is one area where methanol benefits from a head start. It is already one of the most widely shipped chemical commodities on the planet, with storage capacity existing in “over 115 ports worldwide”. The logistical chain is further strengthening as “dedicated methanol bunkering vessels are also emerging, with 12 currently in operation and six more on order”, Leisner said. From this perspective, the physical infrastructure is largely ready; the challenge is the price tag.

“Fundamentally, it comes down to fuel cost,” he said.

The economic gulf between fossil fuels and green alternatives remains vast. In 2025, bio-methanol prices in Rotterdam were recorded at roughly “three times the cost of marine gas oil”.

While organisations like the Methanol Institute and IRENA project that prices could fall significantly by 2050 as technology scales, the immediate future requires more than just hope for lower costs.

e-Methanol hurdles

The development of e-methanol, which utilises renewable electricity and captured carbon, faces even steeper hurdles. Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said. The low energy efficiency in converting green electricity into fuel remains the fundamental technical conundrum for all e-fuels. Despite this, a large portion of the future production pipeline is dedicated to e-methanol, as its ability to “approach zero GHG intensity” may justify its premium price under stricter future regulations.

To bridge this economic divide, the industry is looking toward regulators to provide the necessary “carrot” or “stick.” DNV’s modelling suggests that without strong intervention, methanol-capable ships will simply continue to burn fossil fuels to protect their bottom lines.

Leisner states that scaling will require “stronger and more sustained demand signals, such as long-term offtake agreements with defined prices and volumes, to give producers confidence to invest”.

The regulatory landscape is currently made up of two key frameworks. The FuelEU Maritime initiative provides an “important but limited demand signal”, with projected methanol use rising to between five and twelve million tonnes by 2040. In contrast, the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework represents a much more aggressive path. Under this framework, uptake is much faster, reaching 20 to 50 million tonnes. However, the recent decision to postpone the implementation of the IMO framework has left many in the industry, including DNV, feeling frustrated. Leisner admits that “a decision providing certainty would have been very helpful”.

The future of methanol in shipping is essentially a race against time and policy. The technological readiness is “largely there”, Leisner said, with major engine manufacturers like Wärtsilä and MAN already having accumulated hundreds of thousands of running hours on methanol systems. The order book is healthy, with approximately 370 methanol-capable vessels set to join the global fleet.

What remains missing is the economic bridge that allows shipowners to choose the green option without compromising their commercial viability. As Leisner concludes, the transition depends on how much of the fleet’s capacity is “actually used for low-GHG methanol rather than fossil fuels”. Until the price of carbon or the incentives for green fuel reach a tipping point, methanol will remain a promising solution waiting for the market to catch up to its potential.

Cargill on Thursday (15 January) announced the maiden voyage of Brave Pioneer, the first of five green methanol dual-fuel dry bulk vessels chartered by the company.

The deployment of the Brave Pioneer marks another important milestone in Cargill’s broader decarbonization efforts – one focused on innovation, testing and learning as the company works with customers and partners to refine future-ready solutions for Cargill and the industry.

Built by Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. and owned by Mitsui & Co. Ltd., Brave Pioneer is equipped to operate on both conventional marine fuels and green methanol, a lower-carbon alternative. The estimated CO2 saving of using green methanol compared to conventional fuel is up to 70%.

The ship departed the Philippines on 15 January and will bunker green methanol in Singapore, then proceed to Western Australia before sailing onward to Europe. Through Brave Pioneer’s maiden voyage, Cargill will conduct a series of operational trials designed evaluate methanol bunkering readiness, understand how environmental attributes can be traced and verified through carbon accounting systems, and assess market appetite for low-carbon freight services.

“Decarbonising global shipping requires a mix of technologies and the willingness to take bold steps before the entire ecosystem is ready,” said Jan Dieleman, President of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business.

“Technologies like green methanol or wind-assisted propulsion come with uncertainty. But as an industry leader, we have a responsibility to test these innovations on the water, share what we learn, and help shape the systems and standards that will enable wider adoption.”

The launch of Brave Pioneer paves the way for the four additional vessels that will join Cargill’s fleet over the coming years. The addition of these vessels strengthens Cargill’s multi-solution decarbonization approach, which includes wind-assisted propulsion, voyage optimisation technologies, energy-efficiency retrofits and exploration of alternative fuels such as biofuels and ethanol.

Each represents another step in the company’s broader efforts to embed sustainability into global ocean supply chains and support customers looking for practical, lower-carbon freight options.

“We know the road to low carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman continued. “Our new fleet is about optionality and adaptability. These vessels are engineered to perform at a best-in-class level on conventional fuel today, while allowing us to switch to greener fuels as availability improves. It’s a practical way to future-proof ocean transport.”

As one of the world’s largest charterers of dry bulk freight, Cargill’s actions send a strong demand signal to the market and serve as an open invitation for others in the maritime sector to join in advancing the transition to sustainable shipping.

The initiative supports Cargill’s broader effort to reduce supply chain emissions and invest and test practical innovations that advance progress toward a more sustainable global food system. Green methanol-enabled vessels—paired with the eventual expansion of renewable fuel supply—are expected to play a meaningful role in reducing maritime emissions over the coming decade

Classification society DNV on Monday (12 January) said the latest annual data from its Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform reflects a year shaped by regulatory uncertainty and market recalibration.

While overall newbuilding activity eased in 2025 following an unprecedented boom the previous year, its share of gross tonnage (GT) on alternative fuels held steady at 38%. This stability hinged on continued strength in the container segment, and is to a lesser degree also supported by orders in passenger vessels and PCTCs.

A total of 275 orders for alternative-fuelled vessels were placed in 2025, representing a year-on-year decrease of 47%. This mirrored a broader drop in the overall newbuild market, which fell to 2,403 orders, from 4,405 in 2024.

Despite this downturn, containership contracting showed resilience, rising to 547 new orders from 447 in 2024 and accounting for roughly 49% of all gross tonnage and 68% of alternative-fuel new orders. Within the container segment, alternative fuels dominated, with the fuel mix by tonnage approximately 58 percent LNG, 36% conventional fuels, and 6% methanol.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV, said: “While indicative of a turbulent year where strategic choices were harder to make, the slowdown in 2025 also reflects a natural reduction after several years of extraordinary ordering activity. Still, in select segments the momentum toward use of alternative fuels remains. Looking ahead, progress will depend on effective and global regulations that incentivize alternative fuel uptake, create a level playing field, and foster fair competition and implementation.”

Reflecting the container segment’s strength, LNG-fuelled vessels led the alternative-fuelled market across all ship types in 2025, accounting for 188 orders and representing 31 percent of total GT. Methanol orders fell to 61 from 149 in 2024, while ammonia and LPG saw only limited order uptake.

LPG and Ethane tanker orders fell by 73 percent from 2024 to 2025. Similarly, bulk carriers, crude oil tankers, and oil/chemical tankers all saw pronounced year-over-year declines, reflecting a continued focus on cost efficiency and fewer immediate incentives for owners to commit to alternative fuels. Car carrier orders paused sharply after several years of strong activity, declining by 90 percent compared to the previous year.

Jason Stefanatos, Global Decarbonization Director at DNV, said: “The resilience of the alternative fuels orderbook in 2025 is mainly driven by cargo owners who have set their own emissions reduction goals despite market slow-down and regulatory uncertainty. We see them prioritizing investments where there is a strong alignment between fuel infrastructure, regulatory certainty, and commercial viability, particularly in container shipping, where LNG and methanol are supported by established supply chains and customer demand.

“In contrast, segments like bulk and tanker are more sensitive to market cycles and capital costs, leading to a preference for conventional fuels until further clarity emerges on fuel lifecycle emissions and regulatory incentives. Practically, this environment should encourage owners to focus on scalable solutions, invest in fuel flexibility, and adopt targeted energy efficiency measures that can be adapted as policy and market conditions evolve.”

Investment in fuel infrastructure continued at pace with 22 LNG bunker vessels added to the orderbook alongside new bunkering vessels capable of supplying methanol and biofuel. These developments signal growing confidence in LNG supply chains and emerging multi-fuel capabilities, reducing operational risk and supporting the economics of alternative fuel adoption.

Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) saw 24 ships delivered in 2025, with a total of 63 sails installed, slightly up from 2024, which saw 22 deliveries and a total of 49 sails installed.

During the meeting, the two sides discussed cooperation between Greece, the United States and Saudi Arabia within the framework of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), as well as their shared position on the Net Zero Framework (NZF) for shipping, which, as stated, has already yielded positive results.

To remind, the MEPC ES.2 meeting did not achieve the next milestone toward the entry into force of the NZF Instead, Saudi Arabia called for a vote at the end of the week to adjourn the process for one year. The motion was approved by 57 countries, representing a majority of those present and voting and the meeting was subsequently adjourned.

As explained, Greece and Saudi Arabia agreed to work together through their respective Ministries of Shipping and Energy toward submitting a joint proposal on this issue before the new deadline for the adoption of the framework.

On shipping, we will of course cooperate first with our European partners, but at this moment there is an impasse. The energy transition in shipping has reached a deadlock at the IMO. Therefore, within the European framework, we are working together to shape a mutually acceptable and realistic solution—first at the European level and then with the United States and other interested countries over the coming year.

What is meant by a Hydrogen fuel cell?

A hydrogen fuel cell is a device that generates electricity as a byproduct of the conversion process of oxygen and hydrogen into water. This device is what prevents the battery from running out, as it continually pumps chemicals into the cell. It is frequently utilised in automobiles, power plants, and backup energy sources as a clean, effective substitute for combustion-based energy systems. Hydrogen fuel cells present a spectrum of benefits, including the fact that they emit absolutely no carbon emissions, as the only byproduct is water vapour. They function silently, having fewer moving parts than combustion engines, and are highly scalable, able to power everything from small gadgets to large power stations. Apart from that, they also contribute to energy security since hydrogen can be generated from various sources like water electrolysis, biomass, fossil fuels, and renewable energy.

Why does this type of vessel need to be in the shipping industry?

India has locally developed and launched its first hydrogen fuel cell passenger vessel in Varanasi to promote green inland water transport, lower carbon emissions, and contribute to the net-zero targets by 2070. This zero-emission catamaran uses a fuel cell, which is a Low Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane device and emits only water; thus, it is in line with the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Cochin Shipyard Limited and the Inland Waterways Authority of India have developed it using fully domestic technology, which is a fine example of self-reliance, clean mobility scalability, reduction of logistics costs, and India being ranked among the global leaders in hydrogen maritime innovation, thereby facilitating the growth of the blue economy.

Ship Outlook:

India debuts in a new era of clean water transport with its maiden indigenous hydrogen fuel cell passenger vessel. This 24-meter catamaran is tailored for the Ganga River's zero-emission operations in Varanasi. The heart of its propulsion is a Low Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane (LT, PEM) fuel cell system that takes the stored hydrogen and oxygen from air and converts them into electricity, releasing only water vapour as the byproduct. Besides that, the vessel features a hybrid setup that integrates fuel cells, onboard batteries, and solar panels to ensure a steady power supply and improve the overall system efficiency. The vessel is fully air, conditioned and can carry 50 people with comfortable seating. Its service speed is 6.5, 9 knots (12, 20 km/h), and it can run for up to eight hours on a single hydrogen fill from four onboard cylinders. After meeting all safety requirements, the Indian Register of Shipping has certified the ship. It aids the urban transit system with a low draft suitable for shallow waterways, is operated by 10 crew members.

The Government Road Map for such Programs:

India is turning into one of the world's top hydrogen leaders quite fast. One can attribute this rise to the country's ambitious national policies, a lot of public and private investments, and India's firm commitment to decarbonization. India is planning to be the main hub for the production, consumption, and export of green hydrogen and its derivatives. India has set a landmark example for sustainable transport by introducing its very first indigenously built hydrogen fuel cell vessel in Varanasi. The event, which included the launch ceremony, was overseen by the Union Ministry, and the project is a manifestation of the government's vision to modernise Inland Waterways and promote eco-friendly mobility. In short, the IWAI, along with the Central Government, has been working towards the expansion of the navigational routes, upgradation of terminals, and has also commenced passenger and cargo services to reduce logistics costs and increase accessibility. This environmentally friendly vessel resonates with the national plans, such as Maritime India Vision 2030 and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047. This project is the first step towards an ocean of hydrogen, fueled ships, thus enabling India to grow its blue economy and still rise as a champion against climate change.

Industrial Growth handshakes:

In September 2025, Oswal Energies announced a Rs 320 crore investment in green hydrogen infrastructure, focusing on production, storage, and transportation, with a 20 MW plant planned in Gujarat. The concept proposes the construction of a 20 MW green hydrogen facility in Gujarat within the next 12 to 15 months.

In July 2023, SFC Energy officially began production of hydrogen fuel cells in India, establishing a new manufacturing facility in New Delhi/Gurgaon in partnership with FC TecNrgy Pvt Ltd. In just six months, the production facility was constructed and turned over in collaboration with its Indian partner, FCTecNrgy.

This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint.
Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand.
Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.
This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment.","Danish research and demonstration initiative Project Cleanship on Thursday (15 January) said its new data, collected during real-world sailing, documented significant climate benefits from biofuel for the shipping industry.

The findings have been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Soot particles – also known as Black Carbon – are among the most harmful emissions from shipping, both for the climate, where they contribute to global warming and melting of Arctic ice, and for public health through poor air quality. Now, experts from the CLEANSHIP project document that using biodiesel, specifically B100 FAME, during normal operation can reduce Black Carbon emissions by up to 81% compared to traditional marine gas oil (MGO).

The measurements were carried out on the Uni-Tankers A/S ers vessel Falstria Swan, where an advanced online Black Carbon sensor from Green Instruments, developed in collaboration with Danish Technological Institute, made it possible to track emissions in detail and in real time during the vessel’s normal operation.

“We expected that biofuel would lead to cleaner combustion, but the magnitude of the reduction – especially at lower engine loads – is a very positive surprise. This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint. At the same time, the measurement technology allows us to monitor emissions with much greater detail than ever before,” says Simon Martin Spangenberg Bastrup berg, consultant and measurement specialist in alternative fuels and emission reduction at Danish Technological Institute.

For Uni-Tankers, the measurements translate directly into new, practical knowledge:

“The latest real-world sailing data on biodiesel (B100) give us a clear picture of both the black carbon footprint and actual CO₂ emissions. This insight is crucial for achieving our own reduction targets, while also contributing to better, data-driven recommendations for reducing emissions across the shipping industry,” said Troels Reppien en, Technical Director at Uni-Tankers A/S .

Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand. Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.

The results from the measurement campaign have now been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in the form of a white paper. This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment.

The white paper is scheduled for consideration at IMO’s 13th session of the Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response (PPR), which will take place from 9 to 13 February 2026.

Brazilian state-controlled oil and gas producer Petrobras on Thursday (15 January) said it has entered into an agreement to supply bunker fuel with renewable content (VLS B24) to Norwegian chemical tanker operator Odfjell.

Petrobras’ VLS B24 is a VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil) composed of 24% biodiesel and 76% mineral oil produced at the company’s refineries. The product complies with international quality standards and holds the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification – EU (ISCC EU), a global system that ensures traceability, compliance with sustainability criteria, and the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the biofuel production chain, specifically designed to meet the requirements of the European market.

In addition, the fuel meets the requirements of FuelEU Maritime, a European Union regulation that mandates a progressive reduction in the GHG intensity of fuels used by ships calling at European ports, encouraging the use of renewable and low-carbon solutions.

“The commercialisation of VLS B24 with a company that has a strong international presence demonstrates Petrobras’ consistent progress toward a low-carbon market, in synergy with our 2026–2030 Business Plan. The initiative not only generates value for the business, but also enables concrete solutions in new energies and decarbonisation, reinforcing our commitment to sustainability and innovation,” said Petrobras’ Director of Logistics, Marketing and Markets, Claudio Schlosser.

Supply will be carried out by dedicated barges from the Rio Grande Terminal (TERIG), where the product blending will also take place. The contract provides for the delivery of up to 12,000 metric tonnes (mt) throughout 2026.

The relationship between Petrobras and Odfjell, marked by a history of collaboration, gained new momentum with the joint initiative of the Brazilian and Norwegian governments to promote sustainable solutions in the energy sector.

“This movement resulted in the creation of a green corridor between the two countries, formalized through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in February 2025, which encourages the circulation of vessels powered by low-carbon fuels,” Petrobras added.

Naturgy and Enagás —through its subsidiary Scale Green Energy— on Thursday (15 January) said they have reached an agreement to promote the decarbonisation of maritime transport in the Iberian Peninsula by building and chartering the state-of-the-art vessel Mistral LNG for the supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and BioLNG to all types of vessels.

The vessel will have a cargo capacity of 18,900 m³. Scale Green Energy, which began construction in early 2026, will operate the vessel, which will be chartered by Naturgy in 2028 under a long-term contract.

The Mistral LNG will operate, as its main market, in the Iberian Peninsula, which is being reinforced as a strategic hub in southern Europe for bunkering or supply of sustainable fuels, as well as in the area of ​​the Strait of Gibraltar and the Canary Islands, among other destinations in the Atlantic.

The ship will have a length of 138.8 meters, a dual-fuel engine, a service speed of 13 knots, and a range exceeding 4,500 nautical miles. Designed to supply LNG and bioLNG fuel, the vessel will be equipped with advanced technology to minimise emissions and optimise efficiency.

With this initiative, Naturgy positions itself as a strategic operator in the Iberian LNG and bioLNG bunkering market , which is projected to experience exponential growth in the coming years, and advances its commitment to driving the energy transition by offering competitive solutions to its customers. The company has extensive expertise in the energy supply sector and plays a key role in supplying Spain as the country’s main importer of natural gas.

For its part, Enagás—through its subsidiary Scale Green Energy—is consolidating its position as a major player in LNG bunkering in Southern Europe by adding this new vessel to its existing fleet of three ships: Levante LNG, Alisios LNG, and Haugesund Knutsen.

This contributes to the European strategy for reducing emissions in maritime transport and has a driving effect on LNG plants in Spain. All seven Spanish regasification plants are already equipped to supply LNG for bunkering, and those in Barcelona, ​​Cartagena, Huelva, and Gijón have already begun supplying BioLNG to ships and tankers.

This project will help meet the growing demand for alternative fuels in maritime transport and comply with new European regulations requiring a progressive reduction in emissions from marine fuels. In 2024, orders for LNG and bioLNG-powered vessels doubled compared to 2023, and LNG bunkering demand is expected to continue increasing steadily in the Iberian Peninsula in the coming years.

The BioLNG service, which has no associated emissions, uses the interconnected infrastructure from the regasification plants, so that the biomethane injected into the gas network is recognized as BioLNG —a liquid biofuel obtained by processing domestic and industrial organic waste—.

Greece, one of the world’s leading shipping nations, took a cautious stance on the proposed International Maritime Organization (IMO) carbon tax.","The European Commission has called for EU to stay united as some of its member states joined a US-led alliance opposed to a net-zero agreement.

Greece is joining Saudi Arabia and the US in negotiations within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Last week the Greek minister of environment and energy Stavros Papastavrou met with his Saudi Arabia counterpart, prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, at the conclusion of his visit to Riyadh.

The discussion referred to the cooperation between Greece, the United States, and Saudi Arabia within the framework of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the common position regarding the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) in shipping, which has already borne fruit.

Greece and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate through their respective ministries – shipping and energy – towards submitting a joint proposal on this issue, before the expiry of the new deadline for the adoption of the relevant framework.

It is recalled that last October the IMO decided to postpone the decision to adopt the NZF for one year.

For his part, Mr. Papastavrou emphasized that Greece is “a voice of realism in Europe, when it comes to energy.”

The pushback from certain member states has cast doubt on whether the framework can gain the support needed to move forward, leaving the global shipping sector watching closely.

On Friday, a European Commission spokesperson was asked about the Greek government’s decision to break from the EU line on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework and instead submit a joint proposal together with Saudi Arabia.

“We continue to stand firmly behind the shared objective of putting global shipping on the net-zero emission path towards 2050,” a European Commission spokesperson said on Friday, January 16.

“We are obviously ready to build bridges and to work with other partners to enable the adoption -when the discussion resumes at the International Maritime Organization Marine Environmental Protection Committee, and it’s very important that all EU Member States stay united in our shared International Maritime Organization goals,” the official added. “So to that end, we are looking into the news, and we are in contact with all the Member States and with the relevant authorities.”

A fierce Trump administration push to stop the global shipping industry from paying for its own climate pollution appeared to have been successful, as efforts to approve the “world’s first global carbon tax” collapsed.

It had been widely assumed the tax would be adopted in October 2025 during the extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee in London at the International Maritime Organization.

But after four days of tough negotiations, countries agreed to delay a vote on whether to approve it by 12 months. The delay follows pressure and procedural tactics from the United States and other countries, pushing the adoption vote to October 2026.

The US president Donald Trump voiced its stance against the first of its kind global carbon tax, warning IMO member states to vote against the organization’s Net-Zero Framework aimed at reducing global greenhouse gas emissions from the international shipping sector.

The United States threatened to use visa restrictions, commercial penalties, additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework and sanctions on officials to retaliate against nations that back IMO’s proposed carbon tax. The envisaged measures included potentially blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.

Greece, one of the world’s leading shipping nations, took a cautious stance on the proposed International Maritime Organization (IMO) carbon tax.

In this context, the Greek minister of maritime affairs and insular policy, Vasilis Kikilias, in an official statement, underlined that “shipping needs international, fair and realistic rules, accepted by all member states, and not punitive mechanisms that will endanger the stability of global trade.”

The minister emphasized that “we agree on the framework, but we want realism. LNG has proven its reliability and must be utilized as a transitional fuel. We still do not have zero or near-zero emission fuels, not even to approach the reduction targets of the coming decade. The cost of the transition is very high, and a significant part of it must return to the shipping industry and the corresponding infrastructures.”

Some Greek shipowners, big names in the world shipping, long regarded as the industry’s traditionalists, publicly denounced the framework, calling it “unrealistic” and “detached from the commercial realities of global trade.”

While Greek shipowners are investing in cleaner technologies, they remain wary of regulatory measures that could disrupt business models.

The Union of Greek Shipowners see the delay to reach an agreement on its Net-Zero Framework and the postponement of the decision as a “new opportunity to shape a sustainable and effective international framework that will guide global shipping safely and realistically through the green transition.”

Athens, while acknowledging the agreement’s flaws, it says “is ready to lead constructively, with evidence-based and unifying proposals, in a global effort to shape a fair, practical and enforceable clean plan, where all stakeholders assume their share of responsibility on the collective path toward the green transition.”

“The lack of consensus highlighted deep rifts over the proposed Net-Zero Framework regulation, where the positions advanced by the shipping industry were not sufficiently taken into account,” the Union of Greek Shipowners said in its statement.

On the other hand, the delay on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework, is characterized by environmental groups as a “major setback” for global efforts to clean up shipping industry emissions.

As they say, governments will now have to spend the next months rallying every nation that supports the framework, and convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the “only sane way forward.”

Industry bodies were equally alarmed. In a joint statement, seven associations – Japanese Shipowners’ Association, Royal Belgian Shipowners’ Association, Royal Association of Netherlands Shipowners, Singapore Shipping Association, UK Chamber of Shipping, Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, and Danish Shipping – warned that failure to adopt the NZF would leave the industry facing a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks.

“Binding global regulation is essential for achieving the goal of climate neutral shipping in 2050. We need global regulation and a level playing field. The alternative to the Net-Zero Framework is not zero regulation, as some of the opponents of the agreement may wish for, but rather a complicated patchwork of regional and national regulations, which is entirely the wrong answer for a global industry,” said Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of the trade and employers’ organisation Danish Shipping.

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and European Shipowners (ES | ECSA) also issued, among other leading associations and organizations, declarations of support for the Net-Zero Framework.",https://shippingtelegraph.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SHIPS-GREECE-1024x536.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 21:56:23.572398

The administration of President Donald Trump plans to finalize 2026 biofuel blending quotas by early March, keeping them close to its initial proposal while dropping a plan to penalize imports of renewable fuels and feedstocks, according to two sources familiar with the plans. The information was reported by Reuters.

If finalized, the plan would mark a partial compromise between rival oil and farm industry groups by preserving increased blending targets sought by biofuel producers while dropping a proposal that U.S. refiners had warned would disrupt fuel markets and raise costs.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees U.S. biofuel policy, has told industry stakeholders it aims to send the final proposal to the White House budget office for review later this month, with finalization expected roughly 30 days later after the White House conducts industry interviews.

The EPA in June proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025. The total included a target of 5.61 billion gallons for bio-based diesel, a significant jump from the 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The EPA is now considering a range of 5.2 to 5.6 billion gallons for bio-based diesel in 2026, the sources told Reuters.

The potential downward adjustment is partially related to the EPA's plan to ditch a proposal that would slash the value of renewable fuel credits given by the U.S. government for imported biofuels, an ""America First"" policy hailed as a victory by the soybean and biodiesel industries.

Big Oil, led by the influential American Petroleum Institute industry group, had argued that limiting credits for foreign supply could constrain availability and push fuel prices higher - an outcome the White House is eager to avoid as affordability remains a central political concern heading into mid-term elections this year.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA was considering delaying the proposal for at least a year.

The EPA told Reuters the agency is still reviewing comments on the proposed rule. ""As publicly stated in court filings, the agency aims to finalize in the first quarter of 2026,"" the agency said.

The EPA is also expected to decide whether to require larger refiners to make up for gallons exempted under the agency's small refinery waiver program, a determination that could significantly affect overall biofuel blending quotas. The EPA in August cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016. They have issued additional exemptions since then.

The biofuel industry and its legislative allies have been urging the administration to require refiners to offset 100% of those exempted gallons, while the oil industry is resisting the obligations. The EPA has sought comment on various proposals, ranging from zero reallocation to 100%.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA is considering a plan for refiners to offset 50% of the those exempted gallons.

Capacity-building and the transfer of marine technology.

Shipping and marine environment protection on the high seas

Ships trading across the world's oceans are subject to stringent environmental, safety and security rules, which apply throughout their voyage.

IMO has developed more than 50 globally-binding treaties and other measures to support shipping’s sustainable use of the oceans, enforced through a well-established system of flag, coastal and port State control.

IMO instruments that actively contribute to the conservation of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, include, among others:

International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships (MARPOL)

International Ballast Water Management Convention, which aims to prevent the transfer of potentially invasive aquatic species; and

London Convention and Protocol, regulating the dumping of wastes at sea.

The company announced on Jan. 15 that the vessel, Brave Pioneer, has entered service and begun its maiden voyage.

The vessel was built by Japan’s Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. and is owned by Mitsui & Co. Ltd. It is designed to operate on both conventional marine fuels and green methanol, providing operational flexibility as fuel availability and infrastructure continue to develop.

According to Cargill, using green methanol instead of conventional fuel can deliver carbon dioxide savings of up to 70%, depending on fuel sourcing and operational conditions.

Brave Pioneer departed the Philippines on Jan. 15 and will bunker green methanol in Singapore before sailing to Western Australia and onward to Europe.

During this initial voyage, Cargill plans to conduct a series of operational trials to test green methanol bunkering readiness, evaluate vessel performance, and examine how environmental attributes linked to low-carbon fuels can be traced and verified through existing carbon accounting systems.

The trials will also assess customer and market appetite for low-carbon freight services in the dry bulk segment.

“Decarbonizing global shipping requires a mix of technologies and the willingness to take bold steps before the entire ecosystem is ready,” said Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business.

He added that technologies like green methanol or wind-assisted propulsion come with uncertainty. But as an industry leader, Cargill have a responsibility to test these innovations on the water, share what they learn, and help shape the systems and standards that will enable wider adoption.

Cargill said four additional green methanol dual-fuel vessels will join its chartered fleet over the coming years.

Together, the vessels form part of a broader, multi-solution approach to reducing emissions across its ocean transportation activities.

This strategy includes wind-assisted propulsion technologies, voyage optimization tools, energy-efficiency retrofits, and ongoing evaluation of alternative fuels such as biofuels and ethanol.

“We know the road to low-carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman said.

According to him, the company’s new fleet is about optionality and adaptability. These vessels are engineered to perform at a best-in-class level on conventional fuel today, while allowing the company to switch to greener fuels as availability improves.

“It’s a practical way to future-proof ocean transport.”

As one of the world’s largest charterers of dry bulk vessels, Cargill plays a central role in the movement of agricultural commodities, including grains, oilseeds and feed ingredients, across global trade routes.

The company said its decision to deploy green methanol-capable vessels sends a clear demand signal to fuel suppliers, shipowners and ports, while encouraging broader collaboration across the maritime value chain.

Cargill added that it views the deployment as an open invitation to the wider shipping industry to participate in accelerating the transition toward lower-emission freight, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as dry bulk transport that underpin global food and agricultural supply chains.",https://millingmea.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ghana-rice-66.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:56:38.294154

When produced from fossil sources, methanol’s “total well-to-wake GHG intensity is generally worse than fuel oil, Leisner said.
Leisner points out that “most vessels capable of using methanol today still operate on fuel oil or fossil methanol, with only limited uptake of low-GHG methanol”.
While the world’s production capacity for green methanol sits at approximately 2.2 million tonnes per year—98% of which is bio-methanol—the actual bunkering volumes reported since 2023 remain “far lower” than this capacity.
Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said.","In the race to re-fuel the shipping industry with environmental alternatives to heavy fuel oil, methanol has its staunch supporters. The greener, leaner fuel also has a firm foundation to build on.

Marius Leisner, senior principal consultant in the Environmental Advisory unit at DNV, said methanol boasts a “ten-year track record as a marine fuel”, which provides a level of comfort that other alternatives, such as ammonia or hydrogen, currently lack. This equates to a robust technological foundation, with ship designs and fuel-system integration strategies having matured significantly through the recent influx of methanol-capable vessels in the global order book.

One of the primary drivers behind the mounting interest in methanol is its relative ease of handling. In a world where gaseous fuels present significant logistical and safety hurdles, methanol’s liquid state is a distinct advantage, Leisner notes.

“Being a liquid, methanol is simpler and, I would say, safer to store, transport, and bunker than gaseous fuels such as LNG, ammonia, and hydrogen.”

Furthermore, its volumetric energy intensity compares favourably to other green alternatives, being “similar to ammonia and higher than hydrogen”.

Historically, the adoption of methanol has been driven by local environmental compliance rather than global carbon reduction. Early pioneers used it to meet stringent sulphur and nitrogen oxide standards. As Leisner explained: “Methanol is sulphur-free and fully complies with MARPOL Annex VI SOx standards”.

Low-GHG methanol drive

But while it burns cleanly, generating “very little soot or particulate matter,” it is not a silver bullet for greenhouse gases in its conventional form. When produced from fossil sources, methanol’s “total well-to-wake GHG intensity is generally worse than fuel oil, Leisner said. The true promise lies in the transition to bio-methanol and e-methanol, which “can be produced from non-fossil sources with near-zero well-to-wake emissions”. However, the current landscape reveals a significant gap between capability and practice. Leisner points out that “most vessels capable of using methanol today still operate on fuel oil or fossil methanol, with only limited uptake of low-GHG methanol”.

The availability of low-GHG methanol is currently the bottleneck of the movement. While the world’s production capacity for green methanol sits at approximately 2.2 million tonnes per year—98% of which is bio-methanol—the actual bunkering volumes reported since 2023 remain “far lower” than this capacity. This suggests that while the fuel exists, the market mechanisms to put it into tanks are lagging. There is, however, cause for optimism on the horizon. If current investment decisions hold, “production capacity could increase to around 14 million tonnes by 2030, mainly driven by projects in China”, Leisner said.

Infrastructure is one area where methanol benefits from a head start. It is already one of the most widely shipped chemical commodities on the planet, with storage capacity existing in “over 115 ports worldwide”. The logistical chain is further strengthening as “dedicated methanol bunkering vessels are also emerging, with 12 currently in operation and six more on order”, Leisner said. From this perspective, the physical infrastructure is largely ready; the challenge is the price tag.

“Fundamentally, it comes down to fuel cost,” he said.

The economic gulf between fossil fuels and green alternatives remains vast. In 2025, bio-methanol prices in Rotterdam were recorded at roughly “three times the cost of marine gas oil”.

While organisations like the Methanol Institute and IRENA project that prices could fall significantly by 2050 as technology scales, the immediate future requires more than just hope for lower costs.

e-Methanol hurdles

The development of e-methanol, which utilises renewable electricity and captured carbon, faces even steeper hurdles. Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said. The low energy efficiency in converting green electricity into fuel remains the fundamental technical conundrum for all e-fuels. Despite this, a large portion of the future production pipeline is dedicated to e-methanol, as its ability to “approach zero GHG intensity” may justify its premium price under stricter future regulations.

To bridge this economic divide, the industry is looking toward regulators to provide the necessary “carrot” or “stick.” DNV’s modelling suggests that without strong intervention, methanol-capable ships will simply continue to burn fossil fuels to protect their bottom lines.

Leisner states that scaling will require “stronger and more sustained demand signals, such as long-term offtake agreements with defined prices and volumes, to give producers confidence to invest”.

The regulatory landscape is currently made up of two key frameworks. The FuelEU Maritime initiative provides an “important but limited demand signal”, with projected methanol use rising to between five and twelve million tonnes by 2040. In contrast, the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework represents a much more aggressive path. Under this framework, uptake is much faster, reaching 20 to 50 million tonnes. However, the recent decision to postpone the implementation of the IMO framework has left many in the industry, including DNV, feeling frustrated. Leisner admits that “a decision providing certainty would have been very helpful”.

The future of methanol in shipping is essentially a race against time and policy. The technological readiness is “largely there”, Leisner said, with major engine manufacturers like Wärtsilä and MAN already having accumulated hundreds of thousands of running hours on methanol systems. The order book is healthy, with approximately 370 methanol-capable vessels set to join the global fleet.",,N,,2026-01-16 17:56:45.402428

The EPA in June proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.
The total included a target of 5.61 billion gallons for bio-based diesel, a significant jump from the 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.
The EPA is now considering a range of 5.2 to 5.6 billion gallons for bio-based diesel in 2026, the sources told Reuters.

If finalized, the plan would mark a partial compromise between rival oil and farm industry groups by preserving increased blending targets sought by biofuel producers while dropping a proposal that U.S. refiners had warned would disrupt fuel markets and raise costs.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees U.S. biofuel policy, has told industry stakeholders it aims to send the final proposal to the White House budget office for review later this month, with finalization expected roughly 30 days later after the White House conducts industry interviews.

The EPA is now considering a range of 5.2 to 5.6 billion gallons for bio-based diesel in 2026, the sources told Reuters.

The potential downward adjustment is partially related to the EPA’s plan to ditch a proposal that would slash the value of renewable fuel credits given by the U.S. government for imported biofuels, an “America First” policy hailed as a victory by the soybean and biodiesel industries.

Big Oil, led by the influential American Petroleum Institute industry group, had argued that limiting credits for foreign supply could constrain availability and push fuel prices higher – an outcome the White House is eager to avoid as affordability remains a central political concern heading into mid-term elections this year.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA was considering delaying the proposal for at least a year.

The EPA told Reuters the agency is still reviewing comments on the proposed rule. “As publicly stated in court filings, the agency aims to finalize ‘in the first quarter of 2026,” the agency said.

The EPA is also expected to decide whether to require larger refiners to make up for gallons exempted under the agency’s small refinery waiver program, a determination that could significantly affect overall biofuel blending quotas.

The EPA in August cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016. They have issued additional exemptions since then.

The biofuel industry and its legislative allies have been urging the administration to require refiners to offset 100% of those exempted gallons, while the oil industry is resisting the obligations. The EPA has sought comment on various proposals, ranging from zero reallocation to 100%.",,N,,2026-01-16 17:56:52.169618

For all the apparent momentum, Transport & Environment’s analysis is emphatic that the overall state of e-fuel development for shipping remains fragile.
Most schemes remain at planning or early development stages and are vulnerable to shifting economics, policy uncertainty and competition from other sectors for the same pools of green hydrogen and renewable power.
For deep-sea trades that cannot realistically electrify because of energy-density and range constraints, e-methanol and e-ammonia produced from green hydrogen are widely regarded as among the few scalable options capable of delivering very low well-to-wake emissions.","A quiet but decisive shift is taking place in the race to decarbonise global shipping, and it is unfolding not in Asia’s massive shipyards or the traditional oil hubs of the Middle East, but across four European nations that have moved with unusual speed to build the infrastructure that could define maritime energy in the coming decades.

By Paul Morgan (gCaptain) – Spain, Denmark, Norway and France have emerged as the key frontrunners in developing production capacity for green hydrogen and synthetic fuels that deep-sea vessels will need if the industry is to meet its 2030 and 2050 climate targets, according to Transport & Environment’s latest update to its shipping e-fuels observatory.

The research maps 80 confirmed or announced green hydrogen, e-methanol, e-ammonia and e-methane projects across Europe that could together produce up to 3.6 million tonnes of oil equivalent of e-fuels by 2032, assuming all reach operation. While this is still a relatively modest volume compared with current marine fuel demand, what stands out is the concentration of that potential in a handful of countries, creating a new geography of marine energy that could reshape where the world’s shipping lines refuel within the next decade.

Denmark stands out with fourteen projects that together could produce about 3.6 million tonnes of oil equivalent a year, spanning green hydrogen and its derivatives across multiple end-use sectors. Spain follows as the second-largest potential producer, with eight projects accounting for about nine per cent of total European volumes, closely linked to the country’s emerging hydrogen valleys and to major ports such as Algeciras and Bilbao.

Norway and France have smaller absolute capacity in the overall pipeline, but a notably higher share of their planned output is explicitly targeting maritime use. A significant portion of national volumes is intended to supply shipping at least in part: 100 per cent in France, 63 per cent in Spain, 53 per cent in Norway and 42 per cent in Denmark.

When the analysis narrows to volumes primarily dedicated to shipping, the picture sharpens. Nearly a quarter of Norway’s projected output fits that category, largely in the form of e-ammonia designed from the outset for marine use. Spain and France each have up to about 1.1 million tonnes of oil equivalent per year of potential e-fuels that could flow into maritime bunkers if all relevant projects proceed, while Norway has around 0.13 million tonnes clearly targeting the sector. Denmark’s Kassø facility adds a further 0.02 million tonnes of oil equivalent dedicated to e-methanol, a portion of which is already being sold as ship fuel.

Denmark has already crossed a symbolic threshold that separates ambition from physical reality. The Kassø e-methanol plant, developed by European Energy and Mitsui and inaugurated in May 2025, is widely recognised as the world’s first large-scale commercial e-methanol facility. It has an annual production capacity of about 42,000 tonnes of e-methanol, powered by nearby renewable electricity and biogenic CO?, equivalent to roughly 20,000 tonnes of oil equivalent. Transport & Environment identifies Kassø as the largest European green e-fuel project dedicated to the maritime sector, with part of its output flowing directly to A. P. Moller-Maersk under offtake contracts for its dual-fuel containerships. In an industry that has spent decades discussing alternative fuels with relatively little hard infrastructure to point to, Kassø functions as proof of concept.

Behind this pioneering facility sits a wave of much larger national initiatives still working their way towards final investment decision. Denmark’s pipeline includes gigawatt-scale power-to-x schemes such as HØST PtX Esbjerg, which aims to use offshore wind and other renewables to produce around 100,000 to 140,000 tonnes of green hydrogen a year, equivalent to more than 600,000 tonnes of green ammonia. Spain is pursuing a similarly strategic approach, linking e-fuel production to port-side infrastructure upgrades and regional industrial policy, while Norway’s focus on e-ammonia builds on its long experience in complex maritime operations. France’s smaller but highly focused portfolio reflects a deliberate policy choice to ensure that port decarbonisation and French-flag shipping are integral to the country’s wider hydrogen strategy.

For all the apparent momentum, Transport & Environment’s analysis is emphatic that the overall state of e-fuel development for shipping remains fragile. Less than five per cent of the identified capacity is linked to projects where shipping is the primary end-user, and only a handful of those have reached final investment decision or begun operation. Most schemes remain at planning or early development stages and are vulnerable to shifting economics, policy uncertainty and competition from other sectors for the same pools of green hydrogen and renewable power.

The European policy environment is therefore pivotal. Within the EU’s Fit for 55 package, the FuelEU Maritime regulation requires ships calling at EU ports to reduce the greenhouse-gas intensity of their energy mix progressively, reaching an 80 per cent reduction compared with a fossil baseline by 2050. In November 2025 the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan confirmed that at least two billion euros in Invest-EU finance would be mobilised for sustainable alternative fuels, including green hydrogen-based fuels for aviation and maritime. Those signals have coincided with an uptick in project announcements, but for many developers the lack of long-term, shipping-specific offtake certainty is still a major barrier to reaching construction.

The climate stakes are significant. International shipping accounts for roughly three per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions, and in 2023 the International Maritime Organization adopted a revised greenhouse-gas strategy that calls for net-zero emissions from international shipping by or around 2050. For deep-sea trades that cannot realistically electrify because of energy-density and range constraints, e-methanol and e-ammonia produced from green hydrogen are widely regarded as among the few scalable options capable of delivering very low well-to-wake emissions. Yet these fuels are substantially more expensive than conventional heavy fuel oil and entail significant conversion losses. Without strong regulation, carbon pricing and targeted subsidies, they remain commercially unattractive for most operators.

The emerging leadership of Spain, Denmark, Norway and France therefore cuts both ways. On the one hand, it gives Europe a nucleus of industrial capability, port infrastructure and technical expertise that could anchor a genuinely global green fuels value chain for shipping. On the other hand, the work of Transport & Environment underlines how conditional that lead still is: a single operational, shipping-dedicated e-fuel plant in Kassø, a small cluster of other projects nearing completion, a much larger group still on drawing boards and a regulatory framework that does not yet send a strong enough demand signal to drag the majority of those projects over the investment line.

For shipowners and fuel suppliers trying to navigate the energy transition, the message is that the supply side of green marine fuels is beginning to coalesce in specific locations, but it will only mature if policy and market incentives align. For policymakers, the observatory functions as both a progress report and a warning against complacency. Without clearer and stronger demand signals in European and international regulation, many of the projects that currently place Spain, Denmark, Norway and France in the lead may never move beyond feasibility studies. The outlines of the infrastructure that could define maritime energy for decades are being sketched now in these four countries; whether they turn into steel and concrete in time to help deliver net-zero shipping will depend on decisions taken in the next few years about how serious Europe really is about forcing the pace of decarbonisation at sea.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_1901401.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 15:57:17.871593

How Ammonia Bunkering Differs from Traditional Marine Fuel Supply Traditional marine fuel bunkering involves transferring liquid hydrocarbon fuels at ambient temperature through established pipeline networks connecting shore-based storage facilities to vessel fuel tanks.
Technical Infrastructure Requirements for Ammonia Bunkering Storage and Handling System Specifications Ammonia bunkering infrastructure demands cryogenic storage systems capable of maintaining -33°C temperatures whilst managing boil-off gas recovery and pressure relief operations.

Traditional marine fuels have dominated ocean transport for over a century, but mounting regulatory pressure and environmental imperatives are driving unprecedented innovation in alternative fuel technologies. Among emerging solutions, low-carbon ammonia bunkering has emerged as a critical pathway for achieving zero-emission maritime operations, combining proven chemical properties with scalable production capabilities.

Understanding Low-Carbon Ammonia as a Marine Fuel Solution

Defining Low-Carbon Ammonia as a Marine Fuel Solution

Low-carbon ammonia bunkering refers to the supply chain infrastructure and operational protocols required to deliver ammonia fuel to vessels equipped with dual-fuel engine systems capable of combusting ammonia for propulsion. Unlike conventional marine fuels derived from petroleum products, ammonia produces zero carbon emissions at the point of combustion, making it an attractive alternative for shipowners seeking to comply with International Maritime Organization emissions reduction targets.

The fundamental distinction between low-carbon ammonia and traditional marine gas oil lies in the production methodology rather than the combustion process itself. While marine gas oil generates approximately 3.2 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of fuel consumed, ammonia's carbon intensity depends entirely on its production pathway. This creates a critical classification system where green ammonia (produced via renewable-powered electrolysis) achieves near-zero lifecycle emissions, while blue ammonia (produced from natural gas with carbon capture) reduces emissions by 85-95% compared to conventional fuels.

Recent industry developments demonstrate accelerating commitment to low-carbon ammonia bunkering infrastructure. The collaboration formalised between major fertilizer producer CF Industries, global trading firm Trafigura, and marine fuel supplier TFG Marine through a memorandum of understanding represents the most significant institutional commitment to ammonia marine fuel supply chains. This agreement specifically targets the US Gulf Coast and northwest Europe, two regions with established ammonia production capacity and strategic positioning within global shipping networks.

The Maritime Industry's Decarbonisation Imperative

Maritime transport accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, handling over 90% of international trade by volume. The International Maritime Organization's strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 creates regulatory pressure that extends beyond voluntary commitments to mandatory compliance frameworks. These targets necessitate alternative fuel adoption across approximately 60,000 commercial vessels operating in international waters.

Furthermore, current regulatory frameworks include the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) ratings, which establish baseline performance requirements for existing fleets. However, achieving IMO 2050 net-zero targets requires fuel solutions that eliminate carbon emissions entirely rather than incrementally improving efficiency metrics. This regulatory environment creates market demand for zero-emission fuels like low-carbon ammonia bunkering, particularly for long-haul shipping routes where battery technology remains impractical due to weight and energy density constraints.

In addition, the economic implications extend beyond compliance costs to include potential carbon pricing mechanisms, fuel availability guarantees, and insurance considerations for vessels operating alternative fuel systems. Early adopters of ammonia fuel technology position themselves to capture regulatory advantages while spreading development costs across longer operational timelines.

How Ammonia Bunkering Differs from Traditional Marine Fuel Supply

Traditional marine fuel bunkering involves transferring liquid hydrocarbon fuels at ambient temperature through established pipeline networks connecting shore-based storage facilities to vessel fuel tanks. This process relies on decades of standardised equipment, safety protocols, and crew training programmes optimised for petroleum-based products with well-understood combustion characteristics and environmental hazard profiles.

Ammonia bunkering requires fundamentally different infrastructure specifications due to ammonia's cryogenic storage requirements at -33°C and its toxic properties that demand specialised safety protocols. Transfer operations must incorporate vapour recovery systems to prevent atmospheric releases, continuous leak detection monitoring throughout bunkering zones, and emergency response capabilities specifically designed for ammonia exposure incidents rather than hydrocarbon spills.

The logistics complexity extends to vessel scheduling and port operations planning. Ammonia's lower energy density of 12.7 MJ/L compared to marine gas oil's 35.9 MJ/L means vessels require more frequent bunkering stops or larger fuel storage capacity, directly impacting cargo space allocation and route optimisation strategies. This energy density differential creates operational trade-offs that shipping companies must evaluate alongside fuel cost premiums and infrastructure availability.

Low-Carbon Ammonia Production Pathways for Marine Applications

Green vs. Blue Ammonia Production Pathways

Green ammonia production utilises renewable electricity to power electrolysis systems that split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, subsequently combining the hydrogen with nitrogen through the Haber-Bosch synthesis process. This pathway achieves near-zero carbon intensity when powered by wind, solar, or hydroelectric sources with minimal embedded carbon footprints. However, green ammonia production faces scalability constraints due to renewable energy availability and electrolyser manufacturing capacity limitations.

Blue ammonia production leverages existing natural gas infrastructure and industrial ammonia facilities whilst incorporating carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to reduce emissions. CF Industries' planned Louisiana facility demonstrates this approach, designed to capture up to 95% of CO2 emissions from a 1.4 million tonnes per year ammonia production facility scheduled for 2030 operation. This specification substantially exceeds typical carbon capture rates in industrial applications, reducing carbon intensity from approximately 1.5-2.0 tonnes CO2 per tonne of ammonia to 0.075-0.15 tonnes CO2 per tonne of ammonia.

The production pathway selection carries implications beyond carbon intensity metrics. Moreover, green ammonia requires dedicated renewable energy allocation that competes with grid decarbonisation priorities, while blue ammonia depends on geological carbon storage verification and regulatory acceptance of CCS permanence guarantees. Economic considerations include renewable energy procurement costs, carbon capture infrastructure amortisation, and regulatory incentive monetisation through tax credits and carbon offset markets, aligning with broader decarbonisation benefits across industrial sectors.

Carbon Intensity Metrics and Certification Standards

Carbon intensity measurement in ammonia production encompasses lifecycle assessment methodologies that account for energy inputs, process emissions, and upstream supply chain impacts. Traditional grey ammonia production generates 1.5 to 2.0 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of ammonia, establishing the baseline against which low-carbon alternatives are measured. Blue ammonia with 95% carbon capture achieves approximately 0.075 to 0.15 tonnes CO2 per tonne of ammonia, whilst green ammonia powered by renewable electricity approaches near-zero emissions.

Certification frameworks remain under development by regulatory bodies and industry organisations seeking to establish transparent benchmarking standards. The verification process must address production methodology documentation, energy source verification, carbon capture permanence validation, and supply chain traceability requirements. Current industry practices include third-party verification agencies that audit production facilities and issue certificates enabling low-carbon claims for commercial transactions.

CF Industries' strategy of monetising greenhouse gas abatement efforts through tax credits and carbon credits demonstrates how production economics increasingly factor regulatory incentive mechanisms beyond commodity price differentials. This approach suggests future low-carbon ammonia bunkering cost structures will reflect carbon pricing mechanisms, creating complex interdependencies with shipping carbon markets, carbon credit valuations, and tax policy frameworks.

Integration with Renewable Energy Infrastructure

Low-carbon ammonia production requires substantial renewable energy capacity allocation, creating competition with grid decarbonisation initiatives and industrial electrification programmes. Green ammonia facilities typically require 28-35 MWh of renewable electricity per tonne of ammonia produced, necessitating dedicated renewable energy projects or long-term power purchase agreements with wind and solar developers.

The geographic distribution of optimal renewable resources influences ammonia production location decisions and subsequent transportation logistics to bunkering hubs. Coastal regions with excellent wind resources and proximity to shipping routes offer advantages for integrated production and bunkering facilities, while inland renewable resources may require additional transportation infrastructure to reach marine fuel terminals.

Furthermore, blue ammonia production integration focuses on carbon capture infrastructure rather than renewable energy procurement. Facilities must develop geological storage agreements, CO2 transportation systems, and monitoring frameworks to ensure permanent carbon sequestration. The economic viability depends on carbon credit pricing, regulatory permanence requirements, and geological storage capacity availability in proximity to production facilities, reflecting broader challenges facing the Canada energy transition.

Technical Infrastructure Requirements for Ammonia Bunkering

Storage and Handling System Specifications

Ammonia bunkering infrastructure demands cryogenic storage systems capable of maintaining -33°C temperatures whilst managing boil-off gas recovery and pressure relief operations. Shore-based terminals require insulated tank systems with specialised materials compatible with liquid ammonia's corrosive properties under cryogenic conditions. These systems must incorporate continuous circulation pumps, automated temperature monitoring, and vapour recovery equipment to minimise atmospheric emissions during storage periods.

Parameter Marine Gas Oil Low-Carbon Ammonia Storage Temperature Ambient -33°C Energy Density (MJ/L) 35.9 12.7 Carbon Emissions High Zero (at point of use) Toxicity Level Low High (requires specialised handling)

Transfer system specifications include cryogenic-rated piping with thermal expansion joints, automated flow control valves, and emergency shutdown systems activated by leak detection sensors. Port terminals must install vapour recovery networks capable of capturing ammonia gas releases during transfer operations and either re-liquefying recovered vapour or routing it to industrial users. The infrastructure investment extends beyond terminal equipment to include specialised loading arms, hose connections rated for cryogenic service, and vessel mooring systems designed for extended bunkering operations.

Vessel-side modifications require installation of cryogenic fuel tanks integrated with dual-fuel engine systems capable of combusting both ammonia and conventional backup fuels. Tank insulation systems must maintain cryogenic temperatures during extended voyages whilst incorporating pressure relief systems that safely vent boil-off gas overboard when necessary. Engine room ventilation systems require enhancement to prevent ammonia accumulation in enclosed spaces, with continuous gas detection monitoring throughout fuel storage and distribution areas.

Safety Protocols and Risk Management Frameworks

Ammonia's toxicity profile creates fundamentally different safety requirements compared to conventional marine fuel handling. Ammonia gas is heavier than air and can accumulate in low-lying spaces, creating exposure hazards that require continuous atmospheric monitoring in engine rooms, pump rooms, and fuel storage compartments. Emergency response protocols must address ammonia exposure treatment, including immediate medical intervention procedures and evacuation protocols for affected personnel.

Fire suppression systems require specific rating for liquid cryogenic ammonia fires, which behave differently than hydrocarbon fuel fires. Water spray systems designed for ammonia incidents focus on vapour suppression and cooling rather than combustion suppression, requiring specialised nozzle configurations and pressure specifications. Port emergency response planning must coordinate with local fire departments and medical facilities to ensure appropriate treatment capabilities for ammonia exposure incidents.

Personal protective equipment specifications include self-contained breathing apparatus rated for ammonia environments, chemical-resistant clothing systems, and emergency eyewash stations positioned throughout bunkering areas. Crew training requirements extend beyond standard marine fuel handling to include ammonia-specific hazard recognition, exposure prevention protocols, and emergency response procedures. These safety investments represent significant operational cost increases but are essential for regulatory approval and insurance coverage.

Port Infrastructure Adaptation Requirements

Existing port infrastructure adaptation involves significant capital expenditure for cryogenic handling capabilities, with costs varying substantially between new terminal construction and existing facility retrofitting. Ports with established LNG bunkering infrastructure possess some cryogenic expertise but require ammonia-specific equipment modifications due to different temperature requirements and toxicity considerations.

System Component Modification Type Cost Impact Fuel Storage Cryogenic tanks required High Engine Systems Dual-fuel conversion Medium-High Safety Equipment Enhanced ventilation/detection Medium Crew Training Specialised certification Low-Medium

Environmental permitting processes require comprehensive risk assessments addressing atmospheric emissions, groundwater protection, and emergency response capabilities. Regulatory authorities evaluate ammonia handling protocols, leak detection systems, and community safety measures before approving bunkering operations. This approval process can extend project timelines by 12-18 months beyond typical marine fuel terminal development schedules.

Integration with existing port vessel traffic management systems requires coordination protocols for low-carbon ammonia bunkering operations, including dedicated berthing areas, specialised tugboat assistance, and extended transfer timeframes. Port authorities must develop ammonia-specific operational procedures that address weather restrictions, emergency evacuation procedures, and coordination with other port activities during bunkering operations.

Global Port Leadership in Ammonia Bunkering Development

Port of Rotterdam's Pioneering Infrastructure Programmes

The Port of Rotterdam currently operates at Port Readiness Level 6 within the seven-stage PRL assessment system, positioning it as the most advanced European port for ammonia bunkering capability. This achievement reflects systematic infrastructure development including pilot bunkering programmes designed to validate safety protocols before commercial deployment. Rotterdam's approach demonstrates the multi-year development pathway required for ammonia bunkering readiness, with commercial operations targeted for 2030-2033.

Rotterdam's progression leverages the Netherlands' established ammonia handling expertise from industrial and fertiliser sectors, combined with its position as Europe's largest port and strategic location within major shipping routes. The port's existing LNG bunkering infrastructure provides foundational cryogenic handling capabilities that can be adapted for ammonia applications, though significant modifications remain necessary for ammonia-specific requirements.

The Port Readiness Level (PRL) system evaluates ammonia bunkering capability across seven stages, from initial concept (PRL 1) to full commercial deployment (PRL 7). Rotterdam currently operates at PRL 6, with commercial readiness expected by 2030-2033.

Investment commitments from Rotterdam port authority include dedicated ammonia storage terminals, specialised transfer equipment, and enhanced safety systems designed for toxic gas handling. The port's development strategy emphasises coordination with existing industrial users of ammonia, enabling shared infrastructure utilisation and economies of scale across fertiliser, chemical, and marine fuel applications.

Strategic Regional Hub Development

The CF Industries, Trafigura, and TFG Marine collaboration specifically targets the US Gulf Coast and northwest Europe as initial deployment regions, reflecting strategic positioning within existing ammonia production and global shipping networks. This geographic focus demonstrates industry recognition that low-carbon ammonia bunkering development will concentrate in established ammonia-handling regions before expanding to other maritime hubs.

US Gulf Coast advantages include proximity to CF Industries' Donaldsonville plant in Louisiana, currently the largest ammonia and nitrogen production facility globally. This existing infrastructure provides production capacity that can be redirected toward marine fuel applications without requiring entirely new manufacturing facilities. The region's established ammonia export infrastructure for fertiliser markets offers logistics networks that can be adapted for marine fuel distribution.

Northwest European ports benefit from established ammonia import infrastructure serving industrial and agricultural markets, creating existing handling expertise and storage capacity. The region's regulatory alignment with European Union maritime decarbonisation policies provides policy support for alternative fuel infrastructure investment, whilst established shipping routes connecting to major global trade lanes offer immediate market opportunities for ammonia-fuelled vessels.

Strategic Partnership Models for Infrastructure Development

TFG Marine's specialised role in the three-party collaboration demonstrates the emergence of dedicated marine fuel companies focused specifically on alternative fuel bunkering rather than traditional general cargo terminal operations. TFG Marine, with Trafigura holding a 75% ownership stake, concentrates on last-mile delivery systems and establishing ammonia bunkering hubs across strategic port locations.

This partnership structure illustrates multi-stakeholder value chain integration: CF Industries provides production capacity and low-carbon certification capabilities, Trafigura offers global trading networks and market access, whilst TFG Marine delivers specialised bunkering infrastructure and operational expertise. The coordinated approach addresses production, trading, and delivery requirements through dedicated expertise rather than attempting vertical integration within individual companies.

Additionally, industry partnerships focus on stakeholder engagement and bunkering logistics planning as foundational activities, suggesting that port development requires coordinated industry initiatives rather than individual port authority investments. This collaborative approach enables risk sharing across multiple participants whilst leveraging specialised expertise from production, trading, and marine fuel sectors, providing valuable energy security insights for supply chain resilience.

Critical Safety Considerations for Ammonia Marine Operations

Toxicity Risk Management and Emergency Response

Ammonia's acute toxicity represents the primary safety challenge distinguishing it from conventional marine fuels, which present primarily combustion and explosion hazards. Even small leaks or spills can create immediate health risks requiring specialised emergency response protocols, medical treatment capabilities, and evacuation procedures fundamentally different from hydrocarbon fuel incidents.

Continuous atmospheric monitoring systems must be installed throughout vessels and port facilities to detect ammonia concentrations before they reach hazardous levels. Detection equipment requires calibration for ammonia-specific sensors with automatic alarm systems connected to emergency response protocols. Port facilities need strategically positioned emergency eyewash stations, medical treatment areas, and communication systems enabling immediate coordination with local healthcare facilities experienced in ammonia exposure treatment.

Personal protective equipment specifications include self-contained breathing apparatus specifically rated for ammonia environments, chemical-resistant clothing systems, and emergency respiratory protection readily accessible throughout bunkering operations. Training programmes must address ammonia exposure symptoms, immediate treatment protocols, and evacuation procedures that account for ammonia's tendency to accumulate in low-lying areas due to its density characteristics.

International Maritime Organization Guidelines and Compliance

International Maritime Organization guidelines for ammonia marine fuel operations remain under active development as regulatory frameworks adapt to alternative fuel technologies. Current provisional guidelines address vessel design standards, crew certification requirements, and operational procedures, but comprehensive regulations are still being finalised through international consultation processes.

Vessel certification requirements include demonstration of dual-fuel engine capabilities, cryogenic fuel storage system compliance, and enhanced safety equipment installation. Flag state authorities must approve ammonia fuel systems before vessels can operate commercially, creating potential delays for early adopters whilst regulatory frameworks are standardised across jurisdictions.

Port state control inspections will require specialised expertise to evaluate ammonia fuel systems, necessitating inspector training programmes and updated inspection protocols. Insurance providers are developing coverage frameworks for ammonia-fuelled vessels, with premium structures reflecting the additional risks associated with toxic fuel handling compared to conventional marine fuels.

Crew Training and Certification Requirements

Specialised certification programmes are being developed to address ammonia fuel handling, requiring crew members to complete training modules covering toxicity awareness, emergency response procedures, and operational safety protocols specific to cryogenic ammonia systems. These requirements extend beyond existing marine fuel handling certifications to include hazardous material handling credentials.

Training curricula must address ammonia's unique properties including its density characteristics, exposure symptoms, and appropriate response procedures for different types of incidents. Practical training components include proper use of personal protective equipment, operation of ammonia detection systems, and coordination with shore-based emergency response teams during bunkering operations.

Certification renewal requirements ensure crew competency is maintained through regular refresher training and practical assessments. The specialised nature of low-carbon ammonia bunkering fuel handling may create crew recruitment challenges as the industry scales, potentially requiring enhanced compensation packages and career development programmes to attract qualified personnel.

Ammonia-Fuelled Vessel Technology and Performance Characteristics

Engine Technology and Dual-Fuel Capabilities

Modern ammonia-capable marine engines utilise dual-fuel technology enabling operation on both ammonia and conventional backup fuels, providing operational flexibility during the infrastructure development phase. These engines require specialised combustion chamber designs to accommodate ammonia's different flame characteristics and ignition properties compared to conventional marine fuels.

Trafigura currently has four ammonia-fuelled gas carriers (MGCs) on order, with all deliveries scheduled by 2028, demonstrating near-term vessel availability aligned with infrastructure development timelines. These vessels represent concrete fleet commitment from a major global trading firm, indicating confidence in ammonia fuel viability for marine applications beyond theoretical development phases.

Engine efficiency optimisation for ammonia fuel requires sophisticated control systems managing fuel injection timing, combustion air mixing, and exhaust gas treatment to minimise nitrogen oxide emissions whilst maintaining power output comparable to conventional fuels. Advanced engine management systems automatically adjust operational parameters based on fuel type selection, enabling seamless transitions between ammonia and backup fuels during voyages.

Vessel Design Modifications and Space Requirements

Cryogenic fuel storage systems require substantial vessel design modifications including insulated tank installations, specialised piping networks, and enhanced ventilation systems throughout fuel-related compartments. Tank placement must balance weight distribution, thermal insulation requirements, and accessibility for maintenance operations whilst maximising cargo space utilisation.

Fuel system integration involves installing ammonia supply lines from storage tanks to engine rooms with appropriate thermal expansion joints, automatic shutoff valves, and continuous leak detection monitoring. Ventilation systems require enhancement to prevent ammonia accumulation in enclosed spaces, with forced ventilation maintaining positive pressure differentials that direct any leaks toward safe venting areas.

Safety system installations include enhanced fire suppression equipment rated for cryogenic ammonia incidents, emergency fuel dump systems enabling rapid tank venting in emergency situations, and communication systems providing continuous monitoring of fuel system status from bridge operations. These modifications represent significant capital investment beyond conventional vessel construction costs.

Operational Range and Bunkering Frequency Implications

Ammonia's energy density of 12.7 MJ/L compared to marine gas oil's 35.9 MJ/L creates a 65% reduction in energy density that directly impacts vessel operational range and cargo capacity trade-offs. Vessels require either more frequent bunkering stops or larger fuel storage installations, both of which affect operational economics and route planning strategies.

Timeline Market Milestone Expected Capacity 2025-2027 Pilot Operations Limited commercial trials 2028-2030 Early Commercial Regional route coverage 2030-2035 Scale-Up Phase Major shipping lanes 2035-2050 Full Deployment 35-50% marine fuel share

Route optimisation requires coordination with low-carbon ammonia bunkering hub availability, potentially concentrating initial adoption on shorter regional routes with established infrastructure before expanding to trans-oceanic services. Shipping schedules must accommodate extended bunkering times due to cryogenic transfer requirements and enhanced safety protocols during fuel transfer operations.

Fleet planning considerations include vessel assignment strategies that match ammonia-capable ships with routes offering reliable bunkering infrastructure, backup fuel availability for emergency situations, and coordination with cargo scheduling to optimise fuel efficiency across different operational profiles.

Market Dynamics Driving Ammonia Bunkering Adoption

Regulatory Pressures and IMO 2050 Net-Zero Targets

The International Maritime Organization's commitment to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 creates mandatory compliance frameworks extending beyond voluntary environmental commitments to legally binding emissions reduction requirements. These targets necessitate alternative fuel adoption across the global commercial fleet, with interim reduction milestones creating near-term pressure for early alternative fuel deployment.

Current regulatory instruments including the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) establish baseline performance requirements, but achieving 2050 net-zero targets requires fuel solutions that eliminate emissions entirely rather than incrementally improving efficiency metrics. This regulatory trajectory creates market certainty for zero-emission fuels like low-carbon ammonia bunkering, particularly for shipping segments where electrification remains impractical due to weight and energy density constraints.

Regional regulatory initiatives including European Union emissions trading system expansion to maritime transport and potential carbon border adjustment mechanisms create additional compliance costs for vessels operating conventional fuels. These policy frameworks provide economic incentives for alternative fuel adoption through carbon pricing mechanisms that improve the relative competitiveness of low-carbon ammonia compared to conventional marine fuels.

Economic Incentives and Carbon Pricing Mechanisms

CF Industries' strategy of monetising greenhouse gas abatement efforts through tax credits and carbon credits demonstrates how production economics increasingly incorporate regulatory incentive mechanisms beyond traditional commodity pricing. This approach creates complex interdependencies between ammonia production costs, carbon credit market values, and tax policy frameworks that influence fuel pricing structures.

Carbon pricing mechanisms in shipping markets are evolving through emissions trading systems, fuel levy proposals, and carbon offset requirements that create direct economic advantages for zero-emission fuels. Early market development may require carbon price supports or regulatory mandates to bridge cost competitiveness gaps during infrastructure development phases.

Furthermore, investment incentive programmes including government subsidies for alternative fuel infrastructure, loan guarantee programmes for vessel retrofitting, and research development grants for technology advancement reduce capital barriers for early adopters. These support mechanisms enable first-mover investments whilst spreading development costs across multiple stakeholders through public-private partnership structures, supporting broader investment strategies across the energy transition.

Shipowner Investment Strategies and Fleet Planning

Fleet investment strategies must balance alternative fuel technology adoption with operational flexibility during infrastructure development phases. Dual-fuel capable vessels provide operational security through conventional fuel backup systems whilst positioning fleets for alternative fuel adoption as infrastructure availability expands across global shipping routes.

The timing of vessel orders requires coordination with infrastructure development timelines to ensure fuel availability aligns with delivery schedules. Trafigura's commitment to four ammonia-fuelled gas carriers delivered by 2028 demonstrates strategic coordination between fleet investment and expected infrastructure readiness timelines in target operational regions.

Investment payback calculations must incorporate carbon compliance costs, fuel price differentials, potential operational restrictions in emissions control areas, and insurance premium variations between conventional and alternative fuel vessels. Long-term fleet planning requires scenario analysis addressing different rates of infrastructure deployment and regulatory framework evolution across global shipping markets.

Industry Value Chain Development and Partnership Models

Fertiliser Producers Expanding into Marine Fuel Markets

Traditional ammonia producers possess established manufacturing infrastructure, technical expertise, and global distribution networks that can be redirected toward marine fuel applications with appropriate modifications. CF Industries' Donaldsonville facility represents this strategic pivot, utilising existing production capacity whilst developing low-carbon certification capabilities specifically for marine fuel markets.

The 1.4 million tonnes per year ammonia project with 95% CO2 capture demonstrates how fertiliser producers can leverage industrial-scale infrastructure for marine fuel supply whilst maintaining core agricultural market service. This dual-market approach enables economies of scale across applications whilst providing revenue diversification opportunities during maritime fuel market development phases.

Production capacity allocation between fertiliser and marine fuel markets requires flexible manufacturing systems capable of responding to seasonal demand variations in agriculture whilst meeting consistent marine fuel supply commitments. Strategic inventory management and production scheduling become critical capabilities for producers serving both market segments simultaneously, reflecting broader manufacturing strategies within green metals leadership initiatives.

Trading Firms and Logistics Partnership Models

Global trading firms like Trafigura provide essential market access and risk management capabilities connecting ammonia producers with end-user shipping companies through established commodity trading networks. These firms possess global logistics expertise, customer relationships, and financial resources necessary for developing new fuel supply chains across multiple geographic regions.

Trading firm involvement enables producers to focus on manufacturing optimisation whilst delegating market development, customer service, and logistics coordination to specialised trading operations. This division of capabilities allows each participant to leverage core competencies whilst sharing development risks across multiple stakeholders.

Recent industry partnerships demonstrate integrated value chain development, combining ammonia production capabilities, global trading networks, and specialised marine fuel delivery systems to establish end-to-end supply chains.

Financial risk management becomes critical as trading firms manage price volatility, credit exposure, and supply chain disruptions across global ammonia markets serving both traditional and marine fuel applications. Sophisticated hedging strategies and inventory management systems enable consistent fuel supply availability despite commodity market fluctuations.

Shipping Companies and Fuel Supply Agreements

Long-term fuel supply agreements provide revenue certainty for infrastructure investment whilst guaranteeing fuel availability for shipping companies committed to alternative fuel vessel operations. These agreements typically include minimum volume commitments, price adjustment mechanisms, and force majeure provisions addressing infrastructure development delays or operational disruptions.

Contract structures must address fuel quality specifications, delivery scheduling flexibility, and backup fuel availability during infrastructure maintenance or emergency situations. Quality assurance protocols ensure low-carbon ammonia meets certification standards required for emissions compliance reporting and environmental claims validation.

Geographic coverage agreements coordinate fuel availability across shipping routes with infrastructure development timelines, potentially requiring initial concentration on specific trade lanes before expanding to global route coverage. Strategic partnership development enables shipping companies to influence infrastructure location decisions whilst providing demand certainty for facility investment planning.

Economic Challenges and Investment Requirements

Capital Expenditure for Infrastructure Development

Low-carbon ammonia bunkering infrastructure development requires substantial capital investment across production facilities, port terminals, and vessel modifications. Shore-based terminal construction costs vary significantly between new facility development and existing infrastructure retrofitting, with cryogenic handling requirements representing the largest cost component relative to conventional fuel terminals.

Production facility investments include carbon capture and storage infrastructure, renewable energy procurement systems, and specialised ammonia synthesis equipment optimised for low-carbon production pathways. The CF Industries $4 billion Blue Point facility demonstrates the scale of investment required for commercial-scale low-carbon ammonia production targeting marine fuel applications.

Port infrastructure adaptation costs depend on existing facility capabilities, with LNG-capable ports possessing some cryogenic expertise but requiring ammonia-specific modifications for toxicity management and different temperature requirements. New terminal construction provides opportunities for optimised design but requires higher capital investment compared to facility retrofitting approaches.

Fuel Cost Competitiveness and Pricing Dynamics

Current ammonia fuel cost premiums reflect small-scale production, limited infrastructure availability, and regulatory compliance requirements that differ significantly from conventional marine fuel cost structures. Production cost competitiveness improves through economies of scale, but infrastructure development costs must be recovered through fuel pricing mechanisms during initial deployment phases.

Carbon pricing integration creates complex fuel cost structures incorporating production pathway carbon intensity, regulatory credit values, and emissions compliance costs that vary across different shipping markets and regulatory jurisdictions. These factors create pricing volatility beyond traditional commodity market fluctuations affecting long-term contract negotiations.

Fuel cost parity with conventional marine fuels may require carbon pricing levels of $100-150 per tonne CO2 or direct regulatory mandates for alternative fuel adoption. Economic competitiveness improves through technology advancement, infrastructure scaling, and regulatory framework evolution, but timeline uncertainty creates investment risk for early infrastructure development.

Risk Allocation in Long-Term Supply Contracts

Long-term fuel supply agreements must allocate risks including infrastructure development delays, fuel quality variations, regulatory framework changes, and force majeure events affecting fuel availability or vessel operations. Contract structures typically share these risks across producers, trading firms, and shipping companies based on each participant's ability to manage specific risk categories.

Infrastructure development risk allocation includes construction delays, regulatory approval processes, and technology performance guarantees that affect fuel availability timing. Producers typically retain manufacturing risk whilst sharing infrastructure development risk with trading partners and customers through minimum volume commitments and milestone-based contract activation.

Regulatory risk management addresses potential changes in emissions compliance requirements, fuel certification standards, and safety regulations affecting operational procedures. Contract provisions include adjustment mechanisms for regulatory compliance cost changes whilst maintaining base pricing structures for predictable cost components.

Future Market Scaling and Global Route Development

Regional Hub Development Strategies

Low-carbon ammonia bunkering hub development follows established maritime fuel supply patterns, concentrating initially in major shipping route intersections with existing ammonia handling infrastructure before expanding to secondary ports serving regional trade routes. The strategic focus on US Gulf Coast and northwest Europe demonstrates industry recognition of infrastructure development economics and operational risk management.

Hub development strategies prioritise ports with existing ammonia import or export infrastructure serving fertiliser and industrial markets, enabling shared infrastructure utilisation and economies of scale across multiple applications. This approach reduces infrastructure investment requirements whilst leveraging established operational expertise and regulatory approval frameworks.

Geographic expansion planning coordinates infrastructure development with shipping route priorities, vessel deployment schedules, and regional regulatory framework development. Strategic hub placement enables vessels to maintain operational flexibility across multiple trade routes whilst ensuring fuel availability throughout planned operational areas.

Trade Flow Implications and Supply Chain Reconfiguration

Low-carbon ammonia marine fuel development may redirect existing ammonia trade flows from traditional fertiliser export routes toward emerging bunkering hub locations. Current ammonia trade patterns concentrate exports from US Gulf, Middle East, and Trinidad to markets in Europe, Asia, and South America, providing established logistics networks that can be adapted for marine fuel applications.

Supply chain reconfiguration requires coordination between fertiliser market service and marine fuel demand, potentially creating seasonal allocation challenges as agricultural demand peaks during planting seasons whilst shipping fuel demand remains relatively consistent throughout the year. Strategic inventory management and production scheduling become critical for managing dual-market service requirements.

Trade flow evolution depends on the relative development of production facilities, infrastructure availability, and vessel adoption rates across different geographic regions. Early concentration in established ammonia-handling regions may gradually expand toward distributed production networks serving regional shipping markets with dedicated marine fuel production facilities.

Timeline for Commercial Deployment and Market Penetration

Commercial ammonia bunkering deployment follows a staged development pathway beginning with pilot operations (2025-2027) enabling safety protocol validation and operational procedure refinement before scaling to early commercial operations (2028-2030) serving regional shipping routes with established infrastructure.

However, the scale-up phase (2030-2035) targets major shipping lane coverage as infrastructure networks expand and vessel availability increases through both new construction and retrofit programmes. This phase requires coordination between infrastructure development, fleet conversion timelines, and regulatory framework implementation across multiple jurisdictions.

Full deployment (2035-2050) projects ammonia achieving 35-50% marine fuel market share through comprehensive infrastructure networks, established operational procedures, and regulatory frameworks supporting widespread adoption. This projection depends on successful technology demonstration, cost competitiveness achievement, and policy support for maritime decarbonisation objectives.

Market penetration rates depend on infrastructure investment levels, regulatory implementation timelines, and technology advancement speeds that reduce operational costs and complexity. Early success in pilot programmes and regional deployment creates momentum for accelerated scaling, whilst infrastructure delays or technical challenges may extend development timelines beyond current projections. Furthermore, as demonstrated by initiatives like the Pilbara clean fuel bunkering hub, regional developments are gaining momentum across multiple maritime hubs worldwide.

Welcoming this milestone, IMO Secretary-General Mr. Arsenio Dominguez said:

“The world has demonstrated that countries can come together with a common vision and build a framework to manage the ocean sustainably while ensuring its benefits are shared fairly amongst all humanity. Now we must continue working together to put these rules into action. IMO is ready to support the BBNJ implementation within IMO’s sphere of expertise.”

Shipping and marine environment protection on the high seas

Ships trading across the world's oceans are subject to stringent environmental, safety and security rules, which apply throughout their voyage.

IMO has developed more than 50 globally-binding treaties and other measures to support shipping’s sustainable use of the oceans, enforced through a well-established system of flag, coastal and port State control.

IMO instruments that actively contribute to the conservation of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, include, among others:

International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships (MARPOL)

International Ballast Water Management Convention, which aims to prevent the transfer of potentially invasive aquatic species; and

London Convention and Protocol, regulating the dumping of wastes at sea.

Greece is joining Saudi Arabia and the US in negotiations within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). The three countries are united by their commitment to using natural gas to power ships, a position opposed by the EU, which seeks to promote the adoption of low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels.

Greece is effectively ramping up its reversal of last October, when both Athens and Nicosia abstained from a vote on a new Net-Zero Framework for global shipping, for which a unanimous EU position had been agreed.

At the time, US President Donald Trump threatened to personally sanction any officials who voted to adopt the provisional agreement to decarbonise the shipping industry. The IMO session ended in disarray, with an agreement to reconvene a year later.

Standing firm

There are now serious doubts as to whether the bloc can present a unified front in time for a November showdown in London.

“We continue to stand firmly behind the shared objective of putting global shipping on a net-zero emission path towards 2025,” a European Commission spokesperson said on Friday.

“It’s very important that all EU Member States stay united,” the official added. “We are looking into the news, and we are in contact with all member states and the relevant authorities.”

The Greek defection, reminiscent of Italy signing up to China’s Belt-and-Road initiative in 2019 without the say-so of its EU neighbours, is adding to the troubles of the net-zero shipping framework, a global initiative provisionally agreed last April.

A Greek government source told Euractiv that Athens intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to reach an agreement that serves both the US and Europe.

“We are not abandoning the EU position or the green transition targets, but we need to find a way out of the stalemate,” the source said.

Still, some argue that internal divisions have left the EU impotent in the face of White House pressure.

“Rather than having their voice heard within the EU, this announcement places Greece into a minority of oil-exporting petrostates,” said Felix Klann, a shipping policy officer at the organisation Transport and Environment.

Lukas Leppert, a representative of the German environmental organisation NABU, said the Greek decision to side with the US and Saudi Arabia “displays their continued deviation.”

“It is an attack on an agreed compromise,” Leppert said.

Location, cost reduction and policy collaboration can all help to scale e-fuel production and use across many different industries.

Leaders gathering at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2026 will discuss how to scale clean fuels and drive economic growth.

At the COP30 climate change conference in November 2025, more than 20 countries committed to Belem 4x – a pledge to quadruple the use of sustainable fuels by 2035 from a 2024 baseline. Sustainable fuels, also called clean fuels or low-carbon molecules, include liquid biofuels, biogases, low-emission hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels like e-fuels.

Currently, liquid fuels provide half to two-thirds of global primary energy demand. But alternatives to fossil fuels are quite limited in sectors like aviation, shipping, industry and heavy road transport. Greater use of sustainable fuels by these industries could reduce emissions and bolster global energy security by diversifying fuel supply and reducing import dependence. This would require scaling clean fuels, however.

One clean fuel option that is ripe for scaling is e-fuel. Produced by combining green hydrogen with recycled or direct air captured CO₂, e-fuels are chemically equivalent to hydrocarbons, but their emissions can be more than 80% lower than those of fossil fuels.

Known as ""drop-in"" fuels, e-fuels can be used in existing engines and transported and stored using existing infrastructure. That’s particularly important for long-lived and older infrastructure and for consumer choice.

E-fuel can store and transport renewable energy in molecular form, allowing it to reach markets that cannot rely on direct electrification. This means it could be useful in countries with abundant but remote renewable resources, such as Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Morocco, Canada, the US and Australia. In such locations, at-scale e-fuel projects would complement electrification, rather than replace it.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), only 1% of clean fuels are hydrogen and hydrogen-derivative-based fuels like e-fuels. In other words, e-fuels are still nascent. Location, cost reduction and policy collaboration will all play a key role in scaling e-fuels.

E-fuel production is technically proven

Several e-fuel demonstration facilities have already shown that clean molecule production is technically viable. One example is the HIF Haru Oni e-fuel facility in southern Chile. It has been operating for three years, producing green hydrogen and synthesizing it with recycled CO₂ to make e-methanol, e-gasoline and e-liquid gas. Fuels from the site have already shown early promise in several environments.

Porsche has tested Haru Oni’s e-fuels at various global events, for example, including the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup and the Arosa ClassicCar races. The Chilean Navy has also powered a motorboat used by its Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service with e-fuel, while expedition company Antarctica21 has fuelled its Zodiac boats with e-gasoline to promote sustainable tourism.

More recently, the Port of Açu in Brazil launched a green shipping corridor with the Port of Antwerp-Bruges in Belgium, just before COP30. This could become one of the world’s first large-scale e-fuel export routes by 2030.

These early collaborations show synthetic fuels can meet demanding technical and operational requirements, which should encourage other sectors to consider low-carbon fuels as well.

How to scale e-fuel use

Cost is still the main challenge for scaling e-fuel use across multiple industries. Producing e-fuels remains more expensive than fossil fuel refining, primarily due to the cost of renewable electricity, electrolysis and CO₂ capture.

But other clean energy technologies, such as solar, have overcome similar challenges. In those cases, deployment policy, standardization and mass manufacturing efficiencies delivered steep cost reductions. Clean molecules could follow a comparable trajectory as e-fuel technologies mature, deployment increases and modularization drives efficiencies.

In fact, the industry is already working to overcome the production cost challenge. Over the last 36 months, electrolyzer plant standardization and pre-engineering innovations have been developed that promise steep cost reductions, as well as lower project construction costs due to modularization. Tapping into existing industrial clusters can also help capture infrastructure efficiencies and large quantity equipment orders through economies of scale.

The next frontier of cost reduction is expected to come from competition and efficiency breakthroughs in CO₂ capture, and more coordinated co-development with host countries seeking development of new industries.

Policy that is simple, certain and creates investible opportunities will help e-fuels – and all clean fuels – to achieve scale. Globally, interoperable policy that prioritizes least-cost production is essential, including harmonized standards, lifecycle-based rules and demand-creation mechanisms. This will help reduce uncertainty for investors and producers and enable viable long-term offtake agreements.

A recent World Economic Forum report, Fuelling the Future: How Business, Finance, and Policy Can Accelerate the Clean Fuels Market, highlights how performance-based policies, public-private cooperation and demand signals from industry can work together to accelerate investment and deployment across clean fuels.

Building on e-fuel progress to date

The progress made so far to scale e-fuel production and use offers important insights for its continued development. E-fuels can be produced with existing technology, they can be used in current engines and distribution systems, and early users have shown they can perform reliably. The next step is to translate demonstration experience into investments capable of delivering meaningful production volumes.

Reducing emissions in hard-to-abate sectors is one of the most challenging parts of the global net-zero challenge. Clean molecules such as e-fuels provide a practical option to accelerate emissions reductions in areas where few alternatives exist. The technical foundations are in place, early lessons have been learned and momentum is building. Now the focus must shift to scaling e-fuel solutions.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_4kZrCIXRA0yt6T0UfwatecS-iTjUsPMUq2yWe83WpBI.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 10:58:59.401920

The maritime sector in Spain is setting sail towards a cleaner, greener horizon with the launch of the nation’s first maritime green corridor connecting the ports of Valencia and Palma. This landmark collaboration between Baleària and these two major ports aims to transform the transport of passengers and cargo by drastically reducing emissions on this busy route.

The Roadmap to Zero Emissions by 2030

The initiative pledges to hit zero emissions by 2030 along the Valencia-Palma maritime corridor, an ambitious goal far ahead of the EU’s broader 2050 targets. Central to this effort are Baleària’s two vessels equipped with dual-fuel engines that will transition to running solely on biogás by 2030. To further green the journey, these ships will install onboard batteries supplying renewable electricity for auxiliary operations, while dockside OPS (shore power) systems are planned for clean energy usage while berthed.

Key Initiative Elements Description Zero Emissions Target Year 2030 Fuel Type Biogás (biofuel) Ship Equipment Dual-fuel engines, onboard batteries, OPS connections Route Ports of Valencia and Palma

Collaborative Effort Among Industry Leaders

This project has the backing and signatures of key players: Baleària’s President Adolfo Utor, Presidents of the Valencia and Balearic Port Authorities Mar Chao and Javier Sanz respectively. Government officials also lent their support during the presentation in Valencia, underlining the national importance of this sustainable thrust.

The sentiment shared by leaders echoes a strong commitment to sustainable growth: port authorities will accelerate infrastructure readiness for battery charging and promote low-carbon fuel supply developments. This public-private partnership represents a significant stride not only in maritime passenger mobility but also in the vital freight supply chain between the mainland and the Balearic Islands.

Why This Initiative Matters for Logistics

Decarbonizing maritime freight routes is a game changer for the wider logistics sector. Not only does it lower the carbon footprint of essential cargo shipments—a critical component for globally conscious supply chains—but it also sets a new standard for energy-efficient maritime operations. For industries depending on the timely transport of goods, greener shipping means aligning with regulatory trends and consumer expectations without sacrificing reliability or cost-effectiveness.

Reduced environmental impact: Cleaner vessels mean lower emissions and healthier port cities.

Future-proof freight transport: Shipping companies can avoid potential penalties tied to emissions.

Innovation in maritime technology: Stimulating investments in biofuels and battery storage.

Voices from the Frontline of Sustainable Maritime Transport

Reflecting on the collaboration, industry leaders underscored how sustainability and development go hand in hand. They acknowledged the responsibility of ports to lead the transition toward cleaner, quieter maritime activities, ensuring future growth aligns with environmental stewardship.

What’s Next for Green Maritime Logistics?

The initiative will likely serve as a blueprint for other routes, propelling the entire sector towards greener alternatives. While the impact of a single corridor might seem modest on a global scale, it signals an important trend in maritime freight and passenger transportation toward sustainability.

For logistics operators, carriers, and shippers, embracing these innovations early can translate into competitive advantages, including better compliance with global environmental standards and catering to eco-conscious customers. The stepping stones laid by Baleària and the ports of Valencia and Palma could soon ripple across Europe and beyond.

Breaking the bloc Following the chaotic October meeting, the European Commission told Euractiv that it was open to renegotiating the net-zero shipping deal.","The Greek government is working on a proposal with the United States and Saudi Arabia to curb CO2 emissions from shipping, bypassing EU coordination on the issue.

The proposal is under discussion at the London-based International Maritime Organization (IMO). Athens is abandoning a joint EU position on global shipping decarbonisation, which is currently frozen at the IMO.

“Greece and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate, through their competent ministries – shipping and energy – with a view to submitting a joint proposal on this specific matter,” Greek Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou said on Thursday, following a meeting in Riyadh with his Saudi counterpart, Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud.

Athens is providing a “voice of realism” on energy issues in Europe, Papastavrou added.

The move is expected to raise eyebrows in Brussels. That’s because individual EU countries are expected to seek agreement with the remaining 26 rather than cooperate with third countries on a matter over which the European Commission holds exclusive competence.

It is already the second time Athens, home to much of the global shipping industry, has broken the bloc’s ranks after Greece, alongside Cyprus, abstained during an October vote in London on a global net-zero shipping deal.

At the centre of the debate is the Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NSF), which would force ship operators continuing to use the dirtiest – and cheapest – fuels to pay a gradually increasing carbon price, proportionate to their excess CO2 emissions.

In practice, the framework would prioritise low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen and synthetic e-fuels derived from renewable energy, favouring countries such as Denmark and China, which have invested heavily in these technologies.

However, agreement on the proposal was postponed for a year last October following opposition from Washington and Riyadh. The US administration even threatened sanctions if the deal went ahead, as Washington supports liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transitional fuel.

The diplomatic row last October was widely seen as another instance of Europe being caught in a broader geopolitical tug-of-war between Washington and Beijing. Denmark, which opposed the US line, appears to have paid a price, having failed for the first time in late November to secure re-election to the IMO Council.

Breaking the bloc

Following the chaotic October meeting, the European Commission told Euractiv that it was open to renegotiating the net-zero shipping deal. Now it appears to have renegotiated the deal with Washington and Riyadh, not Brussels.

But Greece’s position could trigger an infringement procedure within the EU.

One EU diplomat noted that only the EU as a whole can table a common position at the IMO, and that in the event of internal disagreement, the bloc simply has no official position.

“Member states do not align themselves with third-country camps,” the diplomat added.

Hydrogen is quickly becoming the buzzword in maritime innovation, and companies like LH2 Shipping are steering the ship toward a greener future. Recently, LH2 Shipping scored over NOK 500 million in funding from Norway’s state agency Enova to develop and build liquid hydrogen-powered bulk carriers, marking a major milestone in reducing maritime emissions.

Funding Details and Collaborative Efforts

The latest injection of NOK 299 million supports the construction of two additional hydrogen-fuelled bulk carriers. This comes on the heels of an earlier grant of NOK 237.6 million awarded for two similar vessels already in development. Together, these grants push total state-backed support beyond the NOK 536 million mark for four innovative hydrogen-powered ships.

These vessels are being developed in partnership with Strand Shipping Bergen, a company operating under the larger Vertom Group BV umbrella, noted for managing a diverse fleet of over 100 ships. The collaboration combines extensive maritime expertise with pioneering clean energy technology.

What This Means for Maritime Decarbonization

LH2 Shipping emphasizes that this substantial funding is more than just money—it’s a clear message of commitment towards significant emissions reduction within the bulk carrier segment, a sector ripe for impactful climate action. As Dr. Ivan Oestvik, CEO of LH2 Shipping, highlighted, transitioning to hydrogen-powered ships at scale signals a promising path for national and global maritime industries aiming for sustainable operations.

Context: Why Hydrogen Power in Shipping?

Shipping is the backbone of global trade, but it’s also a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Embracing alternatives like liquid hydrogen such as LH2 Shipping plans isn’t just a futuristic dream—it’s a practical move aimed at sustainable haulage and distribution. Bulk carriers moving raw materials stand to benefit greatly by integrating clean fuels, which promises to slash carbon footprints without compromising the vast logistical requirements of global freight movement.

Hydrogen Advantages and Challenges

Zero Emissions: Hydrogen fuel emits only water vapor when combusted, massively reducing pollution.

Energy Density: Liquid hydrogen packs more energy per weight than many alternatives, fitting for long haul voyages.

Infrastructure Demands: Widespread adoption hinges on developing the supply chain and bunkering infrastructure.

Safety and Handling: Liquid hydrogen requires advanced storage technology due to its extremely low temperature and volatility.

The Bigger Picture: Impact on Global Logistics

While hydrogen-powered ships might still be a niche today, funding boosts like the ones LH2 Shipping received set the stage for wider acceptance and deployment of clean maritime fuels. This transition has ripple effects across the logistics and forwarding industries, promoting greener supply chains, more reliable shipment scheduling through cleaner technology, and potentially lower freight costs linked to sustainable incentives.

MANILA, Philippines — President Marcos witnessed yesterday the naming and delivery ceremony of the world’s first methanol dual-fueled bulk carrier in Cebu, an event that he said highlighted the Philippines’ status as a major shipbuilder and its readiness to lead in the transition to low-carbon and sustainable maritime transport.

Bulk carrier KAMSARMAX SC-443 is designed to significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions by 10 percent, nitrogen oxides by 80 percent and sulfur oxides by 99 percent compared to conventional models.

Named Brave Pioneer, the ship was launched on July 17, 2025 in Balamban, Cebu by Tsuneishi Heavy Industries Inc. (THI), a joint venture between Japan’s Tsuneishi Group and the Philippines’ Aboitiz Group.

Marcos described the event as “a historic milestone for Philippine shipbuilding,” hailing the project as “a showcase of Filipino craftsmanship, ingenuity and competitiveness.”

“This accomplishment stands as an example of what can be achieved through strong international partnerships. The collaboration between Japan and the Philippines – between the Tsuneishi Group and the Aboitiz Group – brings together advanced ship design, skilled Filipino labor and a robust domestic manufacturing base,” the President said.

“It proves, once again, that what is made in the Philippines can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best of anywhere in the world,” he added.

According to Marcos, Brave Pioneer places the Philippines firmly on the map as a future-ready maritime manufacturing hub aligned with International Maritime Organization decarbonization targets and global sustainability standards.

He said green vessels open doors to sustainability-linked loans, green bonds and climate finance.

The transition to low carbon transport also fuels growth in ancillary industries like advanced marine components, coatings, materials and energy-efficient systems, the Chief Executive added.

“This achievement sends a clear message to the whole world: the Philippines is ready to lead in the global transition toward low-carbon and sustainable maritime transport,” he said.

“This occasion not only celebrates the launching of a vessel; it is also a celebration of progress and of innovation. And above all, we celebrate the Filipino capacity to rise to the challenge of a rapidly changing world.”

Marcos also highlighted the Philippines’ significance to the shipping industry, which he described as “vibrant, dynamic and growing.”

“We are one of the world’s largest shipbuilding nations,” he said.

Marcos noted that as of November last year, the Philippines has over 130 registered shipyards employing more than 11,000 workers.

In 2024, a total of 484 vessels were constructed in the Philippines, including fishing boats, passenger and cargo ships.

“This administration also remains fully committed to strengthening the shipbuilding and ship repair industry by enhancing its competitiveness, sustainability, and strategic capacity,” the President said.

Marcos cited the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or the CREATE Law that provides fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to encourage modernization, the adoption of low-carbon technologies and higher-value manufacturing.

How Odfjell expects to shift to clean energy Odfjell has reduced its carbon intensity by more than 54% since 2008 through both technical upgrades and operational efficiencies.
""This green corridor will show how this works in action while demonstrating how value-chain collaboration can speed the transition and help meet ambitious goals,"" he continues.","Odfjell’s new transatlantic shipping route marks an important moment for the decarbonisation of commercial fleets.

The Norwegian shipping firm has launched what it calls the first operational green corridor between Brazil and Europe, a 5,000-nautical-mile route across which its tankers will be powered by B24 biofuel.

Odfjell is set to charter between 12 and 15 voyages through the corridor per year, with each voyage lasting around 40 days.

The initiative is completely self-funded, meaning that Odfjell will absorb the higher costs of the renewable fuel without support.

""By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation,"" says Harald Fotland, CEO of Odfjell.

The B24 blend, which is supplied by Rio Grande, includes 24% waste-derived renewable biodiesel combined with 76% very-low-sulphur oil.

Bringing renewable energy to the seas

To guarantee a consistent supply of the B24 biofuel blend, Odfjell has established an offtake agreement in Rio Grande.

The Ports of Antwerp-Bruges, Rotterdam and Rio Grande have also partnered with the firm to oversee the energy efficiency of the port operations along the corridor.

""We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology and infrastructure are already available,"" Harald explains.

""Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.""

Importantly, this project is not just a short-term trial. Rather, the corridor is part of Odfjell's long-term strategy when it comes to decarbonisation.

Reaction to Odfjell's green corridor

The corridor is a well-supported initiative both at Odfjell and externally. The Norwegian Minister of Climate and Environment, Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, has welcomed it as ""an important milestone"".

He says: ""We congratulate Odfjell on taking the lead and demonstrating what is possible when business and public authorities cooperate across national borders to reduce emissions.

""Green shipping corridors over long distances are still in their early stages, and this therefore represents an important first step on the path toward zero emissions.""

The transatlantic corridor builds on a 2024 memorandum of understanding between Norway and Brazil focused on establishing a renewable energy supply chain for shipping.

Knut Arild Hareide, CEO of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, considers the move a key development in scaling cleaner fuels.

He explains: ""That a deep-sea shipping company like Odfjell has succeeded in establishing a regular corridor between Brazil and Europe powered by certified biofuel is both highly encouraging and an important step toward our shared goal of decarbonising global shipping by 2050.""

Shipping currently produces around 3% of global human-made greenhouse gas emissions.

How Odfjell expects to shift to clean energy

Odfjell has reduced its carbon intensity by more than 54% since 2008 through both technical upgrades and operational efficiencies. The company now sees biofuel as a strategic component within its broader decarbonisation plan.

""With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonisation strategy,"" adds Harald.

This effort supports the International Maritime Organization’s 2030 targets and complements the EU’s Fit for 55 package by advancing low-carbon energy solutions across shipping lanes.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime, says biofuels remain one of the most realistic energy alternatives for long-distance fleets.

""This green corridor will show how this works in action while demonstrating how value-chain collaboration can speed the transition and help meet ambitious goals,"" he continues.

Harald adds that the initiative’s success depends on maintaining close collaboration across the energy value chain – from ports and customers to suppliers – to increase renewable fuel access and improve efficiency.

""It may not be a perfect corridor yet, but a solid start,"" he concludes.

Built by Tsuneishi Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. and owned by Mitsui & Co. Ltd., the vessel Brave Pioneer is equipped to operate on conventional marine fuels and green methanol. The estimated CO2 saving of using green methanol compared to conventional fuel is up to 70%.

The ship departed the Philippines on Jan. 15, will bunker green methanol in Singapore, then proceed to Western Australia before sailing to Europe. Through Brave Pioneer’s maiden voyage, Cargill will conduct a series of operational trials designed to evaluate green methanol bunkering readiness, understand how environmental attributes can be traced and verified through carbon accounting systems, and assess market appetite for low-carbon freight services.

“Decarbonizing global shipping requires a mix of technologies and the willingness to take bold steps before the entire ecosystem is ready,” said Jan Dieleman, president of Cargill’s Ocean Transportation business. “Technologies like green methanol or wind-assisted propulsion come with uncertainty. But as an industry leader, we have a responsibility to test these innovations on the water, share what we learn, and help shape the systems and standards that will enable wider adoption.”

Four additional vessels will join Cargill’s fleet over the coming years, the company said. The addition of these vessels strengthens Cargill’s multi-solution decarbonization approach, which includes wind-assisted propulsion, voyage optimization technologies, energy-efficiency retrofits and exploration of alternative fuels such as biofuels and ethanol.

“We know the road to low-carbon shipping will require a mix of solutions and green methanol is one part of that portfolio,” Dieleman said. “Our new fleet is about optionality and adaptability. These vessels are engineered to perform at a best-in-class level on conventional fuel today, while allowing us to switch to greener fuels as availability improves. It’s a practical way to future-proof ocean transport.”

As one of the world’s largest charterers of dry bulk freight, Cargill said its actions send a strong demand signal to the market and serve as an open invitation for others in the maritime sector to join in advancing the transition to sustainable shipping.",https://www.world-grain.com/ext/resources/2024/08/14/Cargill-sign_WOLTERKE---STOCK.ADOBE.COM.jpg?height=635&t=1755524476&width=1200,N,,2026-01-15 11:56:40.266743

The push for greener solutions in shipping has taken significant steps forward, with Spain and Denmark emerging as frontrunners in producing green e-fuels tailored for maritime use. Alongside countries like Norway and France, these nations are investing in innovative projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable fuel alternatives for ships. However, while the potential is vast, actual advancement beyond initial planning faces hurdles due to unclear regulatory frameworks that slow investment and deployment.

Current State of Green E-Fuel Projects

According to recent analyses, up to 80 projects across Europe are developing green hydrogen and synthetic fuels—collectively known as e-fuels—that could supply more than 3.6 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2032. Yet, only about 5% of this potential output is dedicated entirely to the shipping sector, with many initiatives hesitating to commit fully due to uncertainties in policy and market conditions.

Country Projects Focused on Maritime Sector Significant Developments Norway Largest volume of marine-dedicated fuels Strong positioning in e-fuels export Spain Notable contribution alongside Norway Home to major projects like Kassø supplying Maersk Denmark Important player in e-methanol development European Energy’s leading projects operational France Emerging participant Involved in several planning-stage projects

Significance of Maritime Demand for E-Fuels

The maritime sector is proving to be more than a mere afterthought in e-fuel development. Studies indicate that for some fuels—particularly e-ammonia and e-methanol—the shipping industry represents the largest segment of potential buyers, outpacing even traditional users such as the fertilizer and chemical industries. This strong demand signal could be the key to convincing producers to invest heavily, as it guarantees a stable market and encourages scaling up of production facilities.

Noteworthy Projects

Kassø Project: The first marine e-fuel facility in Europe, supplying e-methanol to giant shipping companies like Maersk, became operational in 2025, setting a benchmark for future initiatives.

Emerging E-Ammonia & E-Methanol Ventures: Several projects have emerged, eyeing the shipping sector as their primary client, marking a clear interest in zero-emission fuels for sea freight.

Challenges Impeding Progress

Despite the promising groundwork, advancing these initiatives from concept to full-scale operations remains an uphill battle. A major barrier is the absence of strong, consistent regulatory incentives or mandates that create certainty for investors. Without concrete policies or ambitious fuel demand targets, many projects stall or shy away from making final investment decisions.

Economic confidence is vital in logistics and freight transport sectors—they thrive on predictability and rules of the game set in stone. The vague regulatory climate leaves project developers juggling risk, slowing innovation that could ultimately revolutionize shipping fuel used in global freight and vessel propulsion.

Policy Recommendations

Introduce clear, ambitious green fuel requirements specific to shipping sectors in upcoming policy updates.

Ensure economic incentives and funding mechanisms are in place to support scaling up e-fuel production.

Prioritize reinvesting emissions trading system (ETS) revenues into green shipping initiatives to boost market confidence.

Why This Matters for Logistics and Transport

Shipping forms the backbone of global logistics, ferrying massive volumes of cargo internationally. The sector’s shift to greener fuel alternatives is not only an environmental imperative but also a critical driver for sustainable supply chain management. As fuel becomes greener and cleaner, operators can reduce their carbon footprint dramatically, aligning with global commitments to sustainability while satisfying increasingly strict regulations on emissions.

The move towards green e-fuels also impacts cost structures and reliability in transportation logistics. Early adoption and scaling of these fuels could lead to more predictable fuel pricing, mitigating risks associated with fossil fuel volatility. This stability can ripple down the supply chain, helping industry players—from freight forwarders to final delivery services—optimize routes and fuel choices more efficiently.

Key Takeaways

Spain and Denmark are at the cutting edge of marine green fuel innovation, paving the way for a cleaner shipping future.

Regulatory certainty remains a sticking point that, if resolved, could unlock significant investments and operational growth in e-fuels.

The maritime sector is poised to be the biggest consumer of e-fuels like e-ammonia and e-methanol, signaling strong demand ahead.

Policy support and funding are vital to transform pilot projects into mainstream shipping fuel solutions.

The advancement in green shipping fuels is essential for reducing the environmental impact of one of the world’s most important freight transport modalities.

Mr Pedersen said the politics surrounding the extraordinary session had changed the negotiating climate at IMO.
Ms Kronudd said Europe needed to adjust its negotiating posture to the current environment, while maintaining the underlying policy goal.
On the preferred pathway ahead, 69% of respondents selected “continue the discussion and try to adopt in one year”, compared with 17% favouring protocol creation and 14% supporting dismissal of the adjourned extraordinary session.
Views on timing skewed towards a longer delay: 57% agreed the delay to the NZF would last three years or more; while 43% disagreed.","Ms Kronudd said the European Commission’s initial public reaction to the October meeting had softened into a more consultative approach towards EU member states, with Brussels seeking to restore a unified bloc position ahead of the next IMO decision point.

Ms Kronudd said the Commission had reiterated that the postponement did not change the implementation of EU rules, adding: “Until we have a global agreement, the regional framework will stay.”

She said EU discussions had moved quickly compared with the IMO’s meeting cycle and suggested that the politics inside the bloc could now cut both ways: the Commission’s effort to bring dissenting member states back into alignment could also encourage others to seek concessions.

""Returning to an “all-or-nothing” decision environment risked repeating the breakdown""

Ms Kronudd said the Commission had been working on “a single monitoring, reporting and verification framework” intended to cover both the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime reporting, with proposals expected in Q3 2026, followed by further changes on FuelEU Maritime compliance in 2027.

Ms Scheiris described the October extraordinary session as politically charged and said the adjournment vote had deferred adoption for a year without resolving foundational disagreements.

She said the session had exposed disputes over procedural routes to adoption, governance of the proposed net-zero fund, regulatory fragmentation and the distribution of compliance costs along the value chain.

Ms Scheiris said that, in her view, the industry still wanted “a good, single, global solution”, but that elements of the NZF needed clarification to build consensus.

She said the sustainable fuel certification scheme and life-cycle assessment methodology needed further detail, and that non-fuel energy sources should be recognised alongside alternative fuels.

“All the transitional pathways towards decarbonisation stay open,” she said, citing energy-saving devices, sustainable biofuels, LNG and wind-assisted propulsion as options that operators had been considering.

Mr Pedersen said the NZF that emerged from MEPC 83 in April 2025 had been developed quickly as a compromise package and had not been subject to a dedicated impact assessment before being circulated for adoption at the extraordinary session.

""48% favoured proceeding without US participation, 29% preferred negotiating a bilateral US agreement and 23% supported pausing""

He said the two-tier greenhouse fuel intensity (GFI) design and the accompanying economic mechanics created a complex compliance structure, the practical implications of which were still being tested by the industry.

Mr Pedersen said the politics surrounding the extraordinary session had changed the negotiating climate at IMO.

He said the organisation’s tradition of reaching consensus was under pressure, noting that divisive votes had become more likely and that some states were now using procedural tools that, in his view, departed from established practice: “Votes are very divisive … the normality has changed,” he said.

A particular concern, Mr Pedersen said, was that the committee had reached a point in October where the legal text was effectively in a yes-or-no adoption posture, rather than a space for substantive renegotiation.

He said returning to an “all-or-nothing” decision environment risked repeating the breakdown: “We have to be careful not to get back into that room in a black or white scenario.”

He also highlighted the dispute over whether amendments would follow tacit or explicit acceptance procedures, arguing that a move to explicit acceptance would risk creating a precedent that weakened predictability for future changes.

Mr Pedersen said tacit acceptance had been the standard for amendments for decades and had provided a clear timetable for entry into force, whereas an explicit acceptance threshold would be difficult to meet and could result in amendments never entering into force.

On engagement with the US, there had been strong opposition from the US State Department and the panel was asked whether economic opportunities, including sustainable biofuels, could create a pathway back to negotiations.

Ms Scheiris said it could be worth engaging with the US on “the more economical parts of the proposal”, adding that US production potential for sustainable biofuels and bio LNG was large and could create revenue. “Let’s open that conversation and let’s see what their opinions are,” she said.

Ms Kronudd said Europe needed to adjust its negotiating posture to the current environment, while maintaining the underlying policy goal.

She said Brussels should send an “appropriate delegation” and maintain “a basket of options” in negotiations, while remaining mindful of the EU’s climate policy drivers.

Opinion polls

A series of live audience polls during the expert-led webinar suggested a preference for continued IMO negotiations, alongside a cautious expectation that the framework could be reshaped materially before MEPC 84.

On the preferred pathway ahead, 69% of respondents selected “continue the discussion and try to adopt in one year”, compared with 17% favouring protocol creation and 14% supporting dismissal of the adjourned extraordinary session.

Views on timing skewed towards a longer delay: 57% agreed the delay to the NZF would last three years or more; while 43% disagreed.

Asked what outcome looked most likely at MEPC 84 in April 2026, respondents split between “remove the economic element but keep technical standards” (44%) and “re-establish ES.2 Part 2 with minor adjustments” (42%), with 14% expecting termination and a return to working groups.

On how to respond to US State Department opposition, 48% favoured proceeding without US participation, 29% preferred negotiating a bilateral US agreement and 23% supported pausing until consensus was achieved.

Finally, on whether the EU should proceed with unilateral measures despite IMO delays, 46% supported maintaining a climate leadership position, 31% preferred waiting for global consensus and 23% supported implementation with grace periods to allow alignment.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/185/Emma_Scheiris_Intertanko_1200w1_Main.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 07:58:16.063638

The Philippines is ready for the global transition towards environmentally sustainable maritime transport, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday.

Marcos made the remarks at the historic naming and delivery ceremony for the KAMSARMAX SC-443 held at the West Cebu Estate in Balamban, Cebu, known ad the country’s shipbuilding capital of the Philippines.

“The Philippines is ready to lead in the global transition towards low-carbon and sustainable maritime transport,” the President said.

He went on: “This occasion not only celebrates the launching of a vessel; it is also a celebration of progress and of innovation. And above all, we celebrate the Filipino capacity to rise to the challenge of a rapidly changing world.”

Marcos named the vessel as “Brave Pioneer,” noting that it showcased Filipino craftsmanship, ingenuity, and competitiveness.

“It proves, once again, that what is made in the Philippines can stand shoulder to shoulder with the best of anywhere in the world,” he stressed.

The President added that the country is now a future-ready maritime manufacturing hub aligned with the International Maritime Organization’s decarbonization targets and global sustainability standards.

He noted that in 2024, the Philippines constructed 484 vessels ranging from fishing boats to passenger and cargo ships.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.
“It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge.
“The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice.
Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.","HAMBURG: Shipowners and managers are being reminded to review onboard fuel-measurement and data-capture practices following the entry into force of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI.

All ships of 5,000gt and above engaged on international voyages must now begin collecting more detailed operational data under the IMO Data Collection System. This includes information on how much fuel is used by different onboard systems, alongside information on distances sailed and time underway to allow fuel consumption to be assessed against the work the ship performs.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.

“Although information using the enhanced dataset does not have to be submitted until early 2027, the obligation to generate compliant data starts now,” said Uwe Krüger, Joint Managing Director of Germany’s CM Technologies (CMT). “Separating data collection from reporting is essential, as information that is not captured onboard during 2026 cannot be produced later.”

The amendment, adopted at MEPC 81 in March 2024, does not change the established IMO DCS reporting cycle. Fuel-oil consumption data for a given calendar year must still be verified by the Flag State or a recognised organisation, typically a classification society, with a Statement of Compliance issued by 31 May of the following year. What has changed is the scope, structure and traceability of the data that must now exist to support that process.

“Ships are now required to collect more granular information than under the original 2016 framework, moving beyond aggregated fuel figures towards continuous measurement that can demonstrate how fuel is consumed across different onboard systems and operating conditions. For many fleets, this represents a practical shift from estimation and reconciliation towards direct measurement,” said Krüger.

According to CMT, a common source of uncertainty is the assumption that the expanded DCS can be addressed primarily through revised reporting procedures, rather than through changes to how operational data is generated onboard. “It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge. “The first reports will be submitted in 2027, but the quality of those submissions depends entirely on what is measured and logged onboard throughout 2026, and the quality of that data.”

He added that ensuring the right tools are in place early reduces both compliance risk and verification effort later. “If fuel consumption by consumer and operating data are being generated continuously, owners place themselves in a much stronger position when the data is audited and reviewed.

“The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice. Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.

“Effective monitoring reduces reliance on estimation and reconciliation and puts operators in a much better position when the data is verified, since incomplete or inconsistent datasets can result in a SoC being withheld. There could also be greater interest during port State control inspections, and increased scrutiny from charterers.”

Krüger furthered that many operators still associate DCS with end-of-year paperwork, “but it is now very much an operational issue. It depends on what happens in the engine room and on the bridge every day, not on how figures are assembled twelve months later.”

CMT says its engine-performance and fuel-monitoring systems are designed to align with how the expanded IMO DCS dataset must be generated in practice. By capturing fuel consumption at the level of individual engines and other consumers, and linking that data to operating conditions, such systems provide a structured, auditable foundation that supports expanded DCS requirements alongside existing regulatory schemes.

“The objective is not simply to report more data, but to create reliable data in the first place,” Krüger said. “Operators that focus on measurement and data integrity will find their 2027 submission processes far more straightforward. Frequent and effective engine monitoring and data capture also helps crews optimise reduce fuel consumption, emissions and costs.”

With expanded IMO DCS data collection now underway, CMT is advising shipowners and technical managers to treat 2026 as a preparation and validation year, ensuring that onboard systems, procedures and verification pathways are aligned well in advance of the first submissions under the enhanced framework.",https://indiashippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CMT.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 07:58:21.545918

They are currently three to four times more expensive than conventional fossil fuels.

The devil is in the details

Despite the delay, discussions over the framework’s implementation guidelines, which govern how it would operate, continue. Many are hopeful that outstanding issues could be addressed through these discussions.

However, the rules are not easy to develop.

Take, for example, guidelines on how to assess the greenhouse gas intensity of marine fuels throughout their lifecycles. The guidelines essentially determine which fuel can be used to comply with the targets. As they currently stand, they would encourage ships to initially rely on biofuels, specifically renewable diesel made from used cooking oil. That is according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which has also determined that demand will outstrip supply of such fuel after 2032.

That shortage would eventually push the sector toward biofuels made from fresh vegetable oils. A rising demand for virgin oil could displace food production and lead to cropland expansion. The result would be the cutting down of forests and thus more emissions, states the study.

The guidelines haven’t yet accounted for these indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, which occur outside the direct supply chain of the biofuels. Adding safeguards to limit the use of biofuels that incur ILUC emissions would better support the uptake of fuels with no or close-to zero emissions, if the framework is adopted in October.

Building readiness in China

Although China voted to delay adoption, it’s still in the country’s interest to prepare its domestic industry for the inevitable transition.

Internationally, China could directly benefit from becoming a refuelling, or “bunkering”, hub for future sustainable marine fuel. Not currently one of the world’s largest such hubs, it could leapfrog some of the competition by supplying sustainable marine fuel. China is especially well-positioned to supply the likes of methanol and ammonia, which require cheap renewable electricity to synthesise.

But building out fuel production and bunkering infrastructure takes time. And it is hard to justify investment without sufficient demand signal. As such, delaying the IMO framework isn’t helping. Production of fuels and infrastructure need boosting in tandem. Otherwise, new fuel storage tanks and pipelines could end up filled with fossil fuels.

That said, leading ports in China – especially those that have already positioned themselves to become major bunkering ports – are already acting. In 2025, Shanghai’s port completed the nation’s first ship-to-ship methanol bunkering. And the port of Tianjin completed the first methanol bunkering for a car-carrier ship; while that ship was on its maiden voyage to Hong Kong, the government announced it will provide tax incentives for outbound ships using methanol as fuel.

The industry is also taking actions to support this development, with an initial focus on supplying the European market. In February 2025, the China Biomass Energy Industry Promotion Association released voluntary standards for “renewable methanol”. The standards use the term as an umbrella to differentiate gas made using biomass and electricity from gas made using fossil energy.

The standard classifies renewable methanol into three grades, based on the intensity of its greenhouse gas emissions from production to use. Grade A aligns with the European Union’s standard, which is designed to increase the bloc’s renewable energy use. The move has paved the way for renewable methanol produced in China to sell on the European market.

Potential support from net-zero fund

Payments made under the framework will be used to create a net-zero fund that rewards low-emission ships and helps developing nations to transition. China, among other nations, could qualify for such support.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/zheng-xue-SoAe5dQiQ4c-unsplash.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2026-01-15 03:57:30.652501

Toyota Motor Europe (TME) reduced its Scope 3 emissions by more than 22,000 tonnes of CO2e last year through bunkering of low-carbon fuels under United European Car Carriers’ (UECC) Sail for Change fuel-switch programme – and is set to more than double these savings in 2025. The reduction of 22,148 tonnes of CO2e – equivalent to the climate effect of growing 366,215 tree seedlings over 10 years – was achieved with transport of 54,991 vehicles on UECC vessels over the five-month period from August to December 2024.

Independent third-party verifier EnviroSense has validated the emissions saving as compliant with the EU’s RED II sustainability criteria for sourcing of marine fuels – covering agricultural biomass, as well as bio-waste and residue feedstock – to corroborate TME’s carbon footprint for ESG reporting. The certificate of verification was presented recently by UECC’s Chief Operating Officer Per Christian Mørk to TME’s Vice President Supply Chain, Jean Christophe Deville, and Head of Raw Material, Indirect and Logistics Purchasing, Rosemary Lister, at the TME head office in Brussels.

Towards carbon-neutral shipments

Mørk said UECC’s more than 30-year collaboration with TME has “grown into a cornerstone of sustainable logistics”, with UECC now transporting close to 200,000 vehicles for Toyota annually. He disclosed that TME is on course to achieve an even higher emissions reduction of 57,448 tonnes of CO2e this year on UECC shipments of vehicles from Toyota manufacturing plants in Turkey and the Czech Republic to ports in Northern Europe.

“These are not merely numbers; they represent a shared vision and a joint responsibility to create a cleaner, more sustainable future for our industry and our planet,” he stated.

TME was among the first of several major automotive OEMs to sign up for the Sail for Change initiative that focuses on transport of vehicles on UECC’s Pure Car and Truck Carriers (PCTCs) using both biofuels and liquefied biomethane (or bioLNG). Launched last year, the initiative has seen an exponential expansion in cargo volumes to fuel emissions reductions for participants.

“TME’s commitment has yielded tangible and impressive results. Together, we are setting a benchmark for lower carbon-intensive transportation and proving that collaboration can drive meaningful change,” Mørk added.

Decarbonisation of logistics

TME aims to reduce CO2 emissions from its supply chain through decarbonisation of maritime and other logistics.

“The significant emissions reduction achieved in 2024 represents a big step forward in our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our logistics and underpins the value of our partnership with UECC in realising common sustainability goals,” said TME’s Deville.

TME is among 11 leading automotive manufacturers engaged in the Drive Sustainability initiative to boost sustainability efforts across the supply chain by developing common standards and compliance criteria for suppliers that include carbon neutrality.

“We are dependent on business partners with a shared sense of environmental responsibility, and the ability of logistics providers to offer low-carbon solutions is at the core of our Sustainable Purchasing Guidelines. UECC has shown the way by driving forward sustainable short sea RoRo shipping in Europe,” Deville said.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.
“It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge.
""The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice.
Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.","Shipowners and managers are being reminded to review onboard fuel-measurement and data-capture practices following the entry into force of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI.

All ships of 5,000gt and above engaged on international voyages must now begin collecting more detailed operational data under the IMO Data Collection System. This includes information on how much fuel is used by different onboard systems, alongside information on distances sailed and time underway to allow fuel consumption to be assessed against the work the ship performs.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.

“Although information using the enhanced dataset does not have to be submitted until early 2027, the obligation to generate compliant data starts now,” said Uwe Krüger, Joint Managing Director of Germany’s CM Technologies (CMT). “Separating data collection from reporting is essential, as information that is not captured onboard during 2026 cannot be produced later.”

The amendment, adopted at MEPC 81 in March 2024, does not change the established IMO DCS reporting cycle. Fuel-oil consumption data for a given calendar year must still be verified by the Flag State or a recognised organisation, typically a classification society, with a Statement of Compliance issued by 31 May of the following year. What has changed is the scope, structure and traceability of the data that must now exist to support that process.

“Ships are now required to collect more granular information than under the original 2016 framework, moving beyond aggregated fuel figures towards continuous measurement that can demonstrate how fuel is consumed across different onboard systems and operating conditions. For many fleets, this represents a practical shift from estimation and reconciliation towards direct measurement,” said Krüger.

According to CMT, a common source of uncertainty is the assumption that the expanded DCS can be addressed primarily through revised reporting procedures, rather than through changes to how operational data is generated onboard. “It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge. “The first reports will be submitted in 2027, but the quality of those submissions depends entirely on what is measured and logged onboard throughout 2026, and the quality of that data.”

He added that ensuring the right tools are in place early reduces both compliance risk and verification effort later. “If fuel consumption by consumer and operating data are being generated continuously, owners place themselves in a much stronger position when the data is audited and reviewed.

""The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice. Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.

“Effective monitoring reduces reliance on estimation and reconciliation and puts operators in a much better position when the data is verified, since incomplete or inconsistent datasets can result in a SoC being withheld. There could also be greater interest during port State control inspections, and increased scrutiny from charterers.”

Krüger furthered that many operators still associate DCS with end-of-year paperwork, “but it is now very much an operational issue. It depends on what happens in the engine room and on the bridge every day, not on how figures are assembled twelve months later.”

CMT says its engine-performance and fuel-monitoring systems are designed to align with how the expanded IMO DCS dataset must be generated in practice. By capturing fuel consumption at the level of individual engines and other consumers, and linking that data to operating conditions, such systems provide a structured, auditable foundation that supports expanded DCS requirements alongside existing regulatory schemes.

“The objective is not simply to report more data, but to create reliable data in the first place,” Krüger said. “Operators that focus on measurement and data integrity will find their 2027 submission processes far more straightforward. Frequent and effective engine monitoring and data capture also helps crews optimise reduce fuel consumption, emissions and costs.”

With expanded IMO DCS data collection now underway, CMT is advising shipowners and technical managers to treat 2026 as a preparation and validation year, ensuring that onboard systems, procedures and verification pathways are aligned well in advance of the first submissions under the enhanced framework.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/677d25916da11d07add7c910/677e42da317bf233c28d75a0/696767fa570e5f4138475f48/1768385652147/CMT.JPG?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-14 18:57:16.715148

The PCTC Grande Manila, which was christened in Shanghai, was built by Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding (SWS) and China Shipbuilding Trading Company (CSTC), both part of China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC). The delivery and christening ceremony was attended by Zhang Wei, Vice President of SWS, and Luigi Pacella Grimaldi, Automotive Intercontinental Director of the Grimaldi Group. The role of godmother of the Grande Manila was entrusted to Doris Ho, President and CEO of Magsaysay Group, a Philippine maritime recruitment and crew management company.

Emanuele Grimaldi, Grimaldi Group’s Managing Director, highlighted: “With the arrival of Grande Manila we are celebrating, on the one hand, a new and important milestone in the expansion and modernisation of our fleet, and on the other, our increasingly strong ties with the Philippines, a country with a great seafaring tradition. Filipino seafarers represent a fundamental resource for our fleet: their professionalism, dedication and reliability are values that contribute every day to the safety and efficiency of our operations.

“For our part, also through the partnership with the Ho family and Magsaysay Group, we reaffirm our commitment to the growth and well-being of this extraordinary human capital. At the same time, by adding Philippine ports to our network of services, operated regularly by state-of-the-art vessels, we will further contribute to the sustainable growth of the country’s economy.”

This is the Italian group’s seventh ammonia-ready unit, prepared for the future use of ammonia as an alternative, zero-carbon fuel. With a length of 200 meters, a beam of 38 meters, and a gross tonnage of approximately 77,500 tons, the Grande Manila has been designed for the efficient transport of vehicles (cars, SUVs, vans, etc.), both electric and powered by traditional fuels, as well as any other type of rolling cargo.

The vessel has a loading capacity of 9,241 car equivalent units (CEU), with four decks capable of carrying other rolling cargo, including heavy loads of up to 250 tons and as high as 6.5 meters. The ship is perceived to pay tribute not only to the capital of the Philippines, but to the entire maritime community of the country for the contribution it makes to the global shipping industry.

The PCTC’s name is interpreted to also reflect the growing importance of the Asian nation within the Grimaldi Group’s commercial network. Following the recent launch of a new service connecting China with the port of Batangas with two sailings per month, the firm aims to expand its presence in other Philippine ports as well, such as Manila.

The maiden voyage of the Grande Manila will begin this week on the Asia–Europe service, with the vessel departing from Taicang in China, carrying over 5,800 cars and 1,300 linear meters of other rolling cargo (buses, trucks, excavators, wheel loaders), which will be delivered to the United Kingdom, Spain and Belgium and, via transhipment at Grimaldi’s Antwerp hub, to other Northern European and Mediterranean destinations.

From Europe, the vessel will sail back to East Asia, with its return to China scheduled for the end of April 2026. Sporting an electronic engine, described as offering one of the lowest specific fuel consumptions in its class that complies with the most stringent international limits for CO2, NOx, and SOx emissions, this ship is deemed to reduce the CO2 emissions index per transported cargo by up to 50% compared to previous-generation PCTC vessels.

The Grande Manila has already received the ammonia-ready class notation from RINA, certifying that it can be converted in the future to use ammonia as a zero-carbon alternative fuel. The PCTC is also equipped for shore power supply during berthing (cold ironing), which, where available, provides a green alternative to the use of traditional fuels while docked in port.",https://www.offshore-energy.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/01/Grande-Manila.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1768405758,N,,2026-01-14 11:58:10.370880

Against this backdrop, Lloyd’s Register (LR) has released the latest instalment in its award-winning Fuel for Thought series, turning its attention to hydrogen and its potential role in shipping’s energy transition. Published in January 2026, Fuel for Thought: Hydrogen offers a clear-eyed assessment of both the opportunities and the obstacles facing one of the most talked-about fuels in the decarbonisation debate – hydrogen.

LR’s broader Fuel for Thought program examines alternative fuel pathways; including, methanol, ammonia, biofuels and electrification. The series reflects a growing recognition that no single fuel will provide a universal solution. Instead, shipping’s future is likely to be shaped by a mix of technologies and use cases, constrained by cost, infrastructure and operational realities.

A sector searching for scalable solutions

Alternative fuels have moved rapidly from niche concept to strategic necessity in maritime transport. Environmental regulation is tightening, but so too is scrutiny from investors and customers who are increasingly demanding credible decarbonisation pathways. At the same time, shipowners are urged to balance emissions reduction with operational realities such as vessel range, payload capacity, safety and fuel availability.

Today’s menu of marine fuel options is broad and still evolving. It includes LNG and LPG as transitional fuels, biofuels that can often be blended with existing marine fuels, and emerging zero or near-zero-emissions options, such as hydrogen, ammonia, methanol and battery-electric systems. Even nuclear propulsion occasionally features in long-term discussions for specific vessel classes.

Each comes with trade-offs. Ammonia, for example, offers high energy density and zero carbon at the point of use, but presents significant toxicity and infrastructure challenges. Biofuels can deliver near-term emissions reductions using existing engines, but face constraints around sustainable feedstock supply. Batteries are well suited to short-sea shipping but remain impractical for long-distance routes.

Hydrogen occupies a unique position in this mix. When produced using renewable electricity and used in fuel cells, green hydrogen can deliver zero tank-to-wake emissions. It is also a critical building block for e-fuels, such as ammonia and methanol, giving it strategic importance beyond its direct use onboard ships.

Hydrogen under the microscope

LR’s new report examines hydrogen from production and supply through to onboard use, highlighting both its promise and the reasons it remains a challenging option for most vessel types.

On the positive side, hydrogen’s climate credentials are compelling. In fuel cell applications, it produces only water as an exhaust product. It is also highly versatile, with potential to serve as a direct fuel, a feedstock for synthetic fuels, or a form of energy storage linked to renewable power systems.

But the physical realities of hydrogen are hard to ignore. Its low volumetric energy density means far larger storage volumes are required compared with conventional marine fuels. In liquid form, hydrogen must be stored at around –253°C, introducing complexity and energy penalties. These factors translate directly into lost cargo space, higher costs and more complicated vessel designs.

Safety is another critical consideration. Hydrogen has a wide flammability range, low-ignition energy and can cause embrittlement in certain materials. Managing these risks requires rigorous engineering standards, specialised systems and enhanced crew training.

LR’s own rules for ships using low-flashpoint fuels, including its hydrogen requirements set out in Appendix LR3, provide a framework for addressing these issues. The guidance covers fuel cells, composite cylinders, liquid hydrogen systems and bunkering arrangements, reflecting the depth of technical change required to support hydrogen at sea.

The missing pieces: Infrastructure and supply

Perhaps the biggest barrier to hydrogen’s wider adoption is not onboard technology, but what happens onshore. Despite growing interest and a wave of national hydrogen strategies, low-emissions hydrogen still accounts for less than 1 per cent of global production, according to the International Energy Agency.

Significant investment is needed across the entire value chain – from production, transport, storage and bunkering. For shipping, the challenge is compounded by the need for reliable, standardised refuelling infrastructure in ports around the world.

Competition for green hydrogen will also be intense. Heavy industry, chemicals, fertilisers, power generation and long-haul transport are all targeting the same limited supply. This makes robust certification schemes and transparent lifecycle assessments essential to ensure that maritime decarbonisation efforts deliver genuine climate benefits.

Under FuelEU Maritime, renewable fuels of non-biological origin (including green hydrogen) benefit from a two-times multiplier until 2033, potentially accelerating early uptake as production scales. But for now, cost remains a major hurdle.

Reflecting this reality, hydrogen-capable vessels still represent less than 0.5 per cent of the global orderbook, despite growing regulatory and industry interest.

Where hydrogen makes sense

While the report is cautious about hydrogen’s near-term role in deep-sea shipping, it identifies clear opportunities in shorter routes and specialist applications. Ferries, tugs and coastal vessels, where regular bunkering cycles reduce storage constraints, are seen as the most viable early adopters.

Fuel cell technologies particularly show promise in these segments, supported by improving cost trajectories and advances in durability. Hybrid configurations and ‘hydrogen-ready’ designs also offer shipowners a way to future-proof assets without committing fully to a single fuel pathway.

Padmini Mellacheruvu, Lead Technical Specialist in Cryogenic and Compressed Fuel Systems at LR, shared that hydrogen has an important role to play, but warned the pathway to scale will be complex.

“Progress will depend on early investment, careful planning and a clear focus on safety,” she said.

“Our latest Fuel for Thought report brings clarity to both the potential of hydrogen and the substantial work still required to enable its safe, scalable and commercially viable use.”

Wider energy transition

The hydrogen report, as part of LR’s wider Fuel for Thought series, aims to provide practical, evidence-based insights into the rapidly evolving alternative fuels landscape. The overarching message is that the shipping transition will not be defined by a single winner, but by a portfolio of solutions tailored to different routes, vessel types and regional conditions.

Dr Maximilian Kuhn, Advisor to Hydrogen Europe and ISO TC 197 liaison to the International Maritime Organization, said hydrogen should be seen as a driver of systemic change rather than a standalone answer.

“Its versatility, scalability and compatibility with renewable energy sources put it in a unique position to address the complex challenges of maritime decarbonisation,” he said.

“Yet the path forward is not without obstacles: infrastructure, regulation, safety and cost remain critical hurdles.”

For Australia, with its vast renewable resources and ambitions to become a clean energy and hydrogen export powerhouse, these developments will be closely watched. While the initial focus has been on land-based industry and exports, the maritime sector will ultimately be both a customer and an enabler of a global hydrogen economy.",https://www.ecogeneration.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1536x1536-fuelforthought_hydrogen_resized-e1768352758503.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 23:12:12.601668

“It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge.
“The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice.
Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.
Frequent and effective engine monitoring and data capture also helps crews optimise reduce fuel consumption, emissions and costs.”","Shipowners and managers are being reminded to review onboard fuel-measurement and data-capture practices following the entry into force of amendments to MARPOL Annex VI.

All ships of 5,000gt and above engaged on international voyages must now begin collecting more detailed operational data under the IMO Data Collection System. This includes information on how much fuel is used by different onboard systems, alongside information on distances sailed and time underway to allow fuel consumption to be assessed against the work the ship performs.

While the official entry into force date was August 1, 2025, data collection is based on a full calendar year.

“Although information using the enhanced dataset does not have to be submitted until early 2027, the obligation to generate compliant data starts now,” said Uwe Krüger, Joint Managing Director of Germany’s CM Technologies (CMT). “Separating data collection from reporting is essential, as information that is not captured onboard during 2026 cannot be produced later.”

The amendment, adopted at MEPC 81 in March 2024, does not change the established IMO DCS reporting cycle. Fuel-oil consumption data for a given calendar year must still be verified by the Flag State or a recognised organisation, typically a classification society, with a Statement of Compliance issued by 31 May of the following year. What has changed is the scope, structure and traceability of the data that must now exist to support that process.

“Ships are now required to collect more granular information than under the original 2016 framework, moving beyond aggregated fuel figures towards continuous measurement that can demonstrate how fuel is consumed across different onboard systems and operating conditions. For many fleets, this represents a practical shift from estimation and reconciliation towards direct measurement,” said Krüger.

According to CMT, a common source of uncertainty is the assumption that the expanded DCS can be addressed primarily through revised reporting procedures, rather than through changes to how operational data is generated onboard. “It is important for shipowners to understand that expanded IMO DCS separates when data is collected from when it is reported,” said Fuhlbrügge. “The first reports will be submitted in 2027, but the quality of those submissions depends entirely on what is measured and logged onboard throughout 2026, and the quality of that data.”

He added that ensuring the right tools are in place early reduces both compliance risk and verification effort later. “If fuel consumption by consumer and operating data are being generated continuously, owners place themselves in a much stronger position when the data is audited and reviewed.

“The expanded DCS places greater emphasis on how data is generated, making onboard monitoring capability a compliance issue rather than an optimisation choice. Continuous measurement of fuel consumption by consumer, supported by engine performance data, gives owners a far stronger audit trail,” he said.

“Effective monitoring reduces reliance on estimation and reconciliation and puts operators in a much better position when the data is verified, since incomplete or inconsistent datasets can result in a SoC being withheld. There could also be greater interest during port State control inspections, and increased scrutiny from charterers.”

Krüger furthered that many operators still associate DCS with end-of-year paperwork, “but it is now very much an operational issue. It depends on what happens in the engine room and on the bridge every day, not on how figures are assembled twelve months later.”

CMT says its engine-performance and fuel-monitoring systems are designed to align with how the expanded IMO DCS dataset must be generated in practice. By capturing fuel consumption at the level of individual engines and other consumers, and linking that data to operating conditions, such systems provide a structured, auditable foundation that supports expanded DCS requirements alongside existing regulatory schemes.

“The objective is not simply to report more data, but to create reliable data in the first place,” Krüger said. “Operators that focus on measurement and data integrity will find their 2027 submission processes far more straightforward. Frequent and effective engine monitoring and data capture also helps crews optimise reduce fuel consumption, emissions and costs.”",,N,,2026-01-13 17:56:58.369496

In 2023, methanol overtook LNG as the alternative fuel of choice for newbuilds, but LNG retook the crown in 2024.
Still, in select segments the momentum toward use of alternative fuels remains.
Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonisation Director at DNV said: “The resilience of the alternative fuels orderbook in 2025 is mainly driven by cargo owners who have set their own emissions reduction goals despite market slow-down and regulatory uncertainty.","Alternative-fuelled ships maintained a 38% share of gross tonnage ordered in 2025, according to DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight (AFI) platform, as orders by number of ships dropped by 47% from 2024’s level to 275 ships.

The fall in orders for ships using alternative fuels mirrored an overall decrease in orderbook activity year-on-year in 2025 after a bumper year for ship ordering in 2024. DNV characterised last year as one shaped by regulatory uncertainty and market recalibration, with alternative fuels holding market share primarily thanks to containership orders with some help from passenger ships and car carriers.

Clarksons released its Green Technology Tracker’s overview of 2025’s orderbook last week.

While newbuild orders overall fell from 4,405 in 2024 to 2,403 last year, contracting in the container segment rose from 447 ships in 2024 to 547 in 2025. The sector accounted for 49% of orders by gross tonnage, and 68% of alternative-fuelled ship orders, said DNV. LNG was the fuel of choice for container lines, with 58% of the orderbook, followed by 36% conventional fuels and 6% methanol. In 2023, methanol overtook LNG as the alternative fuel of choice for newbuilds, but LNG retook the crown in 2024.

The broader orderbook reflected a similar dominance for LNG, accounting for 31% of orders by GT and 188 ships by number, while orders for 61 methanol-fuelled ships was down from 149 in 2024.

Declines were seen for bulk carriers, crude tankers and oil/chemical tankers, while LPG and Ethane tanker orders fell by 73% from 2024 to 2025. DNV attributed the slowdown to “a continued focus on cost efficiency and fewer immediate incentives for owners to commit to alternative fuels”

There were a total of 24 ships delivered with wind-assisted propulsion systems in 2025, totalling 63 sails, an increase on 22 deliveries with 49 sails installed in 2024.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO maritime at DNV said: “While indicative of a turbulent year where strategic choices were harder to make, the slowdown in 2025 also reflects a natural reduction after several years of extraordinary ordering activity. Still, in select segments the momentum toward use of alternative fuels remains. Looking ahead, progress will depend on effective and global regulations that incentivize alternative fuel uptake, create a level playing field, and foster fair competition and implementation.”

The turbulence Ørbeck-Nilssen mentions no doubt includes the one-year delay to the IMO’s flagship greenhouse gas emissions regulations, the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

Jason Stefanatos, global decarbonisation Director at DNV said: “The resilience of the alternative fuels orderbook in 2025 is mainly driven by cargo owners who have set their own emissions reduction goals despite market slow-down and regulatory uncertainty. We see them prioritising investments where there is a strong alignment between fuel infrastructure, regulatory certainty, and commercial viability, particularly in container shipping, where LNG and methanol are supported by established supply chains and customer demand.”

Addressing the infrastructure challenges around alternative fuel bunkering and distribution, 22 LNG bunker vessels were added to the orderbook in 2025 alongside new bunkering vessels capable of supplying methanol and biofuel.

“These developments signal growing confidence in LNG supply chains and emerging multi-fuel capabilities, reducing operational risk and supporting the economics of alternative fuel adoption,” said DNV.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltf4f9c241129fa6ac/68357a070421c342027c3dbc/MOL_LNG_dual-fuel_VLCC.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-13 17:57:03.196629

The vessel was handed over at HD Hyundai Heavy Industries’ shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, where it was built.

With this delivery, Maersk now has around 19 methanol-capable ships in operation, meeting a deployment target the company had originally set for the end of last year.

Barcelona Mærsk is part of Maersk’s Equinox Mk-II class, which follows the earlier Ane Mærsk class with a capacity of 16,592 TEU.

The Equinox Mk-II vessels have a wider beam and an improved design, and they are currently the largest methanol-powered ships in Maersk’s fleet.

The ship was christened during a ceremony at the Ulsan yard. Maersk has said the vessel was named by Berit Vincentz Andersen, a senior communications advisor from its Fleet Management and Technology team, in the presence of the crew, Maersk staff and representatives from the shipbuilder.

Barcelona Mærsk, designed to run on both conventional marine fuels and methanol, is powered by an eight-cylinder MAN B&W G95ME-C10.5-LGIM dual-fuel engine built by Hyundai-MAN.

The vessel is fitted with two methanol fuel tanks located forward of the engine room, with a combined capacity of about 16,000 cubic metres.

When fully bunkered with methanol, the ship can sail up to 23,000 nautical miles. This range allows it to complete full round voyages on major routes such as the Asia–Europe AE3 service using alternative fuel.

Maersk has indicated that using green methanol can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90 per cent compared with traditional fossil fuels, with possible daily savings of around 280 tonnes of carbon dioxide.

It aims to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 and has identified methanol as a key fuel in this transition.

The company defines reduced-emission fuels as those that deliver at least a 65 per cent reduction in lifecycle emissions compared with standard fossil fuels, measured at 94g CO₂e per megajoule.

Alongside methanol, Maersk has also added LNG-fuelled newbuildings to its plans to ensure flexibility as supplies of green fuels continue to develop.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has enacted a raft of amendments to key treaties, placing seafarer welfare and environmental safety at the forefront of the new year.

Headlining the 2026 changes are mandatory training requirements to combat workplace harassment and stricter protocols for reporting lost freight containers — measures designed to address both the human element and navigational hazards of modern shipping.

Combating harassment at sea

In a major update to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) Code, the IMO has institutionalized the fight against toxicity on board. New mandatory minimum requirements for basic training now include specific competencies in preventing and responding to bullying, harassment, and sexual assault. This amendment aims to dismantle the culture of silence regarding abuse at sea, equipping seafarers with the knowledge to identify, prevent, and respond to such incidents.

Mandatory reporting

of lost containers

Responding to the increasing scale of container spills, amendments to both Marpol and Solas now mandate the immediate reporting of lost freight containers. Masters of ships involved in such incidents must now report specific particulars — including position and the number of units lost — to nearby ships, the nearest coastal state, and the flag state. This move is expected to drastically improve navigational safety and the speed of environmental response.

Fire safety and

dangerous goods

The regulations also introduce critical fire safety upgrades like the Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) ban, a strict prohibition on the use or storage of fire-extinguishing media containing PFOS is now in effect for new ships, with a phased compliance for existing vessels.

New Solas requirements mandate advanced fire detection and video monitoring systems for vehicle, special category, and roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) spaces, ensuring continuous surveillance to detect fires before they escalate.

Other significant amendments enforced as of Jan. 1 include:

– Lifting Appliances: A new Solas regulation (II-1/3-13) standardizes the design, maintenance, and inspection of onboard lifting appliances and anchor handling winches to reduce mechanical failures.

– Fishing Vessel Standards: The STCW-F Convention has been overhauled to professionalize the fishing sector, introducing harmonized qualification standards and a new mandatory code for fishing vessel personnel.

– Polar Code Expansion: Safety regulations for polar waters have been extended to cover smaller cargo ships, fishing vessels, and yachts, reflecting increased traffic in high-latitude regions.

– Stability Monitoring: New containerships and bulk carriers (3,000 GT and above) must now be fitted with electronic inclinometers to accurately record roll motion.

These regulations represent the IMO’s continued push toward a safer, cleaner, and more socially responsible maritime sector. Shipowners and operators are advised to ensure immediate compliance with the new standards to avoid detention or penalties.",https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2026/01/13/897432.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:57:21.142071

The Grande Manila, a unit designed to transport cars, trucks and rolling stock, was delivered and christened yesterday in Shanghai. Commissioned from the Shanghai Waigaoqiao shipbuilding company and China shipbuilding trading company (both part of China State shipbuilding corporation), this is the seventh ammonia-ready vessel for the Neapolitan shipping company, i.e. ready to use ammonia as an alternative fuel, with zero carbon emissions.

With a length of 200 metres, a width of 38 metres, and a gross tonnage of approximately 77,500 tonnes, the Grande Manila is designed to transport vehicles (cars, SUVs, vans, and so on), both electric and traditional fuel-powered, as well as any other type of rolling cargo. In particular, it can load up to 9,241 ceu (car equivalent units), with four decks also suitable for transporting other rolling cargo, including heavy loads of up to 250 tonnes and a maximum height of 6.5 metres.

The ship, explain Grimaldi's top management, ""pays tribute not only to the capital of the Philippines, but to the country's entire maritime community, for the extraordinary contribution it makes to the global shipping industry. The ship's name also reflects the growing importance of the Asian nation within the group's commercial network: after the recent launch of a new service connecting China to the port of Batangas, with two departures per month, Grimaldi aims to expand its presence also in other Philippine ports, such as Manila"".

The group has been manning Grimaldi marine partners for ten years in a joint venture structured in the Philippines, which allows the employment of thousands of Filipino seafarers on the group's ships.

""With the arrival of the Grande Manila,"" says Emanuele Grimaldi, the group's CEO, ""we celebrate, on the one hand, a new, important milestone in the expansion and modernisation of our fleet and, on the other, our increasingly strong link with the Philippines, a country with a great seafaring tradition. Filipino seafarers represent a fundamental resource for our fleet: professionalism, dedication and reliability are values that contribute every day to the safety and efficiency of our operations. For our part, also through our partnership with the Ho family and Magsaysay group, we reaffirm our commitment to the growth and well-being of this extraordinary human capital.

For ballast water and associated grey and blackwater streams, the focus is on how systems behave in real conditions rather than on paper type-approval.
Vessels should include procedures for managing such conditions in their approved ballast water management plans, tailored to the system’s limitations and the vessel’s trading pattern.
The United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency, in its MIN 706 notice, reminded industry, “The guidelines were adopted by the Marine Environment Protection Committee at its 80th session and replace the 2011 Biofouling Guidelines”, referring to the 2023 IMO Biofouling Guidelines in resolution MEPC.378(80).
These guidelines set out expectations for biofouling management plans and record books, as well as inspection and cleaning regimes, but remain formally non-mandatory at global level.","Environmental protection around ships is moving into a new phase in which ballast water, hull condition, underwater-radiated noise, plastics, oily residues and wastewater are treated as a linked compliance burden rather than separate technical issues.

Recent IMO decisions and regional rules already adopted will frame the work of shipowners and operators through 2026 and beyond.

For ballast water and associated grey and blackwater streams, the focus is on how systems behave in real conditions rather than on paper type-approval.

""Mandatory hull fouling control requirements for all vessels over 24 m""

At its 81st session in March 2024, the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) adopted Resolution MEPC.387(81) with interim guidance for ships operating in challenging water quality and Circular BWM.2/Circ.82 with guidance on the temporary storage of treated sewage and grey water in ballast water tanks.

As DNV noted, the purpose of this guidance is to assist ships to comply with the BWM Convention and the D-2 discharge standard when a type-approved ballast water management system (BWMS) encounters operational limitations or has difficulty meeting operational demand in challenging water quality conditions.

Vessels should include procedures for managing such conditions in their approved ballast water management plans, tailored to the system’s limitations and the vessel’s trading pattern.

For owners, this means ballast water planning is moving beyond installation projects into ship-specific operational doctrines that also touch sewage and greywater handling, particularly where treated effluents are routed through ballast tanks under defined conditions.

As more administrations and recognised organisations incorporate this guidance into their survey and plan-approval routines during 2026, operators can expect closer scrutiny of how crews document, decide and record contingency actions when BWMS performance is constrained by local water quality.

Biofouling and coatings are on a similar journey from voluntary guidance toward hard-edged regional rules.

The United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency, in its MIN 706 notice, reminded industry, “The guidelines were adopted by the Marine Environment Protection Committee at its 80th session and replace the 2011 Biofouling Guidelines”, referring to the 2023 IMO Biofouling Guidelines in resolution MEPC.378(80).

These guidelines set out expectations for biofouling management plans and record books, as well as inspection and cleaning regimes, but remain formally non-mandatory at global level.

Brazil is now treating those concepts as a regulatory baseline, and as Inchcape Shipping Services has reported, the Brazilian navy has revised NORMAM-401 to introduce mandatory hull fouling control requirements for all vessels over 24 m operating in Brazilian jurisdictional waters or moving between the country’s three marine biogeographic zones.

West of England P&I summarised the changes and noted all ships must maintain a Biofouling Management Plan and Biofouling Record Book and that vessels trading between Brazilian regions must maintain a fouling rating of 1 or lower, meaning no fouling or only microfouling.

Ships with higher ratings must clean before transit, using inwater methods that capture residues and avoid sensitive areas unless expressly authorised by the environmental authority.

While the permit regime took effect on 17 June 2025, West of England stated, “Full enforcement with penalties is set to take effect on 1 February 2026.”

This Brazilian timeline is likely to be watched by other coastal states concerned about invasive species and hull-derived waste.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/179/Brazil_biofouling_regions_1200w1_Main.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 07:57:52.397450

Mitsui O.S.K. Lines,announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding for a strategic partnership with ITOCHU Corporation to advance decarbonization in the transportation sector through the use of Environmental Attribute Certificates .

Through this MOU, both companies will collaborate in marketing, public relations, sales, and other areas to promote the adoption of EACs, helping companies using transportation services reduce their Scope 3 emissions . By forming a cross-industry partnership between shipping and aviation, this initiative represents a new model for decarbonization in Japan.

As part of this initiative, both companies, in their capacity as users of maritime and air transport, have engaged in mutual trading of EACs to reduce their respective Scope 3 emissions as follows:

[Transaction Summary]

MOL purchased “air transport (air travel and freight)” EACs issued by ITOCHU to reduce GHG emissions associated with its employee air travel (Scope 3 Category 6).

ITOCHU purchased “maritime transport (sea freight)” EACs issued by MOL to reduce GHG emissions associated with its use of maritime transport (Scope 3 Category 4).

This transaction was executed through the platform provided by 123Carbon in the Netherlands. Operating under a robust audit framework, the platform centrally manages the issuance, transfer, storage, and retirement of EACs. It ensures traceability and reliability of transactions while maintaining high transparency in accordance with global standards.

Reducing Scope 3 emissions-which represent a significant share for many companies- is an unavoidable challenge in advancing climate change response. One of key barriers is the difficulty of ensuring traceability, given the complexity of supply chains. MOL will leverage its strengths in marine transport through the use of low-carbon marine fuels, while ITOCHU will draw on its expertise in adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Through this collaborative effort in the shipping and aviation sectors, the two companies will establish a framework to support transportation service users in reducing their Scope 3 emissions. Together, they are committed to advancing decarbonization across the broader transportation supply chain through this partnership.

The MOL Group has identified “Build business models that enable net zero emissions” as one of actions in its “MOL Group Environmental Vision 2.2” In February 2025, the group launched a carbon insetting & book and claim program called the “BLUE ACTION NET-ZERO ALLIANCE” .

CSA is concerned with all technical, scientific and regulatory issues that could have an impact on the use of Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS). It supports and educates the public and policy makers concerning the availability and use of the open loop Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (EGCS), a technology environmentally friendly and effective, and economically feasible.

The Clean Shipping Alliance supported its members in the timely implementation of the regulation 14.1.3 of MARPOL Annex VI that became effective on January 1, 2020 requiring that the sulfur content of any fuel used on board ships shall not exceed 0.50% mm.

Advocacy

The Alliance advocates a rational operating environment for the open loop EGCS (scrubbers) through engagement with policy makers and different stakeholders in the maritime industry. Besides that, CSA advocates for its companies members working to reduce the marine exhaust gas emissions.

Vision

Become the main source of information regarding the Exhaust Gas Cleaning System, being perceived by the various stakeholders in the maritime industry as the authority on the matter with the ability of reversing negative decisions through the advocacy work based on scientific data and the most recent studies.

Key Objectives

Provide technical information and scientific research data to the maritime different stakeholders such as policy makers, public policy officials, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), non- governmental organizations (NGOs), European Institutions and the public on the effectiveness and benefits of the open-loop EGCS along with the associated air and water emissions. Work directly with the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) to ensure the consideration of the most up-to-date technical and economic data in the development of the regulations.

Work directly with regulators to monitor and influence current and future legislation on EGCS.

Promote discussions with the ports and authorities that have a negative position towards the open loop EGCS, provide credible data and scientific analysis of the technology to ensure the decisions will be taken on technical basis instead of a precautionary measure without any grounds.

Rationale

CSA Members have been leaders in emission control efforts and have made significant investments of time, funding, and resources to comply in good faith with the IMO 2020 fuel requirements through the utilization of the environmentally safe and effective Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems, both open and closed loop.

Now, after one year of the MARPOL Annex VI entering into force, some elements of the industry representatives and regulators have voiced opposition to the use of this technology alleging environmental reasons but without any scientific data to support their arguments.

In light of the abovementioned developments with regard to the general acceptance of EGCS, in some regions authorities have already put in place restrictions as a precautionary measure. Therefore, any current or future ban, local or otherwise, will not only unfairly impact many shipping companies but will also undermine IMO as the regulator for global shipping.

It is therefore the role of the Clean Shipping Alliance to engage with these authorities and others worldwide to ensure these authorities have the latest science and most credible studies for their decision-making, and have accepted CSA and its Staff and Members, as an objective resource.Membership Benefits

The strategy, adopted in 2023, aims to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 20% compared to the 2008 level.
Decarbonizing the shipping industry will require building next-generation vessels that can run on low-carbon fuels or operate energy-saving technologies.
Ships built there, whether China- or foreign-flagged, are responsible for nearly 30% of global shipping emissions, according to the ICCT.
With the regulatory certainty provided by the Net-zero Framework, China could calmly steer the industry along the decarbonization route.","[By Mao Xiaoli]

Later this year, member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will resume negotiations on whether to adopt an agreed plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.

China had originally supported the approval of the plan, known as the Net-zero Framework, at an IMO meeting in April 2025. However, about six months later, at talks on whether to sign off the framework formally, the country sided with the majority of member states to postpone the decision for a year.

A few other member states, including India and Argentina, made the same change of position. The situation reflects how divided states are on the IMO’s measures to control these emissions.

Still, when the negotiations resume in October 2026, the adoption of the framework would be in China’s interest. As the world’s largest ship exporter and builder, the country has already laid the groundwork for greening its shipping sector. The framework would provide its industry with the stability it needs to continue the inevitable transition.

Talks on implementation rules press on

Many thought the rules agreed in the framework to restrict ships’ emissions were not ambitious enough to meet the goals of the IMO’s climate strategy. In the meantime, however, this delay has made it even harder for the sector to meet those goals.

The strategy, adopted in 2023, aims to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by at least 20% compared to the 2008 level. It also aims to replace at least 5% of fuels with alternatives that emit zero or near-zero greenhouse gases by 2030.

Without the regulatory certainty that an approved Net-zero Framework would offer, industry remains hesitant to invest in fuels that have very low to no emissions. They are currently three to four times more expensive than conventional fossil fuels.

The devil is in the details

Despite the delay, discussions over the framework’s implementation guidelines, which govern how it would operate, continue. Many are hopeful that outstanding issues could be addressed through these discussions.

However, the rules are not easy to develop.

Take, for example, guidelines on how to assess the greenhouse gas intensity of marine fuels throughout their lifecycles. The guidelines essentially determine which fuel can be used to comply with the targets. As they currently stand, they would encourage ships to initially rely on biofuels, specifically renewable diesel made from used cooking oil. That is according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), which has also determined that demand will outstrip supply of such fuel after 2032.

That shortage would eventually push the sector toward biofuels made from fresh vegetable oils. A rising demand for virgin oil could displace food production and lead to cropland expansion. The result would be the cutting down of forests and thus more emissions, states the study.

The guidelines haven’t yet accounted for these indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions, which occur outside the direct supply chain of the biofuels. Adding safeguards to limit the use of biofuels that incur ILUC emissions would better support the uptake of fuels with no or close-to zero emissions, if the framework is adopted in October.

Building readiness in China

Although China voted to delay adoption, it’s still in the country’s interest to prepare its domestic industry for the inevitable transition.

Internationally, China could directly benefit from becoming a refuelling, or “bunkering”, hub for future sustainable marine fuel. Not currently one of the world’s largest such hubs, it could leapfrog some of the competition by supplying sustainable marine fuel. China is especially well-positioned to supply the likes of methanol and ammonia, which require cheap renewable electricity to synthesize.

But building out fuel production and bunkering infrastructure takes time. And it is hard to justify investment without sufficient demand signal. As such, delaying the IMO framework isn’t helping. Production of fuels and infrastructure need boosting in tandem. Otherwise, new fuel storage tanks and pipelines could end up filled with fossil fuels.

That said, leading ports in China – especially those that have already positioned themselves to become major bunkering ports – are already acting. In 2025, Shanghai’s port completed the nation’s first ship-to-ship methanol bunkering. And the port of Tianjin completed the first methanol bunkering for a car-carrier ship; while that ship was on its maiden voyage to Hong Kong, the government announced it will provide tax incentives for outbound ships using methanol as fuel.

The industry is also taking actions to support this development, with an initial focus on supplying the European market. In February 2025, the China Biomass Energy Industry Promotion Association released voluntary standards for “renewable methanol”. The standards use the term as an umbrella to differentiate gas made using biomass and electricity from gas made using fossil energy.

The standard classifies renewable methanol into three grades, based on the intensity of its greenhouse gas emissions from production to use. Grade A aligns with the European Union’s standard, which is designed to increase the bloc’s renewable energy use. The move has paved the way for renewable methanol produced in China to sell on the European market.

Potential support from net-zero fund

Payments made under the framework will be used to create a net-zero fund that rewards low-emission ships and helps developing nations to transition. China, among other nations, could qualify for such support.

The country has historically focused on building ships at low prices and in great number. Decarbonizing the shipping industry will require building next-generation vessels that can run on low-carbon fuels or operate energy-saving technologies.

The ICCT has estimated that if Chinese shipyards were only to build zero-emission-capable vessels up to 2050, it would cost them an additional USD 125-444 billion, depending on fuel and propulsion type. The net-zero fund, which collects payments under the penalty-and-reward mechanism, could generate around USD 11-12 billion annually by 2030. That could potentially help to fund China’s incremental expenditure.

A successful shipbuilding transition in China would be significant for global shipping’s decarbonization. Ships built there, whether China- or foreign-flagged, are responsible for nearly 30% of global shipping emissions, according to the ICCT.

The Chinese government has already introduced measures to encourage the switch. In 2024, it rolled out subsidies to incentivize shipowners to replace old vessels with ones powered by cleaner energy. This policy could boost the development of zero-emission-capable vessels and the adoption of energy-saving tech.

Keep calm and sail on

The Global Maritime Forum, a non-profit industry platform, held its annual summit in October – soon after the IMO meeting that resulted in the delay of the framework’s adoption.

Participants left feeling “hopeful and energized”, and highlighted the important role of the European Union and China. With Shanghai hosting the next summit in 2026, we can anticipate further significant actions from the China side.

In the end, a legally binding framework at the IMO level would ensure a level playing field for the industry’s transition. It would suit China more than unilateral efforts or a “patchwork” of regional shipping regulations.

With the regulatory certainty provided by the Net-zero Framework, China could calmly steer the industry along the decarbonization route. While doing so, it could benefit from becoming a sustainable marine fuel bunkering hub and upgrading its domestic shipbuilding industry.
