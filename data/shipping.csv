The world’s largest maritime nations had been deliberating on regulations to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels. But U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and other countries vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, Trump urged countries to vote “No” on the regulations. The International Maritime Organization adjourned its meeting Friday.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

The world’s largest maritime nations were deliberating Friday on regulations that would move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions as U.S. President Donald Trump and others vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, United States President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social asking countries to vote “No” and that “The United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Representatives from the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia and a host of other nations are against the regulations passing through in its current form. The meetings on Friday witnessed a tense start as they continued their discussions from earlier in the week about meeting procedures.

“I put myself out there to try and find a way for you to cooperate and move forward in the normal way that we would,” said Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the International Maritime Organization. During his statement, Dominguez added that the way negotiations have happened this week should not be repeated again.

The top shipping nations from across the world are meeting at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London. If the green shipping regulations are adopted, this will be the first time a global fee is imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances. In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework, with the aim of adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” at this London meeting.

“The attempts from the U.S. and others to delay the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework are an affront to multilateralism and fly in the face of the the courage and ambition shown by member states when it was agreed in April. Thankfully this is not a foregone conclusion and countries can continue to demonstrate the spirit of solidarity that they showed in April when voting to adopt the framework,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The regulations set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

Observers said it is still unclear what will be decided later today.

“By voting for adoption of the framework, governments will make history with the first global carbon price, and set course for reducing shipping’s global impact on the climate,” said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the IMO. “But failing to support the framework will be a missed opportunity, and risks stagnating action at the IMO for years to come.”",https://www.abccolumbia.com/content/uploads/2025/10/x/j/ap25286586888279-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:56:11.108675

Washington and Riyadh, the world’s two largest oil producers, have strongly opposed a carbon price on shipping during numerous rounds of IMO talks.
After tense negotiations this week, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion on Friday to defer discussions for one year, which was passed by a simple majority of 57 countries to 49.

“From an economic standpoint, introducing carbon pricing is essential to level the playing field with sustainable fuels, which are currently not economically viable.","Observers have attributed the vote at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which went in favour of a one-year delay late on Friday (17 October), to pressure from the US and Saudi Arabia.

The IMO’s net-zero proposal, agreed in principle by a majority of member states in April, requires ships with a volume exceeding 5,000 gross tonnes to progressively reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity — measured as emissions per unit of fuel — by 30% by 2035 and 65% by 2040, compared to 2008 levels.

Vessels that fail to meet the stricter benchmark would face a $100-per-tonne fee from 2028, while those that fall short of a less demanding target would be charged up to $380 per tonne.

The proposal further sought to establish a carbon credit market, allowing the owners or operators of more efficient vessels to sell credits to those with higher emissions.

Washington and Riyadh, the world’s two largest oil producers, have strongly opposed a carbon price on shipping during numerous rounds of IMO talks.

After tense negotiations this week, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion on Friday to defer discussions for one year, which was passed by a simple majority of 57 countries to 49. A further 70 nations, including Japan and Greece, abstained from voting.

The Saudi motion was backed by nations including the US, the UAE and China. US President Donald Trump called the levy “a green new tax scam”.

Trump’s administration has previously stated that it would retaliate if any global carbon levy is applied to its ships.

“While the delay provides additional time to build consensus—also within different shipping segments—momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult,” said ING’s senior economist for transport and logistics, Rico Luman.

“Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation, which would be a disappointing outcome.

“From an economic standpoint, introducing carbon pricing is essential to level the playing field with sustainable fuels, which are currently not economically viable. Regardless of the timing, a pricing mechanism will eventually be necessary to drive progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, also as it helps fund green investments.”",https://edienetlive.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/APMMShip.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:56:20.803290

The NZF is still alive, but it could just be a case of flogging a dead horse.","Delaying the adoption of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework has kept it alive, but the question is what will have changed in a year’s time when it comes up for another vote.

During a media briefing following the decision by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) member states to delay the adoption of the Net Zero Framework (NZF) Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez was asked whether it was still alive? To which he replied, “It’s very much still alive”.

Certainly, the delaying a vote on whether or not to adopt NZF by another 12 months saved it from the increasingly likely possibility of being voted against at the end of the fractious four-day extraordinary meeting of the MEPC. However, what there is stop the same scenario being played out in a years’ time, just with even more entrenched opinions, is far from clear.

The NZF amendment to MARPOL was approved at the first extraordinary meeting of the MEPC will remain the same and voting on it has simply been adjourned for a year.

On the positive side as the Secretary General pointed out during the briefing the “silver lining” was, “The framework is still there, and the member states are still talking to each other.”

Asked if the delegations would not simply come back in a years’ time still divided Dominguez said, “I’m working on the objective that yes, there is a division, it was clear on the vote today that the there is more work that needs to be done. I think the negotiations between now and the next meeting will actually help address all that in order to start finding those common areas for us to make progress.”

Intersessional workgroup meetings start next week to work on the guidance to the framework that needs to be developed.

Some organisations representing the shipping industry do see the coming 12 months as a window in which the UN body can work through the difficulties the framework faces and find agreement.

The World Shipping Council (WSC), which represents global liner shipping said the IMO should use additional year to close remaining gaps and ensure an effective global agreement.

There was a similar message from independent tanker owner represented by Intertanko with Managing Director Tim Wilkins saying, “This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF raised by Intertanko members.”

Interntanko said that it would be present at the intersessional workgroup meetings in the coming week to voice the opinions of its members.

However, representative body also noted it was “unclear what the path forward is since the positions are more polarised”.

There has been considerable talk about the pressure applied by the US on smaller member states to not support the NZF which has been described as “bullying”, “unprecedented”, and “undiplomatic”. With US President Donald Trump expressing his “outrage” over the idea of the framework and global carbon tax on shipping this week, there can be little doubt this pressure will continue over the next 12 months, and quite possibly be ramped up.

It is point made from Rico Luman, Senior Economist, Transport & Logistics, at ING, “The delay in the final vote to adopt the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) reduces the likelihood of passing the previously agreed proposal. It is likely to strengthen opposition, including from the United States, which may view the postponement as a win.”

Indeed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, took social media platform X to hail it as a “HUGE win” for President Trump. “Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects.”

ING’s Luman believes that time is running out for the NZF. “While the delay provides additional time to build consensus—also within different shipping segments—momentum appears to be fading, making agreement increasingly difficult. Continued procrastination could ultimately lead to cancellation, which would be a disappointing outcome,” he said.

Earlier this year, amid much fanfare, the world's largest maritime nations agreed on the regulations, which would impose a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping. The next step of the process -- adopting the regulations -- during the International Maritime Organization meeting in London this week was widely expected to be a formality.

Instead, after much pressure from Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year and adjourn. In the interim, nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus.

The development underscored how the influence of Trump, who recently called climate change a ""con job,"" extends globally to policies aimed at combating climate change.

""Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis,"" said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

Trump administration quick to celebrate

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the development as ""another huge win"" for Trump.

""Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive U.N. tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects,"" Rubio wrote on X. ""Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.""

Trump had urged countries to vote ""No,"" posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that ""the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping."" The U.S. had threatened to retaliate with tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies if nations supported it.

After vowing to fight any global tax on shipping emissions, Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half the countries agreed.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping, said in a post-meeting news conference that ""geopolitics in the world right now makes it more difficult for us to make progress in certain topics.""

Nations falter in efforts to save the planet

The decision, or lack thereof, in London is similar to what happened this summer with a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world. The negotiations fell apart, with the United States and Saudi Arabia opposing any limit on plastic production.

The world's biggest climate summit, COP30, is in November in Belem, Brazil. Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to Belem and beyond is now more difficult.

""The IMO's failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,"" Regenvanu said. ""But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet.""

Shipping emissions grow

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it's burned. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80 percent of the world's merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Thomas Kazakos, the chamber's secretary-general, said they are disappointed because the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3 percent of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

The regulations, or ""Net-Zero Framework,"" would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

""The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,"" said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

The IMO set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

""What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,"" said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk.

While countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia have been opposed to the framework, the United States administration since then continues to issue explicit threats against countries that had supported the framework.

Ahead of the vote on October 17, in London, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.

Ultimately, Singapore brought in a proposal to delay a decision on the matter for a year and Saudi Arabia proposed a vote.

“We regret that IMO members followed Singapore’s initial proposal to delay the adoption of the framework by 12 months, which Saudi Arabia called to a vote.

But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet,” he added.

A Russian delegate described the proceedings as ""chaos"" as he addressed the plenary Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.

Russia had joined major oil producers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in voting against the carbon-reduction measure in April, saying it would harm the economy and food security.

Major oil-producer Saudi Arabia also called for Friday's vote to be postponed.

""We agree with the United States that it's important that these conversations are brought to light,"" a Saudi representative said.

Ahead of this week's London gathering, a majority 63 IMO members that in April voted for the plan had been expected to maintain their support and to be joined by others to formally approve the NZF.

Argentina, which in April abstained from the vote, now opposes the deal.

Leading up to Friday's decision, China, the EU, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO reaffirmed their support.

The NZF requires ships to progressively reduce carbon emissions from 2028 or face financial penalties.

Shipping accounts for nearly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IMO.

The plan would charge ships for emissions exceeding a certain threshold, with proceeds used to reward low-emission vessels and support countries vulnerable to climate change.

If the global emissions pricing system were adopted, it would become difficult to evade, even for the United States.

Deal blocked

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) got the IMO Net-Zero Framework approved in April after 10 years of negotiations. The goal was to reduce fossil fuel usage in the shipping industry and limit emissions. Shipping represents 3% of all global emissions.

President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and several other countries sought to end the deal over costs.

During a meeting on Friday, Saudi Arabia called a vote to adjourn the meeting for one year. More than half the countries agreed, including several that had originally been in favor of the deal.

That included island nations like the Bahamas and Antigua. They told the BBC they rely on the U.S. for trade and received pressure from the Trump administration to change their vote.

Trump threatened tariffs, the withdrawal of visa rights and more against countries that voted in favor of the deal. The president made his feelings about it clear on social media Thursday.

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form,” Trump wrote. “We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams.”

Reaction to the vote

Those in support of the deal seemed determined to get it back on track, even if it takes a year.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident ‘yes’ vote that cannot be silenced,” Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk, said. “The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

One supporter also seemed hopeful about keeping the deal alive, even as she blamed the U.S.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty,” Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization, said. “But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying.”

Back stateside, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio celebrated the decision.

“This is another HUGE win for @POTUS,” Rubio wrote on X. “Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects. Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

IMO Net-Zero Framework

The goal of the measure was to get the shipping industry to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 2050. The way they planned on getting there was to set a marine fuel standard that would get stricter over time.

The deal would also set fees for emissions above the allowed limits. In essence, it would be a tax on countries that break the rules.

It would have made shipping the first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

According to recent data, Greece, which also voted against the deal, is the country with the highest emissions from global shipping. It’s followed by Japan and the U.S.

The cost

The Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) led the market for shipping companies in total imports to the U.S. in 2024. That’s followed by Maersk Line and Compagnie Maritime d’Affretement, or CMA.

MSC is a privately held company, so its revenue is unclear, but the other two brought in a combined $99.58 billion last year.

Despite that, Trump and other administration officials were concerned that added costs from a tax would be passed on to American consumers at a time when inflation is already an issue.

The fees associated with the proposal, according to a conglomerate of shipping companies, would have cost them an estimated $20 to $30 billion annually by 2030. They said in a letter to the IMO that the cost would increase to $300 billion by 2050 if global fleets missed the targets by only 10%, according to industry site GCaptain.com.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240708992_CFOTOFuture_Publishing_via_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 12:56:26.186780

A fractious meeting of the International Maritime Organization in London ended Friday with a decision to adjourn for a year, after Saudi Arabia, backed by Russia, pushed for a pause.

That means the effort to set binding international rules to cut greenhouse gases from shipping — responsible for about 3 percent of global emissions — goes into the deep freeze for a year. During that time, the U.S. and other opponents can try to rally more support to kill it completely.

The move followed an extended pressure campaign from the United States marked by threats of tariffs and other economic penalties. It is also a huge setback for the European Union, which failed to push through the measure and even saw some of its member countries abstain.

The White House reacted with joy.

“President Trump saved America from the outrageous climate scam that was killing our country, and he has long warned others to abandon this destructive agenda before it is too late. Stopping this disastrous vote is a massive win for the American people and countries around the world,"" said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

But European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera called the delay “a huge shame,” in a social media post. The EU and Brazil had been publicly backing the move ahead of COP30 global climate talks next month, hosted by Brazil.

The proposal up for approval at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates global shipping, was meant to incentivize countries to shift toward using cleaner fuels in a bid to zero out carbon emissions from shipping by 2050. It would have increased the financial burden on polluting ships over time. Fees collected would go to help fund the shift to greener fuels and support developing countries.

The White House had objected for months, with Trump himself weighing in on Thursday in a post on Truth Social that he was “outraged” by the effort. “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said.

It comes as the United States grows increasingly hostile in its approach to climate measures, with Trump calling climate change a “con job” and urging other countries to drop efforts to invest in renewable energy.

There had been “relentless pressure” from the U.S. for countries to back its position, said Vanuatu Climate Minister Ralph Regenvanu. “There’s bullshit going on,” the Pacific Island nation minister said during a coffee break before the final vote.

Shifting votes

The motion to adjourn on Friday passed by just four votes, after several countries that had previously backed the measure, including EU members Greece and Cyprus, chose to abstain.

""The net zero framework relies on fuels and technologies that aren’t available at scale, and introduces sharp penalties for not using them, which would inflate costs as companies chase limited supplies,"" said a Greek official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Greece hosts some of the world’s leading shipping companies.

Representatives from Cyprus declined to comment on their vote.

The delay dismayed countries backing an effort to cut emissions from a sector that is seeing fast growth.

“They killed [the agreement]. The lack of leadership from the EU makes my blood boil,” said one person with knowledge of the discussions, also granted anonymity to speak candidly.

However, the move garnered support from major fossil fuels producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, which traditionally push back against climate measures aimed at cutting the use of oil, gas and coal. Major shipping countries and several with large flag registries, including Singapore and Liberia, also objected.

Others shifted positions.

China, the world’s biggest ship builder, switched from supporting the measure in April, to voting to delay it on Friday.

The clash highlighted the differences between countries worried about the measure's economic impact against those fearing the consequences of global warming.

A Saudi delegate, who could not be named due to the IMO’s restrictions on reporting, accused backers of the carbon price of sowing global division. ""We have differences because we are all looking out for our citizens, our futures ... and our economies,” he said.

But Emma Fenton, senior diplomacy director at Opportunity Green, an NGO, called the outcome “a devastating indictment of member states’ lack of courage to stand in solidarity with climate-vulnerable countries to achieve a just and equitable maritime transition.""

A European Commission spokesperson called the delay “regrettable” and stressed the EU’s commitment to an “ambitious, science-based global framework” to put international shipping on track for net-zero emissions by 2050.

The spokesperson added that Europe “remains an open and reliable partner” and is ready to resume talks “under IMO leadership when appropriate.”

The International Chamber of Shipping, a global trade association representing more than 80 percent of the world’s merchant fleet, said it was disappointed with the outcome.

“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector,” Thomas A. Kazakos, the chamber’s secretary-general, said in a statement. “As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organization to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry.”

Part of the shipping industry is worried that if the IMO effort fails, the result could be a patchwork of national and regional measures that will be expensive and confusing for the sector.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/17/10473161-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-10-18 13:56:23.622216

Shipping accounts for some 3 per cent of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Advt

The vote came on a motion moved by Saudi Arabia on Friday to adjourn the meeting for a year after four days of disagreements over the proposal.

The MEPC meeting of the IMO, held between October 14-17, to adopt the Net Zero Framework (NZF) for shipping, first agreed in April this year, got off to a shaky start after the United States put member states on notice on October 10, threatening them with a raft of penal actions, if they supported what would be the first global carbon tax.

The United States said it would pursue investigations and potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking of vessels registered in those countries from US ports; impose commercial penalties stemming from US government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favour of the NZF; impose additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and evaluate sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.

Hours ahead of the vote on Friday, US President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform ‘Truth Social’ that he was “outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax”.

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!”, he wrote.

Advt

Trump’s warning had a chilling effect on many member states with 57 voting to delay the adoption of the deal while 49 opposed it and 21 abstained at the end of four days of acrimonious talks.

India voted in favour of adjournment, a government official confirmed. “It was totally a call of the Ministry of External Affairs,” he added.

Hybrid model favoured

At the MEPC meeting in April this year, India voted in favour of a hybrid model for carbon pricing, in a bid to make the shipping industry the first in the world to adopt internationally mandated targets to lower emissions.

These measures were set to be formally adopted in October before entering into force in 2027.

""You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to consensus,"" Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary General, IMO, said in his closing remarks.

The Net Zero Framework would have created the first global carbon pricing mechanism for any industrial sector with the aim of delivering a clear path for shipping’s transition to net zero.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy,” said Thomas Kazakos, Secretary General, International Chamber of Shipping.

As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry, Kazakos said in a statement after the MEPC meeting concluded without a deal.

The NZF regulation and its supporting guidelines can give shipping companies as well as fuel producers and suppliers the confidence and clarity to mobilise investment and scale alternative fuels such as methanol worldwide, the Methanol Institute, a lobby group, said in a statement ahead of the MEPC meeting.

“Methanol producers are ready to deliver. Today, there is already enough methanol available to fuel the ships in operation. More than 250 projects for low-carbon, bio- and e-methanol are under development worldwide, with significant new volumes expected to come online by 2027–2028. The Methanol Institute estimates that between 7 and 14 million tonnes of renewable and low-carbon methanol could be available globally by 2030. This demonstrates that the supply chain is moving quickly to scale and that the fuels to enable the transition will be available when they’re needed,” it argued.

“Adopting the framework would mark the most significant milestone yet in shipping’s decarbonisation journey. It would send a strong signal for investment and support millions of jobs in clean energy sectors. Failing to adopt the NZF will slow progress, create uncertainty around the availability of alternative fuels, and leave the industry with a patchwork of national and regional rules that will be costlier, more burdensome and less effective,” it said, adding that by adopting the Net Zero Framework, the IMO member states “can set the global shipping industry on a fair and effective course to achieve net zero by 2050”.

Urging the member states to take the “courageous step” to adopt the Net-Zero Framework, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Centre for Zero Carbon Shipping said that it “provides certainty for the transition, with clear and pragmatic targets for reducing GHG intensity and real incentives to drive change”.

“Doing nothing comes at a high cost: uncertainty, fragmentation, and missing investment in needed innovation. Adoption will set a standard for global cooperation on climate, balancing the urgency to address emissions with the practical realities of the industry. This is a historic chance for shipping to lead the way toward a sustainable future,” it said ahead of the meeting.

Threat to SMEs

The NZF is based on a fee structure on carbon emissions intended to incentivise green-fuel usage. But as the availability of green fuels on the market in the near term is extremely limited, many operators will likely pay the fee, feeding an IMO-administered fund at an estimated rate of about $10 billion per year (globally). These funds would be used to reward low-emissions ships, pay for green fuel infrastructure and R&D, and to offset the cost effects of the regulation on vulnerable states, notably shipping-dependent island nations.

""As currently drafted, the NZF poses a serious threat to the European shipping, economy, and energy security, and also represents a grave danger to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),"" the CUS argued. ""In essence, it represents a multi-billion-euro tax that does not reduce emissions but instead shifts the cost to end-consumers,"" the Cyprus Union of Shipowners (CUS) said in a statement a day before the vote, joining a growing list opposing the IMO proposal.

The shipowners' association criticised the fee and fund plan, calling it a distraction. ""Rather than reducing emissions, the framework diverts critical financial resources away from genuine technological and energy innovation, thereby slowing the transition to cleaner solutions,"" CUS asserted. ""The result will be broad-based price increases, a higher cost of living and intensified inflation,"" it added.

INTERTANKO, the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, said it will continue its focus on practical pathways in the absence of an agreement at the IMO meeting.

“This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF raised by INTERTANKO members,” INTERTANKO Managing Director Tim Wilkins said in a statement.

“It is unclear what the path forward is since the positions are more polarised. The intersessional workgroup meeting at IMO next week will take place and INTERTANKO will continue to voice the concerns of its members, demanding reassurance that all transitional pathways remain in place for the long-term shift to zero- and near-zero fuels, allowing shipowners and operators to focus on operational feasibility,” INTERTANKO said.

INTERTANKO will play an active role in the strategic discussions at hand on the Net Zero Fund and its methods to collect, govern and distribute resources, including incentivising shipowners and operators to invest in efficiency improvements and alternative fuels.

To achieve the zero-GHG future, the full spectrum of transitional pathways must be available, ranging from energy-saving devices such as wind propulsion, to alternative fuels such as LNG and sustainable biofuel, and net-zero technologies such as shore power and carbon capture.

Wilkins asserted that INTERTANKO will continue with its efforts to provide practical and real-world input into the process.

“There’s some misconception that the industry has been sitting around doing nothing, waiting for this decision,” he said, “when in fact, evidence shows the industry has dramatically cut its emissions over the last 10-15 years, and will continue to do so, as it simply makes good business and ethical sense.”

The session is now set to reconvene in 12 months, extending the timeline for finalization and implementation. The NZF forms a key part of the IMO's 2023 Revised GHG Strategy.

It includes measures such as a global carbon pricing system, where ships would pay fees for exceeding carbon intensity limits; a revenue fund expected to generate up to USD 15 billion annually from 2030 to support transitions to cleaner energy; lifecycle emissions standards for fuels; and updated requirements for energy-efficient operations. Shipping accounts for about 3% of global emissions, and the framework seeks to align the sector with the Paris Agreement.

The postponement reflects ongoing differences among member states. Discussions were influenced by positions from various groups, including a U.S.-led initiative supported by oil-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. This group advocated for procedural adjustments, including a shift from consensus-based to ""explicit"" adoption, which could affect implementation in certain regions. Singapore proposed the delay motion, which Saudi Arabia moved to a vote, resulting in the narrow approval despite earlier indications of support in April 2025.

The U.S. had threatened to retaliate if nations support it. Trump urged countries to vote “No” at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London, posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that “the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

The IMO is the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping.

Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half of the countries agreed.

“Now you have one year, you will continue to work on several aspects of these amendments,” Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the International Maritime Organization, said in his closing remarks. “You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to consensus.”

Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the decision is unacceptable, “given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

If the green shipping regulations were adopted, it would have been the first time a global fee was imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances. In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework, with the aim of adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” at this London meeting.

Adopting the regulations was meant to demonstrate how effective multilateral cooperation can deliver real progress on global climate goals, said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green. Delaying the process risks undermining the framework’s ambitions, they added.

The regulations would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,” said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. “The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

Ahead of today’s vote US President Trump had weighed into the debate, expressing outrage over the planned global carbon pricing mechanism. The US has been pressurising smaller member states with tariffs, port fees and blocking of vessels if they supported framework.

According to social media reports, Saudi Arabia sought a one-year delay by way of vote.

Adjourned for a year

The IMO said 57 countries voted in favour of a delay, 49 against and 21 abstained. Eight member states were not present for the vote. “The extraordinary session of the Committee is adjourned for one year,” it said.

Speaking at media briefing after the close of the MEPC meeting and commenting on the delay in adoption of the NZF, Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO said, “It’s very much alive. The decision taken today was to adjourn the extraordinary session that was convened to adopt the amendments for one year. And as was clarified by the chair that next week the intercessional working group will meet and they have a work plan that was discussed and agreed and will continue to move forward.”

Blow to the IMO?

Asked if it the delay would impact the IMO he said, “I don’t see it as blow to the organisation and I want to make that clear and there is a lot of work that comes out from IMO and I think we have demonstrated that for over 50 years.”

The secretary-general also acknowledged the wider geopolitical pressures that were at play during the meeting. “It wasn’t the normal meeting of IMO. But this is topic that transcends IMO. The geopolitics in the world right now make it as well more challenging to make progress on certain topics but I will maintain that member states have the right to express their opinion, to negotiate among each other. I’m not here to qualify that, I’m here to continue to work with all of them.”

Entry into force would have been March 2027

The original entry into force for the NZF would have been in March 2027 if the framework had been approved at the extraordinary meeting of the MEPC. This timeframe will now be reviewed.

Seatrade Cruise News reached out to Cruise Lines International Association for reaction and will update this story if comment is provided.

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), which has pushed for a carbon fund for a number of years, expressed its disappointment at the delay.

Industry needs clarity

Thomas A. Kazakos, ICS secretary general, said: “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.""

Independent tanker owner representative group Intertanko was more positive, hoping the extra time could result in a better framework. Intertanko Managing Director Tim Wilkins said: “This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF raised by Intertanko members.”

However, he also noted that ""It is unclear what the path forward is since the positions are more polarised.""

Major setback: IAPH

The International Association of Ports and Harbours (IAPH), which supports the NZF, said it was a major setback as the industry needs the legal certainty it would provide to make investments in decarbonisation. IAPH Managing Director Patrick Verhoeven commented: ""Only IMO can provide such a framework. We don’t know what this adjournment will lead to, but we fear it will simply open the door for more national and regional measures, which will add to an already complex regulatory patchwork resulting in unintended consequences.”

The Global Maritime Forum, which represents many of the companies and organisations that have been frontrunners in decarbonisation for shipping, said the delay would make meeting the industry's emission targets more challenging.

“Today's adjournment is a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey. The adjournment for a full year creates serious challenges for meeting the timelines in the Net-Zero Framework agreed in April and will make delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging,"" said Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum.

Environmental groups

Environmental groups were also, not surprisingly, disappointed in the outcome.

Teresa Bui, senior climate campaign director, Pacific Environment, said: “Delaying the vote on the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is frustrating and a betrayal of the world’s most vulnerable nations. We urge IMO member states to adopt the Framework as soon as possible.”

Members of the United Nations International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee gathered in London for a special meeting, MEPC 83, to vote on its Net-Zero Framework (NZF), a new set of global regulations aimed at slashing the shipping industry's greenhouse gas emissions.

A Saudi proposal to adjourn the meeting and delay a final decision on the NZF narrowly passed by a vote of 57-49, with 21 abstentions, Mongabay reported.

The NZF—whose goal is net-zero shipping by 2050—has two main interconnected components, a global fuel standard requiring ships to gradually reduce emissions, and a pricing mechanism meant to encourage the industry to voluntarily slash greenhouse gas output.

""The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty.""

The NZF was approved at the last MEPC meeting in April, then shared with member nations for review, with an eye toward final assent during the current special meeting. However, while the European Union and nations including China and Brazil have been pushing for the NZF, the world's two largest oil producers—the United States and Saudi Arabia—are working to scupper the proposal, which Russia also opposes.

Trump took to his Truth Social network Thursday to pressure MEPC members to vote ""no"" on the NZF:

I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax. The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form. We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!

The one-year postponement drew sharp rebuke from supporters of the NZF.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,"" International Chamber of Shipping secretary general Thomas Kazakos said following Friday's vote. ""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO [greenhouse gas] strategy.""

""As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organization to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry,"" Kazakos added.

John Maggs, who represents the Clean Shipping Coalition at the IMO, said in a statement, “By delaying adoption of its Net-Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown.""

“With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on Earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality,"" he added. ""Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

Elissama Menezes, co-founder and director of the advocacy organization Equal Routes, said: ""Delay costs the climate—and coastal Indigenous peoples and Arctic communities are already paying the price for inaction. This week’s non-outcome should mean that states and the marine sector should double down on related efforts to reduce the impacts from the triple planetary crisis.”

Faig Abbasov, director of shipping at the green group Transport & Environment, told Reuters that ""the delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty.""

Global shipping accounts for approximately 3% of the world's CO2 emissions. Approximately 90% of all international trade is conducted at sea, and proponents of the NZF warn that emissions will soar without the regulations.

While leading shipping companies including Maersk and CMA CGM have taken steps to transition their fleets to zero emission vessels, they are still falling short of the goals laid out in the landmark Paris climate agreement or even the IMO’s own 2023 emissions reduction strategy.

”However, all is not lost—not by a long shot,"" said Maggs, ""as there is an immediate opportunity to slash [greenhouse gas] emissions from shipping, minimize fuel burn, and the overall cost of the energy transition, and that is to strengthen and make enforceable the carbon intensity indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure.""

It’s just a room in which people from 176 countries gather to talk about the big issues.

So the fact the IMO failed to come up with a global answer to climate change — one of the biggest issues of them all — is disappointing, but not that surprising.

Countries voted 57-49 to adjourn the MEPC meeting for one year, in a win for opponents of carbon pricing. The NZF is not dead, or at least not yet. But its odds of being adopted, and of entering into force, look worse.

The framework, which if adopted would tax ships for a slice of their GHG emissions to raise billions for green R&D and climate change causes, sailed through its approval vote with a 63-16 majority six months ago. The US had boycotted that vote.

It then took just under six months for the Trump administration to wake up to what such a regulation could mean. Its response was an overwhelming show of diplomatic force, including threats at a state, company and individual level.

The US did all it could to bully, threaten or cajole countries into backing down. It will probably do so again next year. But this is Trump, so trying to predict the future is pointless.

Saudi Arabia meanwhile outfoxed its EU opponents with sulphurous poise, hogging the mic and using every trick in the rulebook to undermine the majority in favour of the carbon tax.

China, whose support for approval was big news at MEPC83, switched to supporting the delay. Greece and Cyprus abstained, in breach of EU rules, and reflecting their shipping industries’ strong misgivings about the carbon price.

A No vote would have killed the NZF outright and left the IMO rudderless on climate, with no clear alternative for achieving its (non-binding) net zero strategy. A Yes vote depending on ‘explicit’ acceptance rules would have seen it adopted, then strangled at birth.

Friday’s vaguer outcome means that draft legal text agreed so far may live on in some other form. More time to fix the NZF’s substantial weaknesses may not be an entirely bad thing.

The work will go on at IMO, but the momentum of MEPC83 has been dealt a blow. The global signal shipping needs to invest in greener technologies is still nowhere to be found.

IMO secretary-general Arsenio Dominguez will come under fire for this result, but he doesn’t deserve it. He has no power to change the paths of powerful states, only the thankless task of urging them to work together.

Many believe that climate change is too big an issue for the IMO to solve. This week was more evidence that international law depends on politics, and politics will follow only the law of the jungle — the eternal fight for power, wealth and influence.

Even if the NZF is adopted, it will not have a happy life as long as the world’s major powers remain at odds over its goals.

Perhaps more climate disasters will convince countries of the need to pay a higher price.

Overall, however, covered ships account for about 85 percent of global emissions from the shipping industry.
Under the proposal, ships must reduce their annual greenhouse gas fuel intensity (the amount of greenhouse gas emitted for each unit of energy used).
The IMO projects that the regulations could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by 40 percent.
Thus, if everything works as planned, the regulations will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 percent.","A fight is brewing ahead of the upcoming meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) over new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the shipping industry. Formal approval at the October 14-17 meeting was assumed until the United States announced its opposition to the regulations in August and called on other governments to reject the proposal or face retaliation.

The IMO is an unlikely place for this confrontation. As a United Nations specialized agency focusing on setting universal standards for maritime safety and security, the IMO is rarely controversial. In fact, the IMO is one of only a handful of UN organizations identified in the Trump administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget request as deserving of US funding. Specifically, it was highlighted for its standards setting, efforts to reduce pollution and prevent maritime disasters, and enhancing US security by helping “secure shipping lanes against terrorism and related threats.”

Nonetheless, the IMO finds itself in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.

The dispute centers on draft amendments to the existing International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), which the United States ratified in 1980 to address pollution of the marine environment by ships. The new rules, if approved in October, would be added to Annex VI of MARPOL and would apply to all parties to the agreement and annex 16 months after adoption through a process called “tacit acceptance.” The United States is a party to both MARPOL and Annex VI of the convention.

These regulations seek to implement the IMO “Net-Zero Framework” through mandatory fuel standards for ships over 5,000 gross tonnage and financial penalties for those failing to comply. Military and domestic shipping vessels are exempted. Overall, however, covered ships account for about 85 percent of global emissions from the shipping industry.

Under the proposal, ships must reduce their annual greenhouse gas fuel intensity (the amount of greenhouse gas emitted for each unit of energy used). Specifically, ships with emissions over two specified thresholds, which increase annually from 2028 to 2035, would be required to pay fines ($100 per ton of excess emissions over the first threshold and $380 per ton of excess emissions over the second) into an “IMO Net-Zero Fund.” Revenues would be used to reward ships with low emissions, support research and technology transfer, and help mitigate the impact of the regulations on vulnerable states.

What impact will the new regulations have? The most recent IMO study found that shipping accounted for 2.89 percent of global anthropogenic emissions. The IMO projects that the regulations could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by 40 percent. Thus, if everything works as planned, the regulations will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 percent.

But things may not go as planned.

The new regulations would take effect in 2027, giving ships a relatively short window to come into compliance. According to shipping firms, fines could amount to “about $20 billion to $30 billion a year by 2030,” with the cumulative total possibly exceeding “$300 billion by 2035 if the global fleet misses targets by as little as 10%.”

The financial penalties are intended to incentivize compliance. However, the costs of compliance are even steeper. Over 90 percent of the current global fleet uses conventional fuels and cannot utilize greener alternatives. Retrofitting existing ships is expensive, and some may choose to pay the fines instead.

In addition to retrofitting ships, infrastructure also needs to be overhauled, including investments related to new alternative green fuel production and refitting ports for storage and bunkering. According to one estimate, “To meet the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2050 emission targets, the scale of investment is estimated to be up to $1.9tn.”

Finally, there is the fact that alternative green fuels cost far more—at least three to four times more—than traditional fuels. Consequently, fuel costs are projected to rise by 350 percent.

Overall, whether shippers comply or simply pay fines, the cost of shipping is likely to increase if the IMO regulations are implemented, and consumers will bear the brunt of the price.",https://dredgewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Looming-International-Shipping-Crisis.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 13:56:50.228557

This week's delay follows a 2023 agreement by the International Maritime Organization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050.","Using a battering ram of trade and visa threats, the Trump administration on Friday blocked the adoption of a landmark global measure that would have imposed a global pollution tax on the shipping industry.

Countries meeting in London at the International Maritime Organization, an organization of 176 countries under the umbrella of the United Nations, were supposed to take a final vote Friday on a measure requiring cargo ships to lower their greenhouse gas emissions to a certain threshold or pay a fee.

It had been provisionally adopted in April with the backing of the leading shipping lobby and most of America's allies, including Britain, Canada, the European Union and Japan. China, too, supported the measure.

The United States, backed by Russia and Saudi Arabia, pushed to delay the adoption by a year. The motion to delay was narrowly passed in a vote of 57-49, with other nations absent or abstaining.

The Trump administration brought a raft of threats to dissuade countries from voting for the measure, including blocking supporters' vessels from entering U.S. ports, visa restrictions on their crews, trade investigations, sanctions on individual officials, and loss of contracting opportunities with the U.S.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump said he was ""outraged"" that the organization was considering a carbon-emissions price on global shipping. ""The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form,"" he wrote in a social media post. He branded the plan a scheme by bureaucrats to raise prices on American consumers to pursue ""their Green Dreams.""

In a joint statement issued last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the United States was considering antitrust investigations into countries that support the measure and ""blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.""

The statement referred to the proposed fee as a ""European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations"" and said that it would raise shipping costs.

The European Union then issued a two-sentence statement of support for the tax proposal, saying it would ""ensure a global level playing field.""

Arsenio Dominguez, the secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization, called out the pressure campaign against the measure, without naming any countries.

""It's the manner in which the conversations took place this week,"" he said. ""This was not the normal IMO meeting.""

He made a plea to country representatives to behave better when they return next year to consider the measure.

""Be nice and kind to each other,"" he said. ""It doesn't cost much.""

The conflict at the International Maritime Organization comes at a time when the high seas have become a high stakes battleground for U.S. power.

Trump has upended global trade with a series of unpredictable tariffs. The U.S. and China are charging extra fees on each other's ships docking at their ports.

In response to a request for comment, the State Department pointed to the joint statement.

Traditional shipping fuel, also known as bunker fuel, is a heavy oil that produces carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide when burned. New kinds of fuels are being developed, including ammonia and hydrogen-based alternatives.

The proposed Net-Zero Framework, as it is called, would require cargo ships weighing 5,000 tons or more to pay a fee if their carbon dioxide emissions exceed a threshold level and in effect, reward ships that use cleaner fuels.

If the compact had been approved this week, the new rules would have been set to take effect by March of 2027.

All large ships traversing international waters, including cruise lines, would have had to start by cutting their emissions 17% by 2028.

The proceeds would mostly be used to help the industry transition to less polluting fuels.

The World Shipping Council called it a ""carefully balanced regulatory package."" Another industry lobby, the International Chamber of Shipping, also backed the measure.

""We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,"" Thomas Kazakos, the International Chamber's secretary-general, said in a statement Friday after the vote. ""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.""

Small island nations facing climate catastrophe had protested that the draft compact was too weak and would not go far enough to save their communities from rising seas and extreme weather.

This week's delay follows a 2023 agreement by the International Maritime Organization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050.

Last year, it offered a more concrete plan, which included an industrywide carbon price.

In April this year, countries voted on a draft agreement. The United States walked out of those proceedings in April.

Russia and Saudi Arabia voted against it at the time.

Ralph Regenvanu, the climate minister of Vanuatu, a small Pacific island nation among the world's most vulnerable to sea level rise, called it ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.""

The vote shocked some of the nongovernmental organizations that have been working on this framework for years.

The Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit based in Washington, called the failure to adopt the framework ""disgraceful.""

""The agreement would have slashed carbon emissions and saved lives,"" said a statement from Delaine McCullough, the group's shipping program director. ""A world without this agreement is dirtier and more dangerous for people, wildlife and the ocean.""

Still, the delay delivers only temporary relief for agriculture. While the proposed IMO rules would cover vessels over 5,000 gross tons (which account for more than 85% of global shipping emissions), many in the biofuel and ethanol industries see potential opportunity in cleaner ship fuels. The Renewable Fuels Association suggests that if ethanol or other biofuels gained even a small share of the maritime fuel market, U.S. growers could see significant new demand — possibly hundreds of millions of gallons and millions of bushels of corn.

The framework would have marked a major turning point for a sector that’s responsible for 3% of global emissions, of course.
“Over the past two years people have really started investing around the anticipation of something like the Net-Zero Framework being adopted,” Danaher told me.
Let’s rip the Band-Aid off, and let’s get clarity,” Danaher told me.
“A lot of wars happen in and around the oceans, because that’s where we intersect each other the most.” Danaher told me.","Today, members of the International Maritime Organization decided to postpone a major vote on the world’s first truly global carbon pricing scheme. The yearlong delay came in response to a pressure campaign led by the U.S.

The Net-Zero Framework — initially approved in April by an overwhelming margin and long expected to be formally adopted today — would establish a legally binding requirement for the shipping industry to cut its emissions intensity, with interim steps leading to net zero by 2050.

In the intervening months, however, U.S. opposition has gotten much louder. On Thursday, Trump posted on Truth Social that he’s “outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.” He also took the extraordinary step of threatening not to comply with the rules. “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form.” If the framework ever does pass, noncompliance could subject U.S. vessels to fines or even denial of entry at the ports of IMO member countries, potentially setting off a cycle of retaliatory measures from all sides.

No specific date has yet been scheduled for the forthcoming vote, which will be taken again a year from now. That throws plans for the world’s largest shipping companies — some of which have already taken expensive measures to decarbonize their fleets — into turmoil. The framework would have marked a major turning point for a sector that’s responsible for 3% of global emissions, of course. But even more importantly, it would have made a range of decarbonization technologies — from advanced batteries and clean fuels to wind-assisted propulsion and onboard carbon capture — far more viable and attractive to investors.

Kate Danaher, managing director of the oceans team at S2G Investments, has a vested interest in the frameworks’ eventual passage. “Over the past two years people have really started investing around the anticipation of something like the Net-Zero Framework being adopted,” Danaher told me. For its part, S2G has invested in Sofar Ocean, which focuses on fuel savings through route optimization, battery company Echandia which is aiming to electrify smaller vessels, and ocean data and monitoring companies Xocean and Apeiron Lab.

The new rules were originally set to take effect in 2028, and would apply to large vessels — ships of 5,000 gross tonnage or more — involved in international voyages. Qualifying ships would be assigned a base target for emissions intensity and a stricter “direct compliance target.” For every metric ton of CO2 equivalent that exceeds the compliance target but falls below the base target, ships must pay $100. For all emissions that exceed the base target, ships must pay $380 per metric ton. Noncompliant ships would pay these penalties by purchasing so-called “remedial units” from a central IMO registry, while the cleanest vessels — those performing better than their compliance targets — would earn surplus units they can sell to others or bank for future use.

Green shipping fuels such as e-methanol, e-hydrogen, and e-ammonia — all produced from green hydrogen using renewable electricity — stand to be the biggest winners, she said. “A new fuel would completely decarbonize the industry. That is 10 years out, and is completely contingent on the IMO,” Danaher said, explaining that if the framework ultimately fails, there’s no economic incentive to adopt these more expensive fuels, which also require costly retrofits for existing fleets. But the framework would effectively cause the cost of conventional fuel to rise just as alternative fuels are scaling up, which would allow them to reach parity around 2035, she said.

A specialized agency within the United Nations, the IMO gets its power to set global regulations from the vastness of the ocean itself. Most of the world’s waters exist outside the jurisdiction of any national government. Because of that, IMO member states — which represent the vast majority of global shipping tonnage — have ratified treaties that empower the organization to set safety, security, and environmental standards on the high seas, which members then implement and enforce through their own national laws. Only member states have a stake in IMO policy. Furthermore, vessels that aren’t IMO-compliant face penalties such as fees and even possible detentions when entering the ports of IMO countries.

While IMO decisions are typically made via negotiated consensus, the contentious nature of these new regulations necessitates a vote. U.S. officials celebrated the delay. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted on X that the postponement represents “another HUGE win for @POTUS,” going on to say that “the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects.”

Along with Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, Rubio last week issued a statement threatening to punish nations that voted in favor of these “activist-driven climate policies” with actions such as banning their ships from U.S. ports, imposing vessel fees, and even leveling sanctions on officials supportive of the regulations.

Saudi Arabia — the world’s second largest oil producer after the U.S. — also strongly opposed the framework, as did a host of other oil-producing Middle Eastern countries, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand, Russia and Venezuela. Singapore ultimately put forth the motion to delay the adoption vote for a full year and Saudi Arabia called it to a vote. It passed with a simple majority, with 57 countries approving and 49 opposed.

When it comes to costs, Trump officials might actually have a point, Danaher conceded. “Once alternative fuels come online and people are actively paying penalties, it gets a lot more expensive,” she told me. “I don’t see how this isn’t incredibly inflationary to the global market in 10 years.”

Today’s standard low-sulfur fuel, she explained, costs about $500 per metric ton. But reaching the same energy density with e-methanol, for example, could push the price to around $2,000 a metric ton. “That is all going to get passed on, essentially, to the consumer,” she said.

Even so, the framework has the backing of major shipping trade organizations and industry giants alike, from the International Chamber of Shipping to Maersk. As a group of leading international maritime associations put it in an open letter last week, “Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.”

Indeed, a universal set of coherent rules is what many in the sector want most, Danaher affirmed. Some voting bodies, such as the EU and Singapore, have already set their own shipping-related emissions requirements, creating a regulatory patchwork that’s both costly and confusing for companies to comply with. “I think most people are like, let’s just do this. Let’s rip the Band-Aid off, and let’s get clarity,” Danaher told me.

In a statement released after the vote’s delay and the conclusion of the IMO’s days-long meeting in London, Thomas A. Kazakos, the shipping chamber’s secretary general, said, “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.”

The delay also risks delegitimizing the power of the IMO as a whole, something the organization’s Secretary-General, Arsenio Dominguez, warned about in the meeting’s opening remarks on Tuesday, when he stated that “Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in IMO.”

There would be other ways for shippers to comply with the framework besides switching to e-fuels, Danaher told me. For example, S2G’s portfolio company Sofar Ocean operates a network of ocean sensors designed to improve marine weather predictions and power a route optimization platform that can help ships save time, fuel, and ultimately, emissions.

Software solutions have a pretty low barrier to adoption. But a step up in complexity — and cost — would involve a technology such as wind-assisted propulsion. The companies Norsepower and Anemoi, for example, use a cylindrical “rotor sail” that creates a powerful thrust as it spins, which they say allows for up to 25% to 30% fuel savings. Another approach is the “rigid wing sail,” such as that developed by Bar Technologies. This generates lift in the direction of the ship’s movement with less drag than a normal sail — similar to how an airplane wing works.

Pairing route optimization with wind-assisted propulsion will generate even greater emissions savings, as the software can direct ships towards areas with the most advantageous winds. Given the obvious co-benefits and cost savings stemming from lower fuel use, Danaher thinks this tech could gain traction even if the regulations ultimately fail to pass next year. “I think the adoption curve will still continue without IMO [Net-Zero Framework], but I think it'll be slower,” she told me.

One approach she doesn’t think will be economically viable without the framework is onboard carbon capture. This tech, which traps carbon dioxide from a ship’s exhaust system before it’s released into the atmosphere, is being explored by startups including Seabound — which I reported on last year — and Value Maritime, as well as more established companies such as Mitsubishi and Wartsila. “A lot of the carbon capture technologies have not yet solved for how to turn that captured carbon into a valuable resource, and how to get it off the boat, put it in a pipeline, and sell it,” Danaher told me.” The economic incentive just isn't there without the IMO.”

At the same time, when I talked to one of Seabound’s backers — Clea Kolster, of Lowercarbon Capital — last year, she told me that when it comes to cargo shipping, “carbon capture is probably the only way that you can get a meaningful amount of emissions reductions in any near term way.” And it’s true that alternative fuels will take a while to scale up, so if the framework is ultimately adopted, carbon capture may still have an important role to play — at least that’s what investors and startups alike are banking on. “Everybody's talking about carbon capture in anticipation of this getting adopted,” Danaher told me. “All these vessels are going to be old, they’re going to need to comply, and they’re not going to be able to comply fast enough,” she said.

Amidst the turmoil, one silver lining is that interest in maritime innovation and efficiency appears to be increasing regardless of global frameworks. For one, the surge in global military spending has underscored this tech’s potential for dual-use applications. “A lot of wars happen in and around the oceans, because that’s where we intersect each other the most.” Danaher told me. Many of S2G’s investments in ocean tech have received additional backing from governments and defense agencies looking to make their fleets more efficient, energy resilient, and secure. “Every single one of our ocean tech companies, one of their customers is the government, or many governments,” she said.

It’s an important reminder that there are many practical reasons for investors and states alike to support a decarbonization agenda, regardless of whether the U.S. is on board or not. But a global system of carrots and sticks sure wouldn’t hurt either. And now, we face the uneasy prospect of waiting another year to see whether the shipping industry will resist the Trump-era pushback or abandon its collective ambitions for a decarbonized future.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTc3MjE2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNDgxODAxNX0.ZPRkfApgyfj5AnTZ0ssS4UWWfMiVhyxWh6QoQXV9_5U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-18 13:57:01.661258

The decision to formally delay adopting the framework until late next year came a day after President Trump took to his Truth Social platform, saying: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said, telling countries to vote against the plan.

Washington also threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies on countries that supported the deal.

In advance of this week’s meeting in London, about 63 IMO members who had voted for the plan in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to join the initiative to formally approve the framework.

Following Trump’s social media threat, delegates in London instead voted on a hastily arranged resolution to push back proceedings on the matter, which passed by 57 votes to 49.

The IMO, which comprises 176 member countries, is responsible for regulating the safety and security of international shipping and preventing pollution on the high seas.

Since returning to power in January, Trump has focused on reversing Washington’s course on climate change, encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation, cutting funding for clean energy projects and promising businesses to “drill, baby drill”.

‘A missed opportunity’

A spokesman for UN chief Antonio Guterres called Friday’s decisions “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net zero emissions”.

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing more than 80 percent of the world’s fleet, also expressed disappointment.

“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector,” the chamber’s Secretary-General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement.

Ralph Regenvanu, the minister for climate change for Vanuatu, said the decision to delay the vote by 12 months was “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”.

“But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet,” Regenvanu added.

Leading up to Friday’s decision, China, the European Union, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO had reaffirmed their support.

Countries that opposed the measures included Russia and Saudi Arabia.

A Russian delegate described the proceedings as “chaos” as he addressed the plenary on Friday after talks had lasted into the early hours.

Argentina and Singapore, two countries that had previously voted in support of the framework in April, were among those that voted to postpone introducing it this week.

If it had been formally adopted this week, the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would have been the first global carbon-pricing system, charging ships a penalty of $380 per metric tonne on every extra tonne of CO2-equivalent they emit while rewarding vessels that reduce their emissions by using alternatives.

The framework plan is intended to help the IMO reach its target of cutting net emissions from international shipping by 20 percent by 2030 and eliminating them by 2050.

Environmentalists eager to curb planet-warming pollution from shipping had grown increasingly confident that countries would adopt the first-ever global tax on emissions this year.

But those predicting success failed to fully account for President Donald Trump harnessing the might of the US against it.

On Friday, nations at a meeting of the UN’s International Maritime Organization voted to delay by one year a decision on the landmark measure that would force large vessels to curb emissions or potentially incur fees of $380 per ton.

The outcome was in part the culmination of a months-long campaign by US officials — including diplomats and cabinet members as well as the president himself — to fight the fee they decried as an untenable global carbon tax.

“President Trump saved America from the outrageous climate scam that was killing our country, and he has long warned others to abandon this destructive agenda before it is too late,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said by email. “Stopping this disastrous vote is a massive win for the American people and countries around the world that cannot afford to bend the knee to bogus climate demands any longer.”

Industry Voices Disappointment and Concern as IMO Postpones Global Shipping Carbon Tax Vote

European nations and the UK were among those who had supported the regulations in April when they received preliminary approval, but were on the losing side of Friday’s 57-49 vote in favor of postponement.

The US wasn’t alone in battling the initiative; nations including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia had voted against the planned emissions charge in April and on Friday backed the delay.

For months beforehand, US officials had been pressing other countries to oppose the measure, at times by delivering arguments about the potential costs and national security risks, said a senior US State Department official who asked for anonymity to speak candidly.

The administration’s work picked up in July, when the State Department gathered federal agencies to develop a roadmap to defeat the plan. By August, the State Department had launched a global demarche – a formal diplomatic outreach to 108 other nations to lay out its opposition.

US officials also met with European counterparts in Brussels last month to discuss what the senior official described as potential off ramps, and they pressed foreign leaders during meetings on sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.

Trump administration officials also wielded specific threats, warning other nations they could face tariffs, visa restrictions and financial penalties if they backed the so-called net-zero framework, or NZF. Trump himself has widely used tariffs — and even just the threat of them — to compel other countries to abandon or ease policies with which he disagrees.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy vowed in an Oct. 10 statement. “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.”

A suite of cabinet officials were enlisted to deliver arguments against the initiative, including Wright and Rubio as well as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, the official said. Conversations unfolded in text messages, phone calls, emails and public meetings, often tailored to anticipate and emphasize the potential concerns of other countries, the official said.

For instance, Trump administration officials told other nations the fees would deliver widespread economic damage — hiking costs, stoking inflation and imperiling food security — although some analysts have described a more modest financial impact.

They also cast doubt on plans for using the more than $10 billion in revenue the emissions charges were expected to raise annually. While the draft agreement outlined where revenue would end up — including for ships using low-emission fuels — key financial details had not been finalized, feeding US officials’ arguments it could be an “environmental slush fund.”

US representatives also assured countries that had some concerns with the measure that they didn’t need to go along with it. Some countries previously felt like it was a foregone conclusion, the senior State Department official said.

The US opposition may have provided a kind of political cover for other wavering nations — a scenario that could play out in other international climate talks.

Environmentalists called the administration’s approach and the delay misguided. Currently, ships are almost exclusively powered by oil-derived fuels that spew out more than a billion tons of emissions each year.

Also, the delay would lead to a conflicting patchwork of rules and undermines a potential economic bounty for the US, given its advantage producing lower-emission fuels, they said. Ahead of the vote, some US biofuel producers unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to alter course.

Ahead of Friday’s vote, Andrew Forrest, the billionaire founder and chair of of Fortescue Metals Group, decried what he said were “intimidatory tactics” impacting delegates’ ability to vote their conscience.

“As a global industrialist and philanthropist I stand ready to support any country or individual being blackmailed or threatened,” Forrest said in a message to negotiators at the UN agency. “I am committed to working with others to ensure that justice prevails and bullying tactics do not win out.”

Although conversations were at times tense and spirited, there wasn’t intimidation, the State Department official said.

Lobbying continued until the final hours. On the eve of the vote, Trump himself swooped in to reinforce the American position on Thursday, amid a last-ditch effort tied to potentially pausing the meeting.

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form,” Trump said in a social media post. “We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!”

The U.S. has succeeded in blocking a global fee on shipping emissions as an international maritime meeting adjourned Friday without adopting regulations.

The world’s largest maritime nations had been deliberating on regulations to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels. But U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and other countries vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, Trump urged countries to vote “No” on the regulations. The International Maritime Organization adjourned its meeting Friday.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

The world’s largest maritime nations were deliberating Friday on regulations that would move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions as U.S. President Donald Trump and others vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

On Thursday, United States President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social asking countries to vote “No” and that “The United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Representatives from the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia and a host of other nations are against the regulations passing through in its current form. The meetings on Friday witnessed a tense start as they continued their discussions from earlier in the week about meeting procedures.

“I put myself out there to try and find a way for you to cooperate and move forward in the normal way that we would,” said Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the International Maritime Organization. During his statement, Dominguez added that the way negotiations have happened this week should not be repeated again.

The top shipping nations from across the world are meeting at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London. If the green shipping regulations are adopted, this will be the first time a global fee is imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances. In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework, with the aim of adopting the “Net-Zero Framework” at this London meeting.

“The attempts from the U.S. and others to delay the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework are an affront to multilateralism and fly in the face of the the courage and ambition shown by member states when it was agreed in April. Thankfully this is not a foregone conclusion and countries can continue to demonstrate the spirit of solidarity that they showed in April when voting to adopt the framework,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The regulations set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

Observers said it is still unclear what will be decided later today.

“By voting for adoption of the framework, governments will make history with the first global carbon price, and set course for reducing shipping’s global impact on the climate,” said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the IMO. “But failing to support the framework will be a missed opportunity, and risks stagnating action at the IMO for years to come.”",https://wpcdn.us-midwest-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.fox21online.com/content/uploads/2020/05/fox-21-avatar.png,N,,2025-10-18 12:00:27.829269

Meeting ends without new regulations, decision on global fee put off until next year

The United States has succeeded in blocking a global fee on shipping emissions as an international maritime meeting adjourned Friday without adopting regulations.

The world's largest maritime nations had been deliberating on adopting regulations to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions. But U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and other countries vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

The U.S. had threatened to retaliate if nations support it. Trump urged countries to vote ""No"" at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters in London, posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that ""the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.""

The IMO is the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping.

Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half of the countries agreed.

""Now you have one year, you will continue to work on several aspects of these amendments,"" Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the IMO, said in his closing remarks. ""You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to consensus.""

What this means for climate change

Ralph Regenvanu, minister of climate change for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, said the decision is unacceptable, ""given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.""

If the green shipping regulations were adopted, it would have been the first time a global fee was imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it's burned.

""The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,"" said Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental non-governmental organization.

Shipping emissions have risen over the past decade to about three per cent of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

Adopting the regulations was meant to demonstrate how effective multilateral co-operation can deliver real progress on global climate goals, said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change non-profit, Opportunity Green. Delaying the process risks undermining the framework's ambitions, they said.

What the regulations would have done

The regulations would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

""What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,"" said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. ""The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.""",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-17 23:00:09.615403

Vote to adopt the Net-Zero Framework postponed for one year.

Negotiations at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have ended in the postponement of the vote to adopt the landmark Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for a year. This comes after a week of pressure and delay tactics from the United States, Saudi Arabia and a number of other countries. The delay undermines years of work on the IMO’s plan to cut shipping’s greenhouse gas emissions, says T&E.

Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at T&E, said: “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying. The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonisation. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.”

This pause will push the adoption vote to the next session in October 2026, and it could risk the deal not coming into force until 2030, even if adopted in a year’s time.

Yet even with this delay, the member states should not abandon their ambitions for the NZF. This additional time is a chance to strategically strengthen the framework and ensure it delivers tangible emission reductions. Crucial elements, such as clear incentives for scalable green e-fuels and safeguards to prevent first-generation biofuels from driving deforestation, must be developed.

Delegates at the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s extraordinary session in London voted to adjourn discussions for 12 months after failing to reach consensus or call a vote on the draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, which include the key elements of the framework.

The decision pushes any adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework into late 2026 at the earliest, complicating the timeline for meeting the organisation’s greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction strategy agreed in 2023.

The framework—approved in principle at MEPC 83 in April 2025—sets out a global fuel standard and an emissions pricing mechanism, which together would form the backbone of international shipping’s path to net zero by 2050.

While the main negotiations have been adjourned, the Intersessional Working Group on GHG Emissions Reduction from Ships, due to meet from October 20 to 24, will continue work on developing implementation guidelines in the meantime.

Industry voices have expressed broad disappointment over the delay, warning that the year-long adjournment risks slowing investment and undermining momentum toward shipping’s decarbonisation goals.

The Global Maritime Forum described the adjournment as a serious setback.

“Today’s adjournment is disappointing but not the end of the journey,” said Jesse Fahnestock, the Forum’s director of decarbonisation.

“Delaying for a full year makes delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging,” he added, urging member states that supported the framework in April to “reconfirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue the urgent work of developing guidelines and adopting a regulatory framework that can deliver on the IMO’s unanimously agreed GHG strategy.”

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) also voiced frustration that the meeting failed to deliver progress.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward,” said Thomas Kazakos, ICS secretary general, adding: “Industry needs clarity to make the investments needed to decarbonise in line with the IMO’s goals.”

We came here to finally conclude a crucial climate agreement for international shipping”. She added that “geopolitical tensions and a new world order have made their way in – also at the IMO”.

Patrick Verhoeven, managing director of the International Association of Ports and Harbors, described it as “a major setback for the maritime industry,” warning that the delay “will simply open the door for more national and regional measures, which will add to an already complex regulatory patchwork resulting in unintended consequences.”

The World Shipping Council, while acknowledging the challenging negotiations, underlined the importance of using the year ahead to clarify and develop the framework. The liner industry has invested $150 billion in ships designed to run on green fuels and remains committed to net-zero by 2050.

Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change of Vanuatu, expressed particular concern from the perspective of climate-vulnerable nations: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change. The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change.”

The Trump Administration threatened retaliatory tariffs and sanctions, especially on developing and climate-vulnerable states, if they supported the framework. Delegates from many developing countries described this pressure as “bullying,” “unprecedented,” and “undiplomatic.”

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marc Rubio both claimed the outcome as a victory, stating that the United States “prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers”.

The Net-Zero Framework includes requirements for gradual reduction of greenhouse gas intensity in marine fuels, with ships that emit more than allowed required to pay, while energy-efficient vessels can earn and trade surplus units. The delay could risk the deal not coming into force until 2030, even if adopted in a year.

The motion to delay was put forward by Singapore and called to a vote by Saudi Arabia.

The decision came after four days of tense talks in London that exposed deep rifts between oil-producing nations and countries seeking stronger climate action.

The proposed carbon-pricing plan—known as the Net Zero Framework—would have charged shipping companies for emissions exceeding set limits, with proceeds funding cleaner fuels and climate aid for vulnerable nations.

Backed by the European Union, Brazil, and several Pacific Island states, the initiative aimed to push the global shipping sector, which generates nearly 3% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, toward its 2050 net-zero goal.

Washington warned that any country supporting the plan could face sanctions, visa restrictions, or higher port fees. The State Department argued the levy would raise costs for American consumers and undermine economic competitiveness.

Carbon Tax Debate Exposes Global Fault Lines

The proposal to delay was introduced by Singapore and called to a vote by Saudi Arabia, passing narrowly with 57 countries in favor, 49 against, and 21 abstentions. The postponement pushes back the adoption of a framework that had been agreed in principle in April, when 63 countries, including the EU, China, India, Brazil, Canada, the UK, Japan, and South Korea, voted to support it.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez urged delegates to avoid further breakdowns, calling the week’s proceedings “chaotic.” Observers said the impasse underscored the difficulty of achieving global consensus on climate measures that directly affect trade and energy policy.

Small island states and developing nations, some of which had planned to back the tax after initially abstaining, expressed frustration that momentum for maritime decarbonization had stalled once again.

Without a pricing system, experts warn, the shipping sector’s emissions will continue to rise, threatening global climate targets and testing the credibility of the IMO’s climate commitments.

Framework in Doubt

The NZF would require ships over 5,000 gross tons to reduce the carbon intensity of their fuels beginning in 2028, introducing a system of credits and penalties.

Vessels exceeding emission limits would purchase “remedial units”, while lower-emitting operators could trade surplus credits. Revenues would feed into an IMO Net-Zero Fund to finance low-carbon fuel adoption and assist developing nations with the transition.

While some delegates view the delay as a chance to build broader consensus, others fear it could embolden opposition and slow progress toward the shipping sector’s decarbonization goals.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ship-5894495_1280.png,N,,2025-10-18 00:56:18.202622

In closing remarks, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez urged delegates to use the coming year to rebuild trust and seek consensus.

“Even though you have differences of opinion, you all spoke in support of the work of this Organization,” he said.

“There are no winners and losers in this session. Let us take this moment to learn from it and come back ready to negotiate and take the next steps needed to meet the goals you all agreed to in the 2023 GHG strategy.”

He asked delegates not to celebrate the adjournment. “There are concerns we need to address, let us work with each other,” he said.

A missed opportunity

UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York that Secretary-General António Guterres viewed the outcome as “a missed opportunity for Member States to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net-zero emissions.”

He stressed that decarbonizing the maritime sector – responsible for about 80 per cent of global trade – “is critical.”

Media reports cited opposition from several major economies – including the United States – which argued that the proposed global pricing mechanism risked functioning as a “carbon tax” and could raise shipping costs by more than 10 per cent.

With years of negotiations behind the shipping decarbonisation amendments that include the NZF, and an April 2025 vote that approved the amendments to Marpol, the move to adjourn was not widely expected.

But during a press conference following the closure of proceedings, IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez said the plan was ’very much alive’.

""The framework is not adopted, but we were already working on developing the guidelines [if] the framework [had been] approved. So the amendments remain approved. The session has been adjourned to continue in one year, again, to address the adoption of the amendments,"" he said.

Asked if the adjournment was a ’blow’ to the IMO, with alleged reports from delegates that ""outside pressure [is] what dictated the outcome"" of the vote, Mr Dominguez said he did not see it that way, while noting the particular challenges and weighty geopolitical stakes that surround climate agreements.

""It wasn’t the normal meetings of IMO, but this is a topic that, you know, transcends IMO,"" he said. ""The geopolitics in the world right now makes it, as well, more challenging for us to make progress in certain topics. But I will maintain that member states have the right to express their opinion, to negotiate amongst each other. I’m not here to qualify that. I’m here to continue to work with all of them... and that’s why there’s further work, not only on the guidelines, but the negotiations that will continue to take place in between now that we have adjourned and when we resume in a year’s time.""

Pointing out that the IMO’s ""main framework"" rules on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)remain ""the basis for any discussions,"" Mr Dominguez said the organisation can still move forward on several fronts.

""We’re still calculating and providing information annually in relation to the efficiency of shipping made on the data collection systems. The goals that remained in the 2023 IMO agenda, [they] remain there as as indicative goals,"" he said, in reference to a 2023 revision to the IMO GHG strategy that saw the organisation set target reductions for 2030, through to targeting a reduction of GHGs to net zero by or around 2050.

""And of course, with the technical measures, as I said in the past, we can still move forward in relation to the meeting the [total annual GHG reductions form shipping] of 20% and striving for 30% [by 2030]. And of course, there are many proactive actions that can take place in order to continue to incentivise the transition of shipping... and allow us to meet the other goal of uptake of alternative fuels,"" he said.

According to IMO, the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy also includes a level of ambition relating to the uptake of zero or near-zero (ZNZ) GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources which are to represent at least 5%, striving for 10%, of the energy used by international shipping by 2030.

Reactions to the delay in adopting a net-zero framework

A host of organisations published reactions to the early adjournment, without a decision, of the IMO meeting that had been expected to address and potentially set formal, binding requirements for the decarbonisation of the shipping sector over the next 25 years.

“Today’s adjournment is a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey. The adjournment for a full year creates serious challenges for meeting the timelines in the Net-Zero Framework agreed in April and will make delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging,"" director of decarbonisation for the non-profit maritime decarbonisation facilitator Global Maritime Forum (GMF) Jesse Fahnestock.

“We encourage member states that agreed on the framework in April to re-confirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue the urgent work of developing guidelines and adopting a regulatory framework that can deliver on the IMO’s unanimously agreed Greenhouse Gas Strategy,” he said.

The EU called the delay ""regrettable,"" and said it remained committed to ""an ambitious, science-based global framework"" to decarbonise shipping through a ""just, equitable"" transition.

UCL Energy Institute Professor of Energy and Transport Dr Tristan Smith said: “This is catastrophic for confidence, and therefore also for the equitable and ambitious decarbonisation we need. We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition. Climate science tells us that the challenge of decarbonisation does not go away, it gets harder. This delay therefore means those with the means must step up and lead more than ever, until this multilateral process can regain its composure.”

ICS Secretary General Thomas A. Kazakos said his organisation is ""disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy. As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry.”

New evidence shows benefits of ’stringent climate policies’

A new study by by the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC) shows that pursuing net-zero climate policies and avoiding temporary overshoot of the 1.5°C temperature limit set in the UN’s Paris Agreement on climate change could prevent 207,000 premature deaths and save billions of dollars in economic damages by 2030 by improving air quality. The research highlights that ambitious climate action not only limits global warming but also delivers immediate health and economic ""co-benefits, providing strong evidence for the importance of stringent mitigation policies worldwide"".

""Air pollution is one of the world’s leading health risks, contributing to nearly 1 in 8 deaths globally.

The IMO will still hold its intersessional meeting on greenhouse gas emissions next week, meaning delegates have an opportunity to continue talks on the details of the NZF.

But the delay puts the business case for green shipping investments in doubt, prolonging uncertainty for shipowners with fleets to renew.

Dominguez said they should learn from the result, work toward consensus and “come back fresh in one year ready to negotiate”.

“As we come to an end, my plea to you is not to repeat the way that we have approached this meeting,” he said.

President Trump outlined several punitive measures against those voting for the measure, including port fees, sanctions, visa restrictions on crews and other ‘penalties’ for ‘nations in favour’ of the NZF.

Adding their voices of dissent in social media posts during the week of the MEPC extraordinary meeting were Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. Secretary Rubio wrote on X: “This week, the UN is attempting to pass the first global carbon tax, which will increase energy, food, and fuel costs across the world.

Added Mr Rubio: “The US will be a hard NO.”

An opinion piece by the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, published on 14 October, railed against the NZF and its carbon tax, which would be collected by IMO into a Net Zero Fund, highlighting concerns around mismanagement and corruption.

“The IMO says this money pot, to be managed by agency staff, would support innovation in green shipping and ‘reward low-emission ships’,” it stated.

It continued: “That’s bad enough as an invitation to opaque special dealing and corruption. But the IMO also contemplates using the funds for ‘just-transition initiatives in developing countries’ and to ‘mitigate negative impacts’ of climate change on ‘vulnerable States’.”

Elsewhere, the BBC reported a number of island states, many of which are likely to bear the brunt of climate change through rising sea levels, were coerced by the US into reversing their stance on the NZF.

“[The framework] represented years of negotiations, research, and collective effort,” Jenny Helle, an expert on decarbonisation of aviation and shipping at Carbon Market Watch, said in a statement. “It was a clear and urgent demand from both the industry and the public.

“Yet, due to pressure from the Trump administration and major fossil fuel producing countries, this opportunity for progress was lost.”

The maritime organization said in a brief statement on Friday that member states “will continue to work towards consensus,” using the next 12 months to bridge differences on the framework, while a technical group meets next week to keep drafting the guidelines for how it would work in practice.

Ships over limits would pay into global clean-fuel fund

The framework, drawn up in April, would have made shipping pay for its emissions. Under the plan, ships that exceed set limits would pay for their excess pollution, while vessels that perform better could trade or bank so-called “surplus units.”

Money collected through the scheme would go into a fund to support zero- and near-zero-emission fuels and technologies — particularly in developing countries and island states.

The rules would apply to ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnes, which account for roughly 85 per cent of international shipping’s total CO₂ emissions. The IMO has said it wants the industry to reach carbon neutrality “by or around 2050,” with interim cuts of 20 per cent by 2030 and 70 per cent by 2040.

Concern for Arctic

The Net-Zero Framework has also been closely watched across the Arctic, where melting sea ice is opening new shipping routes and increasing traffic through fragile ecosystems.

Northern and Indigenous communities, already contending with rising coastal erosion and black carbon pollution from vessels, have often raised concerns in global forums that weaker or delayed shipping rules could deepen the climate pressures already reshaping their coasts.

Trump calls framework a “Global Green New Scam Tax.”

The IMO session, which ran from October 14–17, had been expected to end with a vote in favour of the Net-Zero Framework on Friday.

But in the days leading up to the decision, members of the U.S. administration mounted a strong campaign against the plan, arguing that the framework amounted to a global carbon tax that would raise costs for American consumers, businesses and travellers.

Officials warned the U.S. would retaliate against countries backing the proposal — including through measures like port fees, visa restrictions, sanctions and limits on ships registered in countries that supported the plan.

On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump took to the Truth Social platform saying he was “outraged” the vote would take place and characterizing it as a “Global Green New Scam Tax.”

Delay ‘a squandered opportunity’ say environmental groups

Environmental groups reacted sharply to the IMO’s decision, calling it a major setback for climate action.

“By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown”, John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at the IMO, said in a statement, warning that governments “serious about climate action” should use the next 12 months to rally support for adoption.

Others said the delay exposes how geopolitics has overtaken science in the IMO’s process.

“Emotions have run high, with once-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason,” Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at Seas At Risk, said.

“With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail — but here we are. The planet and the future of shipping don’t have time to waste.”

Part 1 addressed international policy and politics leading up to this meeting. Part 2 looked at efficiency measures; Part 3, alternative fuels.

The shipping sector was widely expected to become the first industry to adopt a binding set of global greenhouse gas emissions rules during an Oct. 14-17 meeting in London. However, the contentious talks concluded not with a vote on the rules, but rather a vote on whether to delay the decision for another year — a proposal that narrowly passed.

Member countries of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) committee voted 57-49 in favor of delaying the decision until October 2026. The IMO is a United Nations body that regulates shipping.

The “net-zero framework,” as the rules are known, would have established emissions intensity limits that become more stringent each year, with substantial fees paid for noncompliance.

“Getting the net-zero framework adopted in this [meeting], however imperfect, was fundamental for shipping to stay within reach of its own decarbonation targets,” Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at Seas At Risk, a Brussels-based NGO, said in a statement. “Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason.”

The United States and other oil-exporting countries dominated much of the discussion in London as they sought to prevent the deal from being adopted. The U.S. derided the framework as an illegitimate international tax and argued that it would have dire economic consequences.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying,” Alison Shaw, IMO manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based advocacy group, said in a statement.

What is the framework?

Formally, the framework would come as an amendment to Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. There are 108 parties to Annex VI, and these are the countries that would vote on whether to adopt the framework.

However, an additional 27 delegations were eligible for the Oct. 17 vote because this was a procedural vote, based on a proposal from Saudi Arabia, on whether to adjourn the meeting and delay substantive decisions until next year. Fifty-seven parties voted in favor, 49 against; 21 abstained and eight were not present. If it had been adopted, the framework, which has been largely supported by the global shipping industry, was set to go into effect in 2028, but this delay likely changes that timeline, experts say.

The net-zero framework would set a fuel standard that incentivizes the use of alternative fuels and, indirectly, the adoption of efficiency measures to cut down on fuel use. It would require vessels engaged in international shipping to reach lower and lower greenhouse gas emission intensity levels, a measure of the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted per unit of fuel energy content.

The framework in fact would set two standards, one high and one low, meaning it effectively creates three categories of vessels: high emitters that meet neither standard and pay the steepest fees, medium emitters that meet only the lower standard and pay reduced fees, and low emitters that meet them both and are rewarded with carbon allowances.

It would increasingly punish the use of conventional marine fuels, which are fossil fuel-based. By 2035, a midsize carrier using conventional fuels — that is, a high emitter — could have to pay $1.5 million in additional fees per year due to the system, raising its fuel costs by roughly 20%, according to a recent analysis by scholars at the Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP) at Columbia University; they used a calculator created by the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation, a Singapore-based nonprofit.

Critics on both sides, one with great power

The deal was a compromise many years in the making. The text was finalized after a vote at an April meeting, setting up the Oct. 14-17 meeting to determine if it would be adopted.

For some, the deal didn’t do enough to incentivize decarbonization. Environmental groups and many member nations, most notably a set of small island developing states (SIDS) in the Pacific Ocean, had pushed for a stricter system that would incorporate a more straightforward levy on carbon emissions.

Simon Kofe, transport minister of Tuvalu, an archipelagic nation in the South Pacific, said the text that was agreed to “delayed justice and left vulnerable nations unprotected.”

For others, the deal went too far. The United States and a number of other oil-exporting countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia led the opposition to the framework, arguing that it would be too economically costly.

The U.S. was particularly active in its attempt to nix the deal, experts said, both at the London meeting and beforehand. Some of its maneuvers were procedural, including an effort to affect the “acceptance” period that would follow adoption. The U.S. sought to make it so that the burden would be on proponents of the deal to get it fully ratified, rather than allowing it to be tacitly accepted; nothing was ultimately decided on this or any other matter at the meeting. Felix Klann, a maritime transport policy officer at Transport & Environment, called it a “delay tactic.” More significant was the heavy pressure the U.S. put on other delegations, he said.

“It is somewhat surprising how brazen they’re acting on the floor,” Klann told Mongabay, after the meeting adjourned, speaking of the U.S. delegation.

“It is quite surprising to see both the tone and the style in which…they’ve been behaving here, and that includes behavior on the floor, the wording, the way they treat procedure,” he added.

U.S. opposition dates back at least to the April talks, which the U.S. delegation left early, sending out a diplomatic note that called it “blatantly unfair.” U.S. officials followed with a series of diplomatic and public condemnations of the deal in recent months, accompanied by threats of retaliation at nations that support the framework. The threats included tariffs, new ports fees and visa restrictions, which were reiterated on the floor in London. The U.S.’ most recent public statement before the meeting, issued by three U.S. cabinet members on Oct. 10, referred to the framework as “the UN’s first global carbon tax” and argued that it would increase costs for U.S. citizens, energy providers and shipping companies and their clients. It went on to say that the framework “poses significant risks to the global economy.” The U.S. statements didn’t cite any economic analysis.

On Oct. 16, U.S. President Donald Trump himself criticized the framework, calling it a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping” in a social media post.

A senior State Department official wrote in an email to Mongabay that “commonsense” prevailed. “The Trump Administration will not stand for the U.N. or any organization forcing American taxpayers to foot the bill for their environmental pet projects,” the official wrote.

What’s to come

Many environmental NGOs and international shipping associations reiterated their support for a deal after the meeting adjourned.

“A globally agreed framework is needed to provide a level playing field to get there,” the World Shipping Council, a trade association, said in an emailed statement. “The liner industry is committed to the goal of net-zero by 2050 and has invested $150 billion in ships designed to run on green fuels. The IMO remains the right place to deliver a global solution.”

Even though the body of the text of the framework has been finalized, many contentious details of the system remain to be worked out — a process that will continue in meetings as early as next week. There are technical negotiations to work through on issues such as how the full life cycle emissions of fuels will be measured; which fuels will qualify as “zero or near-zero”; how monitoring, reporting and verification will work; and how the climate financing will be distributed. The climate finance will come in the form of a “net-zero fund” that the IMO expects to have revenues of roughly $11-13 billion per year from the fees paid by vessels. The general plan is to use it for research and “just transition” initiatives in Global South countries. The CGEP analysis said the plan faces “significant institutional challenges” as the IMO has “limited experience administering or managing climate finance.”

Those details will not be relevant until the broader framework is adopted, and there’s no clear evidence it will be after the London meeting. Klann said the meeting set a “concerning precedent” that “intense geopolitical pressure of a very small group of governments” can undo so much multilateral work on behalf of the climate.

If substantive changes to the text of the framework are adopted in October 2026, the earliest it could be adopted would be April 2027, as a six-month circulation period is required, according to Evelyne Williams, a research associate at CGEP and co-author of the aforementioned analysis. She said the delay in adoption means stricter standards would now be needed in the framework in order to meet the IMO’s strategic goals set in 2023, which call for net-zero emissions “by or around” 2050.

“At this stage, however, the prospect of increased ambition looks vanishingly unlikely, if not faintly absurd,” Williams told Mongabay in an email.

Earlier this year, amid much fanfare, the world’s largest maritime nations agreed on the regulations, which would impose a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping. The next step of the process — adopting the regulations — during the International Maritime Organization meeting in London this week was widely expected to be a formality.

Instead, after much pressure from Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year and adjourn. In the interim, nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus.

The development underscored how the influence of Trump, who recently called climate change a “con job,” extends globally to policies aimed at combating climate change.

“Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The Trump administration was quick to celebrate

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the development as “another huge win” for Trump.

“Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive U.N. tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects,"" Rubio wrote on X. “Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Trump had urged countries to vote “No,” posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that “the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.” The U.S. had threatened to retaliate with tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies if nations supported it.

After vowing to fight any global tax on shipping emissions, Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half the countries agreed.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping, said in a post-meeting news conference that “geopolitics in the world right now makes it more difficult for us to make progress in certain topics.”

Nations falter in their efforts to save the planet

The decision, or lack thereof, in London is similar to what happened this summer with a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world. The negotiations fell apart, with the United States and Saudi Arabia opposing any limit on plastic production.

The world’s biggest climate summit, COP30, is in November in Belem, Brazil. Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to Belem and beyond is now more difficult.

“The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” Regenvanu said. “But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet.”

Shipping emissions grow

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Thomas Kazakos, the chamber's secretary-general, said they are disappointed because the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

The regulations, or “Net-Zero Framework,” would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

The IMO set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,” said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. ""The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

Ahead of today’s vote US President Trump had weighed into the debate expressing outrage over the planned global carbon pricing mechanism. The US has been pressurising smaller member states with tariffs, port fees, and blocking of vessels calling ports in the States if they supported framework.

According to social media reports Saudi Arabia sought a one-year delay by way of vote.

The IMO said that 57 countries voted in favour of a delay, 49 against a delay and 21 abstained. Eight member states were not present for the vote. “The extraordinary session of the Committee is adjourned for one year,” it said.

Speaking at media briefing after the close of the MEPC meeting and commenting on the delay in adoption of the NZF Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of the IMO said, “It’s [NZF] very much alive. The decision to taken today was to adjourn the extraordinary session that was convened to adopt the amendments for one year. And as was clarified by the chair that next week the intercessional working group will meet and they have a work plan that was discussed and agreed and will continue to move forward.”

Asked if it the delay would impact the IMO he said, “I don’t see it as blow to the organisation and I want to make that clear and there is a lot of work that comes out from IMO and I think we have demonstrated that for over 50 years.”

The Secretary General also acknowledged the wider geopolitical pressures that were at play during the meeting. “It wasn’t the normal meeting of IMO. But this is topic that transcends IMO, the geopolitics in the world right now makes it as well more challenging to make progress on certain topics but I will maintain that member states have the right to express their opinion, to negotiate among each other. I’m not here to qualify that, I’m here to continue to work with all of them.”

The original entry into force for the NZF would have been in March 2027 if the framework had been approved at the extraordinary meeting of the MEPC. This timeframe will now be reviewed.

The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) which has pushed for a carbon fund for a number of years expressed its disappointment at the delay.

Thomas A. Kazakos, ICS Secretary General, said: “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.

Independent tanker owner representative group Intertanko was more positive hoping the extra time could result in a better framework. Intertanko Managing Director Tim Wilkins said: “This gives us time to improve the single regulatory maritime framework to cut maritime emissions. Let’s use this opportunity to work collaboratively to tackle the ambiguities and concerns of the NZF raised by Intertanko Members.”

However it also noted that ""It is unclear what the path forward is since the positions are more polarised.""

The International Association of Ports and Harbours (IAPH), which supports the NZF said it was a major setback as the industry needs the legal certainty it would provide to make investments in decarbonisation. IAPH managing director Patrick Verhoeven commented:""Only IMO can provide such a framework. We don’t know what this adjournment will lead to, but we fear it will simply open the door for more national and regional measures, which will add to an already complex regulatory patchwork resulting in unintended consequences.”

The Global Maritime Forum which represents many of the companies and organisations that have been frontrunners in decarbonisation for shipping said the delay would make meeting the industry's emission targets more challenging.

“Today's adjournment is a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey. The adjournment for a full year creates serious challenges for meeting the timelines in the Net-Zero Framework agreed in April and will make delivery of the sector’s decarbonisation targets even more challenging.” Jesse Fahnestock, Director of Decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum.

Environmental pressure groups were also not surprisingly disappointed in the outcome.

Teresa Bui, Senior Climate Campaign Director, Pacific Environment, said: “Delaying the vote on the International Maritime Organization’s Net Zero Framework is frustrating and a betrayal of the world’s most vulnerable nations. We urge IMO member states to adopt the Framework as soon as possible.”

“By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping's contribution to climate breakdown”, said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at the IMO. “With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on Earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltfedea176382c95c5/68f25a90feb03f62d903d8d9/IMO-MEPC.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-17 15:56:07.227298

Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea.","A landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the US succeeded in ending the talks.

More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

But President Trump had called the plan a ""green scam"" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they had voted in favour.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a ""huge win"" for Trump.

But reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a ""plea"" for this not to be repeated.

In a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year.

The chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised.

The motion passed by just a handful of votes.

Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change"".

""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,"" he said.

The shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards.

Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : ""We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.""

""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,"" he added.

The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain.

The countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers.

Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings.

Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.

The deal was first agreed in April after ten years of negotiations and was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

The agreement had meant that from 2028 ship owners would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.

Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea. Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive.

""There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,"" Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment, told the BBC during the last IMO negotiations.

This means without intervention the International Maritime Organisation previously estimated that by 2050 emissions could grow by between 10% and 150%.

The meeting this week in London between nations had been to make the final approval and finalise the next steps. But since April the US has been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan which they are concerned could raise prices for goods for its consumers.

October’s IMO Extraordinary Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) was the talk of the shipping town. The main item on the agenda: formal adoption of the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, the content of which was agreed at the April MEPC meeting.

The postponement of the NZF decision means there is now greater uncertainty over how and when to invest in new vessels and fuels. The Framework would have made shipping the first and, so far, the only industry with binding emissions reductions – a huge feather in the maritime cap, and an even bigger win for the climate.

In the run up to the pivotal meeting, the clatter grew ever louder that the US would derail the agreement. In a joint statement released in mid-August, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy threatened to retaliate against countries that confirmed their support to the NZF at October’s meeting. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump railed against the deal on social media.

Their threat was justified as a form of protection for US citizens and businesses against an agreement that “is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans” and which would “conveniently benefit China”.

However, beneath the wider consensus on the need for decarbonisation and given the outcome of the meeting, significant anxieties persist on the next iteration of the Framework — particularly concerning market distortion and the transparent handling of the prospective net-zero fund.

In an intimate panel discussion at London International Shipping Week (LISW) last month [September 2025], IMO secretary general Arsenio Dominguez and Michael Parker, chairman of Citi's Global Shipping, Logistics and Offshore business, discussed some of the challenges of the NZF.

Inequalities debated

Parker opened the discussion by pressing the IMO Secretary General on potential structural inequalities within the proposed framework. He noted that “several industry voices have expressed concern that the lack of a comprehensive impact assessment on the Framework risks putting tramp shipping at a big disadvantage to liner shipping and similar sectors given issues around fuel availability and bunker infrastructure”.

Parker questioned whether this was a “fair criticism” and, crucially, if the IMO was prepared to move quickly to adjust the framework if distortions became obvious before the earliest planned review in 2030.

Dominguez defended the rigor of the IMO’s regulatory process, stressing that the adoption agreement was the result of exhaustive analysis. “We, if my memory serves me right, evaluated and assessed 20 different scenarios from the proposals that we had on the table before landing on the compromise approach,” Dominguez said. However, he readily acknowledged that concerns were widespread, listing issues ranging from the challenges of infrastructure and fuel availability to differing sector-specific impacts.

He continued that the framework specifically addressed those anxieties by incorporating review clauses and included additional impact assessments to take into account the impact on food security. This mechanism allows the organisation to monitor the sector’s evolution, particularly the “development, scaling and scalability of the different fuels that will allow us to decarbonise the sector”.

Dominguez was also unequivocal about the financial reality the industry must face. Decarbonisation, he warned, “Has a cost. I'll keep repeating that. It's not for free.” While shipping contributes approximately 3% of global emissions, he sees immediate action as necessary to retain industry leadership and pre-empt future challenges from other transport modes. The economic measures are therefore designed not just as a punitive cost, but as an investment engine, aimed at rewarding the early movers, as well as those that “focus immediately in using net zero and zero emission fuels or technologies”.

Critically, these funds are also earmarked for essential infrastructure, seafarer training, research, and development, with a specific focus on mitigating any negative impact on trade for Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries.

Financial mechanism concerns

The conversation at LISW also covered the transparency of the financial mechanisms of the framework — specifically the widely speculated net-zero fund that will accumulate revenues from the economic measures. Parker raised a sharp point of industry scepticism, asking if Dominguez was “confident” that the structure and distribution mechanisms will be transparent enough to ensure that real investment in the industry's decarbonisation takes place to “prevent governments simply seeing this as a general revenue pot to share out for other reasons?”

In response, Dominguez acknowledged that concerns over fund misuse were not new and had been “aired and discussed throughout the whole development of these measures”. He said that while he could not provide specific revenue distribution answers ahead of the regulatory adoption, the intention was clear: “I don't want people to perceive this as IMO just becoming a bank. That's not the intention.

“This is clearly to support the transition in the decarbonisation of the sector, and we will be fully transparent.”

To guarantee integrity, Dominguez confirmed that the oversight framework is robust. He highlighted that a board will oversee the work of administrations that the organisation will take on board. “It's all fully audited.”

He concluded with a call for faith in the organisation’s enhanced governance, asserting that the IMO has demonstrated a commitment to transparency and communication. “We are all going in this process together, but keep the trust on the organisation, because we have demonstrated enhanced transparency, communications and engagement – these are the goals that I'll continue to uphold for IMO,” he said.

Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea.","A landmark deal to cut global shipping emissions has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the US succeeded in ending the talks.

More than 100 countries had gathered in London to approve a deal first agreed in April, which would have seen shipping become the world's first industry to adopt internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

But President Trump had called the plan a ""green scam"" and representatives of his administration had threatened countries with tariffs if they had voted in favour.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the outcome a ""huge win"" for Trump.

But reflecting the pressure countries faced, the Secretary General of the International Maritime Organisation Arsenio Dominguez issued a ""plea"" for this not to be repeated.

In a dramatic conclusion on Friday, when countries should have been voting to approve the deal, Saudi Arabia tabled a motion to adjourn the talks for a year.

The chairman said this would mean that the agreement was not approved, as key timelines for the treaty would have to be revised.

The motion passed by just a handful of votes.

Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said Saudi Arabia's motion was ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change"".

""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step,"" he said.

The shipping industry has been broadly supportive of the deal because it offered consistent global standards.

Speaking after the talks ended, Thomas Kazakos, secretary-general of the industry body the International Chamber of Shipping, said : ""We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting.""

""Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments,"" he added.

The UK and most EU nations voted to continue the talks, but some countries including Greece went against the EU bloc and voted to abstain.

The countries that voted in favour of adjourning the talks included Russia, Saudi Arabia and the US, who raised concerns that the deal would lead to price rises for consumers.

Some key countries including China that had initially voted to support the deal in April agreed to delay proceedings.

Island states Bahamas also changed their position and Antigua and Barbuda, who agreed in April, abstained. A delegate from the island states group told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and had been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.

The deal was first agreed in April after ten years of negotiations and was considered historic as it meant shipping was set to become the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

The agreement had meant that from 2028 ship owners would have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.

Shipping currently makes up 3% of global emissions, with levels increasing in line with global trade rises – 90% of goods are currently transported via the sea. Unlike other sectors shipping has been unable to reduce its emissions, in part due to the lack of cost incentive.

""There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,"" Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment, told the BBC during the last IMO negotiations.

This means without intervention the International Maritime Organisation previously estimated that by 2050 emissions could grow by between 10% and 150%.

The meeting this week in London between nations had been to make the final approval and finalise the next steps. But since April the US has been increasingly vocal about its objections to the plan which they are concerned could raise prices for goods for its consumers.

A fractious meeting of the International Maritime Organization in London ended Friday with a decision to adjourn for a year, after Saudi Arabia, backed by Russia, pushed for a pause.

That means the effort to set binding international rules to cut greenhouse gases from shipping — responsible for about 3 percent of global emissions — goes into the deep freeze for a year. During that time, the U.S. and other opponents can try to rally more support to kill it completely.

The move followed an extended pressure campaign from the United States marked by threats of tariffs and other economic penalties. It is also a huge setback for the European Union, which failed to push through the measure and even saw some of its member countries abstain.

“Commonsense prevailed,” a senior U.S. State Department official said in an email. “The Trump Administration will not stand for the UN or any organization forcing American taxpayers to foot the bill for their environmental pet projects.”

European Commission Executive Vice President Teresa Ribera called the delay “a huge shame,” in a social media post. The EU and Brazil had been publicly backing the move ahead of COP30 global climate talks next month, hosted by Brazil.

The proposal up for approval at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates global shipping, was meant to incentivize countries to shift toward using cleaner fuels in a bid to zero out carbon emissions from shipping by 2050. It would have increased the financial burden on polluting ships over time. Fees collected would go to help fund the shift to greener fuels and support developing countries.

The White House had objected for months, with Trump himself weighing in on Thursday in a post on Truth Social that he was “outraged” by the effort. “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he said.

It comes as the United States grows increasingly hostile in its approach to climate measures, with Trump calling climate change a “con job” and urging other countries to drop efforts to invest in renewable energy.

There had been “relentless pressure” from the U.S. for countries to back its position, said Vanuatu Climate Minister Ralph Regenvanu. “There’s bullshit going on,” the Pacific Island nation minister said during a coffee break before the final vote.

Shifting votes

The motion to adjourn on Friday passed by just four votes, after several countries that had previously backed the measure, including EU members Greece and Cyprus, chose to abstain.

“The net zero framework relies on fuels and technologies that aren’t available at scale, and introduces sharp penalties for not using them, which would inflate costs as companies chase limited supplies,” said a Greek official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Greece hosts some of the world’s leading shipping companies.

Representatives from Cyprus declined to comment on their vote.

The delay dismayed countries backing an effort to cut emissions from a sector that is seeing fast growth.

“They killed [the agreement]. The lack of leadership from the EU makes my blood boil,” said one person with knowledge of the discussions, also granted anonymity to speak candidly.

However, the move garnered support from major fossil fuels producers, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, which traditionally push back against climate measures aimed at cutting the use of oil, gas and coal. Major shipping countries and several with large flag registries, including Singapore and Liberia, also objected.

Others shifted positions.

China, the world’s biggest ship builder, switched from supporting the measure in April, to voting to delay it on Friday.

The clash highlighted the differences between countries worried about the measure’s economic impact against those fearing the consequences of global warming.

A Saudi delegate, who could not be named due to the IMO’s restrictions on reporting, accused backers of the carbon price of sowing global division. “We have differences because we are all looking out for our citizens, our futures … and our economies,” he said.

But Emma Fenton, senior diplomacy director at Opportunity Green, an NGO, called the outcome “a devastating indictment of member states’ lack of courage to stand in solidarity with climate-vulnerable countries to achieve a just and equitable maritime transition.”

A European Commission spokesperson called the delay “regrettable” and stressed the EU’s commitment to an “ambitious, science-based global framework” to put international shipping on track for net-zero emissions by 2050.

The spokesperson added that Europe “remains an open and reliable partner” and is ready to resume talks “under IMO leadership when appropriate.”

The International Chamber of Shipping, a global trade association representing more than 80 percent of the world’s merchant fleet, said it was disappointed with the outcome.

“Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector,” Thomas A. Kazakos, the chamber’s secretary-general, said in a statement. “As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organization to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry.”

Part of the shipping industry is worried that if the IMO effort fails, the result could be a patchwork of national and regional measures that will be expensive and confusing for the sector.

Alison Shaw, IMO manager at green NGO Transport & Environment, said the delay will create further uncertainty for the shipping industry. But this week’s proceedings nevertheless showed “a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying.”

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, however, applauded Trump for resisting a measure it dubbed “misguided.”

“A unilateral global tax of this nature risks distorting markets and discouraging investment in cleaner shipping technologies,” Marty Durbin, president of the chamber’s Global Energy Institute said in a statement. He also took issue with the way the measure advanced, calling it a “rushed and opaque process” that many member countries did not affirmatively support.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/e6/5e/48d2f56d45f68b38b11265bf36c4/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/2240371430,N,,2025-10-17 14:56:22.286255

In April 2025, governments provisionally agreed the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF), which would penalise high-emitting ships around the world and use the money to fund the transition to cleaner vessels and fuels.

An extraordinary set of talks was called in London this week where the plan was for the new system to be formally adopted. But, after a bad-tempered four days of discussions, governments voted narrowly for a Saudi Arabian proposal to postpone the decision for a year.

The NZF was scheduled to set emissions reduction targets for ships starting in 2028. But this – and the rest of the framework’s timeline – have now been plunged into doubt. Although some technical work can continue, political progress will have to wait until October 2026 when delegates will next take up the issue of whether to adopt the NZF.

‘Catastrophic’ for confidence

Ralph Regenvanu, minister of climate change for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, said the decision to delay the NZF is “unacceptable” given the urgency of accelerating climate change. He added that, according to a recent ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), climate action is not optional under international law.

“The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change. This makes the road to Bélem and beyond more difficult. But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet,” said Regenvanu.

Climate campaigners and researchers also lamented the delay. University College London shipping professor Tristan Smith said the decision was “catastrophic for confidence, and therefore also for the equitable and ambitious decarbonisation we need”.

“Those with the means must step up and lead more than ever, until this multilateral process can regain its composure,” he added. The European Union, for example, is implementing its own regulations similar to the NZF, called Fuel EU.

John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s representative at the IMO, said that “governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

The World Shipping Council, an international trade association, emphasised the importance of using the year ahead to clarify and develop the IMO Net-Zero Framework, adding that the IMO’s greenhouse gas strategy and the industry’s investment trajectory “remain aligned toward net-zero by 2050”.

“A globally agreed framework is needed to provide a level playing field to get there,” it added in a statement. “The liner industry is committed to the goal of net-zero by 2050 and has invested $150 billion in ships designed to run on green fuels.”

Momentum builds for strong adaptation outcome at COP30

Trump’s threats

Ahead of the meeting, the US government had threatened a series of measures targeting government officials who supported the NZF and threatening to make it difficult and expensive for those countries’ ships to call at US ports.

A joint statement by the US transport and foreign ministers said: “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

And on Thursday, President Donald Trump tried to intervene directly in the IMO process, urging countries to vote against what he called “this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping” and “a Green New Scam Bureaucracy”. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he suggested that the NZF would lead to higher prices for American consumers, adding that the US “will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form”.

After the vote was postponed, Bob Ward from the Grantham Institute on Climate Change criticised “the bullying by the United States government” which he said “proves that the Trump administration is a threat to the well-being and prosperity of people across the globe.”

A week of procedural politics

Back in April, governments voted 63 to 16 in favour of the NZF – with several Pacific countries abstaining as they said it lacked ambition. But many of the nations that backed the NZF in April supported the postponement of talks this week.

They included major economies like China, India, Colombia and Kenya, but also many small nations reliant on their shipping registries such as Liberia, Bahamas, Panama and Saint Kitts and Nevis. Others – like New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Cyprus and Greece – abstained.

Those opposing the postponement were mainly European and Pacific countries as well as pro-climate action Latin American nations like Chile, Brazil and Mexico.

The four days of talks were marked by procedural wrangling, with the US and Saudi alliance trying to block the adoption of the agenda on the first day, and then attempting to amend the procedure for adopting the NZF on the second and third.

At the start of Friday – the last day of talks – Brazil’s negotiator proposed a vote on the NZF itself. Singapore then raised the prospect of voting for an adjournment of talks, before Saudi Arabia called for a vote on that plan.

The two sides debated for hours – first in the open meeting and then privately with the head of the IMO Arsenio Dominguez at the front of the room – which vote should be taken first.

After a break for lunch, the IMO decided to hold the postponement vote first. While 49 nations voted against, 57 voted to postpone the decision for a year, giving them the majority. Twenty-one countries abstained and eight were not present.

2030 target to cut emissions still in place

Brazil’s proposed vote on the NZF never took place and their lead negotiator politely declined to be interviewed by Climate Home News as he left the venue, after consolations from negotiators on his side of the debate.

While its adoption has been delayed, technical work on the NZF will continue, starting next week.

The Net-Zero Framework is the product of the IMO’s now decade-long attempt to institute a climate strategy.","The United Nations agency that governs global shipping has voted to delay the adoption of its landmark decarbonization strategy by one year, following intense opposition from the Trump administration.

The Friday decision by the International Maritime Organization in London casts uncertainty over the future of the Net-Zero Framework, which would have been the world’s first binding emissions target for an entire industry.

“Today’s delay in adopting the [framework] is a missed opportunity,” Natacha Stamatiou, who leads the Environmental Defense Fund’s global shipping work, said in a statement to Canary Media. ​“Every delay means that innovation will struggle to scale, inequities will deepen, and the transition to clean shipping will become harder and more costly.”

International shipping is responsible for about 3% of the world’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. Climate pollution from diesel-guzzling vessels — which haul virtually everything we buy and use — is projected to soar in the coming decades if nothing changes.

The Net-Zero Framework would require large ships to progressively reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible by 2050. The strategy, which leans on a carbon tax, would force ships to swap out dirty fuels with cleaner alternatives, such as e-methanol or green ammonia, and adopt other energy-saving technologies like wind-assisted propulsion.

The delayed vote puts that progress on ice — and represents a stunning reversal from where negotiations sat just a few weeks ago.

In April, over 60 countries in the IMO, including Brazil, China, and India, agreed to put the framework to a vote in October. In the months leading up to this week, diplomats, environmental groups, and even industry organizations said they expected relatively smooth sailing toward approval.

However, on Oct. 10, ahead of the negotiations, the Trump administration issued a statement forcefully opposing an international environmental agreement, claiming it ​“unduly or unfairly burdens the United States.” U.S. officials also began calling and writing to countries that supported the measure, threatening to impose tariffs, withdraw visa rights, and take other retaliatory measures, The Guardian reported on Wednesday.

On Friday, the final day of talks, the U.S., Singapore, Liberia, and Saudi Arabia all called on IMO to postpone adoption of the climate rules. The motion to delay was ultimately put forward by Singapore and called to a vote by Saudi Arabia. While 49 countries voted against the delay, 57 were in favor. Twenty-one nations abstained.

Without a clear framework in place, progress toward decarbonizing shipping will remain slow going. Efforts to kickstart alternative, lower-carbon fuels have emerged in recent years, but shipping companies and fuel producers have been hesitant to invest at a meaningful scale without a clear directive from the IMO.

Shipping companies, for their part, had said they welcomed the certainty that a global, finalized net-zero standard would provide — particularly as the European Union presses ahead with its own ship-emission rules. A coalition of major shipping industry groups said in an Oct. 9 statement that without an international strategy, a patchwork of separate regulations could bog down the industry in costs without advancing decarbonization.

“This delay unfortunately continues the business uncertainty that hampers investment for private sector actors that are ready and eager for this energy transition to accelerate,” said Ingrid Irigoyen, president and CEO of the Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance.

The Net-Zero Framework is the product of the IMO’s now decade-long attempt to institute a climate strategy.

While the details are still being sorted out, the basic idea behind the regulation is as follows: Every year, shipping companies must calculate their ​“GHG fuel intensity” — the emissions per unit of energy used, on a lifecycle basis — the results of which determine their next steps. Ships that don’t meet IMO’s fuel-intensity standards must buy ​“remedial units” to cover their compliance gap; the dirtiest ships must pay an additional penalty to IMO for every metric ton of CO2 above the established threshold.

Had the strategy passed, the global fuel standard and carbon-pricing mechanism would have taken effect in 2027, and ships would have needed to start reporting their GHG fuel intensity in 2028. That timeline will now be revised.

There’s no clear deadline yet for when the group will reconvene and conduct a final vote to officially adopt the framework. The IMO will hold a technical meeting to discuss the design of the framework next week.

But experts and advocates warned that there is no more time to delay.

“This is catastrophic for confidence, and therefore also for the equitable and ambitious decarbonisation we need,” Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at University College London, said in a statement. ​“We will now have to double-down on other means to drive shipping GHG reduction and energy transition. Climate science tells us that the challenge of decarbonisation does not go away, it gets harder.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2240325072.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=335cf771daf9c37e55601be13ba7ce29,N,,2025-10-17 17:56:29.175642

Using threats of sanctions and tariffs, and backed by Saudi Arabia and Russia, the Trump administration forced representatives of more than 100 countries to table the International Maritime Organization's Net-zero Framework, which would have set a mandatory marine fuel standard.

The draft framework, agreed to in April and aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cargo ships to net-zero by 2050, would have gone into effect in 2027 for all ocean going ships weighing more than 5,000 tons, according to the IMO.

IMO Net-zero Shipping Talks To Resume In 2026

IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee votes to adjourn discussions on the Net-Zero Framework for one year.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has agreed to adjourn the extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), which was convened this week (14 to 17 October 2025) to consider the adoption of draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the IMO Net-Zero Framework.

The extraordinary session will be reconvened in 12 months' time. In the interim, Member States will continue to work towards consensus on the IMO Net Zero Framework.

The Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships, scheduled to meet 20 to 24 October 2025, will go ahead to continue work on the guidelines for implementing the Net Zero Framework.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework was approved at the MEPC 83 session in April 2025, as a new Chapter 5 of the Draft Revised Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). It comprises a set of international regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with IMO's 2023 Strategy for Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships. It includes two key elements: a global fuel standard and global GHG emissions pricing mechanism.

Earlier this year, amid much fanfare, the world’s largest maritime nations agreed on the regulations, which would impose a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping. The next step of the process — adopting the regulations — during the International Maritime Organization meeting in London this week was widely expected to be a formality.

Instead, after much pressure from Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year and adjourn. In the interim, nations will continue to negotiate and work toward consensus.

The development underscored how the influence of Trump, who recently called climate change a “con job,” extends globally to policies aimed at combating climate change.

“Faced with pressure, too many governments chose political compromise over climate justice, and in doing so, abandoned the countries bearing the brunt of the climate crisis,” said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green.

The Trump administration was quick to celebrate

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio hailed the development as “another huge win” for Trump.

“Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive U.N. tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects,"" Rubio wrote on X. “Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Trump had urged countries to vote “No,” posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that “the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.” The U.S. had threatened to retaliate with tariffs, visa restrictions and port levies if nations supported it.

After vowing to fight any global tax on shipping emissions, Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half the countries agreed.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the IMO, the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping, said in a post-meeting news conference that “geopolitics in the world right now makes it more difficult for us to make progress in certain topics.”

Nations falter in their efforts to save the planet

The decision, or lack thereof, in London is similar to what happened this summer with a major treaty to end growing plastic pollution around the world. The negotiations fell apart, with the United States and Saudi Arabia opposing any limit on plastic production.

The world’s biggest climate summit, COP30, is in November in Belem, Brazil. Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the road to Belem and beyond is now more difficult.

“The IMO’s failure to adopt the framework this week marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” Regenvanu said. “But we know that we have international law on our side and will continue to fight for our people and the planet.”

Shipping emissions grow

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Thomas Kazakos, the chamber's secretary-general, said they are disappointed because the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances.

The regulations, or “Net-Zero Framework,” would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

The IMO set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,” said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. ""The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

It had been widely assumed the tax would be adopted during a summit in London at the International Maritime Organization, the UN-backed body that governs global shipping. But after four days of fraught negotiations, countries agreed to delay a vote on whether to approve it by 12 months.

The decision came after a vociferous US campaign, with President Donald Trump calling it a “scam tax” and the State Department threatening reprisals on countries supporting it.

Experts say the collapse of the talks marks not only a significant blow for attempts to clean up a heavily climate-polluting industry, undermining decades of negotiations, but also represents yet another failure of climate diplomacy.

IMO member states agreed in 2023 that the shipping industry would reach net zero emissions — removing as much planet-heating gas from the atmosphere as it emits — by around 2050.

One of the measures proposed as part of this was a tax on the industry’s climate pollution. The shipping industry would have paid the tax into a fund created by the IMO, to encourage emissions reductions and raise funds for climate action. IMO member nations approved the tax at a chaotic April meeting that the US abandoned part way through. The October talks were intended to formally adopt it.

While the tax was supported by members including the European Union, Brazil and small island states such as Vanuatu, oil-producing countries including the United States and Saudi Arabia opposed it strongly.

The Trump administration spent weeks calling on countries to reject the vote. The US will “not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” the State Department said in a statement this month.

It laid out a series of threats against countries that supported the tax including potentially blocking vessels from US ports, visa restrictions, increased fees and sanctions on “officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.”

In a post on Truth Social Thursday, Trump said he was “outraged” at the vote and that the US “would not stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax.”

After days of chaos and disagreement at the IMO talks, Singapore put forward a motion to delay the decision on Friday, which was called to a vote by Saudi Arabia.

A legally-binding carbon tax on shipping would have been a big deal. “It would have marked the first-ever — and legally binding — carbon tax. This explains why petro-states including the United States tried so hard to scuttle the framework,” said Christiaan De Beukelaer, a senior lecturer in culture and climate at the University of Melbourne.

A State Department official told CNN the vote demonstrates American leadership on the global stage: “Now we have a President who will always lead in putting America first and even worked to prevent consumers from around the world from paying higher prices as well.”

The global shipping industry is responsible for around 3% of global planet-heating pollution annually, a figure that could rise to 17% by 2050 if no action is taken, according to a 2018 European Parliament analysis.

The industry has tended to slip under the radar when it comes to climate action, in part because so much of its activity happens in international waters, making the question of accountability for its climate pollution more complex.

The failure to adopt the tax is a huge missed opportunity, experts say. “Every delay means that innovation will struggle to scale, inequities will deepen, and the transition to clean shipping will become harder and more costly,” said Natacha Stamatiou of the Environmental Defense Fund.

There are also fears about what it means for climate diplomacy. Other recent efforts to tackle the escalating climate crisis have either collapsed, such as attempts to negotiate the world’s first global plastics treaty, or failed to meet hopes, including last year’s COP29 climate conference in Azerbaijan, which ended in bitterness and a finance deal described by some developing countries as a “betrayal.”

Experts are concerned for what this might mean for ambition levels at the upcoming COP30 climate conference in Belém, Brazil, next month.

The failure of the IMO to adopt a carbon tax “marks a failure of this United Nations agency to act decisively on climate change,” said Ralph John Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate change minister. “This makes the road to Belém and beyond more difficult.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2193595049.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-17 18:56:19.123453

The IMO agreed to delay the planned adoption vote on the Net-Zero Framework for one year in a vote Friday due to delay tactics and procedural sabotage by the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia and other petrostates at this week’s negotiations. The motion to delay was put forward by Singapore and called to a vote by Saudi Arabia.

The IMO’s delay reveals the fragility of climate action when national politics clash with global regulation. For shipping—a sector that moves 90% of world trade and produces 3% of global emissions—the path to net zero just became longer and far more uncertain.

Heading into this week’s meeting, a clear majority of countries had supported the adoption of the Framework, which was agreed in principle in a vote in April. In April, 63 countries voted yes, including the EU27, Brazil, China, India, Canada, UK, Korea and Japan, versus a minority opposition from 16 oil-producing states.

In the lead up and throughout the meeting, the Trump Administration threatened retaliatory tariffs and sanctions, especially on developing and most climate-vulnerable states, if they support the Framework.

According to our sources, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia also tried to create a delay by proposing to change the IMO’s regular adoption process by consensus to an ‘explicit’ adoption process which would impose additional hurdles to enforce the Framework, especially for many developing countries.

Countries ultimately voted to delay adoption of the NZF at MEPC E.2 with 57 countries in favor of delay, 49 countries against the delay, and 21 abstentions.

The agreement would have had a positive effect on the price gap between fossil fuels and alternative fuels, essential for shipping’s energy transition.

As the world’s first, the mechanism would require ships to pay fees for non-compliance with gradually increasing carbon intensity targets, expected to generate up to $15 billion per year in finance from 2030. The original entry into force of the NZF was planned for March 2027. This timeline will now have to be reviewed.

Industry Reactions

Thomas A. Kazakos, ICS Secretary General, said: “We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy. As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry.”

Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonization at the Global Maritime Forum, called the adjournment “a disappointing setback for shipping, but not the end of this journey.”

“We encourage Member States that agreed on the framework in April to re-confirm their commitment to multilateralism and continue the urgent work of developing guidelines and adopting a regulatory framework that can deliver on the IMO’s unanimously agreed Greenhouse Gas Strategy,” Fahnestock added.

Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of Danish Shipping, said: “This is not what we came for. We came here to finally conclude a crucial climate agreement for international shipping. We from the Danish side have worked tirelessly towards this for a long time, so it’s a big disappointment.”

Steffensen added: “Much has happened in the world since 2023, when the framework for the strategy was adopted. Unfortunately, that means there have been all sorts of other agendas in the negotiation room besides climate. Geopolitical tensions and a new world order have made their way in – also at the IMO.”

International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) managing director Patrick Verhoeven described it as a major setback. “Shipping and ports need a global framework that provides them with legal certainty to make the necessary investments in decarbonisation. Only IMO can provide such a framework. We don’t know what this adjournment will lead to, but we fear it will simply open the door for more national and regional measures, which will add to an already complex regulatory patchwork resulting in unintended consequences.”

Perhaps the sharpest condemnation came from Pacific Island states and environmental groups, who called the delay a betrayal of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations.

Dr. Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at T&E, said: “The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying. The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonisation. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.”

Hon. Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change, Energy, Meteorology, Geohazards, Environment and Disaster Management for the Republic of Vanuatu, said: “We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework. While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step. We regret that IMO members followed Singapore’s initial proposal to delay the adoption of the framework by 12 months, which Saudi Arabia called to a vote. This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer at Seas At Risk, said: “Getting the Net-Zero Framework adopted in this MEPC ES.2, however imperfect, was fundamental for shipping to stay within reach of its own decarbonation targets. Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. With talk of unity versus division, no single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

U.S. Administration Declares Victory

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz tweeted: “This is another HUGE win for @POTUS. Thanks to his leadership, the United States prevented a massive UN tax hike on American consumers that would have funded progressive climate pet projects. Our country will continue to lead the way and put America FIRST.”

Secretary of State Marc Rubio echoed the same message, calling it “another HUGE win” and thanking the president’s leadership for preventing what he characterized as “a massive UN tax hike on American consumers.”

What Happens Next

This pause will push the adoption vote to the next session in October 2026, and it could risk the deal not coming into force until 2030, even if adopted in a year’s time.

The IMO is still set to meet again for technical discussions on 20-24 October, to discuss key policy details on design and implementation of the NZF, including green energy incentives and the revenue disbursement.

Some delegates believe that putting the talks on hold will give countries more time to find consensus on this flagship climate law. Others fear that the U.S. will further ramp up pressure on developing countries to oppose adoption at a later stage.

The agreement includes a requirement for the gradual reduction of the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuels ships use. Ships that emit more than allowed will have to pay, while the most energy-efficient vessels can earn and trade surplus units, as well as receive rewards for using green fuels. Emitting greenhouse gases will become more expensive and reducing them will pay off.

The NZF, as it stands, is the result of three years of discussions from national delegate countries and is the only global regulation for greenhouse gas reduction measures, which aims at avoiding patchworked national regulation.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMO-Sec-General-at-MEPC-ES-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:00:48.695280

The IMO’s economic measure aims to close the gap in pricing between hydrocarbon and low and zero carbon fuels. Such a measure would also assist funding very necessary investments in research and development to accelerate the energy transition of shipping as well as supporting the vital port infrastructure investments to guarantee the supply of those new fuels, particularly in developing countries, which will otherwise be marginalized.

“The adjournment of the IMO Net Zero Framework now spells uncertainty about the incentives that are needed for the uptake of new low and zero carbon fuels” concluded Patrick Verhoeven, “We continue to support a global economic measure as it will also provide vital funding for infrastructure investments in ports of developing countries, for them not to be left behind in the energy transition.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Closing-remarks-of-the-IMO-Marine-Environment-Protection-Committee-%28MEPC%29.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:56:45.049142

US officials were accused of “bullying” and “intimidation”, as nations met in London for what should have been the rubber-stamping of a decision made months ago to place a small levy on the greenhouse gases from global shipping.

Instead, after four days of intense wrangling, the US efforts appeared to pay off in a decisive vote late on Friday afternoon at the International Maritime Organisation headquarters in London.

A majority of countries present voted to put the plans for an emissions pricing mechanism on hold for a year. While this means the measure survives, and could still be imposed, it also gives the US and its allies – including Russia, Saudi Arabia and other petrostates – an opportunity to step up their pressure on other countries to ditch the charge.

Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO secretary general, said the outcome was not a cause for celebration. Taking aim at the fractious nature of the discussions, he chided delegates: “It is the time to really look back at how we have approached this meeting. My plea to you is not to repeat the way we have approached this meeting for future discussions.”

The measure, which would mean shipowners pay a small charge on the CO2 produced by their vessels and have incentives to seek cleaner fuels and upgrade their ships, was passed in a majority vote in April. But under the complex rules of the world’s shipping regulator, that vote had to be reaffirmed at a further meeting this week.

For months, the US – which walked out of the April talks – put pressure on other countries to reject the move. In the past fortnight, this was stepped up to what some countries said amounted to an unprecedented campaign against them.

The US threatened countries, and individual officials, with tariffs, penalties and visa revocations if they supported the pricing mechanism.

Dr Simon Bullock, a research fellow at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester, said: “Yet again, powerful fossil fuel states are successfully blocking global efforts to cooperate on climate change. This is not the result the industry wanted, nor one the world’s people can afford. Progressive shipping businesses and nations can still chart a course to a clean shipping future, but Mr Trump’s aggressive, destructive lobbying has their made their job much harder.”

Meanwhile, some petrostates including Saudi Arabia held out the offer of sweeteners to countries that voted against the plan, which has been several years in the making.

In the final tally, 57 countries voted favour of delay, with 49 countries against delaying, and 21 abstentions. In April, the measure had passed with the support of 63 member states and 16 countries against, though the US walked out and 24 countries abstained.

Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s climate minister, expressed the frustration of many small developing nations: “This is unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

After Friday’s vote, countries will have to reconvene in a year to consider the proposal again. The delay means uncertainty and confusion for companies involved in shipping and in the global trade in many key commodities.

John Maggs, of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “By delaying adoption of its net zero framework, the IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping’s contribution to climate breakdown. With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

Even if the measure is agreed next year, it will take years to come into force, as IMO rules mean it must be subject to a further period of technical assessment and review of how it can be implemented. That could mean a delay until near the end of this decade, at least.

Experts estimate the carbon levy as planned could raise $10bn a year, but to the disappointment of many small countries most of any potential revenues would remain within the shipping industry. Much of the money would be used to help companies upgrade their vessels and move to lower carbon fuels, and pay for modifications to ports, rather than be allocated to poor countries to help them cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, as many had hoped.

If it is eventually passed, the measure is not likely to place significant costs on imported goods, despite the concerns of some exporting countries.

Shipping represents about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, but that is forecast to rise to 10% by mid-century. The IMO has been working on various plans to reduce carbon from shipping for the last two decades, but progress has been slow.

The extraordinary scenes at the IMO, where discussions are normally staid and highly technical, bodes ill for further talks on ways to raise the revenues needed for poor countries to deal with the impacts of extreme weather, which will be continued at the Cop30 UN climate summit in Brazil next month.

Anaïs Rios, senior shipping policy officer at the green campaigning organisation Seas at Risk, said: “Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. No single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail, but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet does not have time to waste.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf90cc0d9c43a7420259c6ee8c74714f74e80733/457_0_4551_3640/master/4551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f3841056d8b21364e245225234d7a78",N,,2025-10-17 14:00:53.072111

The world’s shipping regulator postponed a decision on adopting a landmark charge on vessel emissions, a shock move that highlights the Trump administration’s efforts to disrupt international climate diplomacy.

The postponement marks a setback for multilateral environmental regulations ahead of next month’s COP30 climate summit in Brazil.

Countries gathered at the International Maritime Organization’s London headquarters this week to decide on whether to make ships start paying for the more than 1 billion tons of greenhouse gases they emit each year. On Oct. 17, they voted to push back that ballot for a year, following a proposal put forward by Saudi Arabia.

Industry insiders had previously expected the rules to pass, despite U.S. pressure. They’ve been years in the making, and would be the world’s first global, fixed charge on emissions for any industry. They would also pave the way for the end of oil as shipping’s dominant fuel and opened the door for cleaner alternatives like ammonia.

While the plan had clear international support back in April, that wavered this week as the U.S. dialed up pressure, threatening wide-ranging measures against those who backed the planned rules that President Donald Trump on Oct. 16 said he was “outraged” about.

The International Chamber of Shipping, representing over 80% of the world’s fleet, said it was disappointed with the result, and that uncertainty over the plan’s future threatens investments needed to make the sector cleaner.

U.S. Pressure

The decision’s delay demonstrates the effect that pressure from the Trump administration can have. The U.S. strongly opposed the ship emissions charges, calling them a “global carbon tax” on Americans and warning of “disastrous” economic impacts. It had urged other nations to reject the regulations from “an unaccountable UN organization,” saying some estimates had forecast shipping costs to jump as much as 10% or more.

The State Department had said it would consider measures such as port levies, visa restrictions, commercial penalties and sanctions on officials. It also previously mentioned tariffs as part of potential responses, though it became unclear if they remained on the table.

Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t adhere to the carbon tax “in any way, shape, or form,” and that he was “outraged” that the IMO was holding a vote.

“Stopping this disastrous vote is a massive win for the American people and countries around the world,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.

The U.S. also put pressure on the plans this week by asking for another step in adopting the charge if countries voted in favor of it — proposing nations explicitly opt in after the vote in a shift from a “tacit acceptance” process. That would effectively add a further hurdle for them coming into force.

There were signs of wavering this week. Bloomberg reported Oct. 16 that Athens, which had long been skeptical about the plan because of the impact on its maritime industry, was considering abstaining.

On Oct. 17, Singapore — previously a supporter of the plan — proposed that nations delay voting on the charge. That was backed by Saudi Arabia, which was already against the rule.

Climate Impact

The plan’s failure is another example of the challenges that international climate diplomacy and regulation face. The Trump administration has been dismantling its domestic climate policy and attempting to disrupt efforts to cut emissions globally. Companies have also ditched climate commitments over the past year as the reality of meeting ambitious time frames becomes clear and the marketing benefits of having green credentials fade.

Though Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, the withdrawal only takes formal effect in 2026. In practice, the U.S. will still be able to block efforts to reach consensus at the COP30 talks in November.

The maritime industry accounts for over four-fifths of the world’s trade and more than 1% of all emissions, and the carbon levy was a key part of the IMO’s push for international shipping to reach net zero by around mid-century.

That goal now looks more difficult to achieve.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” International Chamber of Shipping Secretary General Thomas Kazakos said in a statement. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.”",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-10/Shipping-ap-1200.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:01:02.609370

We now urge the public and industry to keep pushing for immediate action to cut emissions from global shipping.”","As a special meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (IMO, MEPC/ES.2) closes in London, the Clean Shipping Coalition (CSC) expressed its huge disappointment in the decision by member states to delay consideration of the adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for one year and called on member states to use the time to ensure the framework is strengthened and adopted next time round.

“By delaying adoption of its Net Zero Framework, IMO has today squandered an important opportunity to tackle global shipping's contribution to climate breakdown”, said John Maggs, the Clean Shipping Coalition’s Representative at the IMO. “With climate warming impacts being felt everywhere on Earth, kicking this decision down the road is simply evading reality. Governments serious about climate action must spend the next 12 months rallying every nation that supports the framework, convincing those who are on the fence, or opposing, that its adoption is the only sane way forward.”

”However, all is not lost - not by a long shot, as there is an immediate opportunity to slash GHG emissions from shipping, minimize fuel burn and the overall cost of the energy transition and that is to strengthen and make enforceable the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), the IMO’s cornerstone energy efficiency measure”, added Maggs. “There's no time to waste, at MEPC 84 April 2026 member states need to focus all their attention on transforming the CII into the energy efficiency powerhouse needed to quickly right this ship and put it back on route to being a climate solution.”

“While the Net-Zero Framework is far from perfect, adopting it would have been an important step to deliver on the IMOs commitment and send key signals to an industry that was not only asking for a global framework, but actively supported this deal”, said Maggs.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships, in line with its GHG Strategy. The NZF includes a global fuel standard (GFS), requiring ships “to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e., how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel's life cycle)”. It also includes a mechanism for setting prices on the GHG ships, to encourage the shipping industry to lower emissions as per the global fuel standard.

“Delay costs the climate — and coastal, Indigenous Peoples and Arctic communities are already paying the price for inaction”, said Elissama Menezes, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes. “This week’s non-outcome should mean that states and the marine sector should double down on related efforts to reduce the impacts from the triple planetary crisis.”

“Implementing revised Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) targets to improve efficiency of the global fleet; investing in wind to promote its scaling up; agreeing to comprehensive well to wake LCA guidelines which ensure all methane based fuels aren't part of decarbonation pathways; and adopting mandatory measures in early 2026 at PPR13 to reduce black carbon from shipping emissions can all be moved on now to support the sector’s zero by 2050 ambitions”, she added.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of US bullying”, said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment. “The world cannot let intimidation and vested interests dictate the pace of climate action. Climate-ambitious countries must use this moment to build a strong majority in support of meaningful decarbonization. They will be the ones that benefit from the economy of tomorrow, not the geopolitical power games of the past.”

“Getting the Net-Zero Framework adopted in this MEPC ES.2, however imperfect, was fundamental for shipping to stay within reach of its own decarbonation targets”, said Anaïs Rios, Senior Shipping Policy Officer, Seas At Risk. “Emotions have run high this week at the IMO, with once high-ambitious alliances wavering and strategies eclipsing reason. With talk of unity versus division, no single flag should dictate the world’s climate course. With countries like Saudi Arabia leading efforts to delay, few expected a postponement to prevail but here we are. What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced. The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.""

“The adoption of the Net-Zero Framework would have marked a crucial first step toward reducing global shipping emissions and supporting vulnerable countries in the transition“, said Jenny Helle, Expert on Decarbonization of Aviation and Shipping at Carbon Market Watch. “Far from rushed, it represented years of negotiations, research, and collective effort. It was a clear and urgent demand from both the industry and the public. Yet, due to pressure from the Trump administration and major fossil fuel-producing countries, this opportunity for progress was lost.

The world’s largest maritime nations had been deliberating on adopting regulations to move the shipping industry away from fossil fuels to slash emissions. But U.S. President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia and other countries vowed to fight any global tax on shipping emissions.

The U.S. had threatened to retaliate if nations support it. Trump urged countries to vote ""No"" at the International Maritime Organization headquarters in London, posting on his social media platform Truth Social on Thursday that ""the United States will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.""

The IMO is the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping.

Saudi Arabia called for a vote to adjourn the meeting for a year. More than half of the countries agreed.

“Now you have one year, you will continue to work on several aspects of these amendments,” Arsenio Dominguez, secretary general of the International Maritime Organization, said in his closing remarks. “You have one year to negotiate and talk and come to consensus.”

Ralph Regenvanu, minister for climate change for the Pacific Island nation of Vanuatu, said the decision is unacceptable, “given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change.”

If the green shipping regulations were adopted, it would have been the first time a global fee was imposed on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

“The delay leaves the shipping sector drifting in uncertainty. But this week has also shown that there is a clear desire to clean up the shipping industry, even in the face of U.S. bullying,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based environmental nongovernmental organization.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of the global total as trade has grown and vessels use immense amounts of fossil fuels to transport cargo over long distances. In April, IMO member states agreed on the contents of the regulatory framework, with the aim of adopting the ""Net-Zero Framework"" at this London meeting.

Adopting the regulations was meant to demonstrate how effective multilateral cooperation can deliver real progress on global climate goals, said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green. Delaying the process risks undermining the framework's ambitions, they added.

The regulations would set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from using shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose fees for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits, in what is effectively the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions.

The IMO, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and has committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely.

“What matters now is that countries rise up and come back to the IMO with a louder and more confident yes vote that cannot be silenced,” said Anaïs Rios, shipping policy officer for Seas At Risk. ""The planet and the future of shipping does not have time to waste.”

The motion, tabled by Singapore and brought to a vote by Saudi Arabia, passed on the final day of the Marine Environment Protection Committee’s second extraordinary session (MEPC/ES.2), held from 14 to 17 October 2025 in London.

The outcome was close enough to raise eyebrows across boardrooms and bridge decks .

Votes were: Yes 57, No 49, Abstention 21, with 8 not present. A simple majority of 54 was required.

The extraordinary session is now adjourned for 12 months, with the Secretariat tasked to reconvene in a year.

In his closing remarks, IMO SG Arsenio Dominguez said: ""I always look for the silver linings in things. Even though you have difference of opinions you all spoke in support of the work of this organization. I will ask you to reflect on this session. The outcome is your decision.

""This was not the normal IMO meeting and I know that it is a sensitive topic for many and important topic for all. The reason why I ask you not to clap is because there are no winners and losers in this session.

At stake is a framework that would bite from 2028 and apply to ships over 5,000 gross tonnes.

The NZF sets binding targets to cut the carbon intensity of marine fuels and establishes a market mechanism of credits and penalties. Ships that overshoot emission limits would have to buy “remedial units” while low-emission vessels can earn and trade surplus credits. The money would then flow into an IMO Net-Zero Fund intended to back clean-fuel adoption and support a just transition in developing countries.

According to the Global Strategic Communications Council, a clear majority of countries had been ready to sign off after an in-principle vote in April, when 63 backed the package - including the EU27, Brazil, China, India, Canada, the UK, Korea and Japan - against 16 opposed. This momentum faltered this week as geopolitical pressure rose and procedural tactics took centre stage.

In the run-up and throughout the meeting, the US hardened its line. Delegations from developing countries reported “bullying”, “unprecedented” and “undiplomatic” pressure on capitals, with threats of tariffs and sanctions if they supported the framework.

US President Donald Trump then went public, posting on Truth Social: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.”

The post escalated, casting the NZF as a Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping and warning that the US would not adhere “in any shape or form”. He also urged member states to “stand with the US and vote No” at Friday’s session.

Washington and Riyadh additionally sought to recast the IMO’s typical consensus-based adoption into a more “explicit” process that would add hurdles for implementation, particularly for developing economies. While that procedural change did not carry the day, the broader delay does much the same thing by buying time.

Whether that time enables consensus or simply intensifies lobbying is now the central question. Some delegations argue a pause could tighten technical guidance and shore up political support for a law of this scale. Others fear the US will use the window to increase pressure on vulnerable states and fracture the coalition that formed in April.

An 11 August submission from the US argued that the NZF would create a de facto global carbon tax, with inflationary knock-ons for consumers and that zero- and near-zero (ZNZ) fuels remain commercially scarce at scale. It said trajectories for the GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) metric risked penalising transitional fuels such as LNG and certain biofuels, despite their immediate emissions gains and investment already sunk by owners.

The paper also warned of “excessive” revenue accumulation in the Net-Zero Fund - “at least in the tens of billions of dollars” - without clear guardrails for management and disbursement, and called for guidelines that keep revenue tied tightly to reducing maritime emissions and easing transition costs rather than broader redistribution.

For supply chain leaders, the delay changes timelines but not direction.

The regulatory arc still bends toward carbon pricing and lifecycle fuel metrics. Procurement teams should assume Scope 3 exposure from ocean freight will face a rising carbon cost, even if the start date is uncertain.

Shippers with diversified fuel strategies and credible efficiency programmes will keep a trading advantage when credit markets arrive. Charterers should tighten clauses that allocate carbon price and performance risk. Ports and 3PLs investing in bunkering and berth-side readiness for methanol, ammonia and shore power have another year to align capex with likely rules.

When the MEPC reconvenes next year, the same fundamentals will be waiting; a fund to accelerate fuel transition and a sector that moves 80% of global trade trying to square climate ambition with affordability and energy security.

Whether the extra time delivers clarity or simply a bigger storm will depend on what happens in capitals - and in the boardroom - over the next 12 months.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a8d071cb8886f402373e42ffe603673b:82114c195dd894933ec919f9fd613576/what-is-international-maritime-organization-imo.webp.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:01:18.763254

The net-zero framework, provisionally approved in April of this year, would have set progressively tougher carbon intensity requirements for marine fuels from the years 2028 to 2035, having first come into force in March 2027. This week's delay may now mean that timeline has to be pushed back.

The delay is likely to mean the EU's measures to regulate shipping's GHG emissions at the regional level - the EU Emissions Trading System and the FuelEU Maritime regulation - remain in place in their current form for longer, and take on greater prominence within the maritime decarbonisation debate.

Other similar regional systems from other parts of the world are also more likely to emerge if global efforts remain stymied over the long term.

The vote on the proposed Net Zero Framework (NZF) was tabled for Friday (17 October), but was pushed back 12 months after a motion was put forward by Singapore and Saudi Arabia.

It came after the countries, as well the US and Liberia, argued more time was needed to reach a consensus.

The US and Saudi Arabia, in particular, have opposed the idea of a global carbon levy, describing it as an unfair green tax. President Donald Trump has called it a “global green new scam tax on shipping.”

President Trump wrote on Truth Social, “We will not tolerate increased prices on American customers or the creation of a green new scam bureaucracy to spend your money on their green dreams.”

In total, 57 countries voted in favour of the delay, while 49 opposed, with 21 abstentions.

The carbon levy forms a central part of the IMO’s proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF), applying to ships above 5,000 tonnes from 2028, in a sector that accounts for nearly 3% of global CO2 emissions.

The measure is designed to impose a fee based on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted and to reward vessels that use cleaner fuels by reducing or exempting their payments.

First approved in draft form in April 2025, revenues from the levy would feed an IMO Net Zero Fund to support green fuels, infrastructure, and equitable transition, particularly in developing nations.

The EU, UK, and a bloc of Pacific Island states have backed the measure, calling it a vital step toward decarbonising shipping and a clear market signal for low-carbon fuel investment.

However, some opponents suggest the compliance costs could fall disproportionately on smaller flag states, shipping operators, and consumers.

They’ve also warned that the new levy might collide with or undermine existing regional schemes like the EU’s FuelEU Maritime and Emissions Trading System.

Media reports said the U.S. and Saudi Arabia had filibustered the meeting in an effort to defeat a vote.

While the delay avoids putting the emissions plan at risk, some experts say it’s needed to guide development of the global maritime sector. Shipping accounts for about 3% of GHG emissions which scientists say contribute to climate change, on a par with aviation.

“Without a predictable and preferably multilateral framework in maritime transport, I am afraid that investors (ships, ports, energy, bunkering) would delay investments,” wrote Jan Hoffman, lead maritime analyst for the World Bank, in a LinkedIn post. “This, in turn, would lead to less supply of maritime transport capacity. And this would lead to higher and more volatile freight rates.

“We learned from Covid and the Red Sea crisis how lower shipping supply can lead to a shift of the supply curve to the left, causing more volatile and higher freight rates.”

The IMO agreed to delay the planned adoption of the Net-Zero Framework for one year in a vote during the last day of Marine Environment Protection Committee, 2nd extraordinary session MEPC/ES.2 (14 to 17 October 2025). The motion to delay was put forward by Singapore and called to a vote by Saudi Arabia.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework sets binding targets for ships over 5,000 gross tons to cut the carbon intensity of their fuels, starting in 2028, and introduces an economic system of credits and penalties: ships that exceed emission limits must buy “remedial units,” while low-emission ships can earn and trade surplus credits. Revenues go into an IMO Net-Zero Fund to support clean-fuel adoption and help developing countries transition.

According to the Global Strategic Communications Council (GSCC), a clear majority of countries at the MEPC E.2 supported the adoption of the Framework, which was agreed in principle in a vote in April. In April, 63 countries voted yes (including the EU27, Brazil, China, India, Canada, UK, Korea and Japan) versus a minority opposition from 16 states.

In the lead up and throughout the meeting, the Trump Administration threatened retaliatory tariffs and sanctions, especially on developing and most climate-vulnerable states, if they support the Framework. Delegates from many developing countries described this extraordinary pressure on their capitals as “bullying”, “unprecedented”, and “undiplomatic”.

The US and Saudi Arabia also tried to create a delay by proposing to change the IMO’s regular adoption process by consensus to an ‘explicit’ adoption process which would impose additional hurdles to enforce the Framework, especially for many developing countries.

Some delegates reportedly believe that putting the talks on hold will give countries more time to find consensus on this flagship climate law. Others fear that the US will further ramp up pressure on developing countries to oppose adoption at a later stage.

Countries voted to delay adoption of the NZF at MEPC E.2 with the following votes:

57 countries in favour of delay

49 countries against the delay

21 abstentions

The IMO is still set to meet again for technical discussions (ISWG-GHG-20) on 20-24 October, to discuss key policy details on design and implementation of the NZF, including green energy incentives and the revenue disbursement.

The original entry into force of the NZF was planned for March 2027. This timeline will now have to be reviewed.

Industry reactions

We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting. Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy. As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry

… said Thomas A. Kazakos, ICS Secretary General.

Hon. John Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change, Energy, Meteorology, Geohazards, Environment and Disaster Management for the Republic of Vanuatu, criticised the IMO’s lack of ambition, noting that Vanuatu’s support for the Net-Zero Framework was reluctant. He condemned the 12-month delay pushed by Singapore and Saudi Arabia as unacceptable amid accelerating climate change. Regenvanu stressed that the IMO’s failure to act decisively represents a setback for global climate action but reaffirmed Vanuatu’s determination to fight for its people and planet through international law.

Alisa Kreynes, Director for Ports & Shipping at C40, lamented that the failure to reach an outcome was a missed opportunity to advance a just and equitable maritime transition. She highlighted that Small Island States and the Global South will continue to bear the greatest burden of inaction. Kreynes underscored that, despite this setback, cities remain at the forefront of equitable port decarbonisation and are driving inclusive, data-led, and locally rooted climate solutions.

Emma Fenton, Senior Diplomacy Director at Opportunity Green, warned that delaying the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework threatens to undermine its ambition and credibility. She urged states to act swiftly and demonstrate their commitment to a fair and equitable maritime transition by adopting the regulation without further delay.

Teresa Bui, Senior Climate Campaign Director, Pacific Environment, condemned the postponement as a betrayal of the world’s most vulnerable nations. She appealed to IMO member states to move quickly to adopt the Framework, stressing that the world is watching and expecting concrete reductions in emissions, pollution, and climate harm.

Natacha Stamatiou, IMO GHG Lead, Global Shipping, Environmental Defense Fund, cautioned that delaying adoption represents a serious setback that risks derailing the IMO’s 2023 Strategy timeline. She emphasised that each delay deepens inequities, increases costs, and slows innovation. Stamatiou called on governments to work together to deliver a just, ambitious, and effective transition to clean shipping.

Nations at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) meeting in London are set to vote today to formally adopt the Net-Zero Framework (NZF) to cut shipping emissions, but questions are mounting over policy uncertainty and U.S.-led opposition.

Majority backs NZF, but U.S. pushes back

Despite the United States’ threats of retaliation against nations supporting the Net-Zero Framework (NZF), a majority voiced support during the opening session, including China, Brazil, and the European Union.

The NZF proposes a global carbon-pricing system under which high-emission vessels would face penalties, while revenues would reward cleaner ships. Unless opposed by one-third of countries or by nations representing half of the world’s tonnage, the framework will take effect on April 1, 2027.

However, the U.S. is sailing against the tide. The smooth adoption process depends on retaining the original “tacit acceptance” procedure, but Washington has proposed switching to “explicit acceptance,” which would require written approval from two-thirds of member states for the NZF to be adopted. The World Shipping Council warned that such a time-consuming process could delay implementation by years or even decades. Nations are also set to vote on the acceptance procedure today.

Supporters call for stronger investment signal

As the policy debate unfolds, industry players are split over the framework’s ambition and investment signals. Seven major shipping associations, including the Japanese Shipowners’ Association and the Singapore Shipping Association, have urged adoption of the NZF, stressing that binding global regulation is essential to achieving climate-neutral shipping by 2050.

“Without the framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonization,” said in the joint statement. The framework would be the strongest signal for investors and producers to scale up the production of alternative fuels, said Anne H. Steffensen, CEO of Danish Shipping.

E-fuel producers argue that the framework still falls short of providing a strong investment signal. Lacking targeted incentives, e-fuels remain at a disadvantage to LNG and biofuels, making large-scale deployment unlikely.

Globally, plans call for about 73 million tonnes of green hydrogen production per year by 2030, but only around 13% of that output is backed by offtake agreements. Without stronger policy signals, many projects may never reach Final Investment Decision (FID) or move into operation.

“E-fuel producers need policy certainty to get green shipping fuels off the ground. Shipping could become a major offtaker for hundreds of projects worldwide, but only under the right rules,” said Alison Shaw, IMO Manager at T&E.

Expert reveals NZF flaws

The current framework not only needs stronger incentives but also risks drifting off course due to its flawed design for setting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets, according to an analysis by Carbon Market Watch.

The NZF sets yearly targets to cut the GHG intensity of fuels, meaning ships must emit less GHG for every unit of energy used. Similar to the EU’s FuelEU Regulation, the system uses fixed reduction factors and applies penalties if ships fail to meet them.

The targets are set from 2028 to 2035 and become stricter over time, with an additional goal for 2040. However, the plan does not yet include a pathway to 2050, when global shipping is expected to reach carbon neutrality. Because the NZF only limits fuel emissions intensity, total emissions could still increase as shipping activity expands.

Under the current scheme, less than 15% of total emissions would be priced through 2035. (Chart: Carbon Market Watch)

This design may not be enough to meet the IMO’s own climate goals, which call for at least a 20% cut in emissions by 2030 and 70% by 2040 compared with 2008 levels. To stay on track, the analysis says the IMO should tighten the reduction factors and accelerate emission cuts to align with its 2030 and 2040 targets. While the NZF provides a necessary starting point, the analysis concludes that there remains significant room for improvement.

IMO chief: NZF not perfect, but the best option

Amid opposition and growing dissatisfaction, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez reaffirmed that the NZF will provide the foundation for a transition toward net-zero emissions by 2050. He addressed calls for clearer regulations and targeted incentives, noting that “no specific fuel or technology has been excluded from the Net-Zero Framework as a compliance option,” while adding that further proposals will be discussed during the meeting.

At issue is a scheduled vote among the 176 countries that belong to the International Maritime Organization, an agency of the United Nations, to require cargo ships to lower their greenhouse gas emissions below a certain threshold or pay a fee. That proposal has the backing of the leading shipping lobby, and most of America’s most steadfast allies, including Britain, Canada, the European Union and Japan. China too supports the measure.

A vote is expected Friday.

The Trump administration has brought a raft of threats to dissuade countries from voting for the measure, including visa restrictions and additional fees on flagged ships from those countries landing at U.S. ports.

On Thursday President Trump said he was “outraged” that the organization was considering a carbon-emissions price on global shipping. “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form,” he wrote in a social media post.

In a joint statement issued last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the United States is considering antitrust investigations into countries that support the measure and “blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports.”

The statement referred to the proposed fee as a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations” and said that it would raise shipping costs.

The European Union then issued a two sentence statement of support for the tax proposal, saying it would “ensure a global level playing field.”

The conflict at the I.M.O. comes at a time when the high seas have become a high stakes battleground for American power. The president has upended global trade with a series of unpredictable tariffs. The U.S. and China are charging extra fees on each other’s ships docking at their ports.

Sam Hargreaves, a spokesman for Transport and Environment, an advocacy group that follows global shipping negotiations, said the Trump administration’s tariffs would have a far greater financial effect than emissions fees. “The additional costs to shipping companies and consumers they are concerned about are likely minimal compared to the potential impact of tariffs or other sanctions being threatened against supportive I.M.O. member states,” he said.

In response to a request for comment, the State Department pointed to the joint statement.

Traditional shipping fuel, also known as bunker fuel, is a heavy oil that produces carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide when burned. New kinds of fuels are being developed, including ammonia and hydrogen-based alternatives.

The proposed Net-Zero Framework, as it is called, would require cargo ships weighing 5,000 tons or more to pay a fee if their carbon dioxide emissions exceed a threshold level and in effect, reward ships that use cleaner fuels.

If passed, the levy would take effect in 2028 and would mark the first time an entire industry paid a price for its climate pollution. The proceeds would mostly be used to help the industry transition to less polluting fuels.

The World Shipping Council called it a “carefully balanced regulatory package.” Another industry lobby, the International Chamber of Shipping, backed the measure too. “Only global rules will decarbonize a global industry,” its statement read. It had earlier estimated that the carbon fee would have a negligible effect on the price of goods.

The threshold would grow more strict over time. It could allow the industry to switch to biofuels to meet the standards. That is a contentious approach, since biofuels are made from crops, and growing more crops to make fuel could contribute to deforestation. Many environmentalists said the targets fell short of their demands.

This week’s planned vote follows a 2023 agreement by the International Maritime Organization to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050. Last year, it offered a more concrete plan, which included an industrywide carbon price. In April this year, countries voted on a draft agreement.

In particular, it promotes crop-based biofuels, linked to deforestation and food insecurity and would exempt 85% of Europe’s shipping emissions from carbon pricing.
If the IMO framework were to override the EU’s own policies, such as FuelEU Maritime and the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the bloc could forfeit at least €10 billion in annual revenue, T&E notes.","With the outcome still uncertain, representatives are maintaining a strict silence. European delegates, in particular, are growing increasingly anxious as momentum appears to shift toward a joint opposition spearheaded by the United States and Saudi Arabia. On the third day of negotiations, hours were lost waiting for a drafting group to return with two competing versions of the draft text, according to the reports.

This is widely considered the most consequential vote in the IMO’s history, one that will chart the course of the global shipping sector for the next 2 decades. The current crisis was sparked by a recent move from the United States, which has urged other IMO member states to reject the NZF, reportedly threatening sanctions. In a social media post President Trump stated that the US “will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” and urging member states to “vote NO in London.”

To remind, on his opening remarks the IMO Sec-Gen admitted that the proposed framework may not be perfect, however it can provide a basis for further work.

Amid rising uncertainty, there are now even growing concerns that the vote could be postponed, though, as of now, nothing is confirmed.

According to Transport & Environment (T&E), capitulating to US demands would not only reverse years of progress but also surrender Europe’s decarbonization strategy and industrial sovereignty to foreign oil interests.

This is a shameless attempt to undermine Europe’s sovereignty. EU negotiators must not cave into efforts to torch vital climate measures that have been all the way through Europe’s elected Parliament. Europeans want strong climate action, to give in to the demands of the US and other petrostates would be a huge betrayal.

…said William Todts, Executive Director, T&E.

Additionally, the United Arab Emirates made a proposal which seeks to include a clause in the agreement binding all countries to recognize the IMO’s measures as the sole global framework. If accepted, this would effectively nullify regional regulations such as the EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime. Delegates debated whether this clause should be incorporated into the current session’s amendments to Annex VI of MARPOL or addressed in a separate future resolution.

However, while T&E acknowledges that the NZF would provide a global platform for action, it warns that the proposal is significantly weaker than existing EU legislation. In particular, it promotes crop-based biofuels, linked to deforestation and food insecurity and would exempt 85% of Europe’s shipping emissions from carbon pricing.

If the IMO framework were to override the EU’s own policies, such as FuelEU Maritime and the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the bloc could forfeit at least €10 billion in annual revenue, T&E notes.

Complicating the EU’s position is internal dissent: its three largest maritime nations of Greece, Cyprus and Malta are reportedly considering abstaining directly challenging the EU27’s voting approach.

While officials have declined to comment ahead of the vote, many reports indicate that unanimity is unlikely, a potentially unprecedented development for EU participation in IMO proceedings.

With the delegates split nearly down the middle, several officials warn that even if the framework passes, the slim majority could unravel in the months ahead. The process could still be derailed, if countries representing at least 50% of global shipping tonnage file written objections, a threshold that remains within reach given the growing resistance.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/54853114232_78089e5850_o-scaled-e1760690712731.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 10:56:37.799157

According to a person familiar with the matter, Athens now intends to withhold its vote on the proposal, which aims to impose levies on maritime emissions exceeding one billion tons annually. The shift underscores growing unease within the world’s second-largest shipowning nation about the potential economic fallout of the measure.

Greece had previously voted in favor of a draft version of the framework in April, but the government has since cooled on the plan, questioning its feasibility and cost implications for global carriers. “Athens has always been skeptical of the net-zero framework and its impact on the shipping industry,” the source said. The Greek government declined to comment publicly.

The vote comes as geopolitical tensions deepen over maritime decarbonization. While the European Union is urging member states to support the carbon levy, the United States remains firmly opposed. Washington has warned that it could retaliate with tariffs, visa restrictions, and port levies if the IMO proceeds. It has also proposed adding another procedural step before the charge could take effect—effectively delaying its implementation.

Greece’s decision to abstain would mark a break from the EU’s unified stance on climate leadership. The European Commission last week described the IMO’s net-zero plan as a “significant milestone” toward decarbonizing global shipping and ensuring fair competition.

Greek officials have reportedly conveyed their reservations to EU authorities in writing, citing concerns over the availability and cost of cleaner marine fuels. “The framework depends on technologies that aren’t yet viable at scale,” the source said. “It penalizes companies that can’t access alternative fuels, driving up costs as shipowners compete for limited supplies.”

The outcome of this week’s IMO vote remains uncertain, especially amid U.S. resistance and divergent views among major maritime nations. In April, the draft plan received broad international backing, but industry concerns over cost, compliance, and competitiveness have since intensified.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump declared that the U.S. “will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form.” He urged IMO member states to vote against the plan, arguing that it would damage American consumers and global supply chains.

The Net-Zero Framework seeks to introduce a carbon-pricing regime for international shipping, combining stricter marine fuel-intensity standards with a levy on carbon emissions.

Funds generated would be channelled into an IMO-managed facility to support low-carbon technologies, infrastructure, and transition assistance across the sector.

Senior U.S. officials, including Secretaries Marco Rubio, Chris Wright, and Sean Duffy, reinforced Trump’s stance, warning that the proposal could increase global shipping costs by up to 10 per cent.

They described the measure as an “unsanctioned global tax regime” that would unfairly penalise global trade and national economies.

The administration has also called for reform of the IMO’s voting procedures — urging a shift from the current “tacit acceptance” system to an “explicit acceptance” system.

Under the tacit acceptance approach, amendments or measures are automatically adopted unless a specified number of member states object within a given period. In contrast, the explicit acceptance system requires active approval by a majority of member states before any proposal can take effect.

Washington argues that the latter ensures greater accountability and prevents the automatic imposition of policies lacking broad consensus.

The United States is also considering a series of retaliatory measures against nations supporting the framework. These include higher port fees for their ships, visa restrictions for maritime personnel, increased scrutiny of flagged vessels, and trade penalties linked to government contracts and infrastructure projects.

Despite the U.S. opposition, the European Union has reaffirmed its support for the Net-Zero Framework, describing it as “a significant milestone” in the global effort to decarbonise shipping and ensure fair competition across markets.

If adopted, the framework would apply to vessels over 5,000 gross tonnes — covering about 85 per cent of global shipping emissions — and impose charges ranging from $100 to $380 per metric tonne of carbon dioxide emitted above agreed thresholds.

Revenues, projected at $10–12 billion annually, would be reinvested in green maritime innovation and infrastructure. The scheme could take effect in 2027.

Industry groups have urged governments to support the proposal, warning that without a unified global policy, the shipping industry risks facing a fragmented system of regional regulations that would raise costs and complicate compliance.

Shipping currently accounts for roughly 90 per cent of global trade and around 3 per cent of worldwide carbon emissions.

The global transition to renewable energy is gaining momentum through innovative transport solutions, as demonstrated by BYD's latest technological breakthrough.

The Chinese manufacturer has developed a hybrid vehicle that integrates biofuel compatibility, marking a new advancement in sustainable mobility.

Designed specifically for Brazil's unique energy landscape, it shows how manufacturers are adapting clean technology to regional renewable resources, creating solutions that could reshape the automotive industry's approach to decarbonisation.

30 examples of the SONG PRO COP30, a special edition vehicle, will be donated to the upcoming UN climate summit in Brazil, highlighting the potential for renewable energy integration in transport. The vehicle was unveiled at the official inauguration of BYD's final-assembly line in Camaçari, where production takes place.

Communities and businesses are confronting escalating disruption from severe weather, highlighting a need for greater energy resilience.

Data from NASA indicates a rise in the intensity of weather events in which floods, droughts and storms are becoming “more frequent, longer lasting and more severe"".

For energy systems, this trend could mean a greater risk of outages, damage to infrastructure and supply volatility.

Building adaptive and resilient networks is now critical for safeguarding economies and the path to net zero.

Philippe Arsonneau, SVP of the Infrastructure Segment at Schneider Electric, has been with Schneider Electric for almost two decades.

He explains that as the frequency, duration and intensity of extreme weather events become the norm, the implications for critical infrastructure and the power grid are profound.

""Electricity is the backbone of modern society, and increasingly of decarbonisation itself. But grid infrastructure in many countries is ageing, centralised and not designed to cope with the effects of climate-related events,"" Philippe says.

13 October

The international shipping industry, which facilitates approximately 80% of global trade, is at a crucial turning point.

According to the World Bank, it generates around 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, a figure that would make it the sixth-largest emitter if it were a country.

In response, industry leaders and regulators are navigating a complex path toward decarbonisation, with major implications for the global energy market.

At the COP28 climate conference, shipping chief executives united to call for a definitive end date for the construction of new vessels powered solely by fossil fuels.

They urged the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to establish the necessary regulatory environment to accelerate the transition to green fuels.

This call to action was followed by the approval of a landmark net-zero framework by the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) in April 2025, which is anticipated to be formally adopted in October 2025 and come into force by 2027.

The London-based IMO, which is the shipping body of the United Nations, voted in April for a global pricing system to help curb maritime carbon emissions.

Leading up to Friday’s decision — China, the European Union, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO — this week reaffirmed their support at a summit in the British capital.

However, Washington’s threat to impose sanctions on those supporting it has cast doubt on the future of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the first global carbon-pricing system.

“I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax,” US President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday.

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” he added.

The United States this week advocated changing the voting process to give more weight to abstentions, a proposal that will be considered early Friday.

Should the US proposal be accepted, it could derail adoption of the carbon-reduction plan.

The framework would require ships to progressively reduce carbon emissions from 2028, or face financial penalties.

Shipping accounts for nearly three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IMO.

Last week, the United States threatened countries who vote in favour of the framework with sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies, calling the proposal a “global carbon tax on the world”.

The Philippines, which provides the most seafarers of any country, and Caribbean islands focused on the cruise industry, would be particularly impacted by visa restrictions and sanctions.

In order to be adopted, the framework needs the backing of two-thirds of 108 voting IMO members who belong to a long-standing international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, known as MARPOL.

A majority of members — 63 states — that in April voted in favour of the NZF are expected to maintain their support and to be joined by others.

The plan would charge ships for emissions exceeding a certain threshold, with proceeds used to reward low-emission vessels and support countries vulnerable to climate change.

Several major oil producers — Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates — voted against the measure, and are expected to do so again this week, arguing it would harm the economy and food security.

Pacific Island states, which abstained in the initial vote over concerns the proposal was not ambitious enough, are now expected to support it.

If the global emissions pricing system was adopted, it would become difficult to evade, even for the United States.

IMO conventions allow signatories to inspect foreign ships during stopovers and even detain non-compliant vessels.

Since returning to power in January, Trump has reversed Washington’s course on climate change, denouncing it as a “scam” and encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation.

A formal vote on adoption is expected to take place today and requires a two-thirds majority of MARPOL contracting parties present and voting to be successful.

The US has led the opposition to the NZF, IMO’s proposed path to ensure shipping decarbonises by around 2050, with the government in Washington issuing threats of sanction to nations that vote in favour of the NZF. Countries backing the IMO’s decarbonisation plan could face port bans, visa restrictions on seafarers, and punitive vessel fees, the US has warned, while earlier this week, the American delegation, in partnership with Saudi Arabia and a number of other petrostates, has been working to create a procedural shift at the IMO that could delay or even block the NZF from entering into force.

“This isn’t just about process. It’s about power and political will,” commented Peter Jameson, managing director of Boston Consulting Group, in a post on LinkedIn.

Yesterday, the committee was unable to bring delegations together to proceed with its review of the finalised resolution for the formal adoption of the consolidated MARPOL Annex VI amendments including the NZF. Rising tensions over both content and sequencing of decisions to be taken led the exasperated chairman, Harry Conway of Liberia, to quip whether there was a doctor in the room and to agree to a request of the US to allow time for informal consultations.

This meant that the plenary session could not proceed in the afternoon with reviewing the report of the drafting group , which had worked late into the evening on Wednesday to complete its work. Unless positive solutions emerge this morning around which delegations can rally, the renowned IMO spirit of cooperation is in grave danger of faltering and scuppering any hope for the entry into force of the NZF on the target date of March 1, 2027.

A formal vote on adoption is expected to take place today and requires a two-thirds majority of MARPOL contracting parties present and voting to be successful. Even if it does succeed, any number of abstentions from the vote would not be good for the IMO’s credibility. The European Union voting as a united bloc now appears unlikely, with sources telling Splash that Greece, Cyprus and Malta are likely to abstain.

“I can’t recall witnessing an IMO meeting with so much in flux on such a large scale,” said one source at the IMO with decades of experience of attending meetings at the United Nations body.

A proposal by the United Arab Emirates to include an operative paragraph in the draft MEPC resolution asserting that the IMO’s NZF “is the only global maritime mid-term measure for international shipping so as to avoid a possible patchwork of duplicative State or regional measure” could help limit the damage.

An extensive work plan to prepare for entry into force could also not be reviewed yesterday. It had been drafted by the secretariat prior to the meeting and was further developed by a working group, which identified 14 major work streams. These include inter alia the development of implementation guidelines on issues such as the greenhouse gas fuel intensity (GFI) and GFI compliance approaches; zero or near-zero greenhouse gas emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources; further development of the IMO Life Cycle Assessment Framework for fuels; the pricing mechanism for the GFI reporting periods starting 2031 and onwards; promotion of technical cooperation and transfer of technology; and food security.

A proposal by Egypt to establish a new IMO sub-committee to deal with the workload related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions received broad support on Thursday morning.

In the event that the framework does pass today, a technical group is scheduled to meet October 20-24 to finalise guidance on fuel definitions, revenue spending, and compliance rules ahead of the 2027 implementation timeline.

He went on to say, “We will not tolerate increased prices on American Consumers OR, the creation of a Green New Scam Bureaucracy to spend YOUR money on their Green dreams. Stand with the United States, and vote NO in London tomorrow!”

Marco Rubio rejects IMO carbon tax

Trump’s remarks on the issue followed shortly after US State Secretary Marco Rubio said the day before that the current administration would not stand by UN’s decision to tax American citizens and companies. He further contended that the carbon tax “will be a hard NO” for the country under the MAGA leader’s government. Rubio also went on to urge other nations to “stand alongside the US in defence of our citizens and sovereignty.”

US government stands against UN’s global carbon tax

About a week ago, the US State Department issued an official media note titled, “Taking Action to Defend America from the UN’s First Global Carbon Tax – the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) “Net-Zero Framework” (NZF).” It included a joint statement by Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

Rejecting the proposal, the spokesperson’s office noted that the economic impacts of the decision could be disastrous, as some estimates had already predicted that it would global shipping costs as much as 10% or even more. Deeming it a risk to the global economy, the government statement added, “President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.”

Moreover, the US officials also hit out against any country that would support the global carbon tax, pushing out major threats like imposing visa restrictions, fee hikes, imposing commercial penalties, raising additional port fees on ships tied to the said country, and much more.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations. We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZ,” the statement read.",https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/10/Trump-on-Venezuela_20251017020604.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 02:56:10.417504

Leading up to Friday's decision -- China, the European Union, Brazil, Britain and several other members of the IMO -- this week reaffirmed their support at a summit in the British capital.

However, Washington's threat to impose sanctions on those supporting it has cast doubt on the future of the Net Zero Framework (NZF), the first global carbon-pricing system.

""I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax,"" US President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform Thursday.

""The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,"" he added.

The United States this week advocated changing the voting process to give more weight to abstentions, a proposal that will be considered early Friday.

Should the US proposal be accepted, it could derail adoption of the carbon-reduction plan.

The framework would require ships to progressively reduce carbon emissions from 2028, or face financial penalties.

Shipping accounts for nearly three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the IMO.

Last week, the United States threatened countries who vote in favour of the framework with sanctions, visa restrictions and port levies, calling the proposal a ""global carbon tax on the world"".

The Philippines, which provides the most seafarers of any country, and Caribbean islands focused on the cruise industry, would be particularly impacted by visa restrictions and sanctions.

In order to be adopted, the framework needs the backing of two-thirds of 108 voting IMO members who belong to a long-standing international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships, known as MARPOL.

A majority of members -- 63 states -- that in April voted in favour of the NZF are expected to maintain their support and to be joined by others.

The plan would charge ships for emissions exceeding a certain threshold, with proceeds used to reward low-emission vessels and support countries vulnerable to climate change.

Several major oil producers -- Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates -- voted against the measure, and are expected to do so again this week, arguing it would harm the economy and food security.

Pacific Island states, which abstained in the initial vote over concerns the proposal was not ambitious enough, are now expected to support it.

If the global emissions pricing system was adopted, it would become difficult to evade, even for the United States.

IMO conventions allow signatories to inspect foreign ships during stopovers and even detain non-compliant vessels.

Since returning to power in January, Trump has reversed Washington's course on climate change, denouncing it as a ""scam"" and encouraging fossil fuel use by deregulation.

The Trump administration has lined up possible sanctions against countries that will sign the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework (NZF), which aims to reduce the negative environmental impact of the global shipping industry.

The IMO, a United Nations agency, is meeting this week, October 14-17, in a special session to consider the adoption of the NZF, which was approved by the Marine Environment Protection Committee in April this year.

READ: IMO approves net-zero rules for shipping

Under the framework, a global fuel intensity (GFI) standard will measure how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, which ocean vessels must reduce over a specified period. Ships that operate above the GFI will be required to pay for their excess emissions while those with zero or near-zero emission are qualified to claim financial compensation.

“The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists,” the US government under President Donald Trump said in a statement.

“The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more,” reads the statement signed jointly by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.

Among the actions being considered by the US are:

Regulations on flagged countries and blocking vessels registered in those countries from US ports;

Imposing visa restrictions and higher fees for maritime crew members;

Commercial penalties stemming from US government contracts and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF;

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the NZF; and

Sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the American officials said.

The International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA), an international trade association for the marine contracting industry, said in a news release that the Net Zero Fund will bring revenues of up to $15 billion.

“Among the key issues to be resolved is how the revenues collected will be distributed and according to what criteria,” IMCA said.

If adopted, the NZF will be incorporated as a new Chapter 5 in Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the MARPOL Convention), and will enter into force in March 2027 and take effect by January 2028.

At least 72 or two-thirds of the 108 signatories to MAPRPOL Annex VI is needed to adopt the NZF. IMCA said this represents at least 50% of the global gross tonnage.

A US-led coalition, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries, is pressuring the EU to abandon its shipping decarbonisation measures to secure support for a weaker IMO's Net-Zero Framework.

Giving in to US pressure would reverse years of European progress and hand control of the region's clean energy transition to foreign oil interests, Brussels-based environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E) said on Thursday.

The Net Zero Framework (NZF), currently being negotiated at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), is under attack from a US-led effort to block a global agreement that would put a modest price on shipping emissions. The US-led climate denialist grouping is now pushing for the EU to drop its own carbon pricing for shipping (ETS) and green fuels mandates as part of its FuelEU Maritime law.

While the NZF would be an important global platform for decarbonising shipping, it is far weaker than the EU’s already existing legislation, says T&E. It will lead to mass adoption of crop-based biofuels that have been associated with deforestation and food security concerns.

As delegates gathered at the IMO’s extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee, reports emerged that the vote on the NZF may be postponed. The delay is being considered amid sharp disagreements over procedural rules and mounting pressure from powerful states.

Lloyd’s List reports that Greece, Malta, and Cyprus are prepared to abstain if the vote proceeds — a sign that support from key Mediterranean ship-registry states is weakening.

At the same time, the U.S. has threatened retaliatory action against nations that back the framework, raising the specter that even if a vote is forced, Washington’s countermeasures could torpedo adoption.

Multiple drafting delays during Thursday’s sessions have added to the uncertainty, with delegates citing “high-level consultations” and doubts over the IMO’s mandate to enforce a global emissions pricing scheme.

Growing Skepticism

The abstention stance of Greece, Malta, and Cyprus underscores the growing skepticism among ship-registry and maritime service states, about the costs and governance of the framework.

In Cyprus, shipowners have openly called for rejecting the framework, arguing that it embeds a “multi-billion euro tax” without matching emissions benefits and threatens competitive disadvantages.

The hesitation among these states could prove pivotal: their abstentions (or “no” votes) could deny the two-thirds majority or required tonnage threshold, effectively blocking the NZF’s formal adoption.

Washington Threats

Washington’s pressure campaign has escalated sharply ahead of the vote. In a joint statement, U.S. Secretaries of State, Energy, and Transportation warned that countries endorsing the NZF might face visa restrictions, additional port fees, vessel bans, and sanctions on officials sponsoring the plan.

President Trump, via social media, denounced the proposal as a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping,” and urged other nations to join the U.S. in voting it down.

Observers warn that even if the NZF secures a majority vote, the threat of U.S. reprisals — particularly blocking vessels from U.S. ports — could render the framework ineffective in practice.

Groundbreaking Regulation

If adopted, the NZF would become the first global greenhouse-gas pricing and regulatory mechanism for shipping, applying to vessels over 5,000 gross tons, with revenues to flow into an IMO Net-Zero Fund and incentives for cleaner fuels.

But the combination of procedural maneuvers (such as calls to shift from tacit to explicit acceptance), abstentions by key registry states, and U.S. hostility poses a formidable barrier to passage.

Should the vote be postponed, supporters fear it would signal a weakening of IMO’s ability to steward a unified global approach — a risk that could fragment regulation across regions and delay investment in zero-carbon shipping.

If a vote is forced, its outcome may not be decisive — and even adoption might face implementation sabotage through U.S. countermeasures or disavowal by recalcitrant states.

The decision this week may not only determine whether the NZF passes, but whether the IMO retains authority as a venue for binding climate regulation in shipping.",https://zeta.creativecirclecdn.com/exportpractitioner/original/20251016-193143-4de-AdobeStock_550251249.jpeg,N,,2025-10-17 02:56:45.329354

The upcoming extraordinary session of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), scheduled for October 2025, will vote on adopting the landmark proposed Net-Zero Framework, introducing major regulatory controls for international shipping's carbon emissions.

This article explains how the upcoming IMO vote is expected to reshape the legal and commercial dynamics of maritime trade and present opportunities for clean fuel producers, particularly in light of Australia's $1.1bn Cleaner Fuels Program announced on 17 September 2025.

The IMO's net zero strategy for shipping

The IMO, a specialised agency of the United Nations, ensures the safety and security of international shipping and prevents marine and atmospheric pollution. Responding to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the IMO introduced the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships — commonly known as the MARPOL Convention.

Among other things, MARPOL sets international standards to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships (for our previous article on this topic click here).

In July 2023, the IMO adopted its updated Strategy on the Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships. The strategy outlines a pathway to net-zero emissions by or around 2050. In April 2025, members approved draft regulatory measures to implement the strategy (Net-Zero Framework), which include a new global fuel standard and an international carbon pricing mechanism for shipping.

What would the IMO vote approve?

The vote, now scheduled for 14-17 October, seeks to formally adopt the Net-Zero Framework. If adopted, the proposed amendments to MARPOL Annex VI will be circulated to all IMO Member States, initiating the next implementation phase. The following timeline is expected:

October 2025 (MEPC/ES.2): formal adoption of the amendments during an extraordinary session of the MEPC.

Spring 2026 (MEPC 84): approval of detailed implementation guidelines.

2027: enforcement begins, in line with the MARPOL procedure requiring a 16-month lead time from adoption.

Core features of the Net-Zero Framework

The Net-Zero Framework would apply to large ocean-going ships over 5,000 gross tonnage, which account for approximately 85% of international shipping's total carbon dioxide emissions. Its key goals include:

Improving energy efficiency in new ships and reducing carbon dioxide emissions per transport work by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 2008 levels. The benchmark used is 93.3g CO₂ equivalent per megajoule, which represents the average fuel intensity of a ship in 2008.

Ensuring that by 2030, at least 5% of energy used by ships comes from fuels with near-zero or zero GHG emissions.

Reaching peak emissions as soon as practicable and achieving net-zero by 2050.

Cutting total annual GHG emissions by 20-30% by 2030, and by 70-80% by 2040.

To support these targets, the MEPC has introduced progressive GHG reduction requirements for vessels starting in 2028.

Ships will be required to calculate their annual GHG fuel intensity over a 12-month period from 1 January to 31 December each year, using a ""well-to-wake"" methodology that accounts for emissions from fuel production through to its use.

This calculation is based on data collected in accordance with the relevant regulations and guidelines, must be reported after the end of each calendar year.

Tiered fuel intensity targets

The regulatory design introduces a two-tier target system for well-to-wake fuel emissions:

The Base Target (BT) reflects the minimum expected performance.

The Direct Compliance Target (DCT) sets a higher benchmark for full compliance.

Ships that meet the DCT are deemed fully compliant. Ships that only meet the BT fall into a Tier 1 compliance deficit, while ships that fall short of both targets are in a Tier 2 compliance deficit.

Vessels in deficit must purchase remedial units from the IMO Net-Zero Fund. During the initial compliance period (2028–2030), the price of a Tier 1 unit is set at US$100 per tonne of excess emissions, while Tier 2 units will cost US$380 per tonne. These prices may be revised after the first compliance period.

Below is the draft annual GHG emission reduction percentage per year for both BT and DCT.

Compliance tools

To enhance flexibility, the framework includes several tools to manage compliance.

Surplus units: Ships that exceed the DCT may generate surplus units. These units can be banked for future use or sold to other vessels.

Deficit rectification: Ships in Tier 1 or Tier 2 deficit may:

use their own banked surplus units;

purchase surplus units from other ships; or

acquire remedial units through contributions to the IMO Net-Zero Fund.

Incentives for zero and near-zero carbon fuels

The proposed amendments introduce financial incentives for ships using low-carbon or zero-carbon fuels, with specific emissions thresholds set well below the broader fuel intensity targets outlined in the IMO Net-Zero Framework. These thresholds are:

Until 31 December 2034, the qualifying threshold is 19g CO₂ eq / MJ.

From 1 January 2035, the threshold lowers to 14g CO₂ eq / MJ.

To put this in context, the IMO's emissions reduction targets are based on a 2008 baseline of 93g CO₂ eq / MJ. For example:

By 2030, a ship meeting the more stringent DCT of a 21% reduction would still emit approximately 74g CO₂ eq / MJ.

By comparison, the 19g CO₂ eq / MJ threshold for incentives represents a ~74% reduction from the DCT for that year.

This highlights the significant advantage offered to ships adopting zero or near-zero carbon fuels.

The IMO will finalise the rules for these incentives by March 2027, and review them every five years.

IMO Net-Zero Fund

A central plank of the framework is the creation of the IMO Net-Zero Fund. This fund will collect contributions from ships with compliance deficits and redistribute funds for:

reward high-performing, low-emission vessels;

support innovation, research, and decarbonisation infrastructure in developing countries;

provide funding for training, technology transfer, and capacity building aligned with the IMO GHG Strategy; and

mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable states, including Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries.

In effect, the new regime combines regulatory pressure with financial incentives – a carrot-and-stick approach – to drive meaningful decarbonisation in global shipping.

Enforcement regimes and key actors

The IMO creates and adopts regulations, but enforcement is carried out by Flag States, often in cooperation with regional groups, to ensure compliance and maintain fair competition. The enforcement regime for the Near-Zero Framework regulations includes:

Flag States: The country where a ship is registered (Flag State) is the primary enforcer. While they can delegate technical verification to recognised organisations (ROs), the Flag State remains ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with the Near-Zero Framework. Enforcement actions such as criminal prosecution, fines, or sanctions against crew or ship management, will depend on how individual member states implement and enforce the Near-Zero Framework.

Port State Control: When ships visit international ports, Port State Control authorities conduct checks to verify compliance with Near-Zero Framework regulations. These authorities may take enforcement actions against non-compliant vessels and their crew, potentially imposing additional charges or even detaining vessels if Statements of Compliance are not provided or regulatory penalties remain outstanding.

Member State Audits: The IMO audits countries to ensure they have the capacity and systems in place to enforce regulations.

Industry Pressure: Industry practices, such as charterparty clauses, vetting programs, and insurance requirements, also encourage compliance.

Fuel transition within Australia – commercial and legal implications

The IMO's proposed emissions scheme is both designed and expected to boost demand for low or zero-carbon fuels like ammonia and methanol, which the Australian Government's Net Zero Roadmap and Action Plan acknowledges as a key to decarbonising long-distance shipping, as well as other hard to abate sectors such as heavy freight, mining and aviation.

Following the legislative entry into force of the Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive (HPTI) as part of the Future Made in Australia framework) in April 2025, as well as the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative, on 17 September 2025 the Australian Government announced a further production incentive for low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF). While the design of the program is subject to a consultation process, consultation is to be completed this financial year, with eligibility criteria and program design to be completed to support a competitive public grants process.

In this context, the Australian Government should ensure that the Australian Guarantee of Origin (GO) scheme aligns with international standards and meets the maritime sector's requirements, as part of ensuring that Australia's HPTI and LCLF initiatives are aligned with international market requirements.

It also emphasises the need for the coordinated policy development in relation to fuel products that strikes an effective balance between agriculture, fuel security and climate outcomes. As the LCLF announcement notes, ""Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow"" that could be used in LCLF production, with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimating that an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050.

So will the vote get up?

The shipping industry faces a classic international cooperation challenge in its path to decarbonisation. As with postal, telecommunications and aviation services, an effective global fuel decarbonisation regime is a new application of the principle ""functional necessity"". In the consent-based jurisdiction of international law, unless all relevant nations participate jointly, any regime could be porous, hard to enforce and – ultimately – ineffective.

While the Australian Government is an active participant in the IMO process, achieving global consensus remains a significant hurdle. The United States has rejected support for the Net-Zero Framework, and has warned it may take actions against countries supporting them. The Norwegian classification society DNV has also criticised the IMO, accusing it of ""institutional romanticism"" and a lack of consideration of market realities.

Despite these challenges, industry is moving, with Lloyd's Register reporting more than 50% growth in alternative-fuelled ship orders in 2024. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) also remains optimistic: ""We remain confident that the net-zero framework will be adopted,"" it has stated, referencing IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez's recent statement in London that ""there is no Plan B.""

By acquiescing to this charge, Australia will hike the cost base for our trading companies, and ultimately, for consumers.
It’s a climate initiative so vague it could be a parody.","One such sleeper story: the world’s shipping regulator, the UN’s International Maritime Organization, is on the cusp of approving a global charge on industry emissions, dubbed the “Net-Zero framework”.

First floated in April, the new rules aim to hold the shipping sector accountable for its more than one billion tonnes of annual emissions.

The charge is expected to raise US$10 billion annually and hasten the end of oil as the industry’s dominant fuel.

And yes, shipping is emissions-heavy - moving hundreds of millions of tonnes of goods, oil, and ore around the globe requires serious grunt.

While the industry broadly expects the levy to pass, it’s made headlines this week thanks to the Trump administration’s threat of tariffs against countries voting for the initiative, branding it a global carbon tax.

You don’t need a PhD in economics to know the cost will be passed on, inflating prices for consumers.

But the real story lies beneath the surface.

A Wall Street Journal editorial this week exposed the underbelly mechanics of this global charge.

Here’s the kicker.

The IMO may regulate shipping, but it’s still a specialised UN agency.

That means the charge will be levied on shipping companies, administered by the UN, and funnelled into a UN-controlled fund.

The phrase “taxation without representation” should send a chill down any rational spine.

It’s hard enough to get domestic politicians to tax and spend sensibly – but expecting unelected, altitude-dwelling international bureaucrats to do so is a fairytale more absurd than kissing a frog and getting a prince.

Officially, the revenues will “reward low-emission ships”.

Whatever that means.

It’s so vague and saccharine that cash could be sprayed anywhere.

As the Wall Street Journal rightly notes, it’s a principle ripe for creative interpretation and jobs for the boys.

And it gets worse.

The IMO also plans to use the fund for “just-transition initiatives in developing countries” and to “mitigate negative impacts” of climate change on “vulnerable States.”

Cue alarm bells.

It’s now painfully clear that this net-zero initiative isn’t about the environment - it’s a wealth redistribution scheme from the developed world to the UN’s preferred enablers.

When this went to a vote in April, Australia abstained.

Classic Albanese fence-sitting.

The government didn’t want to be seen opposing a climate initiative, lest the Prime Minister be left off the invite list for parties hosted by the beautiful people.

Will they do the same again?

Probably.

If this week’s vote mirrors April’s, the measure will pass with the required two-thirds majority.

Perfect for the Albanese government: they can deny voting for it while basking in the glow of having enabled another ideologically driven climate initiative.

Here’s the practical reality for Australia:

We are a big island.

Far from anywhere.

We send things out…by ship.

We bring things in…by ship.

Lots and lots of things.

By acquiescing to this charge, Australia will hike the cost base for our trading companies, and ultimately, for consumers.

Our imports will cost more, including goods like building materials.

As if housing wasn’t already expensive enough.

The tragedy is that the Albanese government is ideologically welded to every climate trinket and trick, regardless of the damage it may cause to Australian industry or living standards.

This will be just another layer of cost borne by Australians, with the benefit padding pockets elsewhere.

And for what?

Warm fuzzies.

A slush fund run by unelected bureaucrats.

A price hike on every imported good.

It’s a climate initiative so vague it could be a parody.

Ultimately, this isn’t environmental policy - it’s economic self-harm dressed up as progress.

And Australia doesn’t need more climate theatre.

It needs leadership to be the bulwark against global vanity projects and clarity to defend our national interest.

Because representation matters.

Accountability matters.

And if we keep outsourcing both to international bodies with no skin in our game, we won’t just pay more – we’ll surrender our sovereignty.

As the maritime sector accelerates its transition towards sustainable energy solutions, nuclear power has re-emerged as a viable solution to achieve net-zero ambitions.

The guidance, developed in partnership with Global Nuclear Security Partners (GNSP) and marine insurer NorthStandard, sets out the practical steps project teams must take – outlining regulatory, technical, operational and financial requirements for integrating nuclear technology, such as small modular reactors (SMRs), into maritime assets.

With no international regulatory framework yet in place, the document discusses the roles of key bodies, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), highlighting the importance of harmonising maritime and nuclear standards.

Topics covered include safety classification, environmental impact assessments, structural integrity, and the development of a robust nuclear safety case. Security measures are also addressed, with emphasis on physical and cyber protection systems, as well as insider threat mitigation.

Operational and financial aspects are thoroughly explored, including personnel qualifications, emergency response planning, and quality assurance throughout the project lifecycle. The document also examines insurance and reinsurance challenges, advocating for a predictable liability framework to support commercial viability.

Mark Tipping, LR’s Global Power to X Director, said: “Nuclear energy has the potential to transform maritime, providing a scalable and zero-carbon energy source that can accelerate the industry’s energy transition. However, its adoption requires clarity, collaboration and trust across regulators, operators, insurers and wider society. This guidance offers a comprehensive starting point for stakeholders to navigate the risks and opportunities ahead.”

Nick Tomkinson, Senior Partner, Global Nuclear Security Partners, said: “Maritime nuclear will only succeed when safety, security and safeguards are considered together from the start. This guidance document helps first movers align maritime and nuclear frameworks, apply goal-based approaches where prescriptive rules are absent, and build the confidence required by regulators, insurers and the public. GNSP is proud to contribute to this important step for the sector.”

Helen Barden, Director - External Affairs at NorthStandard, added: “NorthStandard are proud to have been invited to contribute our expertise to the Navigating Nuclear Energy in Maritime guidance document. We collaborated with Lloyd’s Register to explore the insurance and reinsurance considerations for nuclear energy - particularly the interlink between classification and insurance, current P&I limitations around pooling nuclear risks and the importance of liability frameworks.

“We welcome the growing recognition that nuclear could play a meaningful role in the decarbonisation of shipping and we are proactively supporting the maritime industry when it comes to the insurance and regulatory challenges ahead.”

LR’s guidance builds on its industry-leading Fuel for Thought: Nuclear research programme and aims to fill a critical knowledge gap. It brings together decades of classification, safety and compliance expertise with specialist nuclear insight to provide an evidence-based framework for project teams at every stage of development.

First endorsed in April 2025, it applies to ships over 5000 gross tons and places a carbon levy on operators based on emissions per ton of cargo per mile, with an initial rate near 250 dollars per metric ton of CO2 equivalent. Payments go to the IMO Net Zero Fund, which would generate about 10 to 13 billion dollars each year to help developing nations, fund cleaner fuels, and support maritime transition programs. 

President Trump criticized the measure as a global carbon tax that would penalize American exporters and increase costs for consumers.

Analysts estimate the levy would raise global shipping costs by 12% to 15%, adding roughly 0.04 to 0.07 dollars per gallon of gasoline, 0.03 to 0.05 dollars per pound of imported food, and 0.02 to 0.03 dollars per unit of electronics and manufactured goods from Asia. 

Freight routes such as Shanghai to Los Angeles and Rotterdam to New York could see rates rise by 350 to 400 dollars per container. These increases would pass through to retail markets, hitting low-margin sectors like agriculture, retail, and construction hardest.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the statement declared.
“We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF.
Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.” Despite the U.S. threats, the European Union is standing by its support of the framework.
In a joint statement issued October 9, leading international maritime associations declared: “Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry.","President Donald Trump has issued a stark warning to nations supporting a global carbon tax on shipping, threatening economic retaliation as the International Maritime Organization votes on its Net-Zero Framework in London this week.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump declared the United States “will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form.” The president characterized the measure as a threat to American consumers and called on member states to “vote NO in London.”

This week’s IMO extraordinary session will decide on the adoption of the Net-Zero Framework—a carbon-pricing regime targeting the international shipping sector. The package combines a tightening marine fuel-intensity standard with a priced compliance mechanism that would channel revenues into an IMO Net-Zero Fund for low-carbon rewards, infrastructure, and transition support.

In a joint statement ahead of this week’s meeting, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy declared that “President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people.”

The administration warned that “the economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous, with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing as much as 10% or more.” The statement characterized the NZF proposal as posing “significant risks to the global economy” and subjecting all IMO member states to “an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties.”

The U.S. outlined several potential countermeasures against nations supporting the framework, including pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking of vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports. The administration also threatened to impose visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas.

Additional measures under consideration include imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF. The administration also said it would consider imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework, and evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers.

“The United States will be moving to levy these remedies against nations that sponsor this European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the statement declared. “We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.”

Despite the U.S. threats, the European Union is standing by its support of the framework. “The EU supports ambitious global measures at International Maritime Organization (IMO) level with a view to decarbonise the shipping sector, and ensure a global level playing field,” the EU Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport stated. “The EU views the Net-Zero Framework as a significant milestone and calls for its adoption at IMO next week.”

The framework would impose charges of $100 or $380 per metric ton of carbon dioxide that ships emit above certain limits, potentially generating $10 billion to $12 billion annually in revenue.The framework would apply to ships greater than 5,000 gross tons, covering approximately 85 percent of international shipping emissions.Vessels that overshoot intensity thresholds would be required to acquire remedial units, while efficient ships could bank or trade surplus units.If adopted, the framework could enter into force in 2027.

The U.S. position contrasts sharply with industry sentiment. Major shipping associations, including liner and shipowner groups, have urged governments to pass the package. In a joint statement issued October 9, leading international maritime associations declared: “Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation.”

Shipping accounts for approximately 90 percent of world trade and contributes roughly 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions.Proponents argue that a uniform price signal and enforceable standard would align shipowners, bunkering, and ports on a common decarbonization path.

The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board has also weighed in, characterizing the IMO’s proposed framework as “the ultimate in taxation without representation,” noting that “this is the first instance we can find of the U.N. claiming the ability to levy a tax—the revenues from which will be paid directly into a U.N.-controlled fund.”

Despite the U.S. warnings, backers of the framework seemed optimistic that there were sufficient votes for adoption following April’s approval in principle, though late abstentions could affect the final tally. If the framework passes, a technical group is scheduled to meet October 20-24 to finalize guidance on fuel definitions, revenue spending, and compliance rules ahead of the 2027 implementation timeline.",https://gcaptain.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-14T184954Z_425175044_RC2TBHAFYZW2_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA-TRUMP-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 18:00:24.791736

The vote, set to take place this week at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), concerns a sweeping proposal that would require the shipping industry to pay for its more than 1 billion tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions. The measure has divided major powers, with the U.S. opposing the levy and the EU pushing for adoptionas part of its climate leadership goals.

A person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Athens now intends to abstain, citing long-standing skepticism over the “net zero framework” and its economic implications for global shipping. Greece had previously voted in favor of the draft plan in April.

According to the same source, Greece’s reservations were submitted in writing to EU authorities before the upcoming vote. Officials argue that the proposed framework depends on fuels and technologies not yet available at scale, which could sharply raise costs as shipping companies compete for scarce low-emission resources.

The European Commission has called the IMO framework a “significant milestone” toward decarbonizing the maritime sector, while Washington has warned of potential retaliatory measures — including port levies, visa restrictions, and tariffs — should the tax be approved.

A spokesperson for the Greek government declined to comment.

Usually, under shipping’s main treaty on pollution, new regulations are considered accepted unless a third of countries — or half the world’s merchant fleet — declare they object, a process known as “tacit acceptance.” But the U.S. has now proposed that the IMO require “explicit acceptance” — effectively needing nations to officially opt in after the vote, according to a document.

The proposal is another example of the U.S. putting pressure on the planned rules, because it would add a further hurdle for them coming into force. Washington has already threatened to respond with measures such as port levies, visa restrictions and tariffs.

History may well be written this week in London. Member States of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are gathered to decide on what could become the first-ever legally binding greenhouse gas (GHG) limit for an entire global sector — international shipping.

For years, the maritime industry has moved goods across borders under one flag of cooperation. Now, that same unity is being tested as countries weigh whether to adopt the Net-Zero Framework, a global agreement that could set the industry on course to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

One global ocean, one rulebook

Shipping, by its very nature, doesn’t belong to any single country. It operates between borders, under shared rules. That’s why, say industry leaders, the IMO remains the only body capable of delivering a fair and effective emissions policy.

The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, which has been closely tracking the negotiations, described the moment as “historic.” The Center emphasized that an international agreement is the “only viable path forward” for a sector that thrives on global coordination.

“Doing nothing comes at a high cost,” the Center stated. “Uncertainty, fragmentation, and missing investment in needed innovation.”

The proposed framework would provide exactly what many shipowners, charterers, and financiers have been asking for: clarity. By setting common, legally binding GHG limits, the IMO could finally give the industry a predictable path toward cleaner operations.

Certainty drives change

At the heart of the proposal lies a practical idea — that certainty enables investment. With clear, measurable targets for reducing GHG intensity, companies could plan fleet renewals, invest in fuel alternatives, and develop low-carbon supply chains without second-guessing future regulations.

According to the Center’s latest analysis, adopting the Net-Zero Framework could “close the cost gap and create a business case for sustainable alternatives.” The report suggests that once clear emissions limits are established, technologies such as green methanol, ammonia, and advanced biofuels can compete more fairly with fossil fuels.

That’s a big shift for an industry often accused of “wait and see” behavior. After all, why invest in green technologies if future policy remains uncertain?

Learning from history

The shipping world has been here before. When the IMO introduced global rules on oil spills and sulfur emissions, many feared chaos. Instead, those standards became the backbone of modern maritime safety and environmental protection.

This week’s decision could play the same role for climate policy — defining how the industry measures, reports, and ultimately cuts its carbon output.

A call for courage

The Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping has made its stance clear: the time for half-measures is over. It has urged IMO Member States to “take this courageous step” and adopt the framework, pledging to support implementation through “technical guidance and knowledge sharing.”

The message is simple but powerful: the global shipping industry wants a unified rulebook.

If approved, the procedural changes would make it harder for the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) to come into effect, as it would require support from countries representing half of the world’s shipping fleet.

After years of discussions, governments provisionally agreed the NZF in April, in which they pledged to penalise polluting ships and uses the money to fund the transition to cleaner fuel. The policy is the world’s first global emissions pricing on any sector. At talks in London this week, countries are meeting to discuss how to carry the NZF forward.

Procedural roadblock to shipping deal

The US and its allies want to shift away from a system of tacit approval where, after the NZF is approved at the IMO talks, its rules automatically come into force unless a certain number of countries object. They prefer explicit approval instead, meaning it would not come into force unless enough governments – representing a certain percentage of the world’s shipping fleet – actively indicate support for it.

Emma Fenton, senior director of climate diplomacy at nonprofit policy group Opportunity Green, told Climate Home News that the US’s proposed change “risks undermining the NZF’s ambitions, delays the maritime transition and does not meet the scale or the pace of action that the climate crisis demands”.

Bryan Comer, maritime director at the International Council on Clean Transportation called it “an unnecessary procedural roadblock”.

The US has been pressuring governments not to support the NZF, which they provisionally agreed at the last set of talks in April. Last week, the US threatened supportive government officials and their shipowners with sanctions, visa restrictions, tariffs and port fees.

These measures that would hit small nations with big shipping registries, particularly those whose ships sail frequently to the USA or who have office offices there, the hardest. Two such governments, Bahamas and Liberia – have reversed their support for the NZF and have been actively opposing it this week.

Green shipping deal at risk

While in April some climate campaigners said the NZF lacked ambition and Pacific Island nations abstained from supporting it, others celebrated it a “groundbreaking moment which should signal a turning of the tide on greenhouse gases from global shipping”.

The deal was set to be officially approved by governments at talks at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) this week, with discussions limited to minor changes to the text. The head of the IMO – Panamanian Arsenio Dominguez – told governments on Tuesday that the text was “balanced” and that not agreeing to it would cause uncertainty and lead to a patchwork of regional and national green shipping regulations which would “increase the costs of this transition in the long run”.

Despite the US threats, government statements at an opening plenary on Tuesday suggested that support for the measure had grown since April – with Pacific and other nations who had previously abstained backing the proposal.

A US, Saudi and Russia-led attempt to oppose the adoption of the agenda failed and the talks’ chair – Liberian Harry Conway – introduced a three-minute time limit and urged governments to stop repetitive interventions in an attempt to prevent delays, joking that offenders would have to donate money to the IMO if they kept repeating themselves.

How high-risk biofuels could sink a flagship climate law for global shipping

Tacit or explicit approval

But on Wednesday morning, the US proposed not to use the tacit approval, a system which stipulates that, after agreements, amendments have a ten-month cooling off period.

During this period, the deal can be cancelled if a third of the nations signed up to the relevant IMO treaty – in this case the countries signed up to the Marpol Annex 6 treaty – object. It can also be cancelled if nations whose ship registries make up half of the world’s fleet by weight actively oppose it.

The US negotiator – who IMO rules say cannot be named – proposed explicit acceptance, which puts the onus on the governments supporting the NZF. Under this system, it would come into force until six months after two-thirds of nations, representing more than half the world’s shipping fleet, actively “communicated” to the IMO that they accept the deal.

“The usual tacit acceptance method is not appropriate for the potential entry into force of such significant measures”, the US negotiator said. They were supported by just over 20 governments, mainly from oil-reliant states like Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iran and Nigeria as well as Turkiye, Morocco, Argentina and Paraguay.

Their proposal was opposed by a larger group of nations, including Western and Pacific countries, South Africa, Brazil, Indonesia, Namibia and Kenya. The Danish negotiator protested that switching to the “time consuming and inefficient” explicit acceptance procedure would throw off the NZF’s timeline and reopening the text would mean “starting all over again”.

“The regulatory framework is ready. It is mature. The decision to move forward was already made in April with the approval of the amendments and, in reality, accepting an explicit acceptance procedure would, in reality, mean no to realising the NZF”, she said.

The Brazilian negotiator said tacit approval has been the default since 1973 because explicit acceptance “simply does not work”. The internal procedures for national governments to ratify amendments are “complicated”, he said, and “may take longer than action requires”, particularly as the shipping industry needs “predictability” on what the rules will be.

The negotiator from the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu said he was “surprised” that the US had not made its proposal before the talks. “We are of the view that the requested change at this stage is not conducive of a transparent and predictable process”, he said.

Talks’ chair U-turns under pressure

After nearly two hours of government statements, Conway said that from what he had heard it was “the will of the committee to proceed with the tacit approval”.

But that conclusion drew further complaints from the US and allies, who repeated their arguments. The US accused Conway and the IMO secretariat of not being “neutral” – which they later firmly denied. Russia’s negotiator accepted that “perhaps those who spoke in the majority were indeed for tacit acceptance” but argued that because the NZF is so “significant” it needs explicit approval.

Countries like Spain and Denmark spoke in defence of Conway’s ruling that the room was for tacit approval. Conway repeated that “there’s a clear majority that have decided to maintain the tacit acceptance procedure” and said he did not want to hear arguments repeated.

But after 30 more minutes of statements from the US, Saudi Arabia and allies, he changed his mind. In the interest of consensus and compromise, he said that the US proposal should be discussed by technical negotiators in a working group. “This will be my final ruling on the matter, he said.

The other side then complained. The Cook Islands negotiator suggested Conway had folded under the “pressure of events” and his decision risked “driving a VLCC [a type of big ship] through the processes and procedures that have stood the test of time”.

But they relented and Wednesday morning’s plenary meeting ended with negotiators being given a mandate to discuss tacit and explicit acceptance procedures in behind closed door sessions, which continued until nearly 11pm that night.

The full plenary met again on Thursday afternoon, but Conway proposed that discussions continue on Friday morning. The US called for time to consult and gathered with its Saudi Arabian and other allies. As negotiations continued behind closed doors, Conway urged governments to come back in the morning – the last day of talks – with solutions “so we will have a smooth discussion and a happy ending”.

Governments are also likely to vote tomorrow on the NZF itself.

Through fleet renewal, operational efficiency, and the increased use of renewable fuels, we are not only reducing emissions but also setting a new standard for sustainable shipping. Our transition plan is ambitious, but we are determined to deliver on it,” Mikki Koskinen, Managing Director of ESL Shipping, commented.

Recently, the company reported on the progress of its project for next-generation methanol-powered vessels, also known as Green Handy, with model tests completed at the SSPA facility in Gothenburg to confirm that the vessel’s performance aligns with calculations.

The nation currently plans to abstain from a final vote this week on an International Maritime Organization proposal to make the sector pay for its more than 1 billion tons of annual greenhouse emissions, a person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named discussing non-public information.

Athens had always been skeptical of the net zero framework and its impact on the shipping industry, the person said. In April, however, the country voted yes on a draft plan for the sweeping new rules.

A spokesperson for the Greek government declined to comment.

While the European Union is pushing its members to support the maritime levy, the US is strongly opposing it. After threatening to respond with measures such as port levies, visa restrictions and tariffs, Washington proposed introducing another step in adopting the charge, which would add a further hurdle for it to come into force.

Greece’s abstention would mark a departure of the southern European Union member state from the joint position of the bloc, which wants to lead the global fight against climate change.

The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, last week called for adoption of the IMO net zero framework, saying it was a “significant milestone” to decarbonize the shipping sector and ensure a level playing field.

Greek’s reservations regarding the levy have been submitted to the European authorities in writing well before the vote, the person familiar with the government’s stance added.

The net zero framework relies on fuels and technologies that aren’t available at scale, and introduces sharp penalties for not using them, the person said, adding this would inflate costs as companies chase limited supplies.

The final adoption of the new framework isn’t guaranteed due to Washington’s opposition. In April the draft plan for the new rules had gained wide support.

Nations are at an International Maritime Organization meeting in London to decide on landmark regulations to make vessels start paying for their greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration is strongly against the move, which it has labeled a “global carbon tax” on Americans, and has said it would consider wide-ranging measures against those who backed them.

On Wednesday, the US proposed changing acceptance rules, according to a document provided by the IMO at the meeting.

Usually, under shipping’s main treaty on pollution, new regulations are considered accepted unless a third of countries — or half the world’s merchant fleet — declare they object, a process known as “tacit acceptance.” But the US has now proposed that the IMO require “explicit acceptance” — effectively needing nations to officially opt in after the vote, according to a document.

The CMA CGM Group has signed a letter of intent for six state-of-the-art LNG-powered 1,700 TEU containerships to be built at Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL), India. The move makes the group the first major foreign carrier to commission LNG-fueled vessels from an Indian shipyard. All six vessels will be registered under the Indian flag.

The vessels will be delivered from 2029 to 2031, in line with the group’s fleet renewal and energy transition strategy.

CMA CGM says that the newbuilds demonstrate its commitment to a more sustainable shipping as they can operate on LNG and are ready for low-carbon fuels, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with the group’s ambition to be Net Zero Carbon by 2050. The project at Cochin Shipyard will involve the technical cooperation of Korean shipbuilder HD Hyundai Heavy Industries.

It says the order also underscores its strong commitment to India’s maritime vision and strategic national priorities. The group is actively investing across the Indian maritime value chain, spanning strategic terminals, maritime services, and shipbuilding, while also reflagging vessels under the Indian registry. At the same time, it is enhancing local maritime employment through expanded crewing and manning operations in India. CMA CGM will reflag four vessels under the Indian registry in 2025 and aims to recruit 1,000 Indian seafarers by the end of the year.

Global Communications Leader Joins EQT-Backed Environmental Firm

Arcwood Environmental, an EQT Infrastructure portfolio company, has appointed Carol Roos as Chief Communications and Sustainability Officer (CCSO), effective October 13, 2025. The move signals the company’s intent to embed sustainability more deeply into its corporate strategy while strengthening engagement across investors, regulators, and clients.

Roos joins Arcwood from Invenergy, one of the world’s largest privately held clean energy developers, where she served as Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Brand. Her portfolio spanned policy communications, brand development, and local impact strategies across Invenergy’s renewable energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure projects in North America, Europe, and Latin America.

Before Invenergy, Roos was a Partner at Brunswick Group, where she advised Fortune 500 companies and global boards on reputation management, corporate strategy, and stakeholder engagement during critical corporate transitions and market events.

Integrating ESG, Brand, and Stakeholder Trust

In her new role, Roos will lead Arcwood’s communications, sustainability strategy, and public affairs functions—an increasingly integrated set of priorities for companies navigating rising ESG scrutiny and stakeholder expectations.

“Working across communications, investor relations, and reputation management, Carol brings a deep understanding of how stakeholder trust is built and sustained,” said HP Nanda, CEO of Arcwood Environmental. “Her leadership will strengthen how we connect with customers and communities as we advance environmental innovation and operational transparency.”

Arcwood, which operates across waste management, recycling, and resource recovery services, has positioned itself as a key player in circular economy infrastructure under EQT Infrastructure’s ownership. The company’s stated goal is to become “the most trusted environmental services partner,” with Roos now responsible for aligning sustainability and corporate purpose across its business lines.

Corporate Sustainability in Transition

The appointment comes as global infrastructure and environmental services firms increasingly link communications leadership with ESG oversight—a reflection of how stakeholder engagement, disclosure, and long-term value creation have converged under investor and regulatory pressure.

In the U.S., the SEC’s proposed climate disclosure rules and evolving European reporting standards under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) are reshaping how firms structure sustainability functions. For private equity–backed companies like Arcwood, integrating sustainability leadership within the executive suite also strengthens reporting alignment with EQT’s broader ESG and impact frameworks.

“Environmental waste management is central to building a more sustainable and resilient future,” Roos said. “Arcwood is demonstrating that responsible resource management can create tangible value for businesses and communities. I’m eager to work with our teams and partners to deepen that impact and help shape a cleaner, more efficient world.”

Strategic Implications for the Infrastructure Sector

The creation of the CCSO role within Arcwood mirrors a broader shift across the industrial and infrastructure investment landscape. As investors and regulators heighten scrutiny on environmental performance, companies are prioritizing integrated governance models where communications, sustainability, and investor relations operate in tandem.

For C-suite executives and institutional investors, Roos’s appointment highlights how environmental services firms are responding to new expectations: measurable sustainability outcomes, credible narrative building, and transparent disclosure. EQT’s infrastructure platform, which has placed sustainability and digitalization at the core of its investment thesis, is likely to leverage Arcwood’s enhanced ESG profile as part of its portfolio value creation strategy.

Looking Ahead

Arcwood’s leadership change comes amid rising demand for scalable environmental infrastructure solutions, from circular waste systems to decarbonized logistics and industrial recycling. With Roos at the helm of communications and sustainability, the company is expected to accelerate its stakeholder engagement and reinforce its role in advancing resource efficiency across markets.

As sustainability functions move closer to the center of corporate governance, appointments like this reflect a growing consensus: the next phase of ESG leadership is not only about compliance—it’s about credibility, communication, and competitive advantage.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EQTs-Arcwood-Environmental-Appoints-Carol-Roos-as-Chief-Communications-and-Sustainability-Officer.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:00:26.140809

• Cross-border transactions can resume under national or international standards, tracked by a decentralized real-time registry.

• The reform aims to attract foreign investment and support Indonesia’s 2060 net-zero emissions target.

Details of the new policy

President Prabowo Subianto has signed a decree reopening Indonesia’s international carbon trading market after a four-year suspension. The policy allows companies and project developers to resume cross-border trading of carbon credits, including large-scale conservation and reforestation projects that were previously restricted.

Under the decree, traded carbon units must be verified either under Indonesian national standards or the standards of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and other recognized international certifiers.

To prevent double counting, the decree establishes a decentralized registry that will record carbon units in real time, ensuring transparency and accuracy in the tracking of emission reductions.

By reopening international carbon trade, the government seeks to generate new foreign investment, increase fiscal revenue, and contribute to its national target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060 or earlier.

Context of the previous ban

Indonesia’s 2021 regulations had shifted the focus of its carbon market to domestic compliance trading, effectively halting the sale of credits to international buyers. The government at the time argued that carbon reductions should first be used to meet national emission goals rather than being sold abroad.

Officials also cited concerns that low global carbon prices and uneven benefit-sharing meant that producing countries were not adequately compensated for their environmental assets.

Before the moratorium, Indonesia had been one of the largest suppliers of carbon credits to the global market, particularly through REDD+ reforestation and conservation projects.

Market position and partnerships

Indonesia’s reentry into international carbon markets comes as it strengthens collaboration with global certification bodies to ensure that projects meet international credibility standards. The government has signed mutual recognition agreements with Verra, Gold Standard, Global Carbon Council, Plan Vivo, and the Joint Crediting Mechanism to facilitate cross-border trade.

Domestically, Indonesia launched its own carbon exchange in September 2023, which began offering carbon credit certificates to foreign buyers earlier this year. While trading volume has been modest so far, officials expect international participation to expand following the decree.

Outlook

The return of international carbon trading positions Indonesia as a key player in the global carbon offset market once again. The decree’s combination of national oversight, alignment with international standards, and transparent registry is intended to strengthen trust and market integrity.

If implemented effectively, Indonesia’s framework could attract new investment in nature-based solutions while supporting the country’s broader transition toward a low-carbon economy.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Indonesia-Resumes-International-Carbon-Trade-Under-New-Transparency-Decree.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 17:01:34.658881

However, the US is now pushing for a change to the ratification procedure that industry sources said would complicate and potentially derail its adoption.

Together with Saudi Arabia, another opponent of the plans, the US wants the IMO to abandon its usual “tacit acceptance” process for amending international shipping conventions, in favour of “explicit acceptance”, requiring a certain percentage of countries to individually ratify the change.

Tacit acceptance was introduced in the 1970s to speed up the amendment process and would have seen the plans adopted after a positive vote on Friday and come into force 16 months later unless a specified number of parties formally objected.

According to the IMO, the previous system of explicit acceptance “in practice led to long delays in bringing amendments into force”.

The IMO’s proposed net zero framework is the culmination of years of work to try to tackle emissions from shipping, which account for about 3 per cent of global emissions that cause climate change. The proceeds of the new carbon price on shipping would go into a fund that the IMO says would be used to “reward low-emission ships” and “mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable states”, among other things.

Organisations representing the shipping industry have urged governments to back the plans.

The UK Chamber of Shipping — whose members include oil giants BP and Shell, cruise operator Carnival and transport operators Brittany Ferries and P&O Ferries — was among groups who signed a statement in recent days warning that without the agreement the industry could be left with “a complicated and inefficient patchwork of national and regional regulatory frameworks”.

“Our industry, which by its very nature is global, absolutely needs a global regulation, also to address climate change,” the groups said.

The Trump administration has said it “unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists”.

The hope is that this will convince port authorities to allow nuclear ships to dock more readily.
IMO expects this to take years, with serious questions arising from the operation of nuclear ships: How can we prevent nuclear fuel from leaking when a ship sinks?","On July 21, 1959, former US First Lady Mamie Eisenhower smashed a champagne bottle against the towering hull of the NS Savannah before the newly built ship slid into the Delaware River, carrying with it the lofty promise that shipping would be changing forever.

Rather than having a conventional diesel engine in its machine room, the Savannah was powered by a nuclear reactor. Between 1962 and 1970, at a time when nuclear power was considered the future of energy, the merchant vessel shipped goods and people around the world to showcase the peaceful use of splitting atoms.

Today, only a few countries still operate nuclear-powered ships, and mostly for military uses in aircraft carriers and submarines. Russia continues to employ a small fleet of nuclear icebreakers on the so-called Northern Sea Route in the Arctic, for example.

Cargo vessels, let alone passenger ships, that run on nuclear fuel have all but disappeared. But some people are convinced the time has come to bring them back.

Shipping's carbon emissions problem

Merchant ships carry about 80% of all internationally traded goods, which makes them indispensable to keeping the global economy running.

But the majority still run on bunker oil, a thick, tar-like fuel made from crude oil, and have smokestacks that spew toxic pollutants into their air. Collectively, they emit as much climate-changing CO2 as the entire country of Japan.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO), which is responsible for global shipping, wants the sector to reach net zero emissions by around 2050.

But none of the technologies touted to curb greenhouse gas emissions substantially — for example batteries or alternative fuels like methanol and ammonia — are able to achieve this goal all by themselves.

Building a case for nuclear-powered ships

As global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions are intensifying, the issue of nuclear energy in shipping is getting more and more attention.

Jan Emblemsvag, an engineering professor and project lead at the Norwegian research consortium NuProShip, names the most obvious advantage, telling DW that nuclear-powered ships ""would have no emissions.""

Inside NS Savannah, back in the 1960s, a so-called pressurized water reactor (PWR) was using nuclear fission to heat water, which then produced steam to turn turbines and power the ship's propeller and electrical generators.

The advantage of using nuclear fuel, back then and now, is that huge amounts of energy can be packed into a relatively small space, enabling vessels to traverse the oceans for years without refueling.

""And that, of course, gives a tremendous range,"" said Emblemsvag

NS Savannah, for example, could make 14 trips around the world on a single fuel load, while current container ships typically running on oil don't even manage one.

Occassionally, they even need to reduce speed to save fuel. By contrast, nuclear ships wouldn't run into refueling problems, so that they could go faster and save money at the same time.

What killed the NS Savannah?

Ultimately, it was the business case behind the NS Savannah that spelled her end in 1970. Built at a cost of $46 million (€39.6 million) — today about $500 million in purchasing power parity — the ship required large annual government subsidies to operate, around $2 million, which was not financially sustainable, particularly during periods when oil was cheap.

Apart from that, she was hamstrung by a limited cargo capacity of only around 10,000 tons, the need for a specially trained crew, and limited access to ports around the world due to nuclear safety concerns.

Additionally, the ship's design was costly, with thick shielding around the reactor and even extendable fins to keep the vessel steady in stormy waters.

The NS Savannah was officially retired in 1970, with its nuclear reactor being shut down and defueled in 1971.

After it, only three other nuclear cargo ships were built — Germany's Otto Hahn, the Japanese Mutsu and the Russian Sevmorput. The first two were later converted into diesel ships, and the Severmorput is nearing retirement.

New reactor types for a technological breakthrough?

The current discussion about a nuclear revival in shipping is mainly fueled by technological advances in developing next-generation nuclear reactors, says Mark Tipping from the global shipping classification society Lloyd's Register,

""The technologies that we're looking at today for maritime are very different to what was applied in the 1960s and 70s,"" he told DW.

Often referred to as ""Generation IV"" reactors, their biggest promise is that they will be ""safer than those of the past,"" said Tipping.

Pressurized water reactors, the most common type of reactor today, rely on active intervention when things go wrong, meaning that additional pumps would have to be switched on, for example.

The new reactors would ""take that out of the equation,"" Tipping said. ""If something goes wrong, they're failsafe. It doesn't need people to achieve that.""

The hope is that this will convince port authorities to allow nuclear ships to dock more readily.

Emblemsvag's Norwegion consortium — including the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and shipbuilder Vard — looked into 80 different new reactor designs to single out the three they consider most promising for propelling ships.

Apart from questions of nuclear safety, they also looked at commercial aspects.

""For one of the reactor technologies that we're working on, we've already done some cost calculations. They indicate that the fuel costs will be roughly 40% cheaper than heavy fuel oil,"" Emblemsvag said, adding that the selected reactors are rather small and can be mass-produced, pushing down costs further.

But none of the reactors scrutinized by the consortium have actually been built yet, let alone production capacities established to build them in large numbers.

When asked about the potential of nuclear ships today, some of the world's biggest shipping companies — MSC, CMA-CGM and Maersk — didn't even reply to DW's request for comment.

Will nuclear-powered ships remain a sailor's yarn?

In June this year, the IMO agreed to update its rules governing civilian nuclear vessels, dating back to 1981 and covering PWR reactors only.

Ricardo Batista, IMO's Technical Officer for Maritime Safety, says the authority first wants to understand the hazards and the safety requirements.

""And then from there, [we can] develop the relevant mitigation measures that can be incorporated in the new code,"" he told DW.

IMO expects this to take years, with serious questions arising from the operation of nuclear ships: How can we prevent nuclear fuel from leaking when a ship sinks? How can we stop it from falling into the hands of terrorists? And what happens to the nuclear waste?

Beyond this, classification societies, like Lloyd's Register in London or US-based ABS that establish and enforce technical rules, need to update their guidelines. And port authorities as well as ship insurers would have to revise their rules, too.

So sorting out all the legal aspects of nuclear-powered ships will probably take longer than building them. Taking them to sea in the early 2030s, as Tipping and Emblemsvag hope, seems rather ambitious.

Developed in partnership with Global Nuclear Security Partners and marine insurer NorthStandard, the publication details the regulatory, technical, operational and financial steps required to integrate nuclear power, including small modular reactors, into maritime assets.

The document addresses the absence of an international regulatory framework and examines the roles of the International Maritime Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency in aligning nuclear and maritime standards.

It covers safety classification, environmental assessments, structural integrity, and the creation of nuclear safety cases, along with physical and cyber security measures and insider threat mitigation. Operational and financial considerations include crew qualifications, emergency response planning, quality assurance, and insurance challenges.

The guidance promotes predictable liability structures to support commercial viability.

Mark Tipping, Global Power to X Director at Lloyd’s Register, said nuclear energy could transform maritime operations but requires “clarity, collaboration and trust across regulators, operators, insurers and wider society.”

Nick Tomkinson, Senior Partner at Global Nuclear Security Partners, said success depends on integrating “safety, security and safeguards from the start.”

NorthStandard’s Director of External Affairs, Helen Barden, noted the insurer’s contribution on “insurance and reinsurance considerations for nuclear energy,” adding that the company supports the sector’s efforts to address decarbonisation and liability challenges.

The guidance builds on Lloyd’s Register’s earlier Fuel for Thought: Nuclear research programme, aiming to provide an evidence-based framework for stakeholders as the maritime industry moves toward net-zero emissions.

robert.emmanuel@antiguaobserver.com

Just days after international media reported that the US has been pressuring vulnerable countries not to approve of new Net-Zero rules by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), Prime Minister Gaston Browne said that the government would abstain from voting, citing “cost of living concerns”.

However, a review of the new rules being considered by IMO member countries would develop a fund to specifically address the “disproportionately negative impacts on [least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS)], including on food security”.

The United States, under President Donald Trump, has spoken publicly about its approach to actively undermine global efforts to combat climate change.

In April of this year, the US walked away from talks around the new rules, objecting to the carbon pricing mechanism.

According to several media reports, the measures passed with the support of 63 IMO member states and 16 countries against, and 24 countries abstained.

At the time of this report, Observer media could not ascertain the country-by-country vote during the April meeting, although international media reports suggest that countries against the proposal included major oil producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, while supporters included the UK, the Netherlands, Norway, Germany, Spain, Denmark, France, Sweden, Vanuatu and Tuvalu. The Pacific Islands were said to have abstained as they felt the rules were too weak and that stiffer penalties should be imposed.

According to the Guardian, US officials have since continued to lobby countries that supported the rules both in writing and via phone calls by threatening to impose tariffs, withdraw visa rights and take other retaliatory action if they continue to support the measure.

Days before the 176 member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) meet in London for four days of talks, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, along with Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transport Secretary Sean Duffy issued a joint statement, threatening to slap tariffs on countries that supported the measure, as well as other commercial penalties such as port fees on ships that complied.

The statement also hinted at targeting individual negotiators in the talk by “evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers”.

The Guardian said that the US has also issued a démarche – a diplomatic document—which lists other retaliatory measures.

Prime Minister Browne said the government shares concerns with the United States about the transition to lower emissions in shipping.

According to the Prime Minister, “Like the United States, we are equally concerned about this transition … we think that there should be a deferral, and if there is no deferral, then we will clearly abstain.

“We will not vote against it because, at the end of the day, we remain one of the most strident climate advocates. But this particular initiative could result in significant shipping costs, which in turn would increase the cost of living and it’s from that standpoint that we are likely to abstain,” he added.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework establishes a two-tier system for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, combining a fuel standard with partial carbon pricing.

Ships that comply with minimum emission reduction requirements would pay fees on approximately 15 percent of their emissions at $100 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, while non-compliant vessels face penalties of $380 per tonne.

According to draft IMO regulations, revenue collected through the system would be channelled into an IMO Net-Zero Fund with specific provisions for small island developing states and least developed countries.

The fund is designed to disburse revenue for environmental protection, adaptation and resilience building, with particular attention to the needs of developing countries including revenue for researching, developing and deploying zero and near-zero greenhouse gas emission technologies, as well as developing necessary maritime, coastal and port-related infrastructure and equipment.

The regulations specifically authorize the fund to address “disproportionately negative impacts on states, including food security concerns”, and require the IMO committee to continuously review potential impacts on food security, paying particular attention to countries exposed to food insecurity.

In November 2024, Nation News reported that several Caribbean nations, including Belize and Jamaica, took leading roles in the negotiations, with support from Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts and Nevis, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago, according to the Shridath Ramphal Centre for International Trade Law, Policy and Services at The University of the West Indies, Cave Hill Campus.

The approved framework is expected to generate approximately US $11 to $12 billion annually until 2035, though some analysts suggest this falls short of the US $12 to $24 billion per year needed to support green marine fuels and technologies alone.

Prime Minister Browne claimed that the decision was based on national interests and not external pressure from the US or other major oil producing countries like Saudi Arabia, stating that the country remains “committed to the net-zero transition but the pace and structure of implementation must not disproportionately harm small island economies.”

According to IMO rules, adoption of the framework will require a two-thirds majority vote of the 108 contracting parties with countries having a further 10 months to decide whether or not to accept it.

If approved during the October 14-17 meeting and one-third of the members do not object to the rules, then the Net-Zero Framework would enter into force on March 2027 with ships expected to comply in 2028.

Green corridors are how shipping’s first movers will translate their commitments into action.","On their statement, the organisations are calling for the IMO member states to reaffirm the critical role of these initiatives as platforms for early action to decarbonize shipping.

According to the trio, it is evident that green corridors play a unique role in offering practical pathways to demonstrate, deploy and scale zero-emission technologies in line with the IMO’s greenhouse gas strategy and its goal of reaching zero emissions by 2050.

Importantly, support for green corridors is grounded in stakeholder-driven collaboration amongst industry, cargo owners, cities, ports, and energy suppliers.

The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework offers the potential to unlock capital and accelerate implementation of the scalable, green hydrogen-derived fuels (e-fuels) needed to decarbonize the maritime sector. Green corridors stand ready to operationalise this framework.

Furthemore, creation of robust and ambitious guidelines by the IMO, including a rewards mechanism for zero- and near-zero GHG emission fuels, will be critical to ensuring that green corridors become a reality.

More than 60 green corridor initiatives are already in motion globally across multiple vessel segments and fuel types. These initiatives are uniquely positioned to jumpstart demand for e-fuels, accelerate alignment with the IMO framework, and test solutions on real-world commercial trade routes.

Yet, without robust support, many green corridors risk stalling before reaching full deployment or final investment decision. Corridors can serve as proof-of-concept for e-fuel production, related port infrastructure and supportive policies to test what mechanisms actually drive uptake, offer pathways to scaling, and build strong safeguards to ensure environmental and social integrity.

Green corridors are how shipping’s first movers will translate their commitments into action. We strongly support adoption of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework and urge the development of ambitious guidelines that recognize and strengthen the role of green corridors as credible enablers of a just and effective transition to zero-emission shipping.

LNG is not a transition fuel, it is a transition business model – a short-term profit play dressed up as climate action.

The question every shipowner, policymaker, and regulator should be asking is not ""Can LNG reduce emissions?"" but ""Who benefits from LNG being called a solution?""

The answer is blunt. Classification societies selling their LNG academies. Shipyards chasing orders. Energy companies desperate to monetise gas reserves before they are stranded.

And an International Maritime Organization happy to paper over cracks in its credibility by waving through a fuel pathway that is already proven incompatible with its own stated decarbonisation goals.

The Methane Elephant in the Room

The numbers do not lie.

Methane slip from LNG ships has risen 180% since 2016. Methane is more than 80 times as potent as CO₂ over 20 years.

No amount of rebranding LNG as ""bio"" or ""e-LNG"" changes the physics of that molecule leaking into the atmosphere.

So, while the industry claps itself on the back for ordering dual-fuel engines and calling it ""progress,"" the climate balance sheet is heading further into the red.

This is not a pathway. It is a diversion.

The Cost of False Promises

Let us also be clear about the economics.

LNG newbuilds are not cheaper – they are riskier. Owners face the prospect of costly retrofits or premature scrapping, with estimates of up to $185 billion in losses tied to stranded LNG assets.

Who carries that burden?

Not the classification societies collecting training fees. Not the engine makers pushing LNG-capable designs.

It will be the shipowners, their financiers, and eventually the wider industry – saddled with obsolete ships and wasted capital, all because the IMO could not hold the line on integrity.

Optimisation First, Then Transition

Fuelre4m's position is simple.

We agree the industry must move away from fossil fuels. But until proven, scalable alternatives exist, the responsible course is to optimise every drop of what we use today.

That means real measurement, real accountability, and squeezing every gram of waste and emissions out of existing fuels.

The test for any new fuel is not whether it is marketed as 'green' but whether it is better than what it replaces – well-to-wake, across the full lifecycle, in real-world conditions.

LNG fails that test. Repeatedly.

The IMO's Credibility Crisis

The IMO was founded to regulate in the interest of global society, not to provide a cover story for commercial interests.

By tolerating the LNG myth, the organisation has sold out emissions for profit. It has aligned itself with the beneficiaries of a fuel pathway that is already locking the sector into more pollution, more health impacts, and more stranded assets.

The IMO should be ashamed.

Not because it is slow, not because it is cautious, but because it has been captured by the very interests it is supposed to regulate.

Conclusion: Stop Running from One Mistake Into Another

The industry should not run blindly from fossil fuels to something unproven and unmeasured.

We have not yet fully optimised what we know, and yet we are told to jump into an alternative that fails even the most basic accounting test.

If the new cure is worse than the illness, we have achieved nothing. LNG is the wrong cure.

The responsible path is to measure, optimise, and demand proof – before declaring any new technology a solution.

The world deserves honesty.

The shipping sector deserves better than false promises. And the IMO owes us leadership that cannot be bought.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_2bbbefb0dcb9f6e9ac980429ca22acfc.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:01:29.933390

The maritime industry is facing an increasingly complex regulatory landscape as it strives to meet decarbonisation targets, with new frameworks including the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and FuelEU Maritime, alongside an upcoming IMO net zero framework, driving significant change, heard delegates at the Marine Fuels 360 conference in Singapore on Wednesday (8 October).

Kapil Berry, Business Development Director, Maritime, DNV highlighted each new regulation presents a more intricate scenario than the last, making compliance and strategic planning crucial for shipowners during his presentation ‘Leveraging Technology for Decarbonisation’.

“Though biofuels are currently considered the easiest drop-in bunker fuels to meet immediate compliance needs for FuelEU Maritime and IMO net zero goals, technological solutions remain at the forefront of this transition,” informed Berry.

He shared Wind-Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS), encompassing designs such as rotor sails and rigid wings, can achieve 5-20% fuel savings when installed. However, their implementation requires careful consideration of trading areas, air drafts, deck strengthening, and potential impacts on bridge visibility, with planning often needing at least two years before drydocking.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is also emerging as a significant pathway. Projections from DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast report suggest if 20 major ports establish offloading facilities and the largest bulk carriers, containerships, and tankers are fitted with CCS, it could offload approximately 90% of emissions from those vessels. This translates to 9% of overall maritime emissions, equivalent to 25 million metric tonnes (mt) of oil consumption by 2030.

Beyond advanced technologies, energy efficiency measures are emphasised as the “lowest hanging fruits” that can be implemented immediately, stated Berry.

He pointed out a DNV publication detailing over 40 energy efficiency technologies suggesting potential savings of up to 16% for shipowners.

Crucially, the transition towards net-zero shipping demands robust data management, believed Berry.

“The shift from manual reporting to automated, standardised, and verified data flows is essential for compliance with ETS, FuelEU Maritime, and net zero frameworks, as decisions involving millions or billions of dollars hinge on accurate data,” he said.

“To support the industry, DNV has developed a long-standing expert service available via email, providing responses within 24 hours, or four hours for urgent queries, routed through global data centres.”

Partners for over 34 years, Petroineos and Sogestran’s subsidiary Maritima are renewing their fleet dedicated to bunkering operations in the Fos, Marseille, and Toulon areas, reaffirming their local presence in the south of France.

Petroineos and Maritima will commission vessels for conventional bunkering and ready to supply low carbon fuels – B24, B100, HVO, e-Methanol.

The new bunker vessels will replace the current units – Florence B, Tatiana B, and Cap Pinede.

Their design has been specifically developed to optimise access to the Petroineos refinery jetties in Lavera. Each vessel will have a cargo capacity of 4,500 m³.

They will feature diesel-electric propulsion, powered by three electronically managed generator sets that adjust consumption to the vessel’s operational needs – a technical choice particularly well suited for ships operating over relatively short distances, and already adopted by Sogestran Group for the Pointe de Caux, launched in 2022.

The vessels will be equipped with two electric azimuth thrusters at the stern and a bow tunnel thruster, ensuring optimal manoeuvrability.

They will also be fitted with shore power connections and mass flow meters for quantity delivery monitoring.

Located on the Yangtze River, about 250 km from Shanghai, the shipyard specialises in vessels designed for the transport of oil and chemical products.

The designer of the bunker vessels is Deltamarin Shanghai. Steel cutting for the first vessel is scheduled for November 2026, with launch in 2027 and delivery in early 2028.

In a recent Maritime Impact article, classification society DNV highlighted infrastructure trends and transition models that can support wider adoption of low-GHG bunker fuels across the maritime sector based on its latest Maritime Forecast to 2050:

The maritime industry faces a pivotal moment as it adapts to regulation, including the new IMO Net-Zero Framework (pending adoption), aimed at reducing ship greenhouse gas emissions. DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast to 2050 offers practical insights and analysis to help stakeholders make informed decisions on ships, fuels, technologies and infrastructure for a net-zero future.

“For shipowners exploring low-GHG fuels and onboard carbon capture, knowing when and where they can refuel and offload captured CO₂ is crucial,” explains Eirik Ovrum, Maritime Principal Consultant at DNV and lead author of the paper. In this article, we highlight the latest developments and emphasize the importance of Chain of Custody models to verify the origin and sustainability of alternative fuels.

Net-Zero Framework sets new course for shipping

Shipping’s energy transition is being shaped by IMO’s revised 2023 GHG Strategy: a 20 per cent emissions reduction from shipping by 2030, a 70 per cent reduction (at least) by 2040, and full-scale decarbonization “by or around” 2050 – all compared with 2008 levels.

The Net-Zero Framework (NZF) aims to accelerate the adoption of low-GHG fuels and technologies. Maritime Forecast to 2050 describes the NZF and compares its consequences with those of relevant EU regulations.

A forthcoming DNV white paper will examine the NZF in depth following the October 2025 IMO meeting, where its adoption is expected to be voted on.

The NZF is based on a GHG fuel intensity (GFI) metric expressed in amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), or its equivalent, per unit of energy used on board in a calendar year on a well-to-wake basis.

Starting in 2028, progressively stricter GFI targets are anticipated to be introduced annually. If adopted, the NZF will affect technology choices and the operation of ships as well as the development of shoreside infrastructure and the availability of low-GHG fuels and CO2 storage.

Tracking the fuel and technology transition

Drawing on data from DNV’s Alternative Fuels Insight platform and S&P Global, Maritime Forecast to 2050 reveals a clear shift: LNG and methanol are gaining traction, while ammonia, hydrogen and on-board carbon capture are entering early trials.

The maritime industry is facing an increasingly complex regulatory landscape as it strives to meet decarbonisation targets, with new frameworks including the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and FuelEU Maritime, alongside an upcoming IMO net zero framework, driving significant change, heard delegates at the Marine Fuels 360 conference in Singapore on Wednesday (8 October).

Kapil Berry, Business Development Director, Maritime, DNV highlighted each new regulation presents a more intricate scenario than the last, making compliance and strategic planning crucial for shipowners during his presentation ‘Leveraging Technology for Decarbonisation’.

“Though biofuels are currently considered the easiest drop-in bunker fuels to meet immediate compliance needs for FuelEU Maritime and IMO net zero goals, technological solutions remain at the forefront of this transition,” informed Berry.

He shared Wind-Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS), encompassing designs such as rotor sails and rigid wings, can achieve 5-20% fuel savings when installed. However, their implementation requires careful consideration of trading areas, air drafts, deck strengthening, and potential impacts on bridge visibility, with planning often needing at least two years before drydocking.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is also emerging as a significant pathway. Projections from DNV’s latest Maritime Forecast report suggest if 20 major ports establish offloading facilities and the largest bulk carriers, containerships, and tankers are fitted with CCS, it could offload approximately 90% of emissions from those vessels. This translates to 9% of overall maritime emissions, equivalent to 25 million metric tonnes (mt) of oil consumption by 2030.

Beyond advanced technologies, energy efficiency measures are emphasised as the “lowest hanging fruits” that can be implemented immediately, stated Berry.

He pointed out a DNV publication detailing over 40 energy efficiency technologies suggesting potential savings of up to 16% for shipowners.

Crucially, the transition towards net-zero shipping demands robust data management, believed Berry.

“The shift from manual reporting to automated, standardised, and verified data flows is essential for compliance with ETS, FuelEU Maritime, and net zero frameworks, as decisions involving millions or billions of dollars hinge on accurate data,” he said.

“To support the industry, DNV has developed a long-standing expert service available via email, providing responses within 24 hours, or four hours for urgent queries, routed through global data centres.”

China’s largest methanol bunkering vessel successfully completed a bunkering operation of the ultra-large dual-fuel container ship COSCO Shipping Gemini on Thursday (9 October), according to Shanghai’s Chongming Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) on Saturday (11 October).

According to Chongming MSA, COSCO Shipping Gemini was recently converted into a dual-fuel vessel able to operate on methanol.

Hai Gang Zhi Yuan delivered 2,000 metric tonnes (mt) of methanol fuel to the container ship at the Changxing Island Base Terminal of COSCO Shipping Heavy Industry in Shanghai.

The entire process achieved seamless “bunkering upon delivery, departure upon completion”, marking a new stage of green bunkering in Shanghai Port.

Since the successful implementation of China’s first ship-to-ship methanol bunkering at a shipyard on 6 September, Shanghai’s Chongming MSA has continuously explored and established a standardised operation system for methanol bunkering operations.

This system, centered on the “Shanghai Maritime Safety Administration’s Regulations on the Safety Management of Waterborne Methanol Bunkering Operations,” establishes a network consisting of Vessel Traffic Service system, on-site patrol boats, and aerial drone inspections.”

This effectively connects multiple stakeholders, including shipyards, bunkering companies, and recipients.

“This not only establishes a comprehensive safety chain for methanol bunkering operations, but also further reduces vessel waiting times, lowers operating costs, and improves international voyage turnover efficiency,” said Chongming MSA.

“This system enabled the safe and efficient completion of this large-scale bunkering operation in less than five hours.”

The International Maritime Organization is meeting this week and expected to sign off on a proposal that nations endorsed in April. The U.N. agency sets binding regulations for the global maritime industry, and the measure would ultimately put a tax on shipping emissions.

Several Trump officials have called the proposal a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations” and have sought to strong-arm nations into rejecting it by threatening tariffs and other trade barriers.

In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the plan is “an attempt by “climate-obsessed politicians to entrench their agenda before voters in democracies can kill it.”

But with the measure still headed for passage, the U.S. is making a last-minute push to change the rules of adoption, according to nonprofit observers. Under the U.S. proposal, which would still require a vote, even if the measure passes at this week’s meeting, it wouldn’t be finalized unless enough countries reiterated their support in the coming months.

“We are actively engaging with countries on the extremely flawed proposal, as well as exploring and preparing to act on remedies including tariffs, visa restrictions, and/or port levies,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email to POLITICO’s E&E News ahead of the meeting. “We will also be engaging our like-minded partners and allies to propose they take similar measures.”

It’s the latest move by President Donald Trump to not just abandon U.S. efforts to combat rising temperatures but to try and coerce other countries to follow suit.

How we got here

The IMO regulates the shipping industry and is a rare example of a U.N. body that can issue binding regulations.

The measure up for approval is known as the IMO Net-Zero Framework. It is part of the IMO’s efforts to zero out shipping emissions by around 2050 — a commitment the organization’s 176 member countries agreed to in 2023. The U.S. was among those countries, agreeing to the goal during the Biden administration.

The framework — which 63 countries endorsed in April 2025 — would amend an international treaty known as MARPOL to enact a carbon intensity standard. That standard would get stricter over time, encouraging forcing industry to switch from polluting fossil fuels to lower-emission alternatives. Ships that don’t meet the standard would need to pay a fee, which would go to a fund aimed in part at helping industry make the transition.

Among the countries that supported the proposal were Brazil and China. Saudi Arabia and several other Gulf oil nations voted against it.

In a statement issued last week, Rubio, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the proposal would be “disastrous” for industry and raise the price of goods for consumers. They threatened nations that vote for it with possible sanctions, “commercial penalties,” port fees and visa restrictions.

This week’s vote is being closely watched as a measure of how successful the U.S. is in getting countries to bend to its will. If the U.S. fails, it may be forced to the negotiating table. If it succeeds, that could set a worrying precedent.

How much it will cost

The Trump administration’s most prominent argument is that the IMO agreement will raise shipping costs globally and make goods more expensive.

It might also be the least convincing, said James Lightbourn, founder of Cavalier Shipping, a maritime industry consultancy.

That’s because the types of retaliation the Trump administration is suggesting, such as tariffs and port fees, would likely have the same effect, he said. The threats also come as the U.S. rolls out port fees on Chinese ships in an effort to counter that country’s shipbuilding dominance.

Making the switch to low-carbon fuels will be expensive, say industry analysts. But the exact impact of the regulations — if they pass — is still uncertain.

In the near term, the impact on freight costs will be relatively minimal, said Stuart Nicoll, a director at Maritime Strategies International, a London-based consultancy. The fees on high-emitting fuels like oil will start in 2028 and rise, but by 2035, some of the rewards for using low-carbon fuels may start to outweigh the penalties.

“The cost for shipowners and, by extension, shippers will depend very much on how quickly alternative fuels can be made available at much lower prices,” Nicoll noted in an email. “Widespread use also requires the currently stalled interest in ammonia and methanol dual-fuel engines to revive.”

The U.S. is well positioned to produce some of those alternative fuels, said Jonathan Lewis, director of transportation decarbonization at the Clean Air Task Force. But he said he doubted the Trump administration would pursue it.

The LNG angle

George David Banks, who led international climate policy during Trump’s first term, attributed the administration’s animosity toward the IMO measure to its trade agenda.

“It’s pretty clear from the early stages of the administration that the administration was going to root out programs they believed were inconsistent with the president’s agenda or undermined economic security — and climate got caught up in that,” Banks said. “At first glance, they probably look at [the] IMO and think this is an unfair trade practice.”

But Lewis of the Clean Air Task Force sees the climate elements of the IMO deal as more niggling to Trump.

“I think it comes down to the Trump administration’s antipathy toward climate beneficial technologies,” Lewis said. “They don’t see that as something that the United States should pursue.”

The IMO agreement would also frustrate a transition within the maritime sector toward natural gas as a primary shipping fuel, he added.

The agreement wouldn’t ban liquefied natural gas or biofuels, but ships that run purely on LNG would eventually have to pay a penalty. That would likely lead to less LNG use than the Trump administration — and a cohort of prominent shipping companies — would like, said Lightbourn of Cavalier Shipping.

“This is something that is important to the U.S. given that the country has an abundance of natural gas that could be sold as a marine fuel to commercial cargo vessels and be supportive of the domestic oil and gas industry,” he said.

Another point of opposition: the measure stands to benefit China at a time when the U.S. and China — the world’s two largest economies and carbon polluters — are in an ongoing battle over trade and supply chains.

That’s because the net zero measures are expected to stimulate demand for new vessels that can comply with the new regulations, or retrofits of ships to allow for emission-reducing technologies. And China is the world’s largest shipbuilding nation.

What’s next

Climate groups observing the meetings say they expect the measure to pass regardless of U.S. tactics. And, they say, the U.S. knows it.

That has prompted the U.S. delegation to make a last-minute push to alter the rules of adoption.

Here’s how it would work. For the agreement to be adopted, two-thirds of the countries present need to vote in its favor. Over the following months, before the agreement enters into force, those countries can choose to opt out. The IMO considers countries that don’t actively opt out to remain behind the agreement.

The U.S., however, is pushing for “explicit” adoption, where countries will need to come back and voice their support for the agreement before it can take effect.

“That is the Achilles heel,” said Faig Abbasov, shipping program director for Brussels-based clean energy advocacy group Transport & Environment. The change would give the U.S. time, he said, to bully enough countries into not sending their acceptance to the IMO.

Analysts, industry and even climate advocates acknowledge that the IMO’s carbon-cutting measures aren’t perfect. A coalition of major oil tanker companies, including Saudi Arabia’s Bahri, have concerns about the deal, Reuters reported.

Still, many companies see them as necessary for an industry that accounts for around 3 percent of global emissions and growing.

Without them, “shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonization,” a coalition of shipping associations, including the World Shipping Council and the International Chamber of Shipping, said in a letter last week.

Brazil, the host country for next month’s COP30 climate talks, once opposed the IMO agreement. But now the country is hoping the measure will pass.

“We would very much like to see the agreement go forward,” Tatiana Rosito, secretary of international affairs at Brazil’s Ministry of Finance, said in an interview with E&E News. “This would be a very good signal for COP30.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/44/46/435d753a44fea574aee9dc9f4116/panama-canal-47972.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 11:01:57.710953

The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.","As the International Maritime Organization (IMO) prepares to vote this week (October 14-17, 2025) on final adoption of a mandatory Net-Zero Framework (NZF) for reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the global shipping sector, the United States has reiterated its profound disagreement with the NZF. In a joint statement by Secretary of State Rubio, Secretary of Energy Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Duffy entitled ""Taking Action to Defend America from the UN's First Global Carbon Tax – the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) ""Net-Zero Framework,"" the US has leveled specific threats against any countries that vote to adopt the proscriptive mandates of the NZF at this week's meeting of the IMO Maritime Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) Second Extraordinary Session (MEPC /ES.2).

The high-profile animosity of the US to the NZF dates back to the MEPC's 83rd Session (MEPC 83) in April 2025, during which the US delegation dramatically walked out of deliberations in protest of the proposed NZF framework. Notwithstanding this unusual diplomatic maneuver, the proposed NZF was adopted by simple majority vote in MEPC 83 (63 countries approving, 16 rejecting and 24 abstaining), setting forth a two-prong framework for meeting the IMO's goal of net-zero carbon reduction from international shipping by 2050:

A global fuel standard that requires ships to gradually reduce how polluting its ship fuel can be (i.e. how much greenhouse gas is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel's life cycle); and

A pricing mechanism with set prices on the GHG ships emit, to encourage the industry to lower emissions to comply with the global fuel standard.

Shortly after the April vote, the US expressly formalized what the delegation's walkout had implicitly symbolized in an August 2025 statement from the same triumvirate (Secretaries Rubio, Wright and Duffy) reemphasizing the US's fundamental opposition to the NZF: ""Whatever its stated goals, the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organization. These fuel standards would conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale ... Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavor fail.""

And now, ahead of this week's vote to codify the NZF as a final, mandatory framework, the US has doubled down with a specifically enumerated range of punitive sanctions that may be levied against any countries that vote to approve the NZF:

Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations [both ostensibly via the Federal Maritime Commission] to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from US ports;

Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

Imposing commercial penalties stemming from US government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations in favor of the NZF;

Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.

Notably, the above list of potential retributive measures for NZF support came on the same day that the Office of the US Trade Representative issued amendments to its Section 310 Action (""China's Targeting of the Maritime, Logistics, and Shipbuilding Sectors for Dominance""). These dual efforts emphasize the Trump Administration's broad-spectrum focus on leveraging the maritime sector as a means of implementing its policy interests at the international level.

The prior April vote for preliminary approval of the NZF was opposed by 16 countries, consisting of Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the delegations of Bahrain, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, the Russian Federation, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) and Yemen. Prominent among the 63 approving nations were the European Union, China, Japan, Brazil and India.

Heading into this week's decisive approval vote, which will require a ⅔ majority (unlike the prior, preliminary April vote which only required a simple authority), prognosticators have anticipated that the approval block will retain the high-profile nations from April, as well as Canada, the UK, South Korea, Singapore, Chile, and others.

However, it remains to be seen whether and how the US's eleventh-hour ultimatum — forcing those who approve to pay (directly or indirectly) — may affect the voting on what would be an industry-redefining mandate.

President Trump has made it clear that the United States will not accept any international environmental agreement that unduly or unfairly burdens the United States or harms the interests of the American people. Next week, members of the IMO will vote on the adoption of a so-called NZF aimed at reducing global carbon dioxide gas emissions from the international shipping sector. This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world...We will fight hard to protect our economic interests by imposing costs on countries if they support the NZF. Our fellow IMO members should be on notice.

The Times adds that a fifth of the world’s “carbon-offset” forests were hit by wildfires last year.
It also notes that the UK experienced its first official “mega fire”, as well as the worst wildfire season on record.","Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere reached the highest level ever recorded last year, according to a new report by the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), covered by the Associated Press. The newswire reports that CO2 growth rates have “now tripled since the 1960s”, fuelling more extreme weather. It adds that the increase in the global average CO2 concentration from 2023 to 2024 was the highest one-year jump since measurements began in 1957. On top of burning fossil fuels, an increase in wildfires – particularly in South America – contributed to the rise in CO2 levels over the last year, according to Reuters. The Guardian says scientists are also “concerned” about another factor driving the surge in CO2, namely that the natural land and ocean “sinks” that remove the gas from the air are “weakening as a result of global heating”. The last time the planet experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was between three and five million years ago, New Scientist reports. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide, the second and third most important planet-warming greenhouse gases, also reached record levels last year, the Times of India adds.

A separate report finds that CO2 emissions from extreme wildfires increased by 9% last year, reaching the sixth-highest level on record, the Guardian reports. It highlights “catastrophic” fires – exacerbated by climate change – in the forests of Brazil and Bolivia, noting that Africa also experienced such events but “received little international attention”. The Times adds that a fifth of the world’s “carbon-offset” forests were hit by wildfires last year. It also notes that the UK experienced its first official “mega fire”, as well as the worst wildfire season on record. (See Carbon Brief’s in-depth coverage of the “state of wildfires” report.)

MORE ON EMISSIONS

More than 100 countries now see at least 10 more “hot days” a year than a decade ago when the Paris Agreement was signed, according to new analysis covered by the Financial Times.

New research has concluded that Australia’s tropical rainforests are among the first in the world to start emitting more CO2 than they absorb, Agence France-Presse reports.

The Wall Street Journal has an article about plans to update an accounting mechanism known as the “greenhouse gas protocol”, which it says could adversely affect “big-tech” companies due to the way they measure their emissions.

BusinessGreen reports that the world is “unlikely” to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to “well below 2C” amid a “global decline” in government and institutional sustainability scores tracked by the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Brazil’s agricultural sector, the “highest-emitting sector of the economy”, plans to “show off a green image at the upcoming COP30 summit”, according to Bloomberg.

US president Donald Trump’s “campaign” to block agreement on a “net-zero framework” for global shipping appears to be “heading for the rocks”, according to the Financial Times. With agreement on the framework expected this week, there was “increasing support” for the scheme as nations gathered at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) headquarters in London, the newspaper states. The plan, which includes a carbon price on emissions from large ships, was passed by a majority vote earlier this year and would become legally binding if agreed by the Friday deadline, the article explains. The newspaper notes that several smaller Pacific Island nations, which initially abstained on the plan, hoping for something more ambitious, now intend to support it. The Guardian says US officials “have written to countries that support the measure and besieged them with phone calls threatening to impose tariffs”. Contrary to the Financial Times topline reporting, the newspaper says these moves “appear to be having some impact”. The Daily Telegraph reports that the UK will back the proposals “in defiance of Donald Trump”. (See Carbon Brief’s coverage of the framework negotiations from earlier this year.)

The EU is expected to “toughen its trade stance towards China”, requiring Chinese investors in Europe to “transfer technology to local firms…as it formulates a response to Beijing’s latest restrictions on rare-earth exports”, reports the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP). Reuters also covers the story, adding that “European trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said…investment…needed to be ‘real investments’. This meant they created new jobs in the bloc and involved transfers of technology and intellectual property rights.” The potential new rules from the EU, expected next month, would apply to companies “seeking access to key digital and manufacturing markets like cars and batteries, according to people familiar with the plans”, says Bloomberg. Another Bloomberg article says that “overly aggressive rare-earth implementation by China could supercharge efforts to build alternative supply chains, undermining China’s long-term dominance”.

People’s Daily publishes an article in its print edition by Zhou Fengqi, director of the Institute of Ecology and Sustainable Development at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, arguing that only by promoting “green and low-carbon urban development” can China enhance the “quality and efficiency of its urban development”.

A US federal judge in Montana has dismissed a lawsuit filed by young climate activists seeking to block president Donald Trump’s executive orders promoting the expansion of fossil fuels, the Guardian reports. Specifically, the plaintiffs had hoped to block executive orders declaring a “national energy emergency”, seeking to “unleash American energy” and “reinvigorating” the US’s production of coal, the newspaper says. While there was “overwhelming” evidence that climate change affects the young activists, the judge said the request was “unworkable” because it was beyond the judiciary’s power to create environmental policies, the Washington Post explains. The New York Times adds that the judge said the request would require the court to monitor “an untold number” of federal agencies, in order to determine whether their actions contradicted the court’s ruling.

The “pre-COP” summit recently held in Brasilia “anticipated the differences that will arise in Belém, including discussions over fossil fuels and climate finance”, reports Folha de São Paulo. This comes, the newspaper says, after negotiators from Saudi Arabia reacted “strongly” to declarations in favour of “transitioning away” from fossil fuels. However, the summit helped show that the US president “has not dismantled the negotiations”, it adds.

Meanwhile, COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev tells Dialogue Earth that “COP is the best system we have [and] we cannot lose faith in it”. Babayev said that COP29 “laid the groundwork for scaling up climate finance” and that COP30 should “deliver progress on the Baku finance goal and the $300bn finance pledge”.

Elsewhere, a group of Amazon Indigenous peoples have departed from Ecuador to attend COP30, according to Folha de São Paulo. The group will “travel across the rivers of South America to Belém to ask for greater policies and climate finance for communities and the inclusion of their traditional knowledge in climate solutions”, the outlet says. O Globo adds that Afro-descendant peoples will demand political recognition within the UN climate convention.

A UK parliamentary hearing featuring executives from Octopus Energy, EDF and E.On has seen “some of Britain’s biggest energy suppliers” state that the government’s plans to invest in the power system “could drive up consumer bills in the coming years”, Bloomberg reports. The article notes that as the UK targets a clean-power system by 2030, new renewable generation, grid infrastructure and back-up supplies from gas-fired plants will add costs. The company representatives noted that these extra costs could increase bills, even as the wholesale cost of generating electricity falls, the Financial Times explains. The newspaper quotes a government spokesperson stating that they “categorically reject this speculation”, noting that wholesale energy costs remain high and transitioning away from fossil fuels would “bring down energy bills for good”. An executive at Octopus Energy specifically said household energy bills could rise by 20% unless the government takes action to share the burden of these costs, the Guardian says. The Daily Express is among the newspapers taking aim at the government and specifically energy secretary Ed Miliband in its coverage of the parliamentary hearing.

Lloyds Bank is offering people free heat pumps if they take out a mortgage with them, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Equinor has resubmitted a more detailed environmental plan after it had its application to drill the UK’s “controversial” Rosebank oil field overturned earlier this year, according to the Scotsman. Previously, the firm had failed to account for emissions from burning extracted oil from the site west of Shetland, the newspaper explains. The oil company stated that “it did not have direct control or responsibility for the emissions resulting from the combustion of Rosebank’s oil and gas”, it adds. Nevertheless, BBC News reports that Equinor’s assessment shows that products from Rosebank could result in 250m tonnes of emissions. The news outlet compares this to the UK’s annual emissions of 371m tonnes. The oil company also said that these emissions are compatible with international climate targets and a “managed transition” away from fossil fuels, according to the National. The newspaper explains that this new assessment will be used by the UK government to decide whether or not Equinor can begin exploitation of the field.

In a statement, the Cyprus Union of Shipowners (CUS) called for the Cypriot government and other EU member states to vote against the proposal to allow more time for talks aimed at consensus.
The NZF is based on a fee structure on carbon emissions intended to incentivize green-fuel usage.
In addition, there are practical concerns about scaling up the operation of a global carbon fee system and building out IMO's structure to handle its administration, especially in the short timeframe before entry into force, she cautioned.
“The IMO Net-Zero Framework is not perfect.","In the midst of high-stakes negotiations over the future of IMO's emissions rules, Cyprus' influential shipowners have publicly joined the side of the ""nays"" on the Net Zero Framework. In a statement, the Cyprus Union of Shipowners (CUS) called for the Cypriot government and other EU member states to vote against the proposal to allow more time for talks aimed at consensus.

""As currently drafted, the NZF poses a serious threat to the European shipping, economy, and energy security, and also represents a grave danger to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),"" the CUS argued. ""In essence, it represents a multi-billion-euro tax that does not reduce emissions but instead shifts the cost to end-consumers.""

The NZF is based on a fee structure on carbon emissions intended to incentivize green-fuel usage. But as the availability of green fuels on the market in the near term is extremely limited, many operators will likely pay the fee, feeding an IMO-administered fund at an estimated rate of about $10 billion per year (globally). These funds would be used to reward low-emissions ships, pay for green fuel infrastructure and R&D, and to offset the cost effects of the regulation on vulnerable states, notably shipping-dependent island nations.

The shipowners' association criticized the fee and fund plan, calling it a distraction. ""Rather than reducing emissions, the framework diverts critical financial resources away from genuine technological and energy innovation, thereby slowing the transition to cleaner solutions,"" CUS asserted. ""The result will be broad-based price increases, a higher cost of living and intensified inflation.""

CUS warned of specific damage to small European shipowners, which could shrink the size of the EU-linked fleet through sales and early scrapping.

The shipowners' concerns are familiar territory, and can be found elsewhere. Given the absence of near-term alternatives, many operators will likely pay the NZF fees and continue to emit, according to a new review by researchers at Columbia University SIPA. Smaller operators and those on less competitive routes are the most likely to simply pay for compliance and then raise their rates to cover the cost, wrote researcher Evelyne Williams, a former deputy lead negotiator in the U.S. delegation at IMO. In addition, there are practical concerns about scaling up the operation of a global carbon fee system and building out IMO's structure to handle its administration, especially in the short timeframe before entry into force, she cautioned.

The CUS joins a growing list of opponents of the NZF, including the Trump administration, the government of Saudi Arabia, and an international coalition of prominent oil tanker owners. On the pro-NZF side, the International Chamber of Shipping, the European Shipowners Associations and the EU remain publicly supportive, along with a vocal coalition of small island developing states (which have concerns about rising seas).

IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez has presented the agreement as imperfect, but better than the alternative - which he believes to be the proliferation of different regional and national carbon regulations (as found already in Europe). This future would have no carbon regulation role for IMO, and would leave shipping interests with less influence over the use of the carbon fees.

“The IMO Net-Zero Framework is not perfect. However, it provides a balanced basis for our further work,"" Dominguez said in opening remarks this week.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/CUS-EGM-6-OCT-2025.63b840.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 11:02:53.011343

Together, BioLNG and biodiesel could help U.S. agriculture supply flexible, scalable, and sustainable fuel solutions for maritime shipping.","soybeans have fallen 40-50% from recent highs, while production costs remain elevated. A recent National Corn Growers Association survey shows that nearly half of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis. For many, 2025 marks the third consecutive year of negative profitability, threatening both food security and the stability of local economies.

Industry leaders stress that short-term fixes will not be enough. Instead, new and durable demand markets are required to restore profitability for America's farmers. A potential breakthrough may come this October, when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is expected to finalize its Net-Zero Framework, requiring large ocean-going vessels to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beginning in 2027.

This policy will accelerate demand for biofuels; renewable fuels made from plant material, animal waste, and agricultural residues. By 2030, biofuel demand for maritime use could grow by up to 25 million metric tons; one-third of global demand.

""Biofuels represent more than just cleaner energy. They represent a lifeline for U.S. farmers,"" said Ben Kruger, senior vice president, Roeslein Renewables. ""By leveraging our agricultural waste and renewable resources, we can stabilize rural communities while helping the shipping industry decarbonize.""

Among the most promising fuels are:

BioLNG: Produced from manure, crop residues, and food waste, BioLNG is compatible with existing LNG infrastructure and can even achieve negative lifecycle emissions. With over 1 billion tons of agricultural waste generated annually, the U.S. is uniquely positioned to lead in BioLNG production.5

Biodiesel: Derived from animal fats, oilseeds, and used cooking oil, biodiesel offers a near drop-in replacement for marine diesel with minimal retrofitting. Increased demand could equal up to twice the size of Iowa's annual soybean crop, generating new markets for farmers across multiple feedstocks.

Together, BioLNG and biodiesel could help U.S. agriculture supply flexible, scalable, and sustainable fuel solutions for maritime shipping. Projections show these markets could generate $100-200 billion in new farm revenues by 2050, reducing dependence on ad hoc government assistance and strengthening rural economies.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Roeslein_Renewables_2f5ed99b19.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:56:06.984207

Notably, small island developing states, which had previously criticised the framework for not going far enough, also endorsed it during the opening session.
However, opposition came from the US delegation, representing the Trump administration, alongside a few fossil-fuel-reliant nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Its adoption requires a two-thirds majority among the 108 signatory nations, meaning the US alone cannot block it.
“Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in the IMO,” Dominguez told delegates.","The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF) gained strong momentum on the first day of a high-stakes four-day summit in London, with a clear majority of countries voicing support for the plan—despite sharp opposition and threats from the United States delegation.

The NZF aims to establish binding global emissions-reduction measures for the maritime sector, driving a major transition toward green hydrogen-based shipping fuels over the coming decades. According to the Green Hydrogen Organisation, the framework’s implementation would require about 200 million tonnes of green ammonia and methanol by 2040.

All European nations expressed their backing for the framework, which proposes a system of financial penalties for high-emission vessels. The revenues would be channelled into a “net zero fund” designed to reward low-emission ships, foster innovation and training, and provide financial assistance to vulnerable nations. Notably, small island developing states, which had previously criticised the framework for not going far enough, also endorsed it during the opening session.

However, opposition came from the US delegation, representing the Trump administration, alongside a few fossil-fuel-reliant nations such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. According to TradeWinds, around 15 countries raised concerns, while at least 46 nations declared their support—some of which had previously abstained during the April meeting that provisionally approved the NZF draft by 63 votes to 16.

The US was the only country to explicitly reject any regulation of shipping emissions. Saudi Arabia, which initially opposed certain elements, later softened its stance, saying it did not wish to abandon the framework altogether.

The NZF represents an amendment to Annex VI of the IMO’s MARPOL Convention on marine pollution. Its adoption requires a two-thirds majority among the 108 signatory nations, meaning the US alone cannot block it. Nevertheless, American officials have attempted to undermine the process through threats of economic retaliation—including sanctions against officials, port restrictions on ships from supporting nations, higher port fees, visa limitations for seafarers, and other financial penalties.

The US delegation argued that the net zero fund could become “a giant environmental slush fund” and criticised the focus on “expensive and unproven” alternative fuels.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez dismissed these claims, emphasizing that the organisation has long administered international funds—such as oil pollution compensation mechanisms—from its London headquarters. He also warned that delaying adoption would create uncertainty, deterring investment and prompting fragmented regional regulations.

“Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in the IMO,” Dominguez told delegates. “Adopting this plan will ultimately reduce the costs of decarbonisation and provide a coherent global framework.”

Despite the tensions, backers remain confident the framework will be formally adopted and enter into force in 2027.

“I understand that some view this outcome as not ambitious enough, while others fear the reduction targets are too demanding,” Dominguez said. “The IMO Net-Zero Framework may not be perfect, but it offers a balanced foundation to move forward and deliver meaningful progress toward a cleaner, more sustainable shipping industry.”",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Imo-day-1-news-today.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:56:12.774040

For carbon emissions above this cap, the IMO would collect what is effectively a carbon tax, to be held in a green energy fund and used on unspecified projects.
Maritime shipping accounts for only 3% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions, meaning that the IMO regulations will impose a huge burden on the global shipping industry, for only a marginal reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
However, this aspiration lacked the radical plan to achieve this goal through a U.N.-imposed carbon tax.
Proponents for the IMO carbon tax form an unusual coalition of developed European nations and Pacific island nations.","The International Maritime Organization (IMO) will vote this week whether to approve new regulations authorizing them to charge maritime shipping companies for their carbon emissions. The measure would be the first ever carbon tax on maritime commerce and the first ever tax collected directly by a U.N. agency, which is unaccountable to the consumers who must pay higher prices as a result. Before the extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) convened on Tuesday, the Trump administration issued an ultimatum warning countries against voting for the measure.

In a lopsided vote of 63-16, the MEPC approved the 120-page draft regulation during its 83rd session on April 7-11. The regulation implements a “net-zero framework” (NZF) by requiring all maritime shipping to achieve “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, with intermediate targets set for 2030 and 2040.

“Net”-zero carbon emissions is not the same as absolute zero. According to the regulations, ships that emit less carbon gain “surplus units,” while ships that exceed the emission threshold “will have to acquire remedial units,” said the IMO. Operating companies can cover these remedial units by “Transferring surplus units from other ships;?Using surplus units they have already banked; [or] Using remedial units acquired through contributions to the IMO Net-Zero Fund.”

In effect, the IMO regulation would take the “cap-and-trade” scheme used to limit industrial pollutants and apply it to emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas necessary for all plant life on earth. For carbon emissions above this cap, the IMO would collect what is effectively a carbon tax, to be held in a green energy fund and used on unspecified projects.

“This is the first instance we can find of the U.N. claiming the ability to levy a tax — the revenues from which will be paid directly into a U.N.-controlled fund,” wrote The Wall Street Journal editors. “That’s bad enough as an invitation to opaque special dealing and corruption. But the IMO also contemplates using the funds for ‘just-transition initiatives in developing countries’ and to ‘mitigate negative impacts’ of climate change on ‘vulnerable States.’ In other words, this is another income redistribution scheme for whatever ideas the U.N. bureaucracy deems worthy.”

The regulations would impose a two-tier tax of either $100 or $380 (depending on certain factors) per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions, resulting in an estimated $10 billion to $12 billion collected from shipping companies. By 2035, “a mid-size carrier relying exclusively on very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO) … could face more than $1.5 million in additional annual expenses, or 17 to 20% of fuel costs,” according to researchers at Columbia University.

The carbon tax aims to nudge the shipping industry away from fossil fuels by making it so expensive to run fossil fuels that ships powered by non-carbon alternatives become economically viable. Currently, the leading non-carbon alternatives include green ammonia (which is two to four times as expensive as VLSFO), bio-methanol (5.7 times as expensive), and e-methanol (6.3 times as expensive).

Fuel is one of the primary cost inputs for maritime shipping, which accounts for approximately 90% of international trade. Such an increase in shipping costs could raise the cost of imported goods for Americans by up to 10%.

This is a significant impact for very little gain. Maritime shipping accounts for only 3% of man-made carbon dioxide emissions, meaning that the IMO regulations will impose a huge burden on the global shipping industry, for only a marginal reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

The regulations would amend Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), which entered into force on October 2, 1983. Adopted in 2005, Annex VI limits emissions of harmful pollutants such as sulphur oxide, nitrous oxides, ozone-depleting substances, and particulate matter. In 2011, Annex VI was amended with energy efficiency requirements “aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”

While Annex VI of MARPOL does control air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, it does nothing so radical as phasing out fossil fuels. But that is exactly what the new regulations proposed by the MEPC would do.

For decades, U.N. agencies, including the IMO, have been pushing an anti-fossil fuel agenda based in climate ideology, but never to this extent. In 2018, the IMO published a strategy with the 2050 target of cutting in half the carbon emissions level of 2008. In 2023 — with the far-left Biden administration now steering U.S. policy — the IMO updated this strategy with an aspiration to eliminate carbon emissions entirely by the same date. However, this aspiration lacked the radical plan to achieve this goal through a U.N.-imposed carbon tax.

In April, the IMO was already counting its unhatched chickens with a detailed timeline: the new regulations would be officially adopted in October 2025, detailed implementation guidelines would be approved in the spring of 2026, and the regulations would enter into force in 2027, 16 months after adoption. But now, the Trump administration is trying to throw a last-minute wrench into that scheme.

Proponents for the IMO carbon tax form an unusual coalition of developed European nations and Pacific island nations. Low-lying Pacific nations are greatly concerned about rising sea levels, buy into the notion that this phenomenon is connected to manmade carbon emissions, and therefore seek to reduce those emissions to save their island homes.

Meanwhile, European nations have already implemented strict carbon emission standards at home, which puts them at a commercial disadvantage compared to other nations; they see this as an opportunity to level the playing field by imposing Europe-style carbon regulations on other nations. Thus, in a representative statement, Finland declared that the proposed IMO carbon tax would “even out the imbalance in international regulation of maritime emissions and level out the competitive environment, between the EU and the rest of the world.” After the Trump administration warned countries against voting for the plan, the European Union reaffirmed its support.

Perhaps surprisingly, the shipping industry has also endorsed the regulatory scheme. “Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations,” read a joint statement from industry and labor associations on October 9.

In other words, shipping companies would appreciate the convenience of having to meet only one global standard, instead of different regulations in different countries. Or at least the shipping companies operating under stricter standards would like their competitors to bear the same burden. As for the higher costs these regulations would impose on global shipping, this statement proves that the shipping industry expects to pass those higher costs on to consumers.

The statement was signed by most of the world’s shipping industry: the Asian Shipowners’ Association (ASA), European Shipowners (ECSA), International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), International Bunker Industry Association (IBIA), International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), and the World Shipping Council (WSC). The ASA represents approximately 50% of the world merchant fleet, ECSA represents 35%, and the ICS represents over 80%.

On October 10, the day after the industry endorsement, the Trump administration published a full broadside attack on the scheme. In a joint statement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy threatened “actions against nations that support this global carbon tax on American consumers:

“Pursuing investigations and considering potential regulations to combat anti-competitive practices from certain flagged countries and potential blocking vessels registered in those countries from U.S. ports;

“Imposing visa restrictions including an increase in fees and processing, mandatory re-interview requirements and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas;

“Imposing commercial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts including new commercial ships, liquified natural gas terminals and infrastructure, and/or other financial penalties on ships flagged under nations “in favor of the NZF;

“Imposing additional port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework; and

“Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring activist-driven climate policies that would burden American consumers, among other measures under consideration.”

“This will be the first time that a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world,” the statement declared. “The Administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers, or tourists. The economic impacts from this measure could be disastrous.”

The Trump administration had issued a similar, but less detailed, statement of opposition on August 12, arguing that the standards would “conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale. These standards would also preclude the use of proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets, including lower emissions options where U.S. industry leads such as liquified natural gas (LNG) and biofuels.”

In comments submitted to the MEPC, the U.S. again argued that the proposed regulations irrationally penalized low-emission fossil fuels like LNG, as well as decrying the scheme’s excessive revenue accumulation in pursuit of ill-defined goals.

The U.S. is part of another unusual coalition in opposition to the regulations. The nations most opposed to the regulation are oil-producing countries, which includes many of America’s geopolitical adversaries. In the April vote, the 16 countries to oppose the regulations included Iran, Lebanon, Russia, Venezuela, and Yemen.

A coalition of six oil-producing nations submitted their own comment in opposition to the regulation, arguing that tax collection and the creation of a green energy fund is entirely outside of the scope of the MARPOL convention, and there is no prior precedent for a U.N. agency to require financial contributions for the non-compliance of private entities, rather than sovereign parties.

The final outcome remains unclear. The IMO usually operates based upon consensus, but the regulation vote may force it to a rare ballot vote, in which the resolution would need to carry a two-thirds majority to pass.

Thus, the regulation would require support by 72 out of the 108 member states who have ratified MARPOL Annex VI — but only if they all show up. At the April vote, only 79 nations had delegates present for the vote. Since 63 countries already voted for the regulation in April, the U.S. would either need a sizable majority of undecided countries to vote against, or it would need some countries to switch their votes. Reportedly, some countries are considering switching their votes, including Philippines, Turkey, Argentina, and Australia.

While the Trump administration threatens economic sanctions, Saudi Arabia is whipping its own votes against the measure with promises of economic opportunity and other sweeteners. Saudi Arabia may also have offered to pay the travel costs for representatives of countries not present in April, if they will vote against the measure. Such an energetic campaign suggest one thing: either way, the vote will be close.

Ironically, the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization appears poised to hold a rare vote of member countries on an issue without any popular buy-in at all. “Voters are showing their opposition to the net-zero climate agenda whenever they get the chance. But that isn’t stopping the United Nations,” wrote The Wall Street Journal editors. “Yes, this is the definition of taxation without representation. … It’s an attempt by climate-obsessed politicians to entrench their agenda before voters in democracies can kill it.”

The Albanese government is expected to reaffirm its support for the Net Zero Framework at a key vote this Friday during the International Maritime Organization summit in London.

The UN-backed plan, which Australia helped draft and endorsed in April, aims to slash emissions from the global shipping industry by introducing a carbon price and fuel standards starting in 2028.

The framework targets the 3 per cent of global emissions produced by international shipping, steering the sector away from polluting bunker fuel and toward cleaner, renewable alternatives.

But the Trump administration has launched a fierce campaign against the proposal, calling it a 'European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.'

The United States has abruptly withdrawn its delegation from the IMO negotiations, issuing a stern warning to member states over the proposed NZF.

In a fiery statement released on October 10, Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared the U.S. would 'defeat' the plan and cautioned that 'fellow IMO members should be on notice'.

Rubio condemned the NZF as a threat to national sovereignty and economic stability, warning that countries backing the proposal could face serious consequences, including sanctions, visa restrictions, and port levies.

'This framework is a direct assault on American sovereignty and economic interests,' Rubio said.

'It would cripple supply chains and punish American workers.'

He further argued that the NZF would impose a burdensome and unjust global tax regime, affecting not only the U.S. but all IMO member states.

'The NZF proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans, but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided.' Rubio said.

Despite the pressure, Australia is expected to vote in favour of the NZF alongside China, Brazil, Britain, and the European Union.

One of the most vocal domestic supporters of the plan is billionaire Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest, whose company Fortescue has publicly backed the initiative.

'The global shipping sector has demonstrated what can be achieved through courage, conviction, and international cooperation,' Forrest said after the framework was endorsed in April.

Supporters argue the NZF is a critical step toward decarbonising a sector long exempt from climate rules.

By setting a global carbon price, the IMO hopes to create a level playing field and drive investment in green shipping technologies.

Forrest has a major financial stake in the proposal's success, with interests in green ammonia, a fuel alternative for ships.

However, his broader green hydrogen ambitions have faced major setbacks.

Fortescue scrapped projects in Queensland and Arizona, prompting the Queensland government to seek repayment of nearly $66million in public funding.

The company also laid off hundreds of staff and merged its energy division with mining operations.

The diplomatic clash comes just days before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is due to meet President Trump in Washington, setting the stage for a potentially frosty encounter between the two leaders.

When asked to clarify its position, a spokesperson for the Albanese Government did not confirm a definitive stance.

'The Australian Government is committed to reducing emissions in the transport sector as part of our economy-wide goal of reaching net zero by 2050. We will continue to play a constructive role in advancing this important global effort,' the spokesperson told Daily Mail.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/16/02/103028801-0-image-a-44_1760578821298.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 01:56:17.904138

Breadtree Farms start on largest organic chestnut processing facility in the U.S.

The barn doesn’t look like much yet. The white exterior still bears the name of its former owners, the Atwaters, who once packed it with seed potatoes. The dusty interior has been stripped down enough to reveal a timber frame that dates, in part, to the 18th century. In the early days of summer, just shy of the Vermont border in Salem, New York, there’s little more inside than roosting pigeons and 6,000 square feet of empty ground on which to build. But two years from now — or sooner, if Russell Wallack has his way — this will become the largest chestnut processing facility in the country. Get the details at ambrook.com

Produce shippers watch for IMO's net zero emissions vote

Efforts to achieve net zero in international shipping by limiting greenhouse gas emissions are caught in a geopolitical storm this week, as the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) prepares to vote on proposed additions to a globally agreed treaty on pollution.

This could include sanctions against countries seeking to enforce the tax if it comes into force.
Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and other cabinet members issued a statement warning that the impact could be “disastrous” for shipping costs ultimately borne by consumers.
“This will be the first time that a UN organisation levies a global carbon tax on the world,” Rubio said.
It’s encouraging to see the shipping industry rally around a real, binding commitment to drastically reduce these dangerous emissions.","American officials say consumers will be the losers and China, as the world’s largest ship-building nation, will benefit as the tax forces the replacement of seaworthy vessels. With ship emissions representing 3 per cent of harmful global gases, environmental campaigners say the move would be a big win for climate, public health and marine life.

“Being taxed by the UN would be far more offensive than the taxes imposed by Great Britain against the American colonies more than 250 years ago. Those taxes sparked the American Revolution,” said Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, warning of a blow to the state’s maritime industry. “No taxation without representation,” he added.

The US delegate to the talks at IMO headquarters in London warned that the net-zero framework (NZF) was of concern “at the highest levels” of the Trump administration and it would “not hesitate to protect the American people and their economic interests” if the deal receives the two-thirds majority of the 176-member body required to pass. This could include sanctions against countries seeking to enforce the tax if it comes into force.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and other cabinet members issued a statement warning that the impact could be “disastrous” for shipping costs ultimately borne by consumers. They threatened “commercial penalties … on ships flagged under nations in favour of the NZF” including “additional port fees on ships owned, operated or flagged by countries” supporting the framework.

“This will be the first time that a UN organisation levies a global carbon tax on the world,” Rubio said.

“The administration unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers or tourists.”

“The net-zero framework proposal poses significant risks to the global economy and subjects not just Americans but all IMO member states to an unsanctioned global tax regime that levies punitive and regressive financial penalties, which could be avoided.”

Vern Buchanan, a Republican congressman from Florida and vice-chairman of the House of Representatives ways and means committee, said the proposal “raises serious concerns not only about the inflationary nature of the framework but also about its potential to distort global trade … and exacerbate foreign industrial advantages, particularly for China.”

In the global tussle for supremacy between Washington and Beijing, “incentivising the premature retirement of seaworthy ships and driving demand for new construction … would disproportionately benefit China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, further entrenching its dominance in a sector that is vital to US strategic national security interests,” he said.

The framework aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions from ships over 5,000 gross tonnes to net zero by 2050 using mandatory emissions caps and a global carbon-pricing system requiring the purchase of credits for exceeding the limits.

The IMO’s marine environment protection committee passed a draft of the tax in April by 63 votes to 16, with 24 abstaining including several small Pacific island states that said the measure was too weak.

Some are now expected to swing behind on Friday but there are signs the US pressure campaign is changing minds: Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, said it would abstain. “Like the United States, we think there should be a deferral,” he said. “We will not vote against it because we remain strong climate advocates, but this proposal could significantly increase living costs.”

Arsenio Dominguez, the IMO secretary-general, urged nations to vote for the plan or face a patchwork of competing schemes that would eventually cost the industry more. “Prolonged uncertainty will put off investments and diminish confidence in the IMO, your organisation,” he said. “The energy and digital transition of shipping has already begun. However, the absence of global regulations will increase the costs of this transition in the long term.”

Rosie Seville, Britain’s permanent representative to the IMO, reposted a statement by the International Chamber of Shipping on LinkedIn declaring that the NZF was “a unique and historic opportunity for governments to put in place a comprehensive global framework, which will be strictly enforced worldwide, to incentivise the shipping industry’s transition to net-zero emissions whilst ensuring a level playing field”.

Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition, said: “The IMO’s net-zero framework is far from perfect — lacking ambition, proper safeguards against the uptake on unsustainable fuels and failing to provide the levels of guaranteed finance needed for a just and equitable shipping energy transition — but it is a vital step forward by the IMO. It’s encouraging to see the shipping industry rally around a real, binding commitment to drastically reduce these dangerous emissions. What has been missing — until now — is a plan that countries could agree on. This agreement provides a lesson for the world that legally binding climate action is possible — now.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fc5c8e990-4624-4eb2-b3bd-803fd2ae7141.jpg?crop=7952%2C4473%2C0%2C828&resize=1200,N,,2025-10-15 20:56:07.866497

The project, which was first revealed last year, reports that GTT, known for its containment systems and Bloom Energy will lead a joint innovation project to develop an integrated energy system to cover the vessel’s energy needs related to onboard consumption.

“This partnership is a key milestone in developing innovative and efficient ways to capture CO2 and embodies our commitment to finding new solutions to decarbonizing the maritime industry,” said Mathieu Petiteau, Newbuilding and R&D Director of Ponant Explorations Group. “It also marks another step forward for our Swap2Zero vessel project, co-funded by the European Union Innovation Fund and France 2030.”

The Swap2Zero Project was unveiled in 2023 with the goal of developing the first transoceanic ship aimed at carbon neutrality. The concept, which is being designed by firms LMG Marin and Stirling Design, envisions an 181-meter (594-foot) cruise ship with approximately 100 passenger cabins that would use 50 percent wind energy. They project a speed of 10 knots and total autonomy for an endurance of up to 30 days. It would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80 percent. Bureau Veritas is also participating in the project.

In addition to an optimized hull design, the vessel would have more than 1,000 square meters of photovoltaic panels. A low-temperature hydrogen fuel cell with be dedicated to propulsion with recycling of the water and heat produced. A high-temperature fuel cell would be dedicated to the needs of the ship’s hotel and also use heat recovery for hot water production.

In the joint innovation project, GTT will design and develop a marine carbon capture system compatible with Bloom Energy’s SOFC technology. According to the companies, the integrated solution will supply auxiliary electricity for the vessel, covering the hotel load for lights, hot water, and onboard services while capturing CO2 from the exhaust gases. The dual approach, combining emission reduction and the reuse of low-temperature energy from the ship’s cryogenic installations, they report, will further enhance the overall efficiency of the SOFC system through optimized thermal management.

“We see solid oxide fuel cells as a cornerstone of the maritime industry's low-carbon future,” said Aman Joshi, Chief Commercial Officer of Bloom Energy. “By integrating fuel cells with onboard carbon capture and sequestration, this initiative exemplifies how innovation and collaboration can accelerate the transition to cleaner, more sustainable shipping.”

The project was awarded a €40 million grant in 2024 from the EU to develop the designs that would contribute to the decarbonization of the maritime sector. They have said the project will serve as a catalyst for new energy solutions.

Sovereignty and Economic Threat

Buchanan and Blazer frame the vote as a test of “leadership and resolve,” warning that accepting the “unaccountable global tax” would “open the door to further encroachments on our sovereignty and weaken our ability to compete with China.”

They argue that the NZF’s carbon pricing framework, which penalizes vessels based on emissions, would incentivize the premature retirement of ships and drive demand for new construction, disproportionately benefiting China, the world’s largest shipbuilder.

“If we push back, we can protect American jobs, strengthen our supply chains and keep our economy competitive,” the authors wrote.

The Trump administration views the measure as a threat to American economic interests. It asserts that the tax could be “disastrous,” with some estimates forecasting global shipping costs increasing by 10% or more. This increase would ultimately burden U.S. citizens, energy providers, shipping companies, customers, and tourists.

Threat of Retaliation against IMO Members

The IMO Council advanced the global carbon pricing framework proposal in April with a 63 to 16 vote. Next week, IMO members are scheduled to vote on the final adoption of the NZF, which would be the first time a UN organization levies a global carbon tax on the world.

The US State Department has explicitly stated it “will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens” and is considering a range of retaliatory actions against nations that support the “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations.”

Potential measures include:

Port Restrictions: Pursuing investigations, regulations to combat anti-competitive practices, and potentially blocking vessels from supporting nations from U.S. ports.

Commercial Penalties: Imposing financial penalties stemming from U.S. government contracts, including new commercial ships, LNG terminals, and infrastructure.

Visa Restrictions: Imposing increased fees, mandatory re-interview requirements, and/or revisions of quotas for C-1/D maritime crew member visas.

Additional Fees: Imposing new port fees on ships owned, operated, or flagged by countries supporting the framework.

Sanctions: Evaluating sanctions on officials sponsoring “activist-driven climate policies” that burden American consumers.

In June, Congressman Buchanan wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, urging him to treat the proposed tax as a continuation of the non-market tactics identified in the Section 301 investigation into China’s shipbuilding sector.

The US will oppose a UN proposal to impose what it calls the world’s ""first global carbon tax,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday, warning that the measure would raise prices in key areas worldwide.

""This week, the UN is attempting to pass the first global carbon tax, which will increase energy, food, and fuel costs across the world. We will not allow the UN to tax American citizens and companies,"" Rubio said on US media company X.

He added that under President Donald Trump’s leadership, the US ""will be a hard NO,"" urging other countries to ""stand alongside the US in defense of our citizens and sovereignty.""

The remarks come ahead of next week’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) vote on adopting a Net-Zero Framework (NZF) — a policy that would impose a global levy on shipping emissions to reduce carbon output.

In an earlier joint statement with Energy Secretary Doug Wright and Transportation Secretary John Duffy, Rubio said the administration ""unequivocally rejects this proposal before the IMO and will not tolerate any action that increases costs for our citizens, energy providers, shipping companies and their customers.""
