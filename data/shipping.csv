Olsen Cruise Lines hosted a pivotal roundtable discussion aboard the Borealis on 12th November 2025, inviting UK government officials and energy sector leaders to explore the future of the cruise industry in a low-carbon world. The event, held at Portsmouth International Port Cruise Terminal, provided a platform for key stakeholders to delve into the critical steps needed to achieve net zero emissions in the cruise sector.

The gathering, facilitated by the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), united experts from across various sectors, including the Energy Networks Association, Ofgem, the National Energy System Operator, and officials from the Department for Transport and the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero. The roundtable was part of an ongoing dialogue aimed at identifying actionable solutions to accelerate the cruise industry’s shift towards sustainable practices.

A Collaborative Approach to Decarbonizing the Cruise Sector

The roundtable centred on the cruise industry’s ambitious net zero target by 2050, in line with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2023 strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions from maritime vessels. CLIA, which led the discussions, emphasized the importance of cross-industry collaboration in shaping a sustainable future for cruising.

A major focus was the industry’s transition to cleaner energy, specifically the role of Onshore Power Supply (OPS) systems. OPS technology enables cruise ships to draw electricity directly from the shore grid while docked, thus eliminating the need for onboard diesel generators and significantly reducing emissions while at port.

Portsmouth’s Role in the Green Transition

One of the most significant initiatives highlighted was the installation of OPS at Portsmouth, where a new system is being rolled out. The project is expected to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 20,000 metric tonnes annually starting in 2027. This effort aligns with the UK’s broader decarbonisation goals and marks a key milestone in advancing sustainable energy solutions for the cruise industry.

The roundtable discussions underscored that transitioning to OPS and other clean technologies is vital for reducing the environmental impact of the cruise sector. As the industry embraces innovative energy solutions, the partnership between government, energy stakeholders, and cruise operators will play a central role in meeting the ambitious sustainability targets set for the coming decades.

The collaboration fostered at Portsmouth reflects the shared commitment to reducing the cruise industry’s carbon footprint and further establishes the UK as a leader in green maritime technology.

Mike Sellers, Director at Portsmouth International Port, commented: “It’s evident there is a real appetite for sustainable fuel technology. While delivering this innovative system is not without its challenges, it was great to know that there’s a support and willingness for this to be a success.”

Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines has pledged to incorporate Onshore Power Supply (OPS) on its sister ships, Borealis and Bolette, wherever possible, while continuing to invest in low-carbon technologies aimed at shaping a more sustainable cruising future. Recent enhancements to the vessels include the application of silicone-based hull coatings and the installation of advanced propeller systems, both designed to improve hydrodynamic efficiency and optimize fuel performance.

During the event, attendees were also given the exclusive chance to explore behind the scenes aboard the Borealis, with guided tours that included the Engine Control Room, Shore Power Room, Recycling Centre, and the Bridge. These tours offered valuable insight into the cruise line’s operations and the sustainability initiatives being adopted to reduce its environmental footprint.

Samantha Stimpson, CEO of Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, said: “We are proud to have hosted this important discussion aboard Borealis and help shape the cruise industry’s path toward net zero emissions. Achieving net zero by 2050 is ambitious, which makes events like this vital for identifying practical strategies and collaborative solutions.

“For us, sustainability is more than a goal – it’s a responsibility. By adopting solutions such as shore power and working hand in hand with government and industry partners, we can make meaningful progress in reducing our impact and protecting the oceans we sail and the destinations we’re privileged to visit.”

Andy Harmer OBE, Managing Director of CLIA UK & Ireland, added: “The Roundtable hosted onboard Borealis was a great opportunity to discuss the importance of Onshore Power Supply which is a crucial component of our industry’s decarbonisation journey. Over 50% of the global cruise fleet is already able to plug in, allowing ships to turn off their engines for emissions reductions of up to 98%.

“CLIA has a vital role in bringing industry together with Governments, raising the importance of environmental technologies and practices so that we can work together in our pursuit of net zero emissions by 2050.”

The event highlighted the crucial role of collaboration between cruise lines, ports, and government bodies in reaching decarbonisation goals and the overarching target of achieving net zero emissions. Industry-wide, operators are implementing strategies like Onshore Power Supply (OPS), alternative fuels, and energy-efficient technologies to drive faster progress towards these objectives.

Despite progress, Soga argued that the main challenge remains the high cost of green ammonia.
""Green ammonia, specifically blue or green ammonia, is still much more expensive than traditional options.
Soga sees these grey ammonia plants to play a foundational role in the development of blue and green ammonia plants in the future.","Japanese shipping firm NYK Group sees ammonia-fuelled ships to be the core of its plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The company is already gaining ammonia expertise by operating its ammonia-fuelled tugboat -Sakuyake, Takaya Soga, president and CEO of NYK, said at the opening of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 on Monday.

""The development and introduction of ammonia-fuelled vessels is positioned as our main scenario,"" Soga said at the event.

""We see ammonia as a core next-generation marine fuel.""

The firm has previously talked of other alternative marine fuels including methanol and LNG as being under consideration for its decarbonisation plans.

The Sakuyake had completed a three-month demonstration voyage in March 2025, during which it achieved a GHG emission reduction of up to 95%.

Ammonia is recognized for its ability to produce zero harmful emissions, making it a key solution for decarbonization in the shipping industry, he said.

Soga said that NYK is also advancing operational expertise to handle ammonia safety.

He highlighted the ship-to-ship ammonia cargo transfer that took place between the NYK-owned ammonia carrier Berlian Ekuator and Eco Enchanted off Spain in September 2025.

""This achievement demonstrates the safety and the practicality of large-scale ammonia transportation,"" Soga said.

Despite progress, Soga argued that the main challenge remains the high cost of green ammonia.

""So the foundation for using ammonia as a marine fuel is in place, but the main barrier right now is cost,"" Soga said.

""Green ammonia, specifically blue or green ammonia, is still much more expensive than traditional options.

""On the other hand, currently, numerous grey ammonia plants exist globally.""

Soga sees these grey ammonia plants to play a foundational role in the development of blue and green ammonia plants in the future.

""To overcome the cost of the barrier, we need to accelerate clean ammonia development to enable mass production and drive down costs,"" he concluded.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_1444e6cb8c621deb817b1d8f3b9ffe8b.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 10:57:12.194559

The theme for Hong Kong Maritime Week, “Navigating to a Greener Future,” signals a shared destination for the industry. Complementing this, the theme of the World Maritime Merchants Forum, “Steering Sustainability Through Changes,” serves as a navigational chart for the journey ahead. Together, the themes aim to serve as a warning and a call for coordinated action.

In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action.

…said John Lee.

According to the Chief Executive, in this era of profound and complex transformation, Hong Kong’s role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of “one country, two systems” remains the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s success, providing a foundation for continued development.

As the nation’s only bilingual common law jurisdiction, Hong Kong offers a simple and low tax regime, free-port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

Furthermore, for the sixth consecutive year, the city has ranked fourth globally in the International Shipping Centre Development Index, reflecting strengths in port infrastructure, maritime services and the overall operating environment.

According to Lee, Hong Kong’s tax concession regime for high value-added maritime services continues to attract global businesses. Additionally, plans are also underway to extend half-rate tax concessions to physical commodity traders, further integrating the pillars of trade, commodities and shipping within the city.

Green transition

Beyond its business-friendly foundations, Hong Kong is firmly oriented towards the future, particularly the imperative of green growth which is the defining challenge and opportunity of this generation, according to Lee.

With the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework (IMO NZF) targeting net-zero carbon emissions in international shipping by around 2050, Hong Kong aims to play a leading role as a premier green maritime fuel-bunkering centre.

Since publishing our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering a year ago, we have materialised regular commercial liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkering. Our vision is to become the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. And our proximity to the Chinese Mainland, the world’s largest producer of green maritime fuel, is a critical advantage.

…John Lee highlighted.

As explained, the city’s long-term vision is to serve as the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. The proximity to the Chinese Mainland provides a critical strategic advantage and collaboration with maritime associations and business partners worldwide will continue to drive the transition toward sustainability.

Call for collaboration

Collaboration on an unprecedented scale is essential, particularly in the face of geopolitical tensions, trade protectionism, technological disruption and the climate crisis, issues far too extensive for any single economy to resolve alone.

Let’s work together to build green shipping corridors and digital trade lanes that will define the future of safe, efficient and sustainable global shipping.

…Lee noted.

John Lee reaffirmed that Hong Kong stands prepared to serve as a committed partner, through policy support, professional expertise and strategic vision as the city is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in navigating the next era of global shipping and advancing a more sustainable and collaborative future.

Together, we can steer a course towards a more sustainable, prosperous and collaborative future.

The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee met in a special session in October to approve the NZF that laid a pathway to net zero shipping by 2050, and which was finally agreed in April this year.

Prior to the October Extraordinary Session at the IMO US officials aided by Saudi Arabian representatives had made efforts to scupper the NZF in its entirety, threatening nation states with reprisals if they voted for the regulations.

IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez remained upbeat believing that the NZF would be passed, but ultimately it was agreed to delay its implementation by a year.

In a panel discussion organised by the IMO’s head of climate action Roel Hoenders and moderated by Lloyd’s Register’s Katherine Palmer, at COP30, an audience member asked, “how we will prevent another debacle at the following MEPC-ES2?”

Andrew Forrest responded: “The IMO did not fail. Thugs who, knowing that they had lost on the inside, reverted to gangster tactics outside the building, threatening countries and individuals.”

According to Forrest the solution to defeating these subversives was transparency.

“Expose the thugs. If we let the world know what they're doing as they're doing it, they will lose their power.”

He added that he and others would do what they could to indemnify those under threat.

Australian miner Fortescue has thrown its weight behind green ammonia as the way forward to decarbonise shipping and transport operations.

The maritime industry, however, remains divided with those closer to consumers, such as container ship operators, generally for a global regulation and those that operate general cargo vessels, such as tankers and bulk operators against.

The World Shipping Council along with the International Chamber of Shipping and three other industry bodies released a statement shortly after the Extraordinary Meeting in October backing the IMO.

“Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation,” said the letter.

Meanwhile, speaking at October’s Cyprus Maritime conference Greek shipping magnate George Procopiou told the audience: “It is the first time that shipowners and environmentalists are aligned, all of us want less pollution. But he added, no green fuels are available. “If there is a good quality fuel that makes less emissions, tell us where to buy it.”

Madadh MacLaine, the Secretary-Generalat Zero Emission Ship Technology Association told Seatrade Maritime News: ""Shipping needs to accept the fact that we cannot continue to pollute the ocean. We've crossed the planetary boundary for ocean acidification, and yet shipping continues the fantasy of using so called “ZNZ” fuels that release CO2 and other toxins into the atmosphere and marine environment.”

MacLaine added: “The ocean is the Earth's regulatory system, covering more than 70% of its surface. Shipping views it as a means for trade, but over 3 billion people rely on it for food—and all of us rely on it for oxygen.

The guidance acknowledges the growing complexity and rising costs of regulatory compliance, challenges that are particularly acute for small and medium-sized operators. It provides practical procedures to help manage expenditure while progressing towards net-zero operations. Among the recommended measures are incremental improvements in energy efficiency, staged transitions to alternative fuels, and selective fleet renewal or retrofitting, enabling shipowners to mitigate financial risk and avoid assets becoming prematurely obsolete. By aligning investment decisions with operational performance and evolving market expectations, owners can bolster commercial resilience and secure their long-term competitiveness.

A key message is the need for decarbonisation to become integral to strategic planning rather than a parallel exercise. This involves closely linking compliance requirements with fleet investment and financing decisions, supported by a lifecycle approach that considers renewal, retrofits, and operational efficiency as interconnected elements.

A phased approach to fleet decarbonization is essential, and shipping companies should develop a strategic approach across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons, the guide highlights.

Shipping’s decarbonization journey continues despite the postponement at the IMO. The reality is that energy efficiency and fuel flexibility or readiness are still considered and implemented on vessels. Continuing on this course will maintain competitiveness and contribute to the sector’s long-term decarbonization goals.

…said Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO, DNV Maritime, noting that the collaboration with WMMF on this guide is itself a testament to the importance of working together to pave the way for successful decarbonization.

Shipowners are urged to embed decarbonization into their core business strategies. This includes linking compliance with fleet investment and financing, while adopting a lifecycle approach to fleet management that balances renewal, retrofits and operational optimization.

Furthermore, structured competence development and robust change management are essential to building organizational capability and supporting sustainable growth. By leveraging partnerships across the value chain and investing in digitalization and data governance, companies can enhance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term efficiencies.

The Net-Zero Guide offers the industry a wealth of practical reference cases in a complex transition environment, helping shipping companies strike a balance between short-term operations and long-term emissions reduction.

“Supplying renewable bio-LNG to TT-Line’s ferries allows us to contribute to lower emissions in shipping,” said Markus Pille, Managing Director of EnviTec Energy.

The move comes in response to the EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation, which sets mandatory limits on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels used on ships over 5,000 gross tonnes in commercial passenger or freight service.

The rules remain in effect while the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has delayed its decision on a global “Net Zero Framework,” which would have introduced a CO₂ pricing system and a pathway for shipping to reach climate neutrality by 2050.

Torben Nikolay, CFO of TT-Line, noted that Peter Pan and her sister ship Nils Holgersson are the largest LNG-powered Ro-Pax ferries worldwide.

“These ships go beyond simply meeting regulatory requirements. We aim to prepare our fleet for a more sustainable future. Earlier this year, we carried out several bio-LNG deliveries by bunker barge, and this agreement with EnviTec allows us to refuel by truck as well,” he said.

TT-Line operates routes connecting German Baltic ports at Travemünde and Rostock with Świnoujście in Poland and Klaipėda in Lithuania, as well as southern Swedish ports including Trelleborg and Karlshamn.

​Following are the closing remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Mr Grimaldi (Chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Mr Emanuele Grimaldi), your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, all the distinguished guests that have come to this summit today,

Good afternoon. As we bring this impactful Summit to a close, may I express my gladness seeing that our discussions in the past two days have powerfully demonstrated how our global maritime community is navigating shared challenges - from trade realignment and supply chain resilience to financing our industry’s future. These dialogues have been frank and collaborative, as to be seen from our closed-door session yesterday as well as today's sessions, reflecting our common goal and the spirit of partnership we all value. During the summit, we have heard a number of buzzwords: fragmentation, deglobalisation, protectionism, unpredictability, collaboration, partnership and most important of all - solutions.

Scene setting

In an era of volatility, isolation or unilateralism is certainly not the solution. It must be forged through partnership. The government's role is not to direct, but to enable - to build the fundamental and foundational backbone that allows the private sector to innovate, invest and thrive. This philosophy underpins our recent establishment in Hong Kong of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB) under the able leadership of the Honourable Dr Moses Cheng (Chairman of the HKMPDB, Dr Moses Cheng Mo-chi), ensuring government and industry work as co-pilots in shaping our maritime future.

Guided by this principle and bolstered by our nation's strong support, Hong Kong adopts a clear dual strategy: reinforcing the resilience of our local maritime ecosystem, while expanding opportunities in the Chinese Mainland and in the rest of the world.

First, we are enhancing both our port competitiveness and world-class maritime services. Our port's efficiency remains a key advantage, with vessel-handling speeds nearly double the global average - earning us the ""catch-up port"" reputation. We are capitalising on this by establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal system to extend our cargo hinterland into inland provinces of the Chinese Mainland. Meanwhile, we are not only driving digital and green transformation through launching a new Port Community System for real-time cargo tracking amongst all stakeholders, we are also working, with the port operators, toward reducing our Kwai Tsing Container Terminals' carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

Complementing our port assets, we have an unparalleled cluster of over 1 200 shipping and maritime service companies, including the world's top ship managers, major protection and indemnity clubs and leading financers, as supported by one of the world’s largest fleets by gross tonnage flying the Hong Kong flag. To future-proof this leadership, we are streamlining our shipping registry procedures, enhancing tax incentives for the ship lessors and shipping commercial principals as well as introducing tax concessions for commodity traders, with legislative amendments coming right next year. Further, we will strengthen collaboration with international marine insurance organisations to upscale the training of marine insurance talents, whilst expanding the scope of the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund to cover more green energy courses, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong maritime strengths.

Secondly, we are proactively forging international partnerships to unlock new growth potential and solidify our role as a global ""super connector"". To counter protectionism, we are building partner port relationships with strategic ports in the Chinese Mainland and key Belt and Road regions for enhancing mutual competitiveness and resilience. Do expect our announcement of the first batch of our partner ports shortly later today. At the same time, central to this strategy is the Hong Kong Maritime Week itself, including the ICS World Trade Summit - our cornerstone platform for deepening international exchanges and collaboration. Every November, this gathering transforms our city into a vital nexus where global industry leaders converge to shape and drive positive changes for the future of the maritime trade. I am excited to share with you that we will be welcoming the Silk Road Maritime Association's summit one year from now during Hong Kong Maritime Week 2026, so stay tuned. This event and the week-long event will foster a strategic dialogue to unlock new opportunities in Belt and Road shipping for Hong Kong and the global community.

Despite the postponement in the IMO(International Maritime Organization)'s schedule, which we touched upon a lot during these two days, we, in Hong Kong remain steadfast in advancing our pace to strengthen and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international green maritime fuel bunkering and trading hub. Our prime location at the southern tip of China places us at the crossroads of international fairways, ideal for serving the global shipping community's bunkering needs. We rank seventh globally in shipping fuel bunkering, second in China and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Since the first LNG (liquefied natural gas) bunkering operation in February this year, over 200 000 metric tonnes of biodiesel and LNG have been bunkered in Hong Kong, involving a total of 13 LNG bunkering operations. Having established biodiesel and LNG bunkering, we are pioneering the next-generation fuels - including methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen. We will commence feasibility studies for ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and mandate mass flow meters for methanol operations by next year. Further, leveraging our nation's green fuel supply advantages and Hong Kong's robust financial infrastructure, we are developing a global green maritime fuel trading centre, hosting various matchmaking events to catalyse supply chains and support our nation in reinforcing its leadership in this emerging sector.

The geopolitical landscape today affirms that the old rulebook is being rewritten. In this new chapter, Hong Kong's value proposition under ""one country, two systems"" becomes more relevant than ever after - offering a stable, sophisticated common law platform with a trusted legal framework, free flow of capital and information, as well as professional expertise that de-risks global trade. Hong Kong is here to serve and facilitate you to not just navigate today's challenges, but seize tomorrow's opportunities.

Ladies and gentlemen, while this Summit is about to conclude, I trust that the collaboration and dialogue will go on. As Hong Kong Maritime Week continues with other events, I look forward to welcoming you there.

Thank you to the ICS, our co-organisers, and all of you for your invaluable contributions. Congratulations to the ICS for, once again, hosting and staging such a successful summit this year. I wish you a productive remainder of your time in Hong Kong and enjoy the buzz and the nice weather outside of the Asia's World City. Thank you.

Speech by CE at Opening Ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 cum World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025

Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Opening Ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 cum World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025 today (November 17):

Honourable Vice Chairman C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Honourable Director Zhou Ji (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government (CPG) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Vice Minister Fu Xuyin (Vice Minister of Transport), Deputy Head Chen Feng (Deputy Head, Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR), Acting Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR), Chairman Miao Jianmin (Chairman of China Merchants Group), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. A very warm welcome to Hong Kong, Asia's world city, and to the opening of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 and the fifth World Maritime Merchants Forum, which bring together our maritime cluster, and underline Hong Kong's status as one of the world's leading maritime centres.

The theme for the Hong Kong Maritime Week, ""Navigating to a Greener Future"", signals our shared destination. Complementing this, the theme of the World Maritime Merchants Forum, ""Steering Sustainability Through Changes"", is our navigational chart for the journey ahead.

In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action.

In this era of profound and complex transformation, Hong Kong's role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of ""one country, two systems"" is the cornerstone of our success, providing us with an unshakeable foundation.

As our country's only bilingual common law jurisdiction, Hong Kong offers a simple and low tax regime, free port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

Our standing is consistently acknowledged, and endorsed, by the international community. For the sixth consecutive year, Hong Kong ranked fourth, globally, in the International Shipping Centre Development Index. This pays tribute to our strengths in port infrastructure, maritime services and overall operating environment.

Hong Kong is home to more than 1 200 port and maritime-related companies, a thriving cluster of global leaders in ship management, finance, insurance and law. The Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association's launch ceremony, in just a few minutes, will mark a milestone development, further enriching our maritime services and reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

Our tax concession regime for high value-added maritime services continues to attract global businesses. And we are planning to extend half-rate tax concessions to physical commodity traders, further integrating the critical pillars of trade, commodities and shipping here in Hong Kong.

Beyond our business-friendly foundations, our focus is firmly on the future. And the imperative for green growth is the defining challenge, and opportunity, of our generation.

With the International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework targeting to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in international shipping by around the year 2050, Hong Kong is determined to be at the forefront, as a premier green maritime fuel-bunkering centre.

Since publishing our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering a year ago, we have materialised regular commercial liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkering.

Our vision is to become the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. And our proximity to the Chinese Mainland, the world's largest producer of green maritime fuel, is a critical advantage. We will continue to collaborate with maritime associations and business partners globally to drive the transition towards sustainability.

Indeed, collaboration on an unprecedented scale is essential as we face challenges from geopolitical tensions, trade protectionism, technological disruption, and the climate crisis - issues too vast for any single economy to solve alone.

Let's work together to build green shipping corridors and digital trade lanes that will define the future of safe, efficient and sustainable global shipping.

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is ready to be your partner. Our policy support, expertise, strategic vision and unwavering commitment can play a pivotal role in navigating the next era of shipping. Together, we can steer a course towards a more sustainable, prosperous and collaborative future.

I wish you all a rewarding Hong Kong Maritime Week, a productive World Maritime Merchants Forum, and fair winds and following seas, in business as in life.

Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Dr Emanuele Grimaldi (Chair of the International Chamber of Shipping), Your Excellencies, Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a pleasure to welcome you all to the second Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit, co-hosted by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, and the newly formed Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board.

This important event brings together more than 300 global maritime leaders from some 30 economies for vital dialogue and collaboration. Your presence speaks to the global significance of the discussions here.

I would like to thank the ICS for once again choosing Hong Kong to host this pivotal summit, casting a strong vote of confidence in us as an international maritime centre. Representing over 80 per cent of the world's merchant fleet, your leadership in shaping the global maritime agenda is unparalleled.

Building Resilience in an Age of Transformation

The theme of this Summit - ""Building Resilience, Driving Growth and Investment"" - speaks directly to our moment. Global maritime trade is no doubt facing headwinds: geopolitical tensions, tariff escalations, and new trade barriers are reshaping shipping routes and disrupting established patterns. The UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) Review of Maritime Transport 2025 forecasts seaborne trade growth of merely 0.5 per cent this year, down from 2.2 per cent in 2024 - the slowest pace in years. Vessel rerouting has pushed ton-miles to record levels, forcing ships to travel longer distances at higher cost.

Yet this is not necessarily a story of decline, but of transformation. Allow me to offer three observations.

Shifting maritime trade patterns

First, in my view, geopolitics will reshape rather than weaken maritime trade flows. Consider China. It has stood as the world's largest manufacturing economy for 15 consecutive years, commanding close to 30 per cent of global manufacturing output. It has an industrial ecosystem spanning the entire classification of industrial categories recognised by the United Nations. Despite talk of supply chain diversification, no country possesses China's completeness, scale, efficiency or integrated capacity. Indeed, supply chain reconfiguration arising from trade tensions is creating a complementary, not substitutional, relationship across the region.

While Southeast Asian nations are attracting more investments and manufacturing activities, in this process, they are reinforcing the two-way trade flow with China, in raw materials, components, semi-finished goods and finished products. As a matter of fact, China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) trade reached a record of some US$690 billion in the first eight months of 2025. Hong Kong, as a key re-export hub, has witnessed substantial growth in this business.

As a manufacturer, China will continue to demand vast quantities of raw materials and components from Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific (like Australia). Meanwhile, as a consumer market of 1.4 billion people with a rapidly expanding middle income group, China will drive continued growth in the import of food, fashion, electronics, and more.

At the same time, Southeast Asia, with approximately 700 million people with a median age of 32, is experiencing a significant demographic dividend. More importantly, their incomes are rising substantially. By 2030, ASEAN will contribute 140 million new consumers, representing 16 per cent of the world's new consumer class.

Beyond Asia, the broader Global South, currently accounting for 18 per cent of global GDP, is projected to grow at 4.2 per cent annually through 2029. By 2033, South-South trade is expected to approach US$14 trillion.

I believe this economic dynamism will be reshaping maritime trade. Intra-regional trade is emerging as a powerful engine of growth. Intra-Asia container volumes are projected to reach more than 42 million TEUs (Twenty Equipment Unit) by 2028, representing 3.8 per cent growth per year, outpacing the global average.

The maritime sector itself is evolving, too. Intra-regional trade is driving demand for smaller, fuel-efficient vessels optimised for short-sea shipping. Scheduling patterns are also shifting to accommodate new supply chains and regional trade growth. Bulk commodities remain dominant in seaborne trade, and containerised cargo - including consumer electronics, automotive components, and renewable energy products - is experiencing robust growth, particularly in intra-Asia routes.

Decarbonisation as both imperative and opportunity

My second observation is that decarbonisation of maritime operations is both an imperative and opportunity. The IMO (International Maritime Organization) has set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050. This is not environmental aspiration alone. It is regulatory reality.

To this end, the liner shipping industry is making substantial progress, with 79 per cent of the deadweight tonnage of container and vehicle carriers capable of operating on renewable fuels. Yet scaling green fuel production and creating financial mechanisms to support adoption remain challenging. It requires strong political commitment and cross-sectoral collaboration.

The opportunity is substantial. Maritime decarbonisation represents a multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunity through 2050. The transition to zero-emission marine fuels could create up to 4 million jobs globally across the energy supply chain. Here in Hong Kong, we are embracing this. For example, we have published an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, positioning ourselves as a regional hub for sustainable fuel supply. Our goal is to provide bunkering services for green fuels to ocean-going vessels more than 60 times per year by 2030, involving over 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels.

Harnessing digital transformation

My third observation is on technology's transformative power. Ports and global container lines are commonly deploying artificial intelligence, blockchain and advanced data analytics to improve operational efficiency, optimise routes, and reduce downtime and carbon emissions. This is where Hong Kong also comes in, with our vibrant technology and startup community. Many of them are pioneering innovations in smart logistics. They can play a role not only in supporting our own transformation but also in serving the broader region.

Technology is also reshaping what is shipped and how. As consumer preferences shift and companies adopt new production methods, the mode of maritime trade also evolves. Consumers are now preferring sustainable, traceable products, driving demand for supply chain solutions that can verify environmental and social credentials in real time. Besides, the speed of technology adoption in operation and management will determine competitive success in this decade. Those who are able to digitalise their operations will reduce costs, capture market share, and be better able to meet the expectations of increasingly sophisticated customers and regulators.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, the maritime industry stands at a pivotal moment. Geopolitical fragmentation, shifting patterns of global commerce, climate imperatives and technological advancement are formidable forces. Yet they create opportunity precisely because they demand agility, innovation and vision.

Yes, the currents are shifting, and the waters may be uncharted. But like the explorers in the Age of Discovery, there lies tremendous opportunity for those with the vision to navigate with strategy, courage and conviction. I am convinced that the voyage ahead is one of extraordinary growth for those who are willing and ready.

On this note, I wish you all a most rewarding Summit, and the best of health and business in the time ahead.

And for those of you coming from afar, I would like to appeal to you: don’t just work, but enjoy the city. We have wonderful hiking trails, beaches, about 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants, great museums, and above all, we don’t impose duty on wine! And remember to shop till you drop! Thank you.

This year’s Forum took place with physical attendance at the Eugenides Foundation and was broadcast live worldwide, attracting hundreds of viewers and Members from the Institute’s 27 international Branches.

In her opening remarks, Ms. Natalia Margioli-Komninou, Managing Director of HMC & ICS Greek Branch, reflected on the Branch’s 20-year journey of promoting education and professionalism. She highlighted its vital role in shaping generations of maritime professionals through knowledge-sharing and networking. Ms. Margioli emphasized the importance of the ICS community – a network built on trust, respect, and a shared passion for shipping – and presented two major new initiatives; The Company Membership Scheme allows organizations to connect, access professional training, and tap into ICS’s global network, creating growth opportunities for both individuals and companies. The partnership with the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) offers management and leadership programmes that equip professionals with essential soft skills for success in today’s global markets.

Both aim to foster leadership development and enhance the professional capacity of individuals and organizations within the maritime industry. She concluded by reaffirming the Branch’s mission to continue growing alongside the sector and to uphold its core values of learning, collaboration, and excellence.

In his welcome address, Mr. Nikolas Tsavliris, Chairman of the ICS Greek Branch, spoke with heartfelt emotion and deep respect, describing the 20th ICS Annual Forum as not only a milestone but a moment for gratitude and reflection. He underlined the Forum’s role as a platform for meaningful discussion in today’s complex and fragmented world. Drawing inspiration from the original Greek concept of dialogos, Mr. Tsavliris highlighted that dialogue is not a contest of opinions, but a shared pursuit of understanding, the very essence of the ICS mission.

The panel discussion, moderated with great insight by Mr. Simon Ward, FICS, Director, Ursa Shipbrokers, brought together a distinguished lineup of speakers:

Mr. Polys V. Hajioannou, Chairman & CEO, Safe Bulkers Inc., and President, Cyprus Union of Shipowners

Mr. George G. Mangos, Principal, Interunity Group

Ms. Ismini Panagiotidi, CEO & Founder, Pavimar S.A. and Icon Energy Corp.

Ms. Milena Pappa, Board Member & Commercial Director, Star Bulk Carriers Corp.

Mr. Thanasis Martinos, Managing Director of Eastern Mediterranean Maritime Ltd., contributed to the forum via a pre-recorded video message.

The conversation covered key pillars shaping the shipping industry today — market outlook, geopolitics, environmental regulation (IMO & emissions), and professional development.

In his remarks, Mr Martinos noted that shipping is going through challenging times, and highlighted early indications that freight rates for VLCCs, Capesize bulk carriers, and container ships are expected to be higher next year. He added that he believes future freight market forecasts will become increasingly accurate as AI-enhanced econometric modeling continues to evolve.

Mr Hajioannou highlighted that many shipowners remain skeptical of the current IMO Net-Zero Framework and emphasized the long-term strategic impact of China’s dominance in shipbuilding. He stressed the need for coordinated dialogue among leading maritime nations to manage this structural imbalance. He also described shipping as a dynamic industry offering exceptional opportunities for professional growth. Mr Mangos cautioned against adopting unrealistic decarbonisation targets and noted that geopolitical volatility makes long-term commercial planning challenging. He highlighted the differing capacities of the liner and tramp sectors to influence global policy and stressed the importance of navigating market interdependencies carefully.

Ms Pappa focused on the technical and regulatory challenges facing decarbonisation, including green fuel incentives, lifecycle assessments, and fuel costs. She highlighted progress made through engine efficiency improvements but stressed the need for modern port infrastructure and scalable alternative fuels. Last, she highligted that personal integrity and transparency, alongside technical competence, are essential for anyone seeking a career in shipping. Ms Panagiotidi noted how commercial decision-making now requires constant adaptation to geopolitical uncertainty. She added that shipowners have historically had to make decisions under disruption, and recent developments have further shaken traditional decision-making frameworks in the industry. She observed that formal qualifications remain essential, but success increasingly depends on navigating complex markets with skill and foresight.

Pacific Environment’s climate policy director, Davina Hurt, said, “Now is the time to act”.","Following last month’s one year delay to the Net Zero Framework (NZF) NGO’s are demanding that governments take decisive action to accelerate the industry’s decarbonisation plans.

A US-led coalition scuppered the IMO’s attempts to agree a comprehensive road map that would see shipping substantially reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to a fraction of those recorded in 2008.

The IMO set out a clear pathway to 2050 with interim targets for 2030 and 2040 with many nation states already committed to delivering the reductions in emissions and many vessel operators investing in the green technology that will achieve the industry’s goals.

In a move that will find support from many in the maritime sector, five NGO’s, Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment, have set out a six-point action plan that they are calling on governments to commit to in a bid to make sure that the maritime meets its climate obligations.

The plan calls for governments to: Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions. Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels. Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition. Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification. Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations and support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping.

Postponement of the NZF was a disappointment for many within and outside the industry but John Yum, head of shipping team at Solutions for Our Climate, argues that individual states can still take action to reduce emissions by expanding green corridors or investing in zero or near zero fuels. He said: “Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback.” Meanwhile, Pacific Environment believe that overshooting the Paris target of limiting Earth’s warming to 1.5degs has already been missed and blames “bad actors” for “bullying” countries into inaction.

Brazil was confident global unity would prevail at November's climate talks, but the exceptionally undiplomatic scenes at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN shipping regulator, presented an uglier possibility.

Even with the United States skipping the climate summit, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva called for good faith negotiations at COP30 and a rejection of the ""pressure and threats"" witnessed at the IMO.

Washington's conduct -- threatening sanctions, visa freezes and port levies on nations that didn't vote its way -- was not ""typical"" of the IMO, Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez told AFP.

AFP interviewed Dominguez, a Panamanian nearly halfway through his four-year term as IMO chief, at COP30 in Belem. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: The shipping carbon price was expected to be approved until US officials threatened retaliation against nations to get the vote delayed. Is this normal conduct at the IMO?

A: ""In my 28 years I have never experienced that kind of meeting at the IMO. It was not a typical IMO meeting. Geopolitical situations around the world right now are different to where they were in the past. We all know that.

""But for me, the task is to keep the momentum, maintain the approach, and whenever we come back to the negotiations in future, I call on everyone to do it in the normal spirit of compromise and cooperation that we carry out at IMO.""

Q: How can the IMO's 176 member states rebuild trust after this?

A: ""I can tell you that multilateralism is very much alive at IMO. And that's what I told everyone -- not to judge the organization, or come too quickly to conclusions, from the outcome of one specific topic in one specific meeting.

""For us, we need to learn from it. I am very much in support of multilateralism. We have had conversations and discussions about how to deal with geopolitical aspects.""

Q: US President Donald Trump called the shipping emissions deal a ""scam"" and pressure from Washington clearly influenced its delay. Is the scheme dead?

A: ""The negotiations continue, and they are ongoing. It is by no means a done deal. The process will continue ahead.

""It is important to take their comments and concerns on board, and have further bilateral and multilateral conversations ahead of the next session. They may have proposals to put on the table for us to consider as well. And that's how we make progress.

""I work with all countries, and all governments, at any given time. My job is to listen to what everybody is saying and see how we can accommodate and find those common areas that might allow us to make progress.""

Q: Is the industry still committed to decarbonizing?

A: ""Our goal -- that we all agree at IMO back in 2023 -- is to decarbonize the sector by around 2050. And we all maintain that goal, regardless of the state of play right now.

It also includes a new in-depth section on the U.S. maritime industry, as well as new chapters on maritime technology, the maritime media, AI and public relations, social media and crisis communications.
Pinnington said the book is further aimed at maritime business leaders who want to professionalize their communications.
“I want ‘Making Waves II’ to give proven ideas so businesses can better do themselves justice,” he said.
Pinnington published the first edition of “Making Waves” in 2021.","Ben Pinnington, founder of Polaris Media, a Chicago-based maritime public relations firm, has announced the release of a new edition of his maritime public relations book titled “Making Waves: PR Strategies To Transform Your Maritime Business.”

Pinnington released the latest edition of Making Waves November 4 through publisher Rethink Press.

Pinnington said the book is the result of a year’s worth of research and interviews. It also includes a new in-depth section on the U.S. maritime industry, as well as new chapters on maritime technology, the maritime media, AI and public relations, social media and crisis communications.

“Maritime now has its highest profile in decades, and this is an opportunity and threat,” he said. “As we have seen with President Trump challenging China’s maritime industry and with the IMO Net Zero framework being paused, maritime is now front and center of the news agenda.”

Companies within the maritime industry historically have endeavored to keep a low profile, but that approach may need to change, Pinnington argues in “Making Waves.”

“Times have changed, and maritime needs to start prioritizing professional communications to build authentic reputation and trust,” he said.

A big part of that story is the industry-wide effort and cost associated with decarbonization and how technology and alternative fuels are driving down emissions.

Pinnington said the book is further aimed at maritime business leaders who want to professionalize their communications.

“I want ‘Making Waves II’ to give proven ideas so businesses can better do themselves justice,” he said. “The hard reality is that many maritime firms do not have the reputation they deserve. They are trapped in repeating the same year with minimal growth and average marketing. However, if you communicate authentic good behavior on digital media and in the abundant maritime press, your reputation will rise. And research has shown that, with a stronger reputation, your business is more likely to grow.”

The new edition of “Making Waves” features interviews with leading industry figures like Marina Hadjipateras and Nir Gartzman, marine autonomy specialist Jack Dougherty, entrepreneur Darren Shelton, Texas maritime figure Niels Aalund, American maritime lawyer Charlie Papavizas, Great Lakes maritime professionals Ian Hirt and William Friedman, inland waterways specialist Scott Sigman and PR thought leader Stephen Waddington.

Polaris Media is a maritime and engineering specialist PR firm. Pinnington founded the company in Liverpool, UK, in 2011. Pinnington expanded the company to Chicago in 2022. Polaris has worked for more than 100 clients, including ship builders, boat builders, hovercraft builders, shipping lines, ports, flag states, classification societies, equipment makers, cybersecurity firms, professional service companies, seafarer charities and trade associations. The firm has clients in the United States, United Kingdom, India and Europe.

Polaris helped to recharter the Chicago chapter of the International Propeller Club in 2023. Following a 15-year hiatus, the club was named International Port Chapter of the Year in 2024.

Pinnington published the first edition of “Making Waves” in 2021. The book won the Chartered Institute of Public Relations Silver Award for best publication in 2022. The Nautilus Telegraph called the book a “must read for maritime businesses.”",https://www.waterwaysjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251117-Ben-Pennington-Book-002.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 14:56:29.659011
