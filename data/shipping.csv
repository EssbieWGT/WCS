As informed, the engine uses the Diesel principle combined with dual-fuel Liquid Gas Injection technology, similar to prior engines running on methanol and LPG. The engine incorporates safety features specific to ammonia, including containment systems, sensors, system ventilation, and double-walled piping.

Ammonia as a marine fuel has several technical advantages, Everllence explains. It produces zero CO₂ when derived from renewable sources and has low sulphur-oxide and particulate emissions. Its high volumetric energy density allows more compact storage compared with hydrogen, and it can be stored as a liquid at moderate pressures. Ammonia’s slow combustion rate is compatible with two-stroke engine designs, and existing global production infrastructure supports scalability and operational reliability.

The first engine is expected to be operational in 2026, with testing and bedding-in scheduled beforehand. Extensive testing has already been conducted, including over 800 trials since mid-2023, with safety measures reviewed alongside relevant authorities.

The ME-LGIA engine will support digital connectivity to allow real-time monitoring, performance optimization, and operational data collection.

As the maritime industry’s leading engine designer, we are in a unique position to advance the green transition and know that bringing new fuels to market is not just innovation – it’s imperative for zero-carbon shipping. In this context, ammonia is a vital piece of the puzzle. The development of this engine is not just a technical achievement; it is another concrete step towards a climate-neutral future where the time to act is now

We call on all member states and zero-emission leaders like California to step up and act on climate change by truly decarbonizing maritime shipping.

Full Report Sources: Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment","On Energy and Transport Day at COP 30, Environmental Defense Fund, Pacific Environment, Seas At Risk, Solutions for Our Climate, and Transport & Environment call on national governments to urgently accelerate action to reduce shipping emissions, especially following the recent U.S.-led postponement in the adoption of a binding global shipping measure at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The delay in adoption of the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF), the first UN-mandated fuel mandate and carbon pricing mechanism on any sector, by one year risks slowing down industry-wide decarbonisation efforts at a moment when decisive action is needed most.

Shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and the IMO’s 2023 Strategy sets a clear pathway to achieve net-zero emissions from shipping by 2050, with interim goals for 2030 and 2040 that countries have already committed to deliver. While Member States continue negotiations on the NZF, national governments must step up and act domestically and regionally to keep the transition on course, ensuring investment, infrastructure, and innovation continue to drive the industry forward.

We therefore call on all governments to commit to the following national actions for shipping decarbonisation:

Develop and implement a national action plan on international shipping emissions

Set clear domestic targets and mandates for low- and zero-emission marine fuels and vessels

Deploy financial and regulatory incentives to accelerate ship efficiency and fuel transition

Enhance port infrastructure and support for alternative fuels, as well as technologies such as wind propulsion and electrification

Ensure a just and globally equitable transition, especially for developing and small-island nations

Support urgent action on short-lived climate forcers (methane and black carbon) emitted by international shipping

John Yum, Head of Shipping Team, Solutions for Our Climate, said: “The postponement of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework is deeply disappointing, but it also gives governments a chance to take meaningful action. Instead of just waiting for international negotiations to resume, countries like Korea should take immediate steps to decarbonize their shipping sectors — for instance, by continuing to commit to expanding green shipping corridors and increasing investment in ZNZ fuels. Taking proactive steps now will demonstrate governments’ commitment to achieving net-zero shipping by 2050 and help ensure that, when the IMO reconvenes, it can move forward with stronger ambition rather than face another setback.”

Davina Hurt, Climate Policy Director, Pacific Environment, said: “We now face a reality we long anticipated — overshooting the 1.5°C target is inevitable. Member states were bullied into delaying the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework, but obstruction by bad actors cannot continue to force inaction at a time when decisive action is most needed. We call on all member states and zero-emission leaders like California to step up and act on climate change by truly decarbonizing maritime shipping. There is only one planet. We must stand together for the health of our ocean and for future generations. Now is the time to act.”

Mark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Energy Transition, Environmental Defense Fund, said: “The development and deployment of clean, alternative fuels for global shipping is not only good for stabilizing the climate and improving public health—it also creates economic opportunities for those countries and companies that embrace innovation. The International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework is rooted in this reality. Leaders can and must act now to implement it. The future of the industry is not in its past—it begins with action today.”

Sian Prior, Shipping Director, Seas At Risk, said: “We simply cannot afford to keep delaying climate action. In the face of the climate crisis, countries need to start taking leaps, not steps, towards decarbonising shipping, including addressing short-lived climate pollutants such as methane and black carbon. Meanwhile, bullying tactics must be called out and multilateralism must take precedence. Steering the ship towards greener shipping doesn’t have to be overcomplicated: scaling up wind propulsion, finding financial incentives to adopt cleaner fuels whilst ensuring a just transition are achievable if we all work together.”

As the global community gathers in Belém, we urge governments to seize this opportunity to take concrete actions that will ensure the maritime industry contributes its fair share to combating climate change.

Early preparation around these regimes is closely tied to maintaining their competitive position.

Ahead of his contribution to the Tanker 2030 conference in Singapore, Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore global market leader for tankers Robert Elliot described how operators had to make informed choices on fuel sourcing and pooling, alongside carefully managing operational performance.

He set out two main pathways for owners: securing access to sustainable fuels, which offers greater control and relative stability, or joining pooling agreements that provide flexibility but depend on robust contracts to manage price volatility.

Mr Elliot noted the best balance between these approaches depends on a vessel’s trading profile and fuel options, including access to alternative energy sources, and the ability to anticipate and model these factors had become a commercial capability rather than a narrow compliance task.

It includes international regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships from 2023 and contains two key elements: a global fuel standard and a global mechanism for pricing ship emissions.
The Trump administration had - predictably - previously threatened IMO member states with severe legal sanctions if they supported the MEPC's draft CO2 emissions regulations.
From the US government's perspective, the framework is tantamount to a ""European-led neo-colonial export of global climate regulation"".

The extraordinary meeting is to be resumed in 12 months. In the meantime, the member states want to continue working towards a consensus on the regulations.

The IMO's net zero framework was included as a new chapter in the draft revision of Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) at the 83rd session of the MEPC in April 2025. However, without the USA, which did not attend this meeting. It includes international regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships from 2023 and contains two key elements: a global fuel standard and a global mechanism for pricing ship emissions.

The Trump administration had - predictably - previously threatened IMO member states with severe legal sanctions if they supported the MEPC's draft CO2 emissions regulations. Promoting ""activist-driven climate policies"" under the IMO net-zero framework could lead to sanctions, tariffs, port fees, economic sanctions related to US government contracts or visa restrictions for seafarers, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy warned in a joint statement ahead of the meeting.

From the US government's perspective, the framework is tantamount to a ""European-led neo-colonial export of global climate regulation"". This is because, by and large, the new net zero framework, even if it is not usually discussed as a ""tax"", will be the first and only global financial sanction for carbon emissions. The US announcement then includes a rather blunt threat to penalise countries that vote in favour of the IMO's carbon tax scheme by imposing costs on them. ""Our colleagues in the IMO should brace themselves,"" warned the US ministers.

“We need some other action, other regulations to support something different from alternative fuels.

Kourkountis, who is also the Technical Director at Sea Traders, explained that only 1% of the amount of fuel required for shipping by the controversial IMO Net-Zero Framework that got postponed in October is available at this time, and producing that fuel is not something we could do “the very next day,” he emphasized, adding that the energy required to produce ammonia and methanol would be greater than the energy they generate.

“We need some other action, other regulations to support something different from alternative fuels. We do not have energy from batteries, while nuclear energy is not ready to be applied, even though it would certainly solve the global energy problem, but environmentally the problem remains, since nuclear waste exists,” he said.

Echoing those views, ABS Business Development Manager Angelos Minakis presented the key points of contention in IMO, saying the organization has made a strategic mistake by condemning liquefied natiural gas while theoretically other fuels don’t exist. Looking forward, he said IMO should shift focus on re-engagement and consensus-building among member states.

For his part, Miltiadis Varvitsiotis, vice president and CEO of Skaramangas Shipyards, argued that US opposition to IMO’s Net-Zero Framework poses a unique opportunity for the Greek shipbuilding industry, especially for Skaramangas, as the shipyards will be certified next year to serve LNG carriers and such vessels are expected to travel the Eastern Mediterranean region to export American LNG.

The European Union (EU), the Port of Rotterdam and the Namibian Ports Authority (Namport) have signed a deal to advance the expansion of Lüderitz Port at Angra Point.

The agreement forms part of the EU–Namibia strategic partnership on sustainable raw materials value chains and renewable hydrogen.

Under the deal, the EU has committed N$13 million to support planning for the port’s expansion.

The agreement was signed during the closing session of its Africa regional workshop on Global Gateway Green Shipping Corridors in Walvis Bay.

Maritime transport must undergo rapid change to cut emissions, European Union (EU) ambassador to Namibia Ana Beatriz Martins told delegates at the workshop.

She said the sector’s contribution to global emissions demands urgent action from governments and industry.

She addressed representatives from African partnership countries, the International Maritime Organisation, the African Union Commission, port authorities and private operators.

The discussions come as world leaders gather at the 30th Conference of Parties (COP30) climate conference in Belém, Brazil.

The workshop is the first of three regional sessions to be held worldwide. Martins said hosting it in Namibia shows Europe’s confidence in African partners and Namibia’s growing role in green shipping.

“No better place than Namibia to show us the way on green shipping,” she said.

She outlined the long-standing cooperation between the EU, IMO, and African countries across transport sectors, such as roads, rail, aviation safety, and sustainable fuels.

She said these partnerships have strengthened mobility and connectivity on the continent.

Martins reminded delegates of the urgency of the climate crisis.

The EU has submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution for 2035, committing to cut emissions by 66% to 72% and aiming to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

She noted that Europe remains the world’s largest provider of climate finance, with €31.7 billion contributed in 2024 and €11 billion in private finance for developing countries.

Last week at COP30, President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah revealed that Namibia would require about US$15 billion, or roughly N$270 billion, to meet its climate mitigation and adaptation goals by 2030.

Most of this funding would rely on international support.

Namibia’s adaptation efforts in agriculture, water, health, biodiversity and infrastructure would require about US$6 billion (around N$108 billion), with 90% expected to come from external sources.

Its mitigation measures were projected to cost about US$9 billion (roughly N$162 billion), with 10% expected to be financed locally.

Martina said momentum toward decarbonising shipping remains strong, despite the IMO’s delayed decision on the Net Zero Framework.

She said the EU wants to support long-term competitiveness and economic growth across Africa and Europe through cleaner shipping routes.

She also pointed out challenges, such as geopolitical pressures, high investment costs, renewable fuel prices, and limited infrastructure.

The Global Gateway’s Green Shipping Corridors initiative responds to requests from shippers, fuel producers, port operators, and maritime authorities.

Martins said the long-term goal is to establish shipping routes powered by renewable fuels and supported by ports able to supply clean energy. She said this transition requires robust financing.

Erongo governor Natalia |Goagoses welcomed the delegates from across Africa to the workshop, which was held under the theme “Accelerating Inclusive Green Shipping in Africa: Energy Efficiency, Innovation and Finance for a Low-Carbon Maritime Future.”

She praised the International Maritime Organization, the European Union and MTCC Africa for supporting sustainable and inclusive maritime development.",https://www.observer24.com.na/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cropped-WO-App-Icon-Apple-1-32x32.jpeg,N,,2025-11-14 06:57:15.359762

The enforceable agreement requires the ports to develop and implement charging and fuelling infrastructure plans and includes annual reporting requirements and agency oversight.

The agreement, which the SCAQMD Board approved 7 November, commits the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to developing and implementing plans for zero-emissions infrastructure for equipment types in three phases, starting with a draft plan in May 2027, followed by approved plans in place for all categories by the end of 2029.

According to SCAQM, the cooperative agreement prioritises the development of zero-emission infrastructure at the Ports—the first critical step towards eliminating emissions from cargo handling equipment, harbour craft, trucks, trains, and ocean-going vessels and attaining clean air in the region.

Taken together, the actions build on the voluntary, landmark Clean Air Action Plan that has delivered remarkable progress in cutting emissions from port-related sources, including reductions of 90% in diesel particulate matter, 68% in nitrogen oxides and 98% in sulphur oxides from port-related sources since 2005.

In the months ahead, the ports will also continue working with SCAQMD on additional “CAAP Plus” measures that will focus on emission-reducing strategies related to cleaner oceangoing vessels, the largest source of emissions at the ports, through strategies like the Environmental Ship Index Incentive Programs.

The measures could also include strategies like committing Clean Truck Fund Rate revenue to subsidise the transition to zero-emission trucks and infrastructure, developing a zero-emissions drayage truck utilisation incentive program and consulting annually with SCAQMD on spending priorities.

“We are pleased to move forward with this cooperative agreement and accelerate the progress we’ve achieved by making our operations cleaner and more efficient,” said Long Beach Harbor Commission President Frank Colonna. “It will deliver tangible results and a sustainable future without risking jobs or cargo throughput.”

“I commend the South Coast Air Quality Management District for its willingness to compromise, and all of the work by staff from the agency and both ports in recent months to develop this agreement in a transparent and open process,” said Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero.

“Collaboration has been a key to our success in reducing environmental impacts. Together, with the participation and active support of the ports, SCAQMD, labor, industry, energy suppliers and utilities, technology developers and community representatives – which this agreement will intensify – I am confident we can reach our shared goal of a zero-emissions future.”

“Environmental progress and economic leadership are no longer competing goals – they must move forward together,” said Long Beach Mayor Rex Richardson.

“This collaborative agreement marks a major step toward a more sustainable port complex that protects community health, advances our climate action commitments and strengthens regional economic growth with good-paying jobs. By accelerating zero-emission infrastructure, we will deliver cleaner air, healthier neighbourhoods and a greener global supply chain that reaches far beyond our two cities.”

EnviTec Biogas on Thursday (13 November) said TT-Line signed a bio-LNG supply contract following a trial bunkering.

Some 40 metric tonnes (mt) of bio-LNG from EnviTec Biogas was supplied to TT-Line’s Ro-Pax ferry Peter Pan in Travemünde, Germany.

“We are delighted to be able to supply TT-Line’s Ro-Pax ferries, a combination of passenger and vehicle ships, with our renewable fuel bio-LNG,” said Markus Pille, Managing Director of EnviTec Energy GmbH & Co. KG.

Since the entry into force of the EU Regulation on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, also known as FuelEU Maritime, shipping companies such as TT-Line are required to comply with binding limits for the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on board. The regulation applies to all ships in the EU with a gross tonnage of more than 5,000 in commercial passenger or freight transport, regardless of the flag they fly.

“Our Peter Pan, together with her sister ship Nils Holgersson, is the largest LNG-powered Ro-Pax ferry in the world. These ferries represent far more to us than merely meeting legal requirements; we are preparing ourselves and our fleet as well as possible for a sustainable future,” said Torben Nikolay, CFO of TT-Line.

“We have already carried out extensive bio-LNG bunkerings by bunker barge this year and are now pleased to have found, in EnviTec Biogas, a German partner for particularly flexible bunkering by truck.”

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Caroline Yang, CEO of Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd, Past Chair of the Singapore Shipping Association (SSA); Former Vice Chair of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), discusses the overall state of Singapore’s bunkering sector and its future evolution with bunkering publication Manifold Times.

MT: How is bunker tanker owner and operator Hong Lam Marine helping Singapore navigate the transition towards alternative marine fuels?

Hong Lam Marine, an industry staple for over 40 years, has always aimed to keep pace or even lead the Singapore bunkering sector. We were amongst the first to build and in June 2005 introduced the 9,330 dwt Leadership which was then Singapore’s largest bunker tanker. Today, we operate the 9,338 dwt Oracle which is the largest in Singapore (as per MPA data on 8 September 2025).

Though we are concerned about alternative marine fuels due to high building costs and uncertainty about the dominant fuel, we are still planning newbuildings including IMO Type II bunker tankers to deliver alternative fuels to keep pace with the market.

Even so, it remains uncertain what alternative fuels will dominate the bunkering market, as most shipowners are building dual-fuel vessels enabling them to switch to conventional bunker fuels if prices are too high or when supply is limited.

MT: Can you describe the challenges Hong Lam Marine faced during IMO 2020 and how lessons learned have prepared it for upcoming IMO 2030?

The IMO 2020 Global Sulphur Cap provided a clear regulation with a definite compliance date, creating a level playing field.

However, we lack such clarity with alternative fuels; the failure of the MEPC extraordinary session in October 2025 on the net-zero framework was a setbac k. We hope for consensus next year to approve the net-zero framework and the mechanics agreed by 2028-2029, which would provide investment clarity for the bunkering industry.

To date, we have observed shipowners building dual-fuel vessels predominantly powered by methanol, some ammonia, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Until global regulations are in place, biofuels and LNG will likely be the main transition fuels, as a lack of a level playing field impedes investment.

MT: What are your thoughts on mass flowmeters (MFM), electronic bunker delivery notes (e-BDN), and digitalisation for Singapore’s bunkering sector, and how does those set an example for marine refuelling in the rest of the world?

The best thing that ever happened to the Singapore bunkering industry is the MFM. It’s not only the MFM itself but also the whole piping system to ensure the quantity of fuel delivered is correct.

That really brought integrity to the Singapore bunkering and gave us a reputation, and it is through this reputation that allowed the local bunkering sector to thrive amongst global competition. The enforcement and compliance checks by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) for the MFM system are also crucial to its success.

A noteworthy fact is that Hong Lam Marine test-bedded MFM with ExxonMobil and MPA from 2010 to 2016, resulting in the company operating the certified for MFM custody transfer in Singapore when MFM bunkering for fuel oil became mandatory in 2017.

The adoption of e-BDNs for Singapore’s bunkering sector was successful because the MPA listened to industry feedback. We are currently in Phase One of e-BDN, with the next phase hopefully being full digitalisation to integrate banks, suppliers, buyers, sellers, operators, and MPA, ensuring transparency and integrity when you bunker in Singapore.

MT: Based on your experience as SSA’s president from 2019 to 2025, how prepared is Singapore’s bunkering industry to tackle IMO 2030 and beyond?

Singapore is more than ready. With the involvement of Hong Lam Marine, we were the first to conduct ship-to-ship methanol bunkering and thereafter, MPA has since implemented simultaneous operations for cargo discharge and methanol bunker supply.

The Singapore bunkering sector is supported by three LNG bunker vessels, is also actively delivering bio bunker fuels, and backed by storage terminals ready for methanol and ammonia.

The MPA is proactive, and the SSA president has a seat on the MPA board, ensuring Singapore stays relevant and invests in future trends. The Singapore Maritime Academy (SMA) has trained many crew for methanol and is training for ammonia.

While Singapore is ready, the alternative fuels future resets the bunkering landscape, and we must continue to innovate to maintain our position as the world’s top bunkering port.

Singapore-headquartered crude and product tankers owner AET on Monday (10 November) said it has signed shipbuilding agreements with Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) for the construction of two LNG dual-fuel Suezmax tankers.

The vessels will further expand AET’s growing dual-fuel fleet operating worldwide. With these orders, AET will have dual-fuel capability in all the tanker sectors it operates in – Aframaxes, Shuttle Tankers, Suezmaxes and Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs).

Each vessel will feature advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and environmental performance, including:

Everllence 6G70ME-C10.5-GI main engine, designed for fuel efficiency and to minimise methane-slip.

SVESSEL Intelligent Smart Ship Solution, enabling real-time monitoring and data-driven optimisation of performance and safety.

SAVER Stator-D (Duct), SARB (Rudder Bulb) and SAVER-Fins to enhance hydrodynamic efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.

Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) systems and a hybrid vertical bow design that further improve propulsion efficiency and lower emissions.

LNG is one of several alternative fuel pathways AET is pursuing, alongside ammonia and other emerging low-carbon fuels, as part of its Energy Transition Strategy. When operating on LNG, by design dual-fuel vessels can emit between 14% to 23% less greenhouse gases (GHG) on a well-to-wake basis than those using conventional marine fuels, while significantly reducing particulate matter (PM), sulphur oxides (SOₓ) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) .

In addition to these savings, LNG from alternative feedstocks namely bio-LNG and e-LNG offer a long-term and scalable solution to deep decarbonisation for the industry. These forms of LNG while nascent in their use as marine fuel offer significant incremental GHG emissions savings beyond (fossil) LNG based savings and utilise the same infrastructure .

Nick Potter, President & CEO of AET, said: “This marks another important step in building a more sustainable fleet and supporting our customers’ decarbonisation ambitions. With these newbuilds, our dual-fuel fleet will grow to 18 vessels , a clear demonstration of the progress we’re making in delivering more energy with less emissions.

“Through continued collaboration with industry partners, we’re investing in technologies that deliver lower-carbon energy solutions today while keeping firmly on course towards a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 2030 as part of our Energy Transition Strategy.”

Once that distribution system is in place, shipowners will use it but it is not their job to build it.
Considering the next steps for NZF at IMO, Marinakis said he’d like to see compromise and an agreement on measures that have an immediate effect on the environment.","A panel of leading shipowners called for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to take a pragmatic approach to regulating the shipping industry’s greenhouse gas emissions, warning that there would be global economic consequences for getting it wrong.

Speaking at the Capital Link Maritime Forum in Dubai, Eng. Ahmed Ali Alsubaey, CEO & board member, Bahri Group, said shipping’s own pragmatism was good for the environment and the world as a whole. The IMO should take a similarly practical approach, as global industry would screech to a halt if shipping took a wrong step in its energy transition, he said.

“The shipping industry, you don't know how powerful you are. When we sneeze, the rest of the industries get a cold. We've seen it,” he said. Alsubaey listed the pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, and US-China trade war as examples of how disruption to shipping has rippling global effects that reach the man and woman on the street.

Lois Zabrocky, CEO, International Seaways Inc., said she believes that the shipping industry is pragmatic, and that it will decarbonise, although the practicalities may take longer than “the dreamers” want. Shipowners face a challenge in making considered investments — close to $150m for a dual-fuel LNG VLCC out of South Korea — on environmental credentials for alternative fuels that can be unclear and are shifting.

George Prokopiou, founder, dynacom tankers management, said that fuel-ready notations for vessels are a marketing tool. “What we do as ship owners, we are ordering the best available ships at the given moment. We don't go and say, ‘give me a model that is 10 years old’.”

Shipowners have taken risks in ordering more efficient tonnage with less proven technologies such as new engines, said Prokopiou, and that had resulted in modern tonnage with 30-35% lower fuel consumption for the same cargo. Ship efficiency is a rare place where shipowners and green organisations are aligned, he said, as fuel is a major cost in ship operations, and owners want to keep costs low.

Alsubaey agreed, saying the industry bears no resemblance to how it was in the 1960s, especially when it comes to fuel and engines. “The two major industries that have done something about the environment are the energy sector and the designers of [engines]. These two groups, over the last 30-40 years, have really transformed what we do,” he said.

The panel were less optimistic about the transformational potential of the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF), which was recently delayed at a meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC).

Prokopiou said he believes there is a fundamental problem with a lack of clarity on the distribution of funds raised under the proposed rules, and that the IMO is set up as a regulator, not a tax collector. He had clear reservations on timescale and ambition too: “When you penalise somebody for not using fuels that don't exist, it's absurd,” he said.

Evangelos Marinakis, founder and chairman, Capital Maritime & Trading Corp quipped that paying a levy on fuel to governments in Europe was a roundabout way of tackling the issue at hand. “We don't solve the problem for our environment. It’s like you pay someone and you die happier, it doesn't make sense.”

Marinakis compared carbon taxation unfavourably to a more familiar strategy used in shipping.

“With slow steaming, there is a result. There are less emissions, and the only thing that is increasing is the time of transportation. But at the end of the day, you see a result that helps the environment.”

Far from cutting costs, suezmaxes cost around $70m - $80m, and for the lifespan of a newly-delivered vessel there is the prospect of paying penalties of up to $240m under NZF, claimed Prokopiou. No shipowner can foot such a bill, he said, and the cost would ultimately fall to consumers and drive up inflation and poverty.

Prokopiou suggested that shipowners and operators are the wrong target for regulation. “We are not the engine builder, not the shipyard. We are the taxi drivers. We are the users… We are not the fuel makers, the refineries and the energy companies are.”

On the challenge of alternative fuel infrastructure, Prokopiou said shipping needs two fuel suppliers in each port, “because if you have one supplier, he'll screw you on the price”. Once that distribution system is in place, shipowners will use it but it is not their job to build it. “We buy whatever is the best available,” he said.

Alsubaey raised the issue of environmental regulation with unintended consequences, noting one impact of the drive to lower sulphur content in marine fuels. “I never liked those open ended scrubbers. I thought it's a joke. If anybody thinks we're doing this for the environment, I don't know what science they have been reading, to take pollution from the air and put it in the sea and get it into the food cycle.”

“The reason we're doing it… [is] because it makes economic sense, not because it makes environmental sense. I hope that we don't get [decarbonisation] regulation that, on the face of it, looks environmental, but actually it is more harmful to the environment,” said Alsubaey.

Considering the next steps for NZF at IMO, Marinakis said he’d like to see compromise and an agreement on measures that have an immediate effect on the environment. “We have a year in front of us, at least, to make some constructive discussion and find the solution.”

Alsubaey said: “I'm hoping that the next time IMO meets, they will come up with something pragmatic, something possible, something we can do so we can truly, truly show our love for this blue planet.”

Prokopiou echoed the sentiment: “We are a family company. We try for the best. We care for our children and our grandchildren, to live in a better environment, but we go with the possible, not the desirable.”

Despite the issues raised with the NZF, the panel were responsible for sizable investments in greener tonnage. Marinakis said a significant premium was paid to order more than 30 vessels as dual-fuel LNG, but the business case made sense, as well as the environmental benefits.

“When the market on LNG is stabilised, and the new production comes in, the price of LNG will be lower, and of course, it will make sense to consume LNG irrespective of the reduction in emissions,” said Marinakis.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/bltc0ce67da76e6678c/6916783aabd3a493e0c9b61b/Capital-Link-Dubai-2025-Panel_credit-Emma-Howell.jpeg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-13 20:56:52.527732

However, Emma Fenton, Senior Director of Climate Diplomacy at the NGO Opportunity Green, believes that LNG stalls shipping’s clean energy transition.
The use of LNG therefore has serious and adverse effects for the climate, potentially outweighing those of conventional fuel oils.
“LNG supply chains and engine technologies are increasingly robust and established, reducing the fuel’s well-to-wake emissions.
For Madadh MacLaine Secretary-General Zero Emissions Ship Technology Association, the IMO delay has created uncertainty on process but not on direction.","The October delay at IMO of its Net Zero Framework continues to spark debate, and enthusiasm, about net zero fuel choices, including what LNG’s role should be.

Debate is expected to continue too, as shipowners face a more complicated regulatory landscape now. Despite the uncertainty created by the delay, regulations continue to force emissions reductions, including existing IMO regulations such as CII and regional regulation such as FuelEU.

With the number of dual-fuel LNG ships being ordered higher than methanol or ammonia alternatives, interest in the pathway from fossil LNG to biomethane and e-LNG is growing.

However, Emma Fenton, Senior Director of Climate Diplomacy at the NGO Opportunity Green, believes that LNG stalls shipping’s clean energy transition. “Methane is a potent GHG with climate impacts over 80 times those of CO2 over a 20-year period, and burning LNG on ships results in significant amounts of unburned methane being released into the atmosphere.

“This means that any moderate CO2 emissions savings from LNG are likely offset by methane slippage at the point of combustion and leakage across the supply chain. The use of LNG therefore has serious and adverse effects for the climate, potentially outweighing those of conventional fuel oils.

“For this reason, LNG should have a very limited role in the marine transition, and it is therefore likely that investments in LNG infrastructure will lead to stranded assets and sunk costs.”

In contrast, Steve Esau COO of SEA-LNG, says the role of LNG remains the only practical and realistic future fuel available at scale, which reduces both GHG and local air pollution from deep-sea shipping.

“The methane decarbonization pathway through liquefied biomethane and e-methane is the most viable and low risk pathway for the global maritime industry, as demonstrated by the rapid growth in the LNG dual-fuel fleet and new build orderbook. With industry initiatives dramatically reducing levels of methane emissions onboard and in fuel supply chains, the growing availability of biomethane and gradual introduction of e-methane in the coming years, the pathway will continue to deliver meaningful reductions of greenhouse gases and local emissions to the citizens of the world.”

Caspar Gooren, Commercial Director Renewable Fuels, Titan Clean Fuels, points out that details such as fuel default emissions factors are still to be decided at the IMO. “Looking beyond hypothetical scenarios, what we can say is LNG offers immediate emissions reductions and a realistic pathway via liquefied biomethane and then e-methane. It is vital that all regulations create a level playing field for alternative fuel pathways and that LNG is fairly represented.

“In fact, a recent report by Rystad Energy commissioned by SEA-LNG using actual certified emissions from LNG marine fuel supply chains found that the 2024 average global well-to-tank emissions intensity was 13.9g CO2e/MJ (LHV) – lower than the FuelEU Maritime well-to-tank default of 18.5 gCO2e/MJ.”

Regardless of the postponement, those following the LNG pathway will still make progress. “LNG supply chains and engine technologies are increasingly robust and established, reducing the fuel’s well-to-wake emissions. Meanwhile, biomethane continues to prove itself as the only readily available and competitively priced green marine fuel,” says Gooren.

Development of alternatives continues. For Madadh MacLaine Secretary-General Zero Emissions Ship Technology Association, the IMO delay has created uncertainty on process but not on direction. “Across the sector, projects are moving ahead: wind-assisted vessels under sail, hydrogen and battery systems ramping up in number and size, while serious capital is piling into clean tech and maritime infrastructure. What remains in question is not whether transition will happen, but how we ensure it is real: science-based, verifiable, and free from creative accounting.”

Joe Bettles, Climate Policy & Analysis Manager, at the Maersk McInney Centre for Zero Carbon Shipping, sums up the situation for shipowners: “There was strong support for the IMO Net Zero Framework from industry organizations who represent a significant share of the world’s shipowners and operators. These organizations want clarity and certainty. They want to see one set of global rules to be able to make business decisions. Many of those decisions are now on pause, waiting for the outcome of next year’s meeting.”",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/markgusev-adobe-165503.jpeg,N,,2025-11-13 19:56:14.279755

As diplomats meet in Brazil for the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), global resolve to tackle the climate challenge appears badly frayed. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer remarked at the beginning of the conference that global “consensus is gone” to confront the issue, with some countries stepping away from climate diplomacy and others engaging in campaigns to block the implementation of emission reduction rules. Meanwhile, recent forecasts predict a world on track for well over 2°C of global average warming—above the Paris Agreement goal to avoid the most severe impacts of climate change—with new analyses projecting the world may reach temperatures 2.6–2.8°C higher based on current policies.

With some countries adopting intimidating tactics of negotiation against climate policies and support for multilateralism ebbing, priorities among countries are largely recalibrating away from emission reductions toward the more traditional interest of security. Alongside the likely overshoot of the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal and growing intensity of climate impacts, contestation over climate politics is becoming more disruptive, particularly in venues external to historic climate negotiations of the COP process. This year may mark the beginning of a new, more unruly era in global climate politics.

Fracturing Consensus

At prior climate conferences, implementation of the Paris Agreement seemed sturdy if not swift, producing many markers of success since the agreement’s adoption 10 years ago: countries have ratcheted up emission reduction pledges; climate finance has been mobilized; and global carbon intensity of GDP has fallen, even as emissions continue to rise. A surge of enhanced national commitments strengthened momentum for climate mitigation at 2021’s COP26 in Glasgow, and leaders agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels” and speed ambition across sectors at 2023’s COP28 in Dubai. But now, even COP29’s signature agreement—a new climate finance target of $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion in public finance to come from developed countries—looks imperiled, despite being agreed to just 12 months ago, due to tightening national fiscal space and shrinking foreign assistance budgets.

These developments come against a backdrop of great power tensions that threaten the foundations of the entire multilateral system, many of which are rearing their head in global climate politics. For example, inflamed rhetoric this year has flouted norms underpinning the World Trade Organization, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Refugee Convention, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, and the UN Charter’s recognized right to territorial integrity. Member states have separately accused three permanent members of the UN Security Council—China, Russia, and the United States—of illegal use of military aggression against their neighbors. These security issues are getting more airtime with each successive COP meeting, as topics like military emissions from the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine get increasing scrutiny, and as territorial disputes boil over into COP processes.

Meanwhile, the UN faces a historic budget shortfall and is warning of a “race to bankruptcy,” with major powers failing to contribute their annual payments to the organization. With the US now joining the BRICS group of 11 countries in harsh critiques of the international system, attracting further contributions to fortify the work of international institutions appears bleak. “The post-war global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” declared US Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this year, reflecting the Trump administration’s intention to undermine many of the institutions the US helped establish over the past 80 years.

Bullish Petrostates

As the US federal government now vehemently opposes efforts to combat global climate change, its approach has revealed fresh hostility to differing global views. US negotiators to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), for example, displayed new tactics of intimidation in October to scuttle multilateral efforts to limit emissions from the shipping sector. The “Net-Zero Framework” had been provisionally agreed to by governments after years of negotiation, had wide backing of industry, and would have introduced a carbon pricing mechanism on shipping emissions to take effect in 2028. Decrying the effort as a “neocolonial export of global climate regulations,” the US State Department put governments “on notice” that it would not just change its position and oppose the measure but also inflict consequences on countries that supported the framework’s adoption. Those pressures increased with the direct involvement of President Donald Trump to include threatening sanctions or the revocation of visas of individual negotiators and members of the IMO Secretariat, and ultimately led to a postponement of the vote until next year.

But it’s not just the United States that is displaying new resolve to stymie countries with ambitious climate policies or block new climate action. The United Arab Emirates recently joined the Trump administration in opposing European Union legislation that would make businesses responsible for limiting their environmental impact. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia and Russia blocked a vote within the World Health Organization to advance an action plan on climate change and health impacts, and Saudi Arabia has also pushed aggressively to prevent mention of the energy transition in at least five different global negotiations. Together, these states perceive they benefit strategically from the continued expansion of fossil fuel demand and have used bilateral and multilateral negotiations to advance these interests. Given the ability of the Trump administration to secure fossil fuel purchase agreements in its trade negotiations (even if the scale of those promises are unrealistic), fossil fuel–producing states likely feel newly unconstrained from global climate agreements, particularly with some developing countries applauding the shift back toward oil and gas.

More Discord Brewing

As some countries backtrack from climate deals, others are using new tactics outside of the COP process to confront the global climate challenge head-on. Foremost is the growing trend to seek legal damages for the impacts of climate change. Over 30 states and municipalities in the United States have brought suits against fossil fuel companies alleging damages, with Hawaii being the latest after the devastating Maui fires. The European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that countries taking insufficient action against climate change are violating human rights, and similar rulings have come down from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Law of the Sea Tribunal. In July 2025, the International Court of Justice built on these cases and ruled on the side of the small-island state Vanuatu, finding that states are bound under international law to prevent climate change. While international bodies have little ability to enforce their rulings, they give additional leverage to those seeking financial reparations from the losses and damages they face, whether from private companies or governments.

And without a dedicated negotiation stream to discuss trade issues in the formal COP process, countries are increasingly flouting established international trade rules for climate and economic purposes, using subsidies and tariffs to reward energy technologies—both clean and fossil fuels. This has contributed to a more fractured global landscape of robust industrial policies. Participants of a recent series of dialogues convened by CGEP on climate and trade found that climate–trade conflicts could increasingly create obstacles to trade and to countries’ climate and economic ambitions.

Finally, with climate forecasts pointing to decades of warming, more intense global impacts, and the potential for crossing “tipping points” in the Earth’s systems, proposals for local or global geoengineering programs—such as marine cloud brightening over the Great Barrier Reef or global solar radiation management—are gaining steam. Discussion of this topic has been mostly absent from the COP climate negotiation process, leading it to pop up in several other fora including the Montreal Protocol, the London Protocol, and the UN Environmental Assembly, among others. However, with private parties signaling interest in unilateral deployment while some activists are pushing for a total ban on climate intervention technologies, global debate has only just begun on a potentially more divisive issue than even global emissions reductions and climate finance has been.

Governments have come together at COP30 seemingly with less uniting them than ever, and with more friction likely ahead. These are the tough realities that the global community must contend with, not just at COP30 but as it looks to chart a new future for governance in a climate changing world.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Image_COP30-and-Beyond-The-Implications-of-a-New-Era-of-Discord-in-Global-Climate-Politics.png,N,,2025-11-13 14:56:53.097238

Since the entry into force of the EU Regulation on the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in maritime transport, also known as FuelEU Maritime, shipping companies such as TT-Line are required to comply with binding limits for the greenhouse gas intensity of the energy used on board. The regulation applies to all ships in the EU with a gross tonnage of more than 5,000 in commercial passenger or freight transport, regardless of the flag they fly.

This rule will also continue to apply until further notice. The International Maritime Organization – IMO for short – only recently postponed its decision on a global climate regime for shipping, the so-called “Net Zero Framework,” by one year. The framework would, for the first time, have introduced a global CO₂ price for an industrial sector and set the roadmap for the industry’s climate neutrality by 2050.

“Our Peter Pan, together with her sister ship Nils Holgersson, is the largest LNG-powered Ro-Pax ferry in the world. These ferries represent far more to us than merely meeting legal requirements; we are preparing ourselves and our fleet as well as possible for a sustainable future.

TT-Line connects the German Baltic Sea ports of Travemünde and Rostock as well as the ports of Świnoujście in Poland and Klaipėda in Lithuania with the southern Swedish transport hubs of Trelleborg – Sweden’s largest ferry port – and, since April 2023, Karlshamn. Its transport performance amounts annually to approx. 1 million passengers, 250,000 cars and approx. 500,000 freight units. TT-Line is therefore the market leader in traffic to southern Sweden.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez spoke at one of the first side events at the United Nations climate negotiations beginning this week on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon. The side event discussed the shipping industry’s efforts to slash carbon pollution by cutting back on fossil fuels.

Maritime nations were set to adopt the first global carbon fee on shipping last month at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates the international industry. They had already agreed on the regulations in April, so adopting them was widely expected to be a formality.

But after much pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates decided to postpone the decision by a year. Trump said then that the U.S. “will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Plan to slash emissions postponed

The regulations — or “Net-Zero Framework” — would have set a marine fuel standard that decreases, over time, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from shipping fuels. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions as trade has grown. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Dominguez told The Associated Press that despite the new rules being blocked, progress is continuing to be made on the shipping fee’s framework. He said he doesn’t blame the United States or other countries for thwarting the new regulations.

The U.S. is one of only four nations missing the climate conference, known as COP30, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar.

In a full room of organizers called “maritime enthusiasts,” Dominguez said that the world shouldn’t judge the IMO for October’s setback and that “there’s no reason to be upset” given “how volatile the world is right now.”

“Don’t think the IMO stops there, because we don’t,” he said. “We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.”

Dominguez said he remains positive that countries can adopt a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping, though “it is too early too go into any of the details.”

“I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,” he said. “Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.”

Hopes for future shipping fee remain

Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, said in a keynote address after Dominguez’s opening remarks that his nation and many other countries were ready to adopt the regulations last month in London, which they had expected to celebrate at COP30.

He said that while the delay in many ways caused a “sense of failure,” it is “equally important to take a cool headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month.”

In this context, the latest edition of the IEA’s World Energy Outlook underscores the need for governments to pursue greater diversification of supplies and increased cooperation with one another to help navigate the uncertainties and turbulence ahead.

The 2025 edition of the World Energy Outlook (WEO), the most authoritative global source of energy analysis and projections, covers a broad range of trajectories, highlighting different opportunities and vulnerabilities – but also commonalities. It does this through three main scenarios, none of which are forecasts. Each maps out a distinct energy future, enabling an analysis of the implications of different policy, investment and technology choices for energy security, affordability and emissions.

Among the many trends common to all the scenarios in this year’s WEO is the world’s growing need for energy services over the coming decades – with demand rising for mobility; for heating, cooling, lighting and other household and industrial uses; and increasingly for data and AI-related services.

In particular, a group of emerging economies – led by India and Southeast Asia and joined by countries in the Middle East, Africa and Latin America – comes to increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years ahead. Collectively, they take up the baton from China, which accounted for half of global oil and gas demand growth and 60% of electricity demand growth since 2010, although no country or group of countries comes close to replicating China’s energy-intensive rise.

Amid these shifts, traditional energy risks affecting the security of oil and gas supply are now accompanied by vulnerabilities in other areas, most visibly in supply chains for critical minerals due to high levels of market concentration. A single country is the dominant refiner for 19 out of 20 energy-related strategic minerals, with an average market share of around 70%. The minerals in question are vital for power grids, batteries and EVs, but they also play a crucial role in AI chips, jet engines, defence systems and other strategic industries. Geographic concentration in refining has increased for nearly all key energy minerals since 2020, and particularly for nickel and cobalt. Analysis in this year’s WEO of the pipeline of announced projects suggests that reversing this process is set to be slow, calling for stronger action by governments.

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once – a situation that calls for the same spirit and focus that governments showed when they created the IEA after the 1973 oil shock,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “With energy security front and centre for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals – on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change. The World Energy Outlook’s scenarios illustrate the key decision points that lie ahead and, together, provide a framework for evidence-based, data-driven discussion over the way forward.”

Electricity is at the heart of modern economies, and electricity demand grows much faster than overall energy use in all scenarios in WEO-2025. Investors are reacting to this trend: spending on electricity supply and end-use electrification already accounts for half of today’s global energy investment. For the moment, electricity accounts for only about 20% of final energy consumption globally, but it is the key source of energy for sectors accounting for over 40% of the global economy and the main source of energy for most households.

“Analysis in the World Energy Outlook has been highlighting for many years the growing role of electricity in economies around the world. Last year, we said the world was moving quickly into the Age of Electricity – and it’s clear today that it has already arrived,” Dr Birol said. “In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies. Breakneck demand growth from data centres and AI is helping drive up electricity use in advanced economies, too. Global investment in data centres is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025. Those who say that ‘data is the new oil’ will note that this surpasses the $540 billion being spent on global oil supply – a striking example of the changing nature of modern economies.”

A pivotal issue for energy security in the Age of Electricity is the speed at which new grids, storage and other sources of power system flexibility are put in place. For the moment, some of these elements are lagging. Investments in electricity generation have charged ahead by almost 70% since 2015, but annual grid spending has risen at less than half that pace.

Although the pace varies across the different WEO scenarios, renewables grow faster than any other major energy source in all the scenarios, led by solar PV. Notably, fresh analysis for the WEO-2025 maps the new geography of demand onto the distribution of global energy resources, showing that, by 2035, 80% of global energy consumption growth occurs in regions with high-quality solar irradiance. Another common element across scenarios is the revival of fortunes for nuclear energy, with investment rising in both traditional large-scale plants and new designs, including small modular reactors. After more than two decades of stagnation, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035.

In WEO-2025, all the scenarios indicate ample global supplies of oil and gas in the near term. Oil markets already reflect this, with today’s geopolitical fragility coexisting with oil prices in the $60-$65 per barrel range. A similar easing of market balances for natural gas appears imminent, as new projects for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports come online.

Final investment decisions for new LNG projects have surged in 2025, adding to the expected wave in natural gas supply in coming years. Around 300 billion cubic metres of new annual LNG export capacity is scheduled to start operation by 2030, leading to a 50% increase in available global LNG supply. Around half the new capacity is being built in the United States, and a further 20% in Qatar. Natural gas demand has been revised up in this year’s WEO, but questions still linger about where all the new LNG will go.

Easing near-term market balances for oil and gas are no cause for complacency, the report notes. Both markets remain exposed to geopolitical risks, and faster demand growth – in response to weaker energy transition policies or lower prices – could quickly erode what buffers they have.

In two critical areas of longstanding WEO analysis, the world is falling short on the goals it set for itself: universal energy access and climate change. Around 730 million people still live without electricity, and nearly 2 billion rely on cooking methods that are detrimental to human health. A new scenario in WEO-2025 outlines a country-by-country pathway to reaching universal access to electricity in 2035 – and to clean cooking in 2040, with liquid petroleum gas (LPG) playing the biggest role.

With climate risks rising, WEO-2025 shows the world surpassing 1.5°C of warming in any scenario, including those with very rapid emissions reductions. The energy sector will need to prepare for the security risks brought by higher temperatures, but there is still scope to avoid the worst climate outcomes. The updated scenario in which the world reaches net zero emissions by mid-century brings temperatures back below 1.5°C in the long term.",,N,,2025-11-13 08:57:05.302791

The motion to delay was initiated by Saudi Arabia, with the majority of the member countries in favor of waiting a year.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a London-based specialized agency within the United Nations (UN), was hoping to approve the Net Zero Framework (NZF) measure whose main objective was to charge companies for exceeding thresholds of greenhouse gas emissions released by their vessels.

This proposal would be detrimental to the U.S. economy, its workers, businesses, energy producers, and consumers. NZF must be prevented from reaching our shores.

Thanks to the administration’s efforts to delay its possible enaction, we are safe from the oppressive tax for now; but what happens in a year?

The UN’s top court in July asserted that the “failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from [greenhouse gas] emissions…..may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is attributable to that state.” They include fossil fuel production, consumption, and exploration in their indictment. This opinion could be used to justify global greenhouse gas regulations, including taxes.

Congressman August Pfluger (R-TX) has spearheaded legislation that would block the UN from forcing the U.S. to be subject to any new tax that was not explicitly levied by American taxpayers’ own government. The UNtaxed Act affirms the right of the Senate to sanction any UN-imposed tax prior to its enforcement and prohibits the federal government from making financial contributions to any UN agency that attempts to impose a tax on the American people.

Lacking legal basis, the NZF would be the first global carbon tax on the industry and is estimated to increase shipping costs by at least 10 percent, rippling through supply chains and the economy. Consumers will see higher prices on everyday goods.

The $11-$13 billion generated annually would place the NZF among the largest vehicles dedicated to global climate finance. And yet, some claim that is “nowhere near what is needed to ensure a just and equitable transition.” Worse still, the IMO has limited regulatory experience in this area.

A core objective of the NZF is to eventually force operators toward switching to lower-emitting fuel alternatives by inflicting steep compliance penalties. However, replacement fuels deemed climate friendly are anywhere from two to six times the cost of what carriers currently use. Companies would also face retrofitting their fleets and potential shortages of older and newer fuels, thus confronting additional expenses. A recent study found 90 percent of major carriers pass these extra costs on to customers, often with significant markups.

One of the UNtaxed Act’s cosponsors Troy Balderson (R-TX) believes such a program would punish Americans “while undermining American sovereignty.”

The Center for Urban Renewal and Education agrees that “legislation is needed to ensure that the UN never again seeks to impose illegal taxes on the American people.”

A hot-off-the-press policy analysis concludes the NZF would only slash shipping emissions by a maximum of 10 percent by 2030, compared with the 43 percent required by the Paris Agreement. In addition to a low climate impact, the report concludes NZF offers “a weak carbon price signal, limited and unpredictable revenue, insufficient support for zero-emission fuels, distributional and equity concerns, and implementation risks.”

Such punitive measures simply impose a climate agenda on nations by redistributing the collected fees to whatever purpose the unelected UN bureaucracy deems worthy. A UN-appointed governing board could transfer funds to “reward low-emission ships,” “mitigate negative impacts” of climate change on “vulnerable States” and “just-transition initiatives in developing countries.” It’s a slush fund garnered on the backs of hard-working Americans.

The measure will cost U.S. consumers significantly for so little in return.

A UN agency should not be imposing a tax on Americans, nor should they or anyone else attempt to dictate the climate policies of other nations.

In the stated policies scenario, which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030.","Global oil and gas demand could grow until 2050, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday, departing from previous expectations of a speedy transition to cleaner fuels following U.S. criticism about its climate focus.

The Paris-based energy security watchdog also predicted in its annual outlook that the world will likely fail to meet its goal to cap the rise in temperatures to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times to avoid the most devastating effects of climate change.

The IEA has been under pressure from the U.S. for a shift in recent years toward a focus on clean energy policies as President Donald Trump called on American companies to expand oil and gas production.

During the Biden administration, it predicted that global oil demand would peak this decade and said there should be an end to investment in new oil, gas and coal projects if the world wanted to reach net zero emissions by mid-century.

’NOTION OF PEAK OIL’

Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called its demand peak projections “nonsensical”. The IEA is funded by member countries, with the U.S. the largest contributor.

In its World Energy Outlook published on Wednesday, the IEA predicted under a current policies scenario that oil demand will hit 113 million barrels per day by mid-century, up around 13% from 2024 consumption.

It predicted that global energy demand will climb by 90 exajoules by 2035 – a 15% increase from present levels.

The scenario, which the IEA first used in 2019 before switching to one more in line with a clean energy transition, is based on existing government policies and not aspirations to achieve climate goals.

IEA head Fatih Birol said on a press call the scenario was restored to reflect differing choices governments are making about energy.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has previously disputed peak oil demand forecasts.

“We hope… we have passed the peak in the misguided notion of ‘peak oil.’” OPEC said on its website on Wednesday.

This year’s outlook ditched the pledges scenario as the IEA said not enough countries had submitted new commitments to produce a meaningful picture.

In the stated policies scenario, which considers proposed but not necessarily adopted policies, oil demand peaks around 2030. The difference in projections is largely due to diverging expectations of EV uptake.

The IEA says its scenarios explore a range of possible outcomes under various sets of assumptions and are not forecasts.

LNG CAPACITY TO SOAR

Final investment decisions for new liquefied natural gas projects have surged in 2025, the report noted. Operations for about 300 billion cubic metres of new annual LNG export capacity will start by 2030, marking a 50% increase in available supply.

Based on the current policies scenario, the global LNG market increases from around 560 bcm in 2024 to 880 bcm in 2035 and to 1,020 bcm in 2050, driven by rising power sector demand fuelled by data centre and AI growth.

Global investment in data centres is expected to reach $580 billion in 2025, the report said, noting that if achieved this would surpass the $540 billion a year spent globally on oil supply.

The report includes a scenario describing a pathway to reduce global energy emissions to net zero by 2050.

More than 190 countries pledged at the Paris climate talks in 2015 to try to keep the world from warming more than 1.5 C.

The report shows the world surpassing that in all scenarios.",,N,,2025-11-12 20:57:33.346424

Methanol fuel cells?
With sustainable hydrogen infrastructure constantly expanding and evolving, zero-emission hydrogen fuel cells remain a strong candidate for many owners and operators.","Do you want to power your whole ship or replace diesel auxiliary generators? Do you want to use hydrogen, ammonia or methanol to generate energy? These are legitimate questions when it comes to purchasing marine fuel cells, highlighting their flexibility, says Dr. Andreas Bodén, SVP & CTO of PowerCell Group.

Many marine uses

Fuel cells can be used in several ways in the maritime industry. Onboard larger vessels, like big cruise ships or containerships, they can replace the diesel generator sets or auxiliary engines used to power hotel-side operations or crew quarters and used for manoeuvring in port.

This means zero local emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and particulate matter (PM) such as black carbon in port communities. According to the World Health Organization, these pollutants significantly impact human health. They can exacerbate existing conditions like asthma and cause respiratory problems with long-term exposure linked to lung cancer.

These local emissions reductions also support FuelEU Maritime compliance. As of 2030, container and passenger ships greater than or equal to 5,000 gross tonnes (GT) must use shore power supplies for all electricity needs while moored in major EU ports or find alternatives to meet the emissions requirements while docked, including hydrogen and ammonia fuel cells, and biofuels and e-fuels, depending on their well-to-wake emissions reductions.

If port operators don’t want ship operators to have all the shore power fun, they can also use fuel cells to offer (and commercialise) onshore power supplies (OPS). Containerised fuel cells are replacing diesel generator sets in ports, and this technology has recently been trialled as a land-based shore power connection in the port city of Gothenburg – removing the need to plug into the fossil-fuelled grid.

On smaller vessels such as typical ferries or river barges, fuel cells are now comfortably powerful enough to take on primary propulsion duties. PowerCell is delivering hydrogen fuel cells to two RoPax ships operated by Torghatten Nord on Norway’s longest and arduous ferry route. PowerCell also recently announced it will equip the world’s first hydrogen-powered bulk carriers.

Methanol fuel cells?

Fuel cells come in different shapes and sizes. Proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are smaller, much more efficient and offer a higher power density to alternatives. These fuel cells can directly use hydrogen, or with integrated reformer technology, they can also use ammonia or methanol to produce energy. This may sound like science fiction, but there are already commercial orders for PEM fuel cells featuring integrated methanol reformer technology, such as PowerCell’s M2Power 250 system.

Methanol offers a practical pathway for integrating hydrogen electric technologies without relying on pure hydrogen infrastructure. Plus, methanol can be used approximately 30% more efficiently in fuel cells than in internal combustion engines. With green methanol, and all other green fuels, set to be more expensive and less energy-dense than their fossil-based counterparts, this creates a significant operational expenditure (OPEX) benefit to using fuel cells.

Net-zero methanol fuel cells are just one option for cleaner, greener power generation onboard or in ports. With sustainable hydrogen infrastructure constantly expanding and evolving, zero-emission hydrogen fuel cells remain a strong candidate for many owners and operators. It is also technologically feasible and realistic to develop ammonia reformers too, which would offer another zero-carbon solution.

What about costs and safety?

These have historically been the primary barriers to more widespread fuel cell adoption. It is true that fuel cells still have a relatively high capital expenditure (CAPEX) but we’ve established that their lower OPEX can help to recover some of the sunk costs.

As regulations evolve and technology costs decrease as solutions become more commoditised, purchasers must constantly re-evaluate the costs of their decarbonisation options. The act of polluting is also becoming more costly, shortening the payback period for zero-emission technology. Carbon taxes and levies are already changing the equation.

While it’s true that hydrogen is flammable, fuel cells now have a proven safety track record. As well as in marine environments, fuel cells are used at conferences with around 80,000 people regularly milling past. If fuel cells can be used to electrify everything at a Coldplay concert or a golf tournament, there is no reason they can’t be used safely around people on a cruise ship or ferry.

There are also countless cases of fuel cell technology used in scenarios with potential hazards, such as constructions sites or off-road mining trucks. From a marine perspective, ships already have similar safety considerations for marine gas engines – including ventilation requirements, double-wall piping, gas leak and fire detection. With the alternative fuels transition underway, shipping has good gas handling training, standards and protocols in place too.

Fuel cells have associated benefits as well. They can be used to support load smoothing and peak shaving in ports or as auxiliaries. This can allow the primary engines to be operated more smoothly and efficiently or for ports to add resilience and redundancy to their energy infrastructure. Fuel cells are quiet and vibration-free since they contain almost no moving mechanical pieces. Fewer moving parts also minimises maintenance requirements compared to internal combustion engines.",,N,,2025-11-12 20:57:41.541962

While I was preparing this November 2025 update I happened to come across the recent press release on the website of Dolphin Drilling:

Dolphin Drilling AS (OSE: DDRIL) (""Dolphin"") today confirms that His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) in the UK and the Company has reached a position in respect of the outstanding corporation tax liability of GBP 12.2 million, where the Company will repay its debt to HMRC over a period until April 30, 2026. This liability relates to a legacy claim dismissed by the UK Supreme Court on 24 June 2025. Dolphin Drilling is committed to meeting its financial obligations and continuing to focus on its operational and strategic priorities.

Interesting I thought and also concluded that I must have missed this decision during the summertime. I had a look and the case revolved around whether Dolphin could fully deduct the costs of leasing a support vessel, the Borgsten Dolphin, from an associated company based outside the UK.

The main issue was how the vessel was used. The Borgsten Dolphin wasn’t just a technical support ship; it also provided living quarters for workers on the Dunbar oil platform in the North Sea. Dolphin argued that the accommodation was only a minor part of the vessel’s role, and that the main purpose was to support drilling operations. If that were true, they could avoid a cap on how much of the lease cost they could deduct from their UK tax bill.

However, HMRC saw things differently. They pointed out that providing accommodation was a significant and independent use of the vessel—so much so that extra berths were added specifically for this purpose, and Total (the oil company) paid for these upgrades. In HMRC’s view, this meant the vessel’s accommodation role wasn’t just incidental or secondary.

The Supreme Court agreed with HMRC. The judges said that if providing accommodation is an important and separate function of a vessel—even if it’s not the only one—then the special tax cap applies. As a result, Dolphin Drilling couldn’t deduct the full lease payments, leading to a higher tax bill.

This ruling is a win for HMRC and clarifies the rules for oil and gas companies operating in UK waters. It sends a clear message: if a support vessel is used significantly for accommodation, companies can’t sidestep the tax cap by claiming that’s just a side benefit!

Hope you enjoy the other updates and cases as well!

1. India

Summary of Supreme Court Case: 2025 INSC 1247 – Pride Foramer S.A. v. Commissioner of Income Tax & Anr.

Background:

Pride Foramer S.A., a French non-resident company engaged in oil drilling, had a contract with ONGC in India from 1983 to 1993. After the contract ended, there was a gap until a new contract was awarded in 1998 (formalized in 1999). During the intervening years (Assessment Years 1996-97, 1997-98, 1999-2000), the company maintained business correspondences and submitted bids but had no active contract or office in India.

Key Issue:

Whether the company was ""carrying on business"" in India during these years, entitling it to deduct business expenses under Section 37(1) and carry forward unabsorbed depreciation under Section 32(2) of the Income Tax Act.

Lower Authorities’ Findings:

Assessing Officer & CIT (Appeals): Disallowed deductions, holding the company was not carrying on business in India during the relevant years.

ITAT: Reversed this, holding a temporary lull does not mean cessation of business, and allowed the deductions.

High Court: Overturned ITAT, stating that without a contract or office in India, the company was not carrying on business.

Supreme Court’s Analysis & Decision:

The Supreme Court held that a mere lull or temporary discontinuance does not amount to cessation of business if the intention to continue exists, as evidenced by ongoing correspondences and bids. The existence of a permanent establishment or office in India is not a prerequisite for a non-resident company to be considered as carrying on business in India under the Income Tax Act. The Court found that the company’s actions (correspondence, bidding, etc.) showed a clear intention to continue business activities in India. The restrictive interpretation by the High Court was rejected as inconsistent with modern business realities and India’s commitment to facilitating cross-border business.

Conclusion:

The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the High Court’s order, and restored the ITAT’s decision. The company was entitled to claim business expenditure deductions and carry forward unabsorbed depreciation for the relevant years.

2. Lithuania

Seeks to extend it’s tonnage tax regime

On 20 October 2025, Lithuania’s Ministry of Transport and Communications announced changes to the Corporate Profit Tax Law (No. IX‑675), prolonging the availability of the tonnage tax regime—a fixed-rate profit taxation approach—for shipping companies.

The legislative update amends Article 381, paragraph 5, which outlines the criteria and procedures for utilizing this alternative corporate tax framework.

Shipping companies that wish to benefit from the fixed-rate system are required to inform their local tax office of this decision by the end of the first quarter of the tax period in which they first become eligible.

Under the tonnage tax regime, qualifying maritime businesses determine their corporate tax liability based on the tonnage (carrying capacity) of their vessels, rather than their actual earnings, thereby streamlining tax compliance for the shipping industry. With this extension, eligible companies will be able to continue using the fixed-rate taxation method through 31 December 2036.

These changes are scheduled to come into force on 1 January 2027.

3. United Nations

Decided to delay the adoption of proposed changes to MARPOL Annex VI

On 17 October 2025, the UN’s International Maritime Organization (IMO) deferred a decision on draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI that would introduce the IMO Net-Zero Framework—an unprecedented global carbon tax for shipping—after the United States objected to the proposal.

The US had previously warned that the Framework, designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions from ships, would unfairly increase costs for American businesses and consumers. As a result, the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) postponed further discussion for a year, with talks set to resume in 2026.

Meanwhile, the Intersessional Working Group on ship GHG emissions will continue developing implementation guidelines. The Net-Zero Framework, initially approved in principle in April 2025, would form a new chapter in the revised MARPOL Annex VI, which regulates air pollution from ships and covers nearly all of the world’s merchant fleet.

4. CJEU

Dismisses taxpayer’s (Fugro) appeal on the EU Minimum Tax Directive challenge

On October 30, 2025, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) dismissed an appeal (C-146/24 P) challenging Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523, known as the EU Minimum Tax Directive. The case was brought by a Dutch multinational subject to the Dutch tonnage tax regime, which argued that the Directive’s rules on the exclusion of shipping income conflicted with existing national tonnage tax benefits and lacked transitional protections for existing beneficiaries.

The General Court had previously rejected the challenge, finding that the company was not “individually concerned” by the Directive as required under Article 263 TFEU to bring an annulment action. The CJEU upheld this decision, ruling that simply being affected by changes to a favorable tax regime does not grant an acquired right or legal standing to challenge the Directive. The appeal was therefore dismissed. See here for a more extensive summary by KPMG’s EU Tax Centre or an article of Bloomberg on this topic here. The SBIE for mobile assets is still under discussion.

5. Brazil-Netherlands

Tax treaty and MLI

On 20 October 2025, the OECD announced that Brazil signed the Multilateral Instrument (MLI). The signing of the MLI by Brazil raises the question if and to what extent this could have consequences for the tax treaty between Brazil and the Netherlands. This question is set out below. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you would have any follow-up questions.

In general terms, the signing of the MLI does not in and of itself have consequences for the tax treaty between Brazil and the Netherlands. In order for the MLI to have consequences for the treaty, two cumulative conditions need to be fulfilled. The first condition is that Brazil must ratify the MLI in order for the MLI to be able to enter into force for Brazil. Whereas it is difficult to predict how long ratification will take, prior research (based on data as at 19 October 2022) indicates that ratification takes, on average, more than two years. The second condition is that the Netherlands would have to notify the tax treaty with Brazil as a covered tax agreement. In the absence of such a notification, the tax treaty would not be a covered tax treaty and could not be affected by the MLI. Although there is no guidance in this respect, we consider it likely that the Netherlands would notify the treaty, especially if Brazil were to have ratified the MLI.

If it the two conditions would be fulfilled and the MLI would become effective in relation to the tax treaty between Brazil and the Netherlands, the most relevant consequences seem to be as follows:

Mutual agreement corporate tie-breaker instead of place of effective management corporate tie-breaker;

Switch-over provision applicable for Dutch residents. Based on this switch-over, the Netherlands would no longer be required to exempt income derived from Brazil that is also exempt by Brazil as a result of the application of the tax treaty. This is particularly relevant for disregarded permanent establishments of Dutch residents whose income is currently exempt in the Netherlands.

A principal purposes test. Brazil has indicated that it does intend to adopt a limitation on benefits provision, in addition to or in replacement of the principal purpose test, through bilateral negotiation. In the meantime, however, a principal purpose test would become applicable.

No mandatory arbitration in connection with mutual agreement procedures.

We will closely monitor the developments from both a Brazilian and Dutch tax perspective.

Delivering his remarks at the just concluded conference in Miami, under the theme “A Joint Development Pathway: A New Framework for Partnership Between Cruise Lines and Caribbean Ports,” Telemaque described a strategic shift from competition to collaboration — a “shared pathway” built on transparency, green infrastructure, and measurable climate progress.

Telemaque said that PMAC, which now represents 22 ports across 21 Caribbean states, must become the central hub for maritime governance and innovation in the region. The goal, he explained, is to foster operational and financial efficiency while improving service delivery for cruise and cargo partners alike.

He emphasized that the maritime landscape has shifted dramatically under new International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations — particularly the 2027 global carbon pricing framework — and urged regional ports to act collectively rather than individually.

“The regulatory tsunami of IMO 2027 and the EU Emissions Trading System is both a challenge and an opportunity,” Telemaque said.

“It’s time for ports and cruise lines to align on a unified decarbonization strategy that turns compliance costs into commercial value.”

A centerpiece of Telemaque’s address was the Inclusive GreenPort Resilience Infrastructure & Decarbonization (InGRED) Programme — a multi-billion-dollar regional platform to transform Caribbean ports from traditional gateways into next-generation energy and data hubs.

Telemaque explained that the initiative is not a “sustainability campaign” but a strategic business platform designed to align environmental necessity with economic opportunity.

Highlighting the importance of accountability, Telemaque presented PMAC’s AI-powered MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification) platform — a real-time digital system tracking vessel emissions, energy consumption, and carbon reduction progress.

“This is not a promise; it’s a working system,” he noted. “It transforms PMAC from a traditional association into a strategic, data-driven partner that cruise lines can trust.”

Meanwhile Telemaque said cruise executives responded enthusiastically to discussions on the Joint Development Pathway, describing it as a timely and collaborative approach to the major challenges created by the IMO’s Net Zero Framework.

He told Antigua.news that cruise lines are under pressure to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, a costly shift made more difficult by the limited availability of viable alternatives.

The proposed framework, he said, aims to help both ports and ship owners jointly navigate this transition by developing essential infrastructure such as shore power systems, new fuel options, and regional logistics networks to support the change.

For Antigua, Telemaque noted that cruise lines have reaffirmed their need for expanded port services, including provisioning, shore power, LNG bunkering, blended biofuels, regular fuel supply, waste removal (with potential for waste-to-energy conversion), and hull-cleaning technology — all critical to meeting the evolving environmental and operational standards of the global cruise industry.",https://antigua.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Multi-Template-Whiteboard-13-1-e1762978296837.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 15:56:36.029942

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez spoke at one of the first side events at the United Nations climate negotiations this week on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon. The side event discussed the shipping industry’s efforts to slash carbon pollution by cutting back on fossil fuels.

Maritime nations were about to adopt the first global carbon fee on shipping last month at the IMO, the U.N. agency that regulates the international industry. They had already agreed on the regulations in April, so adopting them was widely expected to be a formality.

But after much pressure from U.S. President Trump, along with Saudi Arabia and a handful of other countries, delegates postponed the decision for a year. Trump said then that the U.S. “will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping.”

Plan to slash emissions postponed

The regulations — or “Net-Zero Framework” — would have set a marine fuel standard that decreases the amount of greenhouse gas emissions allowed from shipping fuels over time. The regulations also would establish a pricing system that would impose a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted by ships above allowable limits.

Shipping emissions have grown over the past decade to about 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions as trade has grown. That makes them a significant cause of climate change. Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil that releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it’s burned.

Large ships last about 25 years, so the industry would need to make changes and investments now to slash its emissions. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents over 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, advocated for the adoption of the regulations.

Dominguez told the Associated Press that despite the new rules being blocked, progress is continuing to be made on the shipping fee’s framework. He said he doesn’t blame the United States or other countries for thwarting the new regulations.

The U.S. is one of only four nations skipping the climate conference, known as COP30, along with tiny San Marino and strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar.

In a full room of organizers called “maritime enthusiasts,” Dominguez said that the world shouldn’t judge the IMO for October’s setback and that “there’s no reason to be upset” given “how volatile the world is right now.”

“Don’t think the IMO stops there, because we don’t,” he said. “We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.”

Dominguez said he remains positive that countries can adopt a fee on carbon pollution to clean up shipping, though “it is too early to go into any of the details.”

“I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states [and] sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,” he said. “Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.”

Hopes for future shipping fee remain

Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, climate envoy for the Netherlands, said in a keynote address after Dominguez’s opening remarks that his nation and many other countries were ready to adopt the regulations last month in London, which they had expected to celebrate at COP30.

He said that while the delay in many ways caused a “sense of failure,” it is “equally important to take a cool-headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month.”

“We see its merits for addressing greenhouse gases and contributing to a just and equitable transition,” he said. “We also continue to work constructively with all interested parties to overcome the barriers for its adoption next year.”

Shipping can go pollution free, said Andrew Forrest of Fortescue, the Australian green technology, energy and metals company, during the IMO side event.

Automation Of Shipping Vessels Autonomous ships are now a reality for an increasing number of shipping companies.","Sedat Saka, energetic leader and President of MTS Logistics, a NYC-based, top U.S. logistics company.

Uncertainty has dominated shipping over the past decade, from the 2016 Hanjin bankruptcy to Covid. This year was no exception. Will 2026 prove calmer for shipping? As the head of an international freight forwarding company for 25 years, I am in a unique position to foresee developments in shipping and offer trends I believe will dominate next year.

Geopolitical Events

Geopolitical events have affected shipping this year, and in 2026, there are several developments worth watching.

The “Red Sea crisis” of ships attacked in the Red Sea by Yemen-based Houthi rebels has been ongoing since the 10/7 Hamas attacks on Israel. The attacks continued throughout 2025. Ships have re-routed around Africa, rather than through the Red Sea. With a ceasefire, shipping will again become quicker.

Pay attention to tensions between the U.S. and Iran, as any military conflict between the countries could shut the Strait of Hormuz, used to deliver oil and roil shipping.

Tensions with Russia are also a threat. The war in Ukraine has affected commodities such as grain and oil. There was some progress toward a deal to protect Black Sea ships, but only an end to the war will bring safety to ships in the Black Sea.

U.S. Trade Policy

U.S. tariffs imposed on foreign nations have dominated shipping. As the Trump administration imposed tariffs on allies and foes, shipping became more expensive for many. A big question for 2026 is whether these tariffs will continue or end if trade deals are reached with countries. The end of the so-called de minimis exemption signaled a large cost increase on shippers.

In April, the Trump administration announced it would impose a new penalty for Chinese-made ships arriving at U.S. ports, starting in October 2025. The policy assesses fees against Chinese-made vessels calling U.S. ports—another cost that will be passed to shippers in 2026. The U.S. is trying to reduce China’s shipbuilding dominance.

Tariffs also drive uncertainty. Small to mid-size importers and businesses will likely be most affected, meaning many small to mid-size companies would go under or be acquired if tariffs remain. If the U.S. economy experiences a recession in 2026, Trump could pare back tariffs to stimulate the economy.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

AI advancement is the major story of 2025. Companies have joined the race for artificial general intelligence (AGI) and developed tools that have been rolled out by companies, including in shipping and logistics. There are questions about whether AI is ready to replace humans. In 2026, AI will see further advancements and be further applied to shipping, whether for customs enforcement or document compliance.

Shipping Consolidation

Over the past decade, shipping companies have consolidated into “alliances” to pool resources, build resilience and increase profitability. In 2025, a major change occurred as Maersk and MSC’s 2M Alliance ended in February. Maersk partnered with Hapag-Lloyd in a new Gemini Cooperation alliance. Other alliances such as the Ocean Alliance between CMA CGM, Cosco, OOCL and Evergreen remain.

In 2026—a decade since the Hanjin bankruptcy—shippers will likely re-evaluate whether the alliances work. Transformations in alliances would impact rates, schedule reliability and deliverability.

Cleaner Ships And Sustainability

In 2025, shipping and logistics made progress on a clean-emissions deal as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced a fuel-emissions framework. The IMO’s “Net-Zero Framework” has faced opposition from the U.S. and others, risking the proposed October 2025 adoption date. In 2026, pressure will likely remain on the largest economies to reach a shipping emissions deal. China has emerged as a key party in the fight against climate change, and China’s shipping industry will likely be part of any solution.

Sustainability has become a key part of shipping companies’ strategic plans, and much progress has come from the private sector rather than world governments. That is likely to continue and increase the pressure on the U.S. and others.

Automation Of Shipping Vessels

Autonomous ships are now a reality for an increasing number of shipping companies. The IMO is developing a regulatory framework for governing autonomous ships. In 2022, the MV Yara Birkeland became the world’s first autonomous cargo ship in service, transporting fertilizer.

In 2026, more autonomous ships are likely to enter service. With advances in AI, these ships are likely to be safer, more efficient and smarter. The U.S. Navy is even considering commissioning autonomous vessels for maritime transport. Whether the shipping industry will embrace autonomous technology or push back due to worker concerns is unknown.

Another Inventory Imbalance

Following the Covid pandemic, there was an inventory imbalance with too much inventory being front-loaded and container ships being empty. Carriers cancelled routes, which resulted in higher prices. Based on my industry knowledge, the opposite is happening. Inventory levels for businesses are depleted. Businesses will need to replenish inventory, which would increase costs on businesses already facing higher, across-the-board costs. Companies’ sales will likely decrease if higher costs from tariffs and other issues prevent them from sending inventory.

These higher costs should initially arise during the fourth quarter of 2025, with the full effects visible by the first quarter. That could force the U.S. government to re-evaluate its tariff position. The Federal Reserve may also intervene, but it remains to be seen whether interest rates will be changed due to inflationary pressures.

A Calmer 2026

I see the uncertainty in shipping personally. Customers have faced more expensive shipping costs, more regulatory hurdles and uncertainty throughout 2025. I see a lot of potential for 2026. Breakthroughs in technology and emissions standards, as well as positive developments in geopolitical events, offer hope for a calmer shipping and logistics industry after a volatile decade.

According to the analysis, international maritime shipping of energy products remains particularly sensitive to potential disruption at key chokepoints, including the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, the Suez Canal and Red Sea, and the Panama Canal.

Furthermore, there are risks to energy infrastructure arising from vulnerabilities in the digital world: as energy systems have become increasingly electrified, integrated and connected, their vulnerability to cyberattacks has increased.

Against this background, governments face a difficult balancing act as they seek to manage potential trade-offs while trying to align as far as possible the goals of energy security, energy transitions, supply chain security, affordability and industrial policy.

The approaches they take and the results they achieve will have a critical bearing on the outlook for energy.

When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once – a situation that calls for the same spirit and focus that governments showed when they created the IEA after the 1973 oil shock.

…said Fatih Birol, Executive Director, IEA.

Shipping activity increased by almost 30% in the 2015 to 2024 period. Thanks in large part to efficiency gains, oil demand rose by much less, just under 5% to 5 mb/d in 2024. In the CPS, projected changes in patterns of trade mean that growth in shipping activity slows, but shipping tonne-kilometres still rise by a further 15% by 2035, and oil demand increases by another 3%.

Although turnover in the shipping fleet remains gradual, more LNG-powered ships enter the fleet, and the fuel mix adjusts to meet the requirements of FuelEU maritime regulation in the European Union. As a result, the share of oil in shipping drops from more than 90% in 2024 to around 80% in 2035, and the share of LNG rises to nearly 15%. Some energy efficiency technologies that offer a positive return on investment are introduced for new ships. This leads to a 4% decline in shipping energy use per tonne-kilometre by 2035 in the CPS.

Shipping alliances restructured significantly in February 2025. The Ocean Alliance now leads with the largest fleet and strongest orderbooks, while MSC maintains the second-largest capacity while operating independently. The Gemini Cooperation emerges as a new powerhouse with a hub-focused network as the Premier Alliance remains much smaller, offering targeted direct-port services through February 2030.

Since February 2025, the container shipping industry has undergone significant restructuring among the major ocean carrier alliances.

Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have formed a new partnership known as the Gemini Cooperation, marking a major realignment in global carrier synergies. Meanwhile, Ocean Network Express (ONE), Yang Ming, and HMM—the remaining members of the former THE Alliance—have continued their collaboration under the new name Premium Alliance, while the Ocean Alliance, comprising CMA CGM, Evergreen, COSCO, and its subsidiary OOCL, has remained unchanged.

At the same time, MSC, the world’s largest ocean carrier in terms of TEU capacity, has opted to operate independently, pursuing a standalone strategy that has drawn considerable attention across the industry.

As a result, the new alliances, as well as MSC, are now defining the rules of global shipping.

While the box carriers do not deploy their entire vessel fleets within their respective alliance services, it is worth examining the total TEU capacities of each alliance, as this provides a broader picture of the market dynamics and the potential strength of each partnership.

Ocean Alliance Dominates with Largest Fleet and Orders

The Ocean Alliance is now the most dominant container alliance, with a total capacity of over 9.5 million TEUs. Both CMA CGM and COSCO, the most powerful members of the partnership, have strong orderbooks and are expected to receive around 3 million TEUs combined in the coming months and years.

In particular, CMA CGM has commissioned around 130 new buildings totalling over 1.7 million TEUs, COSCO is set to receive more than 80 vessels with a combined capacity of approximately 1.2 million TEUs, while Evergreen’s orderbook includes over 40 box ships with a total capacity of about 660,000 TEUs. The vast fleet, along with their established network—since the Ocean Alliance has been active since 2017—positions it well to retain a leading role in the market.

MSC Expands Capacity Despite Going Solo

Although operating independently, MSC has developed its fleet to a level that makes it the second-largest shipping player, with container ships capable of moving more than 7 million TEUs.

MSC’s strong fleet has been the backbone of its strategic decision to remain independent, allowing the company to be flexible and offer over 1,500 direct port combinations, providing clients with a wide range of choices. It is also important to note that MSC has by far the strongest orderbook among its competitors, expecting to receive more than 2.1 million TEUs in the near future.

Gemini Cooperation Backed by Hub-Focused Network

Gemini is emerging as a new powerhouse in the industry, following the decision of Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd to join forces and form an alliance with a combined capacity of over 7 million TEUs.

The Gemini Cooperation is supported by Maersk’s extensive port and terminal network, operated through Maersk’s subsidiary APM Terminals, and has chosen a hub-focused network approach in contrast to MSC’s direct-connection strategy.

Both Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have relatively smaller orderbooks compared to the other major container lines, with approximately 810,000 and 390,000 TEUs respectively.

Smaller Premier Alliance Set to Operate Through 2030

ONE, HMM and Yang Ming have decided to continue their collaboration, forming a shipping group – the Premier Alliance – with a combined capacity of around 3.8 million TEUs—significantly smaller compared to their competitors in terms of total capacity.

This tripartite alliance provides end-to-end direct port container services to customers across both the Transpacific and Asia–Europe trades, with their agreement set to last until February 2030.

The combined orderbook of the three companies barely exceeds 1 million TEUs with ONE leading the pack having ordered more than 50 vessels featuring an overall container capacity of over 630,000 TEUs, while HMM and Yang Ming have ordered 16 and 18 ships with around 190,000 and 240,000 TEUs respectively.",https://www.czapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/0b107625-db75-452e-a4ab-e5e80e5501b1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:58:06.386616

Industry leaders are calling for realism in the green transition, peace for trade to flourish, and investments to secure the future of the maritime economy.","Hundreds of executives and entrepreneurs from the global shipping world gathered in Dubai over the past few days, where on Saturday, November 8, Bahri Week officially began—an event lasting five to six days that has evolved into one of the most important annual events in the tanker sector.

Approximately 5,000 visitors are estimated to have traveled to Dubai for the event, which many call the “Posidonia of tankers,” comparing it to the major Greek shipping exhibition held every two years in Athens.

Of particular interest during this year’s Bahri Week was the Capital Link Forum, held on Tuesday, with the participation of leading figures in international shipping: Evangelos Marinakis, founder and chairman of Capital Maritime & Trading; Ahmed Ali Alsubaey, CEO of Bahri Group; Lois Zabrocky, CEO of International Seaways; and George Prokopiou, founder of Dynacom Tankers Management.

Evangelos Marinakis’s proposal caused a sensation among the discussion participants—and was applauded by the audience—calling for a temporary lifting of sanctions for a period, aimed at enabling the disposal of many old vessels belonging to the so-called “shadow tanker fleet,” which poses a serious threat to the environment.

The IMO Regulation Postponement

The first topic of discussion was the one-year postponement of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) vote regarding the new framework for zero emissions balance.

The moderator asked whether this represents “a steady stance” or “a restart from zero” aimed at formulating a new proposal.

Evangelos Marinakis focused on the failure of international organizations to arrive at implementable solutions:

“We have our views. They may be different. It is not a matter of disagreement. It is a matter of how each of us perceives our responsibilities and what we need to do as leaders in our industry. Because of the number of ships we operate and the volume of cargo we transport. Over the past ten years, there have been a lot of discussions within the IMO, the committees of the Greek Shipowners Association, Norwegian Shipowners Association, European Associations, and with our classification societies regarding efforts to reduce emissions. But the problem begins when disagreements lead us to find compromises. So at the end of the day, the compromise reached allows us to continue using our vessels but we will be penalized with taxes that the European countries will be receiving. So, in this way, we do not solve our environmental problem. It is like paying someone to die happier. It does not make sense. Mr. Prokopiou has consistently advocated for slow steaming, which produces a result: reduced emissions. The only increase is in transportation time, but we see a benefit to the environment. This is a matter of fact. Being penalized with high taxation for vessel use does not solve the problem.”

Mr. Marinakis added:

“They resorted to this measure because they could not agree on the basics in the first place. This is the reality. Another reality is Mr. Trump’s election. From the beginning, he has been radical regarding green discussions and transitions. By campaigning for countries not to vote for this taxation, we saw some European countries—Greece and Cyprus—change their position at the last minute, resulting in postponement. What I think we should do is compromise but agree on measures that will have an immediate effect on our environment. We have at least a year ahead to engage in constructive discussions and find a solution. That is how I see it from my point of view. Having seen these regulations and deadlines, we invested a lot—not in $10,000 ‘LNG ready’ certificates, but in proper LNG dual-fuel vessels, over 30 ships. We have paid a significant premium. And this is now delayed. But when the LNG market stabilizes and new production comes online, LNG prices will be lower. It will make sense to consume LNG irrespective of the emission reductions. This is my view on your question.”

Industry Realism & Green Transition

George Prokopiou was clear about his position: “I was convinced this would not pass because it is absurd to penalize someone for not using fuels that don’t exist. How can you penalize somebody for something that does not exist?”

He went on to explain the financial implications: “A Suezmax costs $75-80 million, yet during its lifespan, the vessel would incur $240 million in penalties—three times the ship’s value on top of the initial cost. Nobody can bear such costs except the consumer, which will increase inflation and poverty while reducing living standards.”

He emphasized the industry’s limited role in global pollution: “Shipping is responsible for only 2.5% of world pollution. Why don’t we focus on what causes the other 97.5% first?”

Prokopiou stressed that shipowners are being unfairly targeted: “We are not engine builders or shipyards. We are the taxi drivers—the users, not the fuel makers. The refineries and energy companies produce the fuel. The surest way to discredit an organization is to issue rules that cannot be implemented.”

He expressed confusion about certain countries’ positions: “I cannot understand why the Norwegians and other northern countries favor this net zero framework so strongly. I have yet to receive a satisfactory explanation.”

Emphasizing the practical approach of family companies, he concluded: “We are a family company. We strive for excellence and care about leaving a better environment for our children and grandchildren, but we must pursue what is possible, not just what is desirable.”

Lois Zabrocky emphasized that the industry has already demonstrated its commitment: “Looking at the order book, we’re talking about over $70 billion in real investment. The industry is not reluctant—we’re stepping up and doing our duty. However, we need the technology to be ready for us. Once fees are collected, there must be effective utilization of these funds, which currently lacks a clear framework.”

She expressed confidence in the industry’s ability to adapt, though with realistic expectations: “We’re accustomed to overcoming obstacles—delivering oil and containers despite every challenge thrown at us. I believe we will decarbonize, but it will take longer than idealists anticipate.”

Ahmed Ali Alsubaey emphasized the industry’s proactive approach: “Regardless of regulations, we will invest in the safest possible vessels using the best available technology. Nobody wants to invest in what was available five years ago—we want what’s available today, and we do this without mandates because we genuinely care about this blue planet. My hope is that future negotiations will not produce rules that appear environmentally friendly but are actually environmentally damaging. Shipping has always been at the forefront of pushing toward cleaner and safer operations. When we meet with regulators, we need something practical and achievable that allows us to demonstrate our genuine commitment to environmental protection.”

Call to Scrap the Dark Fleet

Marinakis specifically addressed the creation of the so-called “shadow fleet,” a result of geopolitical tensions:

“I would like to make another point. This starts from geopolitics, because of the wars between Ukraine and Russia, conflicts in the Middle East in the past involving Iran, and the situation in Venezuela with its sanctions. Previously, we talked about net zero. All the discussion is about keeping our seas clean. There have been a lot of discussions, legislation, and expenses from all of us in order to maintain our seas clean. At the same time we have politicians discuss sanctions and also talking about peace. When I entered the conference room, there was a discussion with Anil Sharma regarding the dark fleet and sanctioned fleet. We have allowed all this time over 1,500 ships to operate—876 are already sanctioned. They don’t have insurance, proper crews, and adequate maintenance. We have seen also many incidents and accidents in the past 12 months involving these vessels in the Suez Canal, the Baltic, and collisions in Singapore. As an industry, we need to urge the US administration and Europe to immediately grant permission for these sanctioned vessels to be scrapped without further delay. India can receive vessels for scrap because they have not sanctioned these vessels.”

Mr. Marinakis continued:

“Owners cannot be paid to scrap their vessels, because they are sanctioned and alternative payment methods must be found. If we immediately obtain a waiver for the next 2-3 months at least to reduce this sanctioned dark fleet, it will help a lot the industry while significantly reducing unlawful trade. We spend time, effort, and money on issues with minimal impact on pollution. At the same time we allow fundamental problems to persist. It doesn’t make sense. We must make a concerted effort to send a strong message to provide this waiver immediately, so that we can eliminate this fleet. I don’t need to add anything more. Of course we like peace. We want peace. And at the end of the day, we look forward to peace.”

Dark Fleet Scrapping Projections

When asked about potential scrapping if sanctions were lifted, Marinakis estimated:

“At least 25% will proceed with scrapping, as many ships can barely operate. These vessels are used for trade with significant risk. Anil is the appropriate person to address this question, but from our observations, at least 25%—which represents many ships—will be scrapped. This will create a significant market impact.”

Dr. Anil Sharma commented: “It will be a way out for them. I think definitely if the licenses are given, there will be a flood of ships that are coming in because some of them are indeed unsafe and face insurance issues”.

When asked about the time frame, Marinakis added: “The time limit will help this. They will know they have three months and they will go for it.”

Prokopiou also stressed that it is important to “put a time limit within the next three months” as an incentive.

The Call for Peace

George Prokopiou emphasized the fundamental connection between peace and prosperity: “The best way to improve living standards is peace. When peace prevails, trade flourishes, and 90% of globalization occurs through shipping. Geopolitics remains one of the most unpredictable factors—nobody knows what will happen tomorrow. But if we must bet on something, we should bet on peace, not war.”

Prokopiou also challenged the terminology used for sanctioned vessels: “The term ‘dark fleet’ is misleading. It’s not dark—it’s a parallel fleet operating at different cost levels. Instead of penalizing Russia, we’re effectively providing them with cheaper transportation.”

Lois Zabrocky stressed the importance of free trade: “We thrive in an environment of open and free trade. Protectionism and tariff walls are not optimal scenarios for our industry. The Trump administration appears to believe that applying significant pressure can create peace.”

Ahmed Ali Alsubaey underscored the essential nature of shipping: “Without open and free trade, there is no long-term sustainability for any business. I always emphasize, particularly to the ladies in the audience, that without shipping there’s no shopping. We need to convince even protectionists that free trade must prosper again as it did in the past. I believe we’re approaching that point.”

Middle East Investment Opportunities

The discussion extended to the future of the United Arab Emirates and the broader Middle East region.

Marinakis expressed optimism about regional stability:

“Over the past 40 years, the region has experienced numerous wars—Iraq, Iran, the Kuwait invasion, and ongoing troubles in Syria and Lebanon. With such instability, it has been difficult to invest more or do things that we have seen recently. But the situation is now stabilizing. The threat from Iraq has diminished, Iran also has not been as aggressive as in the past. Solutions have been found in Syria and the surrounding region. Now is the time to expand and make real investments that were maybe postponed in previous years. This region has all the fundamentals necessary for much more investment and infrastructure progress. We are happy to be here, to do repeat business with friends and partners and to increase our activities in the region.”

Ahmed Ali Alsubaey highlighted the region’s strategic importance: “The Arabian Gulf has always been central to shipping, from the Silk Road to the Spice Route. Today it continues to serve as a crucial crossroads. If geopolitical conditions improve, we will witness a renaissance for the region. As the second fastest-growing economy after India and China, the Middle East sits at the intersection of global economies. That’s why I’m confident shipping will return strongly to this region.”

George Prokopiou noted the ongoing transformation: “Something very special is happening in this region in terms of investments.”

He also advocated for pragmatic energy solutions: “We shouldn’t fear oil—it will remain relevant. Carbon capture technology offers the solution. Capturing 50% of emissions would be sufficient. We have the infrastructure, refining capacity, and distribution networks. We should utilize them while making energy affordable globally.”

Lois Zabrocky observed market dynamics: “OPEC is beginning to reclaim market share, and regional countries are working intensively to achieve peace—a critical and valuable role.”

Newbuilding Market Outlook

The panel concluded with discussions about vessel orders and market conditions.

Marinakis acknowledged his position:

“Regarding newbuilding risks, we may be the wrong people to ask, as we have 100 vessels on order. We are obliged to be optimistic. And we are optimistic by nature, and we believe in the market. There are a lot of needs, more stability, and growth opportunities. As far as the newbuildings are concerned, the industry needs these vessels. If we have also significant progress with the dark fleet issue and scrapping of vessels delayed by market conditions and illegal trade, there is room to accommodate newbuildings. We are quite optimistic. We live in an inflationary environment where prices do not seem to go down. All costs have increased, and I do not see any immediate price reductions. We are optimistic that ships are needed for growth. Additionally, our new vessel orders are significantly more economical. This benefits both the environment and emissions reduction. Answering your question, yes, we are optimistic. We expect prices to remain high for a significant amount of time.”

Ahmed Ali Alsubaey offered a succinct philosophy: “Donald Trump says ‘drill, baby, drill.’ I say ‘build, baby, build.’ When regulations change, you need ships on order.”

Lois Zabrocky described International Seaways’ strategy: “We’ve renewed our MR fleet while selling older vessels and taking delivery of new LR1s. We recently purchased a secondhand VLCC. While new vessels are preferable, we’re constantly working to upgrade our fleet through various means.”

George Prokopiou acknowledged the complexity of market predictions: “This is the most difficult question, and certainty is impossible. Shipyards are fully booked through 2029. Predicting conditions four years ahead requires exceptional foresight. A financial crisis could disrupt everything, particularly if tariffs backfire.”

He emphasized efficiency gains: “Every newer vessel is more efficient. Fuel represents our largest expense, so a 30-35% reduction is significantly advantageous. However, older vessels and the parallel fleet continue generating substantial profits, which explains why secondhand vessels command prices disproportionate to their age.”

As leaders and delegates from around the world have gathered in Belém, Brazil, for the COP30 to engage in climate talks, the Industrial Transition Accelerator (ITA) and Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) announced that clean industry is entering a new phase of momentum, with 1,001 commercial-scale projects now recorded across all stages of development. This marks strong growth across multiple sectors and regions despite ongoing geopolitical headwinds.

New data published in MPP’s Global Project Tracker, supported by the ITA, reveals 144 commercial-scale projects worldwide have now reached final investment decision (FID). Of these, 82 are operational and 62 have secured funding, spanning the most energy-intensive sectors: aluminium, cement, chemicals, fuels for aviation and shipping and steel.

In shipping, the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) target of 5% clean fuel uptake by 2030 has spurred a wave of new ammonia and methanol projects from Singapore to Brazil, projects expected to accelerate once the IMO finalizes its net-zero framework.

Progress in the ammonia and methanol industries are especially significant, as both are expected to drive down the cost of clean hydrogen production. As prices fall, clean fertiliser could soon undercut conventional ‘grey’ production – a shift with major implications for food and energy security in import-dependent countries such as India and Brazil.

These same investments are also laying the groundwork for a broader clean hydrogen economy that will underpin industrial competitiveness worldwide. However, while existing and anticipated policies are driving demand in fuels, it remains limited in other sectors.

It’s taken nearly a decade to reach this point. With a record number of operational and under construction plants across all sectors, clean industry is no longer a vision for the future, it is a burgeoning opportunity we can speed up today. […]

…said Faustine Delasalle, Mission Possible Partnership CEO and Executive Director of Industrial Transition Accelerator

Policy action will determine who captures the opportunity

The evidence is clear: there is profit potential in clean industry, but the pace of financing depends on stronger demand-side policy. Governments that create predictable demand signals for clean materials, chemicals, and fuels will unlock the next wave of projects and secure their industrial futures.

The ITA’s work on demand-side policy in Europe highlights this opportunity: by creating lead markets for clean materials and fuels, the EU could revive its flagging industries and boost its pipeline of projects, which represents more than €100 billion in investment potential.

Such measures would strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security while adding only marginally to the cost of consumer goods, far less than inflation caused by volatility from fossil fuel-intensive production.

[…] Building on the leadership of many companies around the world, governments and investors have a unique opportunity to turn today’s plans into plants, which together will make up tomorrow’s global clean industrial economy. Those who demonstrate strategic foresight and unwavering commitment to the clean industrial transition stand to reap its benefits.

The EU ETS, UK ETS, and FuelEU Maritime are already in force, imposing monitoring, reporting, and financial obligations on ships trading up Europe. These regional systems—especially within the EU—are expected to expand further, and most NNPC members already fall within their scope.

For more information, see our recent articles on these developments:

What this means for shipowners

The delay increases uncertainty in the regulatory landscape. Without a global IMO framework, regional initiatives will continue to define compliance requirements. In the meantime, shipowners should continue to develop systems aligned with both EU ETS and potential future IMO rules and ensure charter party agreements included suitable clauses allocating emissions-related costs and responsibilities.",https://nnpc-marine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/delay_adoption-_IMO_net_zero_framework_until-_2026.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:59:08.355860

The need for greener fuels has been gaining traction due to stricter impending environmental rules in international shipping.

In April, the International Maritime Organization's Marine Environment Protection Committee approved net-zero regulations for global shipping during its 83rd session. The framework represents the IMO's regulatory response to the 2023 IMO GHG Strategy to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by or around 2050.

A key extraordinary session of the IMO's MEPC in October, however, decided to delay the ratification of the framework, including the adoption of new requirements on GHG fuel intensity, in combination with a pricing and reward mechanism, for one year.

The monthly average delivered bunker price for 0.5% sulfur fuel oil, the most common bunker type, was $483.73/metric ton in Singapore in September, according to the bunker cost calculator from Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.

The event, held in a ballroom that buzzed with anticipation, was more than just a meeting—it was a rallying cry for a new era in U.S. energy policy and a pointed critique of what attendees described as the dangers of environmental overreach. The summit’s opening remarks, delivered by AFPI’s vice chair of energy and environment, Oliver McPherson-Smith, set the tone: ""Around the world, governments are abusing an increasingly thin patina of environmentalism to push policies that further and further encroach on the freedoms of everyday citizens."" According to Inside Climate News, this sort of rhetoric is nothing new for AFPI, a think tank founded in 2021 in the wake of Donald Trump’s loss to Joe Biden.

AFPI has long criticized what it sees as ""apocalyptic rhetoric"" from the Biden administration, arguing that climate concerns have been used as a justification for sweeping government expansion. But for those gathered at the summit, Trump’s return to office was heralded as a kind of salvation—a chance to recommit to what they call the “American model” of energy and environmental policy. McPherson-Smith’s message was clear: ""Under the ‘America First’ leadership of President Trump, our nation is once again returning to, recommitting and advancing the American model of energy and environment.""

AFPI’s campaign director, Ted Ellis, described the summit as a forum for ""leading experts in energy policy to discuss the most pressing issues on today’s energy landscape: affordability, reliability, and energy independence."" The event featured a star lineup, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. Both officials highlighted the administration’s recent efforts to fight what they view as anti-energy and anti-prosperity policies, including a high-profile intervention on the world stage.

One of the most consequential moves came in October, when the U.S. played a pivotal role in blocking a global carbon tax framework at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The proposed rules would have capped greenhouse gas emissions from shipping vessels, requiring those that exceeded limits to purchase carbon credits or pay extra fees. As reported by Inside Climate News, a draft of the framework was initially approved in April 2025 by 63 countries, with only 16 voting against and 24 abstentions. But after months of pressure from the Trump administration—including threats of tariffs, visa restrictions, sanctions, and additional port fees—support for the framework shifted dramatically. In October, with the backing of the U.S. and other nations, Saudi Arabia introduced a proposal to postpone the framework until October 2026. This time, 57 countries voted for postponement and 49 against, with 21 abstentions. ""I will tell you that the ‘it’s going to happen’ crowd were very disappointed,"" Wright said at the AFPI summit. ""That’s because of your support, your belief, your commitment to this stuff … and helping to elect President Trump and the cabinet he picked.""

AFPI’s influence on the Trump administration’s energy agenda is unmistakable. The think tank’s 2022 policy book, “The America First Agenda,” calls for the modernization of cornerstone environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act, to spur economic growth. AFPI has also pushed for ending what it calls ""outsized subsidies"" for renewable energies and has labeled the Inflation Reduction Act a threat to national security. In May 2025, the organization claimed that the Trump administration had enacted or advanced over 86 percent of its agenda in the first 100 days of Trump’s second term.

Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act""—which mandates lease sales for oil and gas drilling while slashing incentives for wind and solar development—was described by critics as a major win for the fossil fuel industry. The administration is also seeking to reverse the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health, a key legal basis for regulating emissions. According to Inside Climate News, companies can now simply email the EPA to request exemptions from Clean Air Act regulations that limit toxic emissions from facilities like coal-fired power plants.

AFPI’s reach extends deep into Trump’s inner circle. Brooke Rollins, now agriculture secretary, is the co-founder and former president and CEO of AFPI, despite having little professional background in agricultural policy. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, and McPherson-Smith himself (who previously served as executive director of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council) all have ties to AFPI. The New York Times has reported that AFPI’s connections to the fossil fuel industry date back to its founding, with Texas oil tycoon Tim Dunn playing a key role in its creation.

Meanwhile, in New York, the battle over energy policy has taken a dramatic turn. As reported by The Hill, the federal government in April 2025 ordered a work-stop on the $5 billion Empire Wind offshore wind farm project off Long Island, only to reverse the decision a month later. This move fueled speculation about a political deal between Governor Kathy Hochul and the White House, possibly trading support for new natural gas pipelines in exchange for restarting Empire Wind.

Two long-dormant pipeline projects—the 23.5-mile Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) Pipeline and the 125-mile Constitution Pipeline—were revived in 2025, with both re-filing for state permits. Yet New York state law effectively bans new fossil fuel infrastructure, and Hochul has been careful to state that “New York will work with the [Trump] administration and private entities on new energy projects that meet the legal requirements under New York law.”

New York is widely considered one of the most anti-fossil fuel states in the country. The state banned oil and gas drilling in 2014, closed all coal-fired power plants, and rejected every natural gas pipeline proposed—until now. The 2019 Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act set aggressive targets: 100 percent electric vehicle sales by 2035, an emissions-free electricity grid by 2040, and a net-zero economy by 2050. Hochul doubled down in 2023 with the All-Electric Building Act, banning natural gas hookups for new buildings starting in 2026. In late 2024, she expanded the fracking ban and signed the Climate Change Superfund Act, imposing a $3 billion annual tax on oil and gas companies beginning in 2026.

The New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) had previously denied water permits for the NESE and Constitution pipelines multiple times. But in November 2025, the DEC surprised many by approving the NESE pipeline, despite highlighting its inconsistency with statewide greenhouse gas emission limits. At the same time, the DEC remanded the Constitution Pipeline’s application back to its sponsor and federal regulators, ending hopes for a quick approval.

Critics argue that New York’s anti-fossil fuel policies not only affect the state but have ripple effects across the region and the nation. By blocking pipelines, New York restricts natural gas flow to New England, impacting regional energy prices and reliability. Its aggressive climate policies, they say, interfere with interstate commerce and the national economy. As Paul Tice, a senior fellow at the National Center for Energy Analytics, wrote in The Hill, ""It’s time for the Trump administration to start suing to finally establish federal supremacy for American energy policy.""

Why green methanol matters

Shipping moves around 90 per cent of global trade and contributes nearly 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. With the International Maritime Organization (IMO) targeting net zero by 2050, the industry faces a complex transition to alternative green fuels.

Green methanol — produced from organic waste (bio-methanol) or by combining green hydrogen and captured CO2 (e-methanol) — offers a promising solution. However, widespread adoption is constrained by limited supply, infrastructure gaps, high retrofitting costs and regulatory uncertainty.

Methanol-handling capabilities are currently limited to a small number of ports, and green methanol remains in short supply. Supporting infrastructure — such as pipelines, storage tanks and refuelling stations — is also underdeveloped.

Despite these challenges, decarbonising shipping could accelerate renewable energy investment and unlock economic opportunities for Australia.

Our response

From feasibility to future-ready

This pre-feasibility study explores how green methanol can be transported, stored and used as fuel for short-sea vessels. It focuses on methanol produced by the proposed Solar Methanol 1 (SM1) demonstration plant near Port Augusta, South Australia.

SM1 aims to produce approximately 7,500 tonnes per annum of e-methanol using renewable energy, electrolysis-derived hydrogen and captured industrial CO2.

Led by Vast Renewables through its Hyfuel Solar Refinery subsidiary, the project is exploring the technical, infrastructure, regulatory and commercial readiness required to adopt green methanol in maritime operations.

While the initial focus is on Australian short-sea vessels, the long-term vision is to expand supply to Singapore and beyond through larger-scale projects in Western Australia and the Americas.

The results

Fuelling the future without fossil fuels

The project is being delivered in multiple phases, each addressing a key area of readiness:

Technical readiness has defined standards and design options for methanol-ready engines and storage facilities.

Infrastructure readiness has evaluated port, transport and storage capabilities.

Regulatory readiness has examined policy settings and calculate lifecycle emissions reductions.

Commercial readiness has explored market dynamics, competitor activity and viable business models.

Knowledge sharing will ensure insights are shared with port users in Australia and Singapore to support uptake and strengthen international collaboration.

By identifying barriers and opportunities in the rollout of green methanol for short-sea vessels, the project aims to help reduce costs and accelerate adoption. The study supports increased uptake through cross-border value chains and stakeholder engagement.

Ultimately, demonstrating the viability of Australian-produced green methanol will build industry confidence and improve supply chain readiness.

Strengthened collaboration between Australian and Singaporean ports will further drive investment and support the transition to low emissions maritime fuel.

The United Nations climate negotiations, COP30, had just kicked off on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, and one side event drew a crowd of so-called ""maritime enthusiasts"" eager to hear what was next for the ships that keep global trade afloat. The spotlight was on Arsenio Dominguez, Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), who addressed the future of shipping’s role in the fight against climate change.

Dominguez’s message was both determined and realistic. Despite a major setback just weeks earlier—when the United States, led by President Donald Trump, and Saudi Arabia blocked a long-anticipated set of new rules aimed at slashing shipping emissions—he insisted that efforts to decarbonize the industry are far from over. ""Don’t think the IMO stops there, because we don’t,"" Dominguez told the gathered crowd, according to the Associated Press. ""We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.""

It’s a complicated moment for the shipping industry, which has quietly become a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. According to the AP, shipping now accounts for about 3% of global emissions, a figure that has grown steadily over the past decade as international trade has boomed. Most of the world’s ships still burn heavy fuel oil, a dirty and carbon-intensive energy source, and with the average large vessel lasting up to 25 years, any shift away from fossil fuels will require both immediate action and long-term investment.

The regulations that were set to be adopted in October 2025 would have marked a historic first: a global carbon fee on shipping. The plan, known as the ""Net-Zero Framework,"" would have set a marine fuel standard to gradually decrease the amount of greenhouse gases that ships are allowed to emit. It also included a pricing system, imposing a minimum fee of $100 for every ton of greenhouse gases emitted above allowable limits. The International Chamber of Shipping, which represents more than 80% of the world’s merchant fleet, was among those pushing for the new rules. The expectation was that adoption would be a mere formality, following an agreement reached in April.

But that expectation was dashed after intense lobbying from President Trump, Saudi Arabia, and a handful of other countries. Trump, never one to mince words, declared that the United States ""will not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping."" The result was a year-long postponement, with the decision now pushed to 2026. It was a blow for many nations who had hoped to celebrate the agreement at COP30, and it left a sense of disappointment hanging over the climate talks.

Yet, if Dominguez felt frustration, he didn’t show it. Instead, he struck a conciliatory tone, refusing to blame the U.S. or any other country for the delay. ""There’s no reason to be upset given how volatile the world is right now,"" he said, according to the AP. He emphasized that the IMO is still making progress on the framework for a shipping carbon fee and remains committed to engaging all member states and sectors in the decarbonization effort. ""I will go to everyone to engage proactively, in a fair manner, to work with all the member states (and) sectors that need to be part of the decarbonization,"" he explained. ""Shipping is not going to decarbonize on its own.""

The absence of the United States from COP30 was notable. According to the AP, the U.S. was one of just four countries not present at the conference, along with San Marino, Afghanistan, and Myanmar. This absence underscored the challenges facing global climate diplomacy, particularly when major emitters and economic powers are not at the table.

Other nations, however, remain undeterred. Prince Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, the climate envoy for the Netherlands, delivered a keynote address immediately following Dominguez’s remarks. He acknowledged the disappointment many felt after last month’s setback in London, where the regulations were supposed to be adopted. Still, he urged a pragmatic approach. ""While the delay in many ways caused a ‘sense of failure,’ it is equally important to take a cool headed, dispassionate view of what happened last month,"" he said. ""We see its merits for addressing greenhouse gases and contributing to a just and equitable transition. We also continue to work constructively with all interested parties to overcome the barriers for its adoption next year.""

For advocates of rapid change, the stakes are high. With ships built to last a quarter-century, every year of delay means more vessels locked into a carbon-heavy future. The International Chamber of Shipping, representing a vast majority of the world’s merchant fleet, has stressed the importance of acting now. The organization’s support for the regulations signals that much of the industry is ready—or at least willing—to embrace change, provided there’s a level playing field and clear rules.

Industry leaders like Andrew Forrest, founder of the Australian green technology company Fortescue, are already moving ahead. Speaking at the IMO side event, Forrest cut through the political noise. ""We’re not woke, we’re not green,"" he said. ""We’re a bunch of very pragmatic scientists and business people who are switching off fossil fuels."" Forrest’s blunt approach reflects a growing sentiment among some in the sector: that the transition away from fossil fuels is not just about environmental virtue, but about business sense and technological opportunity.

This pragmatic streak is echoed by many maritime nations and their representatives, who see the proposed regulations as both necessary for the planet and inevitable for the industry. The hope, as articulated by Prince Jaime and others, is that the extra year will be used to build broader consensus and address the concerns that led to the postponement. That includes finding ways to ensure the transition is just and equitable, particularly for developing nations and smaller shipping companies that may struggle with the costs of compliance.

Still, the path ahead is anything but certain. The political landscape remains volatile, as Dominguez acknowledged, and the shipping industry is notoriously complex, with a web of national interests, regulatory regimes, and economic pressures. Yet, the momentum for change appears to be building, even if progress is slower than many had hoped. As Dominguez put it, ""We need to learn from this experience, these circumstances.""

With the world watching and the clock ticking on climate action, the next year will be critical for the future of shipping—and, by extension, for the global effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Whether the industry can chart a course toward decarbonization will depend on the willingness of nations to bridge divides, the resolve of industry leaders to invest in cleaner technologies, and the ability of the IMO to keep the conversation—and the campaign—moving forward.

For now, the sense in Belem is one of cautious optimism. The setback may have delayed the journey, but few doubt that the destination remains the same: a shipping industry that pulls its weight in the fight against climate change.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-11-12 11:59:55.533493

Navigating to a Greener Future

Hong Kong Maritime Week (HKMW) 2025 is set to be the premier event in the international maritime calendar, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong's status as a prime global maritime capital.

HKMW is organised by the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board, with Hong Kong Maritime Museum and Invest Hong Kong as co-organisers. This landmark convention also owes much to the collaboration of industry leaders, government agencies, and professional associations nationally and overseas.

The week-long celebration will bring together stakeholders from across the world to discuss trends, innovations, and the future of the maritime industry. The event reflects Hong Kong's unique position bridging East and West, and its commitment to driving growth, sustainability, and excellence in shipping and port operations.

During a packed week from 16 to 22 November 2025, more than 50 individual conferences, seminars, forums, networking events, educational workshops, and community engagement activities will take place across Hong Kong - Asia's most dynamic city. These events reflect the intent of the organisers to create a highly diverse platform catering to the needs and interests of all members of the broad maritime-related ecosystem.

In curating the programme, emphasis has been placed on green shipping, decarbonisation, and the adoption of sustainable practices to address global environmental challenges. With the maritime industry undergoing rapid digital transformation, other key topics at this year's gathering will highlight smart shipping and the integration of digital technologies in port management.

Why Hong Kong?

Despite the temporary hiatus at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in the finalisation of its Net-Zero Framework, the shipping industry is forging ahead in its quest to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. HKMW 2025 recognises this central concern of the industry and is ideally placed to address it.

HKMW 2025, will be the first truly international maritime event of scale since the vote to adopt the IMO Net-Zero Framework was deferred in October. It will be the first time and place to gain some sense of the favoured way forward from various experts, industry leaders and government officials on hand at many of the conferences and networking occasions.

For those professionals involved in the energy and bunkering industries, there has never been a more opportune time to attend HKMW. This year's convention plays out against the background of the ongoing realisation of Hong Kong's extraordinary ambition to develop into a leading green maritime fuel bunkering and trading hub.

The pathway to green maritime fuel bunkering and trading

In November 2024, the Government of Hong Kong SAR promulgated its Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering. The first LNG bunkering exercise was completed within three months in early 2025, and there are solid plans for the first green methanol bunkering operation in the near future.

To drive through Hong Kong's transition to a green maritime fuel bunkering centre as efficiently and expeditiously as possible, the Government is offering financial incentives for encouraging pioneer companies to start green maritime fuel bunkering businesses in Hong Kong as soon as possible.

The Hong Kong Marine Department, meanwhile, provides one-stop services, with staunch support and clear guidelines offered to companies interested in setting up green maritime fuel bunkering businesses in Hong Kong.

With the growing demand for green marine fuel bunkering, and the Chinese Mainland's capacity to become a major producer of green maritime fuels, experts are predicting that the region will be a leading force for the supply of green energy for years to come. Hong Kong's commitment to developing a dependable and high quality green marine fuel bunkering centre with a regulatory framework aligned with international standards, means the city is able to build trust and encourage major corporations to invest in shipping's clean future.

Yemen's Houthi movement has indicated a halt to attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, warning they could resume operations if Israel restarts its Gaza offensive.

As per an undated letter circulating on social media, Houthi chief of staff Yusuf Hassan al-Madani warned the group could resume strikes and a shipping ban if Gaza is attacked again.

""We are closely monitoring developments and declare that if the enemy resumes its aggression against Gaza, we will return to our military operations deep within the Zionist entity, and we will reinstate the ban on Israeli navigation in the Red and Arabian Seas,"" the letter reads.

The move signals a potential pause in the Houthi offensive that has disrupted global trade routes through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since late 2023.

This has forced ships to take the longer route around Africa instead of the shorter Suez Canal route, leading to increased global bunker consumption.

Over the weekend, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) announced that a CMA CGM ship had become the largest container ship to transit the Suez Canal in two years, signalling a gradual return of traffic after Red Sea disruptions.

However, questions remain over how quickly vessels will return, and whether the Houthis can be trusted to maintain the cease in attacks.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_c5627b22e01090c2edd535ca8d1d33e9.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 21:00:46.630364

The tenth conference in this series, which had the theme “Tanker Shipping Negotiates Challenging Market Headwinds’ was dominated by market uncertainties, caused primarily by geopolitical factors.

Conference editor, Clive Woodbridge, said: “During the morning session the word ‘uncertainty’ was heard so many times I lost count! There is no doubt that external factors are having a great impact on tanker shipping right now, with new tariffs and port charges, sanctions, the trade tensions between the USA and China, conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, the IMO’s pause on net zero regulations and the fast pace of technological change all coming into the mix. Rarely if ever have tanker shipping executives had to make strategic decisions against a backdrop of such volatility and unpredictability.”

This year’s keynote speakers were HE Sheikh Khaled Al Sabah, Acting CEO of Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC) and Dr Ibrahim Al Nadhari, CEO of ASYAD Shipping & Drydocks. Sheikh Khaled noted the fast pace of change driven by geopolitics, particularly highlighting the impact of sanctions and the presence of the so called ‘dark fleet’. But positively, he stressed the continued importance of tanker shipping as the “backbone of oil supply chains.”

Geopolitics was one of a number of factors that Dr Al Nadhairi said were keeping him awake at night, along with operational disruptions, insurance premiums, regulatory compliance and market volatility. His overall message was that there is a clear need to balance operational actions today with long term strategic planning. “This is key to navigating uncertainties and sustaining profitability in a volatile market,” he added.

Other panelists in the first session of the conference, which focussed on sustainable strategies to combat uncertainties, included Abdul Bari Alzubaidi, Senior Vice President, Ship Management, ADNOC Logistics & Services; Ali Abouda, Group Financial Officer, Gulf Navigation Holdings; Nafeesa Moloobhoy, Managing Director, Moloobhoy Group of Companies; Navin Kumar, Director, Drewry Maritime Research; Bard Poulsson, Senior Vice President, Lockton; Captain Ankara Arora, Global Market Leader, Tankers, Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore; and Dipak Karki, Managing Director, DK2.

Abdul Bari stressed the need for a long-term commitment to decarbonisation but said there was a need to strike a balance with commercial day-to-day business requirements. Ali Abouda made the point that, “You can no longer separate geopolitics from shipping profit and loss forecasting,” echoed by Navin Kumar who argued that “Geopolitics is now driving tanker earnings more than market fundamentals.” He presented the audience with a ‘World Uncertainties Index’ which not surprisingly had risen sharply, almost off the scale, during 2025.

Session 2 in the afternoon, was expertly moderated by Ali Shehab, Global Director of Special Projects at DNV, who was joined on stage by Richard De Vries, Vice President, Business Development, Lloyds Register; Han Ning, General Manager, ShipBid.Net; Captain Gargan Dhillon, CEO (Dubai), West of England P&I Club; Katherine Yakunchenkova; General Manager, Al Safina Security; Captain Onur Yildrim, Marine General Manager, Advanced Polymer Coatings; Alexandra Burke, CEO, K2 Bunker Fuel Supply; Roger Harfouch, Sales Director, Marlink Communications; Captain Vikas Pandey, Founder and CEO of Shipfinex; and Ramee Rashid, Director, Seamaster Maritime Group.

Collectively these panelists discussed how best to boost operational efficiency while maintaining a focus on green shipping. Alexandra Burke argued that the bunker sector can no longer afford to separate profitability from environmental accountability and urged collaboration between stakeholders to reshape bunker trades for a sustainable market future.

Han Ning said she believed market volatility can create both risk and opportunities for tanker shipping. “Crises should be seen as being an opportunity to strengthen market position, build flexibility and capitalise on global shipping trade dynamics,” she suggested.

Gagan Dhillon stressed the need for companies to embrace insurance strategies. This he said would “help mitigate the financial impact of operational disruptions, while supporting long term planning for fleet renewal and green investments.”",,N,,2025-11-11 19:56:14.107013

Did you know that 80% of international trade and the goods we use in our everyday lives travel by sea from port to port? These goods generate 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, so reducing these emissions is critically urgent to protect our climate, oceans, economy, and human health. Of the 50 ports around the world that ship the most, 42 are located around cities, where they generate jobs and support local and national economies.

Despite their economic importance, ports pose dilemmas for the environment. Maritime air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases are serious contributors to global GHG emissions, with projection of the shipping industry is projected to grow on average at 2.1% annually for the next four years. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set robust goals to curb GHG emissions from international shipping so as to align with the Paris Agreement. The IMO aims for a reduction of 20%, by 2030 and 70% by 2040 in relation to former 2008 levels. Can a 100% reduction by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions in ports around the world really happen?

Seaport operations are categorized into two main areas.

Land logistics encompass cargo handling, storage, customs processing, and inland transportation.

Maritime logistics include vessel traffic management, berth allocation, cargo loading and unloading, and fuel and maintenance services.

The implementation of effective reduction measures in maritime operations, especially at seaports as significant contributors, is essential. As our CleanTechnica colleague, Michael Barnard, has outlined, ports are embroiled problems related to their function to anchor heavy industry that depends on steady, cheap power. But they also host ships that idle on diesel engines burning through thousands of liters of fuel while tied to the quay.

For years the solution to both problems was more fossil generation. Now smart port solutions can enhance efficiency and transparency.

What Innovations are Making Ports More Sustainable?

There are lots of options for ports around the world to decarbonize.

Adoption of alternative fuels: A range of alternative fuels, including LNG, biofuels, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia, is possible for ports. Yet liquid fuels alone cannot meet long-term climate targets or the local air-quality standards that port cities are now enforcing. Batteries are the next step, not for crossing oceans yet, but for what happens close to shore.

Renewable energy: Electric vessels exhibit far lower total cost of ownership compared to diesel-powered counterparts. The transition to river-going and near-shore electric shipping is underway in Europe, China, Brazil, and Canada. Battery electric ships (BES) are now traversing waterways across the globe.

Electrification of port operations: Significant emissions at ports arise from vessels docked at berth. Ground vehicles and equipment consume about 15% of port energy yet are responsible for up to 30% of particulate emissions. Electrification of these assets promises an immediate emissions reduction of over 90%.

Energy management systems: Port electrification, logistics, microgrids, renewable energies, energy storages, and port automation are all part of the big picture of energy management systems. Different smart port founding perspectives play a decisive role in technology approaches to building a port energy management system including optimizing algorithms for energy consumption, balancing demand and energy production, and comprehensively integrating renewable energy.

AI-driven analytics: Emily Newton writes in Global Trade how visual and analytical replica react instantly to incoming information, displaying vessel positions, cargo handling activity, and weather conditions. Such situational awareness moves from human observation or delayed reports to a comprehensive view of timely port operations. Ship tracking becomes more precise, navigational safety is sharpened, and emergency preparedness is elevated through realistic, AI-generated simulation exercises, Newton explains.

Blockchain-based emissions tracking: The Institute of Supply Chain Management defines blockchain as, essentially, a digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the data is secure, transparent, and immutable. Blockchain technology has emerged as a potential solution to address the imperative need for enhancing security, transparency, and efficiency in the maritime industry, where increasing reliance on digital systems and data prevails. Blockchain technology, with its promise of decentralized, secure, and transparent record-keeping, has found a good fit in the maritime trade sector.

Ports Across The World That Are Working To Decarbonize

World Resources International has compiled a list of several ports across the world that are making concerted efforts toward a net zero emissions future.

The Port of Barcelona is already installing shore power for both container ships and passenger ferries, drawing on 100% renewable electricity. The port is also investing in electric straddle carriers for moving containers as part of its broader efforts to halve carbon emissions by 2030 (relative to 2017).

Norway signed a memorandum of understanding to promote sustainable maritime transport, including port decarbonization. This agreement looks to initiate low-carbon supply chains to create a green maritime corridor between the two countries.

The Port of Trelleborg in Sweden is aiming for net-zero emissions by 2040 and exploring green fuel options. It is also establishing “green corridors,” which aim to create low-emission transportation routes with partner ports.

In China, the Port of Shanghai has developed a workplan to boost the transition toward alternative maritime fuels. This will increase the supply of liquefied natural gas, methanol and ammonia for vessel refueling (known as bunkering). A maritime decarbonization center is planned to help coordinate efforts in the transition toward alternative fuels.

Rotterdam, Netherlands has set out a clear goal to become the green shipping hub of Europe.

Many smaller ports including Walvis Bay in Namibia, have begun to pilot the production of green hydrogen.

Of course, the pathway to decarbonization of ports around the world takes specific steps, which the WRI outlines as:

Analysis on the economic case for action based on the current and projected future state of progress in vessel decarbonization and fuel choices;

Analysis of the benefits and challenges associated with various alternative fuel options, including electrification, biofuel strategies that minimize suboptimal land use, ammonia, methanol and hydrogen, for land-side and water-side equipment and vessels;

A roadmap for fuel development and cost/benefit analysis for the conversion of systems; and,

Guidance and detailed case studies from ports that have started the transition exploring what has worked and why.

Final Thoughts

Ports across the world have grasped the fact that dedicated climate action is necessary across the transportation sector and beyond. Ports are a site where climate action wins will benefit human and ocean health while supporting global and local economies and sustainable growth.

Due to the interconnectivity of seaports across countries and their role in facilitating trade between diverse regions and continents, policies must be formulated and endorsed on a large scale, necessitating collaboration among authorities. Port climate activists must continue to work against a backdrop of political turmoil and shifting fiscal climates.

Efforts to decarbonize ports offer a flexible and practical opportunity to mitigate climate change, act on health risks, and stimulate sustainable development.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Port-of-Barcelona.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 14:00:40.304862

As the EU’s greenhouse gas regulations, EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime, are already in force, the delay in the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) adoption of its Net-Zero Framework has heightened uncertainty over future global regulatory developments.

Amid this complex landscape, shipping companies are seeking solutions that can help them evaluate various emission-reduction options and operational strategies based on objective data, while considering both cost and regulatory risks. Developed in response to these industry needs, KR’s new platforms enable efficient and data-driven decision-making for sustainable fleet management.

PILOT allows users to design and assess customized greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction scenarios using each vessel’s technical specifications and operational data. The platform automatically calculates vessel-specific emissions and compliance costs based on actual emission data reported to the IMO and the EU, while evaluating the cost-effectiveness and reduction potential of introducing energy-saving devices (ESDs) and alternative fuels to recommend the most viable strategies. It also supports the establishment of mid- to long-term plans by simulating possible future regulatory developments.

Meanwhile, POWER visualizes ship performance and fuel efficiency by analyzing data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) along with weather and ocean condition information. This helps ship operators easily understand their vessels’ current operational status and identify areas for improvement, enabling them to formulate optimal, data-driven voyage strategies.
