At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025 reveals that new initiatives have been launched in major developing economies like China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Kenya.

For the first time since the report’s inception in 2022, four corridors have now reached the ‘realization stage’ where construction and operation begin to take place. However, many corridors remain stalled by a 'feasibility wall' created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels.

There are now over 300 stakeholders involved in green corridors, up from 240 in the previous edition. Port authorities continue to be key leaders, with public sector and governmental actors following closely behind them. The vessel owner/operator category increased by over 30% since last year, which could indicate that port and government-led initiatives are having more success finding partners in shipping. The one category with no positive movement on the stakeholder side is financial institutions. This could be due to engagement with financiers occurring outside the core green corridor consortia.

This year’s findings also reveal that some government-funded initiatives have stalled after feasibility studies have been completed, suggesting a gap between government priorities and industry interests. While companies have leveraged government funding to explore fuel options and thereby reduce their in-house research costs, this has not yielded action in many cases. In contrast, initiatives with high industry involvement have been progressing the fastest, as indicated by the four green corridors now in the realization stage.

Out of the 84 initiatives in this year’s edition, 24 are in the Initiation stage, 44 (16 early and 28 advanced) are in Exploration, 12 are in Preparation, and four are in Realization. Additionally, one-third of last year’s 59 initiatives have progressed between or within stages while the other two-thirds have maintained their progress status.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/adobe-stock-165927.jpeg,N,,2025-11-30 19:56:08.390902

Methane emissions in the LNG supply chain are important, accounting for about 4% of total (Well-to-Wake) GHG emissions.","In a seismic era for shipping and global sustainability efforts, the perception of LNG as a marine fuel has shifted dramatically in recent years. Once seen as one of many ‘alternatives’ in the future fuels bucket, LNG together with liquefied biomethane (Bio-LNG/LBM/RNG) are firmly becoming mainstream options for owners and operators looking to decarbonize.

Over the past three years, investment into the fuel has accelerated driven by a number of factors, including:

Immediate regulatory compliance: LNG, in its fossil form, is currently compliant with both local emissions and greenhouse gas emissions regulations. LNG emits virtually zero SOx, NOx and particulate matter emissions and reduces GHG emissions by up to 23%.

Pathway for industry decarbonization: The use of RNG reduces GHG emissions by an average of 80% and, depending on feedstock, offers negative emissions of up to -190%. Looking further ahead, e-methane promises a scalable solution for full maritime decarbonization.

Compelling investment case: LNG dual-fuel vessels provide the lowest cost of compliance with EU regulations, such as FuelEU Maritime and EU ETS, and the IMO’s proposed Net Zero Framework. The optionality dual-fuel vessels provide protects investment returns amid fluctuating regulations and fuel prices.

Growing availability of bunkers: The infrastructure for LNG and biomethane bunkering is available in over 200 ports worldwide and counting. The LNG bunker vessel fleet is growing rapidly and increasing volumes of the fuel are becoming available on a spot basis.

Increasing industry adoption

Data from DNV shows that the number of LNG fueled vessels has increased from 159 in 2019 to more than 1,400 in operation and on order today. Adoption is seen in all vessel sectors but led by the container sector, car carriers and crude and product tankers. The cruise sector, although relatively small in terms of numbers, has been a highly influential first mover.

The majority of orders in 2025 have been for large and ultra-large container ships which use large volumes of fuel making for a compelling investment case. Examples include recent investments announced by industry giants such as MSC, CMA CGM, Hapag Lloyd and Maersk.

Biomethane bunkering is growing…

LNG bunker volumes grew 4-fold in Singapore between 2023 and 2024; 50% in Rotterdam and 65% in Shanghai. This strong growth has continued into 2025. LNG bunkering is taking off in the US and Canada in ports such as Jacksonville, Canaveral, Miami, Houston, LA/Long Beach, Tacoma and Vancouver.

Similarly, biomethane bunkering has taken off in 2025 driven by companies’ voluntary decarbonization commitments and regulations. Biomethane operations have taken place in key ports across Europe, servicing container lines, the cruise sector, car carriers amongst others over the past 12 months. This trend is extending to the USA which has an established biomethane or RNG market with massive potential for growth.

But what about methane emissions?

Methane emissions, in particular the issue of methane slip in LNG dual-fuel engines, has long been a point of contention for LNG adoption.

High-pressure 2-stroke, diesel-cycle engines which account for approximately 75% of the LNG-fuelled vessel order book have effectively eliminated methane slip. For low-pressure, Otto-cycle engines levels of methane slip have been reduced from 2.5% in 2019 to less than 1.4% today in the 4-stroke technologies and from 1.5% to 0.8% for the 2-strokes. Post combustion abatement technologies are also being piloted.

These technological advances demonstrate that the industry is well on its way to solving the matter of the slip by the end of the decade.

Methane emissions in the LNG supply chain are important, accounting for about 4% of total (Well-to-Wake) GHG emissions. Here LNG suppliers have been making progress on a voluntary basis and in response to regulations, particularly in the US and Europe. Rystad Energy’s recently published definitive study on supply chain GHG emissions finds average Well-to-Tank emissions to be 13.9gCO2eq/MJ, well below the 18.8g default emissions factor adopted by the EU in FuelEU Maritime regulations. Further reductions are expected as supply chains evolve and the use of certification increases.

Looking towards the future

LNG is not a silver bullet. In reality, shipping needs a broad suite of viable options to be made available. Solutions which not only support full decarbonization by 2050, but which cater to changing technological advances, market and geopolitical shifts, investment levels, and of course, infrastructure.

Waiting is not an option, and LNG is a pragmatic choice. It is currently the only safe, scalable and commercially viable way for the industry to comply with today’s regulations and meet tomorrow’s compliance targets. Investing in LNG enables the industry to make immediate progress on decarbonization while also providing cleaner air. Then the LNG assets the industry is investing in can incrementally switch to liquefied biomethane and e-methane as these low and zero emission versions of the methane molecule scale.

Dominguez acknowledges the pressing challenges in the maritime sector, such as climate change and security threats, emphasizing that the industry must adapt to remain efficient, resilient, and forward-thinking.

In an interview with Robban Assafina, Dominguez outlined his vision for a progressive era at the IMO, leveraging his extensive experience as a former delegate and chair of key governing bodies to facilitate decision-making and drive concrete reforms in the organization. He highlights four strategic priorities: enhancing the organization’s work, support, image, and personnel. His focus will particularly be on providing targeted support to developing nations, especially small island and least developed countries.

Dominguez stresses the importance of technological advancement in shipping, particularly the mandate for a “Maritime Single Window” that will streamline processes at ports. This digitalization is expected to significantly improve operational efficiency. He also plans to regulate the growing presence of autonomous ships to ensure safety and environmental sustainability.

Decarbonization is another major area of focus for Dominguez, with the IMO targeting net-zero emissions by 2050. He outlines a strategic pathway for greenhouse gas reductions, encouraging Member States to adopt measures such as a global fuel standard and a pricing mechanism for emissions by 2025.

Education and training in the maritime sector are also vital components of Dominguez’s vision. He highlights the need for a sufficient supply of skilled seafarers and addressing gender imbalances within the industry. The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW) is under review to align competencies with technological advancements and climate objectives. Moreover, the IMO is actively enhancing training initiatives through collaborations and established institutions like the World Maritime University.

Dominguez discusses the challenges faced in international shipping due to geopolitical tensions, which can disrupt trade flows. He emphasizes the need for collaboration between governments, industry stakeholders, and international organizations to ensure the safety of navigation and protect seafarers amidst conflicts.

This accomplishment underlines Indonesia’s strategic role as a significant global maritime hub, reinforcing its commitment to global maritime governance as highlighted by President Prabowo Subianto’s directives.

The IMO Council consists of various categories, with Category C focusing on member countries that represent key global geographies without having large shipping fleets. Alongside Indonesia, other elected Category C members include nations like the Bahamas, Belgium, and Turkey, totaling 21 countries representing diverse maritime interests.

Minister Dudy emphasized Indonesia’s dedication to enhancing shipping safety, environmental sustainability, and the welfare of seafarers. He expressed Indonesia’s readiness to collaborate with member nations to promote a safer, greener, and more resilient future in international shipping. The focus is on maximizing shared maritime opportunities to achieve sustainability on a global scale.

Indonesia’s commitment to maritime safety entails advancing e-navigation, modernizing the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), and implementing risk management strategies. A highlight of these initiatives is the Traffic Separation Scheme established in the Sunda and Lombok Straits, which showcases how international cooperation can enhance safety in busy waterways.

Regarding environmental sustainability, Indonesia is aligning national policies with IMO objectives to achieve net-zero emissions. This includes expanding on-shore power supply facilities at ports and designating the Lombok Strait as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA).

Human resources are at the core of Indonesia’s maritime ecosystem, with a focus on strengthening seafarers’ rights, mental health, and well-being. Minister Dudy mentioned the development of a digital training framework intended to support seafarers through technological advancements.

Indonesia also reaffirms its support for a more inclusive and representative IMO Council, demonstrated through its ratification of the 2021 Amendments to the IMO Convention, which aims to enhance multilingualism within the organization.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is the global regulator for the shipping sector and a specialised agency within the United Nations (UN) who could help to guide the sector on the course for a net zero future.

That was the aim of a decade of negotiations which led to the draft regulations for the IMO’s Net-zero Framework. This framework was initially approved the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) earlier this year, but the finalisation of this agreement was delayed in a second meeting in October - facing particularly strong opposition from the US (currently under the Trump Administration) as well as Saudi Arabia.

What the new framework would bring

The measures included a new fuel standard for ships and a global pricing mechanism for emissions. Ships with weights from 5,000 tonnes and above (responsible for about 85% of global shipping emissions) would have had to limit CO2 emissions per unit of energy. Those exceeding that would have had to pay a carbon fee. This raised criticism from some member states, but there would also be a reward where those outperforming the standard would earn Surplus Units that could be banked or traded.

The Net-Zero Framework would be the first to combine mandatory emissions limits and greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing across a whole sector - through a reward and repay system.

Revenues from the charges were predicted to raise billions each year from 2028 to 2030 to fund alternative fuel infrastructure, energy efficient retrofits and buildings for developing areas. For the first time, it would have established a global carbon price, along with solid greenhouse-gas standards for shipping.

It would also require owners of large international vessels to report on their emissions and use cleaner fuels, or face penalties - these requirements might have stirred things up for some decision makers.

The plans were for the framework to start from 2027 or 2028, giving a short window of preparation time for compliance. Existing investment and plans are affected by he delay - with uncertainty in what to focus on.

An uncertain investment landscape... for now

These shaky waters may make the investment landscape more unstable for alternative fuels like ammonia, methanol and hydrogen. Such investments may slow as investors reconsider their commercial case - where there are already risks.

While some may feel some relief from the delay, others do not relate. Without regulatory transparency, planning for what to expect becomes more cumbersome. Some companies had already begun preparing, whether through fuel switches, contract changes or carbon pricing models - but without clear requirements, there is little guidance and certainty in the sector. The delay may complicate compliance for global operators, making costs uneven.

Comparisons with the 2023 Greenhouse Gas Strategy

IMO’s 2023 Greenhouse Gas Strategy already set an aim to reduce emissions from shipping by a minimum of 20 per cent by 2030. The 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships had a goal for net zero by around 2050, with ambitious 2030 and 2040 emissions reductions milestones. This came with a target for zero-emission fuels and technologies to comprise at least 5 per cent (ideally 10 per cent) of energy used by international shipping by the year 2030.

It introduced a target for zero- or near-zero-emission fuels and technologies to make up at least five percent (striving for ten percent) of the energy used by international shipping by 2030

What’s next for worldwide shipping?

The Net-Zero Framework was initially approved in April but by October plans for its adoption sunk into murky waters. Though it had long been planned, by October, the new framework was not brought to fruition. Instead of being enforced, the formation adoption was delayed.

The new framework had been highly debated as it came with various criticisms, topped off by the disruptive delay on the decision in October.

These are murky waters for the framework and the future of clean fuels in shipping. Some shipowners are betting ahead anyway though by investing in newbuilds compatible with alternative fuels like methanol or ammonia.

What does this mean for shipping? Reuters shared some speculations on what will happen now after the decision on the anticipated regulatory agreement was postponed.

The Reuters article described this as leaving the shipping sector in ‘regulatory limbo’. All the while, companies, investors and insurers are still going ahead with net-zero emissions, but with a lack of clarity on decarbonisation strategies and expectations - without the map ahead the framework would have provided.

Perhaps waters will clear in time for the next meeting which will be held next year - in October 2026.

The company is driving towards achieving net zero emissions ahead of the 2050 IMO target. A major step was the retrofitting of Rubber Tyred Gantry (RTG) cranes with hybrid technology. Six cranes were hybridised during FY 2024/25, increasing the total hybrid fleet from 22 to 28 cranes. This project has reduced fuel consumed per machine by over 50%, contributing directly to the reduction in Scope 1 emissions.

Furthermore, the installation of a 460kW solar array generates 3-5% of the current annual electricity usage. These efforts have cumulatively reduced emission intensity by 22% since 2019/20, largely driven by reducing Scope 1 emissions. Plans include leveraging digitisation, automation, and equipment electrification to decarbonise operations further. Going beyond its operational boundaries, SAGT has partnered with the Centre for Sustainability, University of Sri Jayawardenapura, to restore five acres of the Benthara River Mangrove Complex, in addition to the five acres previously restored at the Yagirala Forest Reserve.

The company also upholds its employees as its most valued asset. This commitment was demonstrated by a 42% increase in employee training hours compared to the previous year, covering health and safety, leadership, and technical skills development. SAGT also began implementing LEAN principles with guidance from the APMT Global LEAN Academy, introducing methodologies like KAIZEN and 5S to drive continuous improvement, waste management, and employee-driven process efficiencies.

SAGT’s groundbreaking initiative on gender equality, which earned the merit certificate, focused on improving gender diversity by engaging relevant regulatory agencies to overcome archaic port rules that restricted women from entering port-controlled areas after 6:00 PM. In a major industry development, SAGT secured special regulatory approval to integrate females into night shift operational roles, onboarding 12 female graduates in January 2025 and overcoming long-standing industry barriers.

This determination to make a difference is reflected in the increase of female representation in the organisation from a previously stagnated 4% to 6% during the reporting year, representing a significant milestone in promoting gender equality within Sri Lanka’s Port sector. SAGT will continue to strive to create further opportunities for women in the country’s Port sector.",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sagt.JPG,N,,2025-11-29 05:57:01.740212

Regarding maritime safety, Indonesia reiterated the importance of implementing e-navigation, modernizing the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), and a risk management approach. Indonesia has implemented a Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) in the Sunda and Lombok Straits. This serves as a concrete example of how international cooperation and scientific research can improve shipping safety in busy waterways.

Regarding decarbonization, Indonesia affirmed its strong commitment to aligning national policies with the IMO agenda. These efforts include a strategy to achieve net-zero emissions, the gradual expansion of on-shore power supply facilities at Indonesian ports, and the designation of the Lombok Strait as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA).

""As one of the largest seafaring communities in the world, Indonesia also places human resources (HR) at the center of its maritime ecosystem. Indonesia is encouraging the strengthening of seafarers' rights, mental health, and well-being, including through the development of a digital training framework that ensures technological transformation favors seafarers,"" said Transportation Minister Dudy.

Furthermore, Indonesia also reaffirmed its commitment to strengthening the IMO. Indonesia's ratification of the 2021 Amendments to the IMO Convention demonstrates its support for a more inclusive and representative Council and strengthens the principle of multilingualism within the organization.

On the sidelines of the 34th IMO session, Minister of Transportation Dudy held a number of bilateral meetings, namely with IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez; UK Minister for Aviation, Maritime Affairs and Decarbonization Keir Mather; Dutch Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management Robert Tieman; Chinese Deputy Minister of Transport Li Yang; and the Transport Ministers of ASEAN Member States.

However, it faces significant environmental challenges, particularly regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, marine pollution, and resource consumption. As climate change concerns intensify, the sector is undergoing a transformative shift towards sustainability. This article explores the latest developments in green shipping and decarbonization, focusing on International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations, the adoption of green fuels, eco-friendly practices, and real-world case studies from Singapore and beyond.

IMO Regulations: Steering the Green Transition

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been pivotal in driving the maritime industry’s sustainability agenda. Key regulations include:

IMO 2020 Sulphur Cap: Effective January 2020, ships must use fuel with a sulphur content of 0.5% or less, drastically reducing sulphur oxide emissions and improving air quality.

Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI): Mandates technical measures to enhance energy efficiency in existing vessels.

Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII): Requires ships to measure and report their carbon intensity, promoting operational improvements.

2030 and 2050 GHG Reduction Targets: IMO aims to reduce total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2050 (compared to 2008 levels).

These regulations push shipping companies to innovate and invest in cleaner technologies and fuels.

Green Fuels: The Future of Marine Energy

Transitioning from conventional heavy fuel oil to alternative fuels is crucial for decarbonization. Prominent green fuels include:

Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG): Offers lower CO₂ and sulphur emissions than traditional fuels.

Biofuels: Derived from renewable biomass, biofuels can be blended with conventional fuels to reduce carbon footprints.

Methanol & Ammonia: Emerging as zero-carbon options, especially when produced using renewable energy.

Hydrogen: Considered the ultimate clean fuel, hydrogen-powered ships are in development, though challenges remain in storage and infrastructure.

The uptake of these fuels is supported by incentives, research, and pilot projects worldwide.

Eco-Friendly Practices: Beyond Fuels

Sustainability in maritime extends beyond fuel choice. Key eco-friendly practices include:

Hull Design Optimization: Advanced hull forms and coatings reduce drag, improving fuel efficiency.

Slow Steaming: Operating ships at lower speeds significantly cuts emissions.

Onshore Power Supply (Cold Ironing): Ships plug into shore-side electricity while at port, reducing emissions from auxiliary engines.

Digitalization and Automation: Real-time monitoring and AI-driven route optimization help minimize fuel consumption and emissions.

Case Studies: Singapore and Global Leaders

Singapore: Asia’s Green Maritime Hub

Singapore, one of the world’s busiest ports, is a frontrunner in maritime sustainability:

Green Port Initiatives: The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) offers incentives for LNG-powered vessels and ships using clean shore power.

Decarbonization Roadmap: Singapore aims to be a global hub for green shipping fuels, including biofuels and hydrogen.

Eco-Port Certification: The port has implemented strict waste management, water conservation, and emission reduction measures.

Global Examples

Maersk (Denmark): The world’s largest container shipping company is investing in methanol-powered vessels and targets net-zero emissions by 2040.

NYK Line (Japan): Piloting ammonia-fueled ships and implementing digital solutions for energy efficiency.

Port of Rotterdam (Netherlands): Europe’s largest port is pioneering shore power, hydrogen bunkering, and circular economy initiatives.

Expert Guidance for Stakeholders

The Capesize market delivered a robust and increasingly confident performance this week, with the BCI 5TC climbing steadily from the low $30,000s to close the week in the $37,000s. The Pacific set the tone early, where consistent miner participation and a busy slate of operator cargoes tightened the tonnage list and pushed C5 progressively higher, with fixtures advancing from the mid-$10s to the high-$11s to $12.00 by the week’s end. Despite occasional dips in the index, underlying demand in the basin remained firm, and sentiment strengthened as supply grew noticeably thinner.

In the Atlantic, early hesitancy gave way to a more constructive tone as fundamentals improved. South Brazil to China saw patchier enquiry and date-sensitive bids, with rates holding mostly in the mid-$23s to mid-$24s before lifting to $25 at the close. This was complemented by an increasingly active North Atlantic, where improving fundamentals and stronger fronthaul fixtures added meaningful support. The sharp rise in C8 and C9 underscored the tightening of nearby positions and a marked improvement in sentiment across the northern basin.

Panamax

The market held a steady tone through the week, supported by firm fundamentals in the US Gulf and US East Coast, while fronthaul grains continued to underpin Atlantic sentiment. The BPI timecharter average opened at $17,498 on Monday and edged up $157 to $17,655 by Thursday. In Asia, tight prompt tonnage supply and active Indonesian demand kept the Pacific well-supported, although by mid-week owners’ offers were being met rather than pushed higher.

By Thursday, sentiment had turned more mixed, with some sensing the market was becoming toppy in the Atlantic and that prompt fronthaul routes may be nearing a ceiling especially when coupled with national holidays in motion. A two-tier structure also emerged in Asia, with modern tonnage commanding premiums in Indonesia–Japan trades, while short Indonesian round voyages drew softer bids. Period activity was noted, although many fixtures remained short on detail.

Ultramax/Supramax

A staggered week with the Atlantic seeing a dip in activity with the Thanksgiving period at the end. The US Gulf saw a slight weakening in rates as the week progressed whilst the South Atlantic remained relatively balanced. A 66,000 dwt fixing delivery Recalada trip to the Arabian Gulf/SE Asia at $17,400 plus $740,000 ballast bonus. The Continent-Mediterranean lacked fresh impetus and confidence feel, although a 64,000 dwt was heard fixed delivery Continent trip via lower Baltic redelivery Brazil at $22,000.

The Asian basin remained relatively active, with brokers saying a reasonable amount of enquiry was seen from the South whilst North Asia remained relatively flat. A 61,000 dwt fixing delivery Singapore trip via Indonesia redelivery India at $21,000. Further north, a 56,000 dwt fixed delivery Dalian trip with steels redelivery SE Asia at $14,000. The Indian Ocean gained momentum, with a 63,000-dwt fixing delivery Mina Saqr for a trip redelivery WC India at $24,500.

Handysize

The market remained broadly steady this week, with slight gains in some regions and subdued conditions in others. In the Continent and Mediterranean, enquiry remained limited and sentiment softened midweek as prompt tonnage increased, although rates ultimately held firm. Among the reported fixtures, a 35,000-dwt was fixed for delivery Antwerp via North France to Abidjan with grain at $12,000, reflecting the generally steady trading environment in the region.

The South Atlantic and US Gulf were firmer ahead of the Thanksgiving period, supported by healthier demand. Notable fixtures included a 38,000-dwt fixed for a trip from Recalada to West Coast South America at $26,000. In Asia, the market remained quiet throughout the week.

The report, At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025, identifies 25 new zero-emission corridor initiatives launched in 2025, bringing the global total to 84.

New initiatives in China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana and Kenya reflect expectations of significant economic opportunities in zero-emission marine fuels and bunkering infrastructure.

The publication follows last month’s postponement of the IMO’s landmark framework intended to guide the sector toward net-zero emissions by 2050. Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said the entrance of large economies into green corridor development is “hugely promising” and framed the initiatives as “strategic economic infrastructure.”

For the first time since 2022, four corridors have reached the “realisation stage,” where construction or operation of vessels, infrastructure or fuel plants begins. However, many of the 84 initiatives are stalled by a “feasibility wall” driven by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels—an issue the delayed framework could help address.

The report warns against a “wait and see” attitude during the coming year and encourages use of emerging national programmes such as the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, H2Global and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart.

According to Fahnestock, the next 12 months can be used to build projects that create strategic advantages and position participants for future IMO incentives.

Recommendations include sustaining momentum to close the cost gap, helping shape future IMO policy, engaging cargo owners with ambitious decarbonisation goals, adapting national policies for new regions and prioritising harder-to-deploy e-fuels while maintaining collaborative principles.

The Getting to Zero Coalition is an international industry-led partnership organized to promote the development and deployment of zero-emission maritime technologies. It brings together companies and organizations from across the maritime value chain and collaborates with governments and NGOs to support long-term decarbonisation strategies.

The employment of Filipino seafarers, researchers emphasized, sustains not just the maritime sector but the broader Philippine economy.
In addition, the study revealed that the industry’s economic impact depends heavily on maintaining global confidence in the Philippine seafaring workforce.
The study emphasized that these experiences reflect how the nation’s maritime workforce profoundly shapes the Philippines’ economic and social landscape.
As the study shows, Filipino seafarers are not just navigating the seas, they are steering the Philippine economy toward growth.","The study, titled “The Overseas Seafarers’ Industry Profile, Structure, and Impact on the Philippine Economy,” found that Filipino seafarers contribute about 4% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), supporting nearly 400,000 jobs nationwide and providing ₱150.1 billion in household income.

At the heart of this economic wave are foreign shipowners who continue to rely on Filipino seafarers. The employment of Filipino seafarers, researchers emphasized, sustains not just the maritime sector but the broader Philippine economy.

For every peso a Filipino seafarer sends home, nearly three pesos ripple through the economy

… explained Dr. Winston Padojinog, UA&P Professor of Strategic Management and Industrial Economics and President of the Center for Research and Communication.

In 2024 alone, ₱331.7 billion in direct remittances from seafarers flowed into local communities, driving consumption, business growth, and tax revenues.

These remittances go through different sectors. There are industry multipliers; for every peso that they spend, it generates more than a peso after it goes through the different industries

… Padojinog explained.

But beyond remittances, seafaring also creates an extensive domestic ecosystem. The study points out that the industry supports a wide range of onshore jobs — from crewing and logistics to training, insurance, and maritime services — all interconnected with the confidence of shipowners in Filipino manpower.

In addition, the study revealed that the industry’s economic impact depends heavily on maintaining global confidence in the Philippine seafaring workforce. Should shipowners lose confidence, whether due to policy instability, skills gaps, or global competition, the consequences could be swift and severe.

“In global shipping, when confidence breaks, ships leave,” the study cautioned.

Losing that confidence, researchers noted, would endanger ₱1.06 trillion in economic activity, an estimated 4% of the nation’s GDP, a blow that would ripple across the national economy.

An industry that anchors families and futures

Behind these numbers are real human stories such as parents building homes, children completing their education, and communities strengthened by the resilience of maritime families. The study emphasized that these experiences reflect how the nation’s maritime workforce profoundly shapes the Philippines’ economic and social landscape.

It further underscored that protecting the maritime industry is not only about safeguarding jobs but also about securing the well-being of Filipino families and the country’s economic prosperity.

Additionally, the study highlighted the importance of reintegrating retiring seafarers and professionals whose years of technical experience and leadership can significantly enrich and strengthen the local maritime sector.

The Council is the Executive Organ of IMO and is responsible, under the Assembly, for supervising the work of the Organisation with the elections for two-year terms.

The elections came at the start of the 34th session of the Assembly, which runs through December 3, and which will have an influential role as the IMO faces key issues. At the top of the IMO’s agenda is the one-year delay in its framework for decarbonization, with the goal to build greater consensus after it failed to adopt the measure last month.

Opening the assembly earlier in the week, IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez told the representatives of the Member States, ""We meet today at a time when the maritime sector continues to navigate a complex international environment marked by geopolitical tensions, evolving trade patterns, and an accelerating global transition towards decarbonization and digitalization. The successes still ahead of us will depend on your decisions and your collective action in bringing together this diverse community.”

This week saw lobbying and jockeying for position, including Russia’s attempts to regain its position at the IMO, lost after the invasion of Ukraine. China also highlighted its intent to deepen exchanges, coordination, and cooperation with the IMO Secretariat and other Member States. China also marked the establishment of a permanent mission to the International Maritime Organization (IMO). During an opening celebration, Li Yang, vice minister of transport and head of the Chinese delegation to the 34th session of the IMO Assembly, highlighted that China will work to build a modern maritime transport system and contribute more to global economic growth and stable industrial and supply chains.

Voting concluded on Friday, November 28, for the new two-year terms.

Council Category A members were selected and approved based on having the largest interests in shipping services. The countries elected were China, Greece, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Norway, Panama, South Korea, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Council Category B members were selected and approved on the basis of having the largest interest in international seaborne trade. The countries elected were Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates.

Council Category C members were elected in effectively a competitive open category, with delegates voting secretly, but asked to choose candidate countries either having special maritime interests or whose election would balance geographic representation across the Council. This election was held last, somewhat delayed, in order for voting to take into account of the earlier Category A and B selections.

There were three changes in the Category C Council membership compared to the 2024-25 biennial term. Bangladesh, Denmark, and Kenya lost their seats, and in their place, Belgium, Nigeria, and South Africa were elected. The countries that retained their seats were Bahamas, Chile, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, Indonesia, Jamaica, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Turkey.

IMO, EU Launch Project to Combat Sea Violence

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the European Union (EU) have signed an agreement to launch Safe Horizons, an ambitious project aimed at promoting zero tolerance for violence and harassment within the maritime sector.

The Safe Horizons initiative is designed as a seed project to establish foundational measures that will help maritime sector prevent and address any form of violence and harassment at sea. This includes, but is not limited to, bullying, sexual harassment, and sexual assault. The project is fully aligned with IMO's commitment to safe and secure working environments and complementary to ILO's labour standards.

Project Objectives

The project supports capacity-building and experience sharing, with no compliance or assessment components and is structured to develop and implement scalable actions across the industry to ensure safer, more inclusive working environments. Key objectives include:

Promoting a Zero-Tolerance Culture: Fostering a shift in industry mindset toward comprehensive rejection of violence and harassment.

Establishing Stronger Regulatory Frameworks: Supporting target countries in voluntary national efforts to strengthen policies, where requested by Member States, and consistent with national frameworks and policies related to on-board conduct.

Improving Training and Awareness: Enhancing educational resources for seafarers and maritime stakeholders to better identify, prevent, and respond to incidents.

The project leverages updated IMO training materials and involves direct collaboration with target countries to build capacity, share best practices, and advance safe working environments across the global maritime sector.

Scope and Funding

The global project is implemented by IMO with financial support from the EU. The EU has committed 2 million Euros to support the project.

Ammonia emerges as a promising candidate for future fuel, although its production, transportation, and usage pose challenges. This landscape is evolving rapidly, particularly within the maritime sector, where ammonia is gaining traction.

Ammonia consists of hydrogen and nitrogen, which positions it as a potential zero-carbon fuel. However, the predominant form of ammonia produced today is “grey” ammonia, created through an energy-intensive process reliant on fossil fuels. This traditional production method significantly contributes to carbon emissions, undermining the zero-carbon potential of ammonia.

To mitigate these emissions, the industry is increasingly turning to two lower-carbon production methods. The first is “blue” ammonia, produced by integrating carbon-capture technology into the traditional methods. This approach reduces carbon emissions but still hinges on fossil fuel sources. The second method, known as “green” ammonia, utilizes renewable energy and electrolysis, resulting in minimal to zero carbon emissions. Both blue and green ammonia are classified as low-carbon or decarbonised ammonia.

Although ammonia is being recognized as a viable fuel in the maritime industry, its primary use continues to be in industrial applications, particularly as a fertilizer. It is also finding applications in the production of plastics and synthetic fibers. In the mid to long term, low-carbon ammonia is expected to play a crucial role in power generation.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cropped-maritime-fairtrade-favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-28 10:56:41.302089

: A global system is the most credible and practical, we are after all a global industry.","In an exclusive interview, Thomas A. Kazakos, Secretary General of ICS, outlines his priorities for advancing maritime decarbonisation and highlights how ICS’s collaborative initiatives – the Clean Energy Marine Hubs (CEM-HUBS) initiative and the Maritime Just Transition Task Force – are making significant progress to ensure that no one is left behind in this transition. A key focus, he emphasizes, is ensuring that seafarers are properly upskilled to work with new green technologies and zero-emission fuels.

He also stresses the importance of addressing wellbeing, diversity, and inclusivity – not only to retain existing seafarers but also to encourage more people to pursue a career at sea. This, he notes, is essential for moving forward and building a workforce that welcomes everyone. After all, a diverse workforce brings many advantages, Kazakos concludes.

SAFETY4SEA: What do you see as the biggest leadership challenge for ICS in this decade of transformation, and how do you plan to address it?

Thomas Kazakos: I believe the biggest challenges for the industry as a whole are two-fold. Firstly, a greatly significant concern is the current erosion of the international regulatory system. The benefits of open trade and global regulations are clear, but despite this we are witnessing a steady disintegration of the multilateral spirit that has long fortified global commerce. Secondly, decarbonising the industry and meeting the IMO goal of net zero GHG emissions from international shipping by or close to 2050. It is not impossible, and ICS and the industry fully support this ambition and stand ready to do what is necessary, but the industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector. Currently there are little to none ZNZ fuels available and what is available is very expensive. At ICS we will continue to work with the International Maritime Organization, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry. Without a global mechanism, we face a patchwork of unilateral greenhouse gas charges imposed around the world.

S4S: Can you explain the Clean Energy Marine Hubs (CEM-HUBS) initiative and why it is important for global shipping decarbonisation?

Th.K.: ICS, in collaboration with the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), is also making great strides with our Clean Energy Marine Hubs (CEM-HUBS) initiative. The aim of the CEM-HUBS initiative is to accelerate the deployment of infrastructure, and to de-risk the investment needed to ensure that the whole world can have access to low-carbon fuels close to the ports for the maritime sector to transport and use. The CEM HUBS continues to build momentum with nine governments onboard – UAE, Norway, Canada, Panama, Uruguay, Brazil, Greece and most recently Malta and China. What makes this initiative unique is that the CEM Hubs looks beyond what shipping needs but ensures that shipping is not forgotten. Shipping uses only 4% of liquid fuels. We need to focus on the transportation of all fuels, the 4% for shipping and importantly the 96% of fuel that will be used by all other sectors. If we get the 96% right the 4% will have the infrastructure to support shipping’s decarbonisation. If we ignore this, we are going to make life more difficult for shipping and all sectors.

S4S: With the IMO’s delay of the Net-Zero Framework decision, how do you see ICS helping to shape a stronger and more inclusive outcome over the next year?

Th.K.: We have time, and it is important for us to use the time wisely. With the support of ICS, IMO Member States now have an opportunity to revisit the draft IMO agreement so that we can get it right and ensure, so far as possible, that it’s acceptable to everyone. What we do not want is a fragmented regulatory environment with unilateral and regional regulations and GHG charges being imposed. We need a global mechanism for what is fundamentally a global industry. ICS will continue to work with IMO, with Member States and the industry as a whole to find the best way forward to meet the IMO net zero GHG emissions target by or close to 2050. But whatever may eventually be decided at IMO, the transition to the use of new green fuels and technologies will continue and ICS will be supporting shipowners on this transition.

S4S: Many shipowners are uncertain about future fuels, regulation timelines, and financing mechanisms. How can ICS help provide clarity and stability during this transitional period?

Th.K.: Uncertainty fuels delays and caution, it stifles investment decisions, and this is to be expected. This is why ICS has been advocating for a global measure to ensure a level playing field and to avoid market distortion. What is important is that governments need to set standards for new fuels, this will give energy producers the certainty they require to invest. Shipowners and fuel suppliers need clarity to make long-term investments. Shipping is already investing billions in new ships and green technologies to be ready for the new fuels when they arrive. For now, shipowners can focus on technologies that maximises energy efficiency, reducing their emissions through energy efficiency measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving operational costs. This will be crucial to decarbonisation and reducing running costs to ensure future profitability. Shipowners are already doing this by introducing measures that address underwater radiated noise or hull friction for example. What ICS is doing is continuing to push for practical solutions that balance ambition with feasibility, as well as working with governments and industry to provide stability to the maritime sector.

S4S: In your view, what does a credible and practical system for decarbonisation look like- one that works for both developed and developing maritime nations?

Th.K.: A global system is the most credible and practical, we are after all a global industry. Importantly, whatever system is adopted it must provide support for maritime decarbonisation efforts across the globe, for example the green fuel generation and bunkering infrastructure of developing countries, as well as training in new green fuels for our workforce. We need a system that works, as much as possible, for everyone.

S4S: How should ICS support equitable access to green technologies and zero-emission fuels across the global fleet?

Th.K.: We already are supporting through different initiatives such as the Clean Energy Marine Hubs and our technical input to various proposals to the International Maritime Organization. What we must remember, and keep at the forefront, is to make sure our seafarers are upskilled in these green technologies and zero-emission fuels. They, after all, will be the ones dealing with them. The Maritime Just Transition Task Force – a collaboration between the ICS, ITF, IMO, and other leading global organisations established in 2021 – was therefore a crucial step in ensuring that no one is left behind in this transition. But we need more than global initiatives; we need direct action from companies, training institutions, and governments. This means strengthening maritime education and ensuring it remains fit for purpose.

S4S: As global maritime governance becomes more complex – and with concerns over the “dark fleet”- how can ICS strengthen transparency and accountability in the sector?

Th.K.: The move towards a fragmented trading world risks undermining the global framework that has served international trade so well for decades. Fragmentation of markets and the rules-based order will inevitably reduce efficiency and increase costs, ultimately hurting both the industry and consumers worldwide. The rise of the “dark” or “parallel” fleet is symptomatic of this fragmentation. If left unchecked, it could undermine safety, environmental standards, and the credibility of the international regulatory system. ICS is committed to working with governments and international organisations to ensure that shipping remains a rules-based, transparent, and safe sector. We continue to encourage our members to diligently comply with instruments such as the International Safety Management Code, SOLAS and MARPOL and the Industry Best Practice. These systems and instruments rely on an industry that follows protocol, which is why we are so clear in our communication that we must operate within the regulations.

S4S: How will you ensure that ICS remains the trusted voice of responsible shipowners when it comes to compliance, safety, and environmental integrity?

Th.K.: With over 74,000 ships operating worldwide, international shipping is built on legal and robust operations, supported by strong regulatory oversight and insurance systems that ensure high standards are consistently met. It is vital that shipowners, operators, and managers adhere to any and all regulations. Shipping operates within a well-established legal framework, and these regulations are essential to maintaining a high-quality, responsible industry that enables global trade to function smoothly. As the collective voice of the international shipping industry, ICS continues to articulate and advocate shipowner positions to international regulators International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization as well as to other government regulators and relevant stakeholders. Our aim is to positively influence regulatory changes while maintaining high standards of quality, safety and environmental protection.

S4S: What do you believe the next generation of seafarers needs most from both regulators and employers to view shipping as a rewarding and sustainable career?

Th.K.:

We need to take a human centred approach which means employers, unions and governments all need to cooperate to create a career path that works for our people.

In recent years there has been a damaging shift towards seafarers being viewed as commodities. We need to change this attitude to one that puts people first and creates an environment in which they want to work. This will in turn attract the attention of more people to consider a career in shipping as well as lead to higher levels of employee retention. After all, shipping is not the only industry facing a workforce shortage; we are competing against multiple sectors all trying to recruit the best and brightest candidates. Therefore, it is necessary to make us stand out amongst the crowd. We need governments to actively support the recruitment and training of seafarers. Ensuring that decent working and living conditions for seafarers are implemented, we have the opportunity to create career that offers opportunities for growth, accommodating for changes in life circumstances and taking up roles onshore. These measures will help to make seafaring the most appealing career option. I am pleased to say that ICS works closely with ILO, ITF, and other regulatory and representative bodies to create better regulations. Additionally, in 2023, we brought the industry together at our Shaping the Future of Shipping – Seafarer 2050 summit in Manila that looked at the training and education the future seafarer will need, recruitment and retention of seafarers, seafarer welfare, opportunities for national economic development. Key outcomes from the summit were collaboration and investment are key to tackling the challenges of seafarer training and seafarer recruitment and retention; and also, that we need data that shows the value of seafarers to national economies over other trades.

S4S: How do you see ICS advancing wellbeing, diversity, and inclusivity within the maritime workforce?

Th.K.: Addressing wellbeing, diversity and inclusivity is a key part of not only retaining seafarers but also encouraging more people to consider a career in seafaring.

We can and should be doing more to show that this is a career for all, that we open our arms to everyone regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. This is the only way we can move forwards and access the benefits of a workforce that welcomes everyone. After all a diverse workforce brings many benefits.

It enables shipping companies to access a talent pool wider than any restricting definition, reflect societies and demographics more accurately and have a broader range of talents and experiences. ICS has been very involved in advancing diversity and inclusivity and launched in 2023 the Diversity and Inclusion Toolkit for Shipping. This toolkit has been developed to create awareness and inspire change in the strategies, policies and practices that will enable the maritime industry to meet the needs of the diverse seafarer community. Looking more specifically at the wellbeing of seafarers, earlier this year in April, governments, shipowners, and unions met in Geneva at the International Labour Organization’s Special Tripartite Committee on the Maritime Labour Convention, to review and adopt crucial updates that reflect the evolving needs of seafarers and the maritime industry. Key amendments to the MLC aim to improve the conditions for seafarers on board ships and the MLC updates are set to enter into effect in 2027. I am pleased to say that some of the key outcomes agreed were new provisions for seafarers to be designated as key workers; strengthened requirements for seafarer repatriation; ensuring visa free shore leave; and enhanced protections against bullying and harassment. These are groundbreaking and show the importance of seafarer welfare.

S4S: On a personal note, what inspired you to dedicate your career to maritime policy – and what continues to drive your passion for this industry today?

Th.K.: I was born and raised on an island nation and one that has a strong history in maritime so I was drawn to this career from a very young age. I found maritime policy and law of particular interest which is what attracted me to my Bachelor’s degree in law and a Master‘s degree in European and International Trade Law. I guess when you grow up looking at the sea it calls to you in some way, so this was my inspiration. What drives my passion now for the industry is the same as it has always been – without shipping there is no global trade, the world would stop, and the significance of that should never be taken for granted.

1. South Africa’s Historic Win Over India

In a significant upset, South Africa defeated India by 408 runs in a Test match in Guwahati, marking India’s largest-ever home loss in terms of runs. This loss resulted in South Africa winning the series 2-0, their first series victory in India since 2000. India’s performance has markedly declined, with five losses in the last seven home Tests, contrasting sharply with their historical record of only five losses in the previous 50 home Tests over 13 seasons. Head coach Gautam Gambhir faces scrutiny, currently holding a dismal win record of 36.82%. The defeat complicates India’s aspirations for the World Test Championship, dropping them to fifth place on the points table.

More particularly, the discussions of the event addressed how industry and regulators can speed up credible measurement and abatement solutions across global fleets, examining also developments accross the full emissions chain. Delegates discussed the rapid advances in methane measurement and abatement and the need for stronger alignment between innovation and regulation, as well as the right mix between action and accuracy.

With methane recognised as 28 times more potent than CO2 on a 100-year scale and the second most significant GHG emission, participants underscored that methane abatement represents one of the fastest, most impactful climate solutions available to shipping today.

Led by Safetytech Accelerator, established by Lloyd’s Register, MAMII is a coalition of shipping leaders, which aims to reduce the environmental impact of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in shipping while assisting the transition to future fuel solutions.

Upstream transparency is improving through enhanced monitoring tools, enabling more informed LNG sourcing. However, tank-to-wake emissions, where combustion slip remains the dominant contributor, remain the largest challenge. Several engine types have seen 60–70% reductions in methane slip in recent years, supported by the emergence of aftertreatment systems that could scale reductions up to an additional 80–90%.

Furthermore, technology providers demonstrated solutions ranging from catalyst-based aftertreatment and advanced sensor systems to AI-driven emissions analysis and handheld methane leak detection devices for pipelines.

Shell’s Technology Manager, Stephen Brown, confirmed that the company’s in-house methane abatement catalyst system will enter shipboard trials in December. This marks the third MAMII-member aftertreatment technology trial. Early results from all member trials have been positive, and commercial readiness is expected as soon as 2027.

Industry representatives called for clearer, predictable and science-based frameworks that provide certainty for investment. They highlighted the importance of updated default values reflecting technological progress, reliable measurement methodologies, and incentives for early adopters alongside support for retrofitting. Alignment between EU and IMO regulations was seen as essential for global consistency and operational clarity.

The real question is not whether the transformation will occur, but how quickly African ports can prepare and how effectively they can mobilise the support required.","The global maritime industry is steadily moving towards lower emissions, driven by new regulations, evolving fuel technologies and growing pressure from international trade partners.

For many African countries, the pace of this transition is difficult to match, yet the consequences of not adapting may be far greater.

Avoiding or even ignoring the global shift to reshape shipping, is simply not an option, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has stressed.

The IMO’s 2023 greenhouse gas strategy sets a clear target that the shipping industry should reach net-zero emissions around 2050, and signs of this shift are already visible.

These include green methanol-fuelled vessels entering service and major ports in Europe and Asia preparing for ammonia and other alternative fuels. Equipment such as electric cranes, digital yard systems, and shore-power connections is becoming mainstream in developed maritime hubs.

And yet, Africa’s starting point is markedly different.

Many ports still rely on diesel-powered machinery, lack green bunkering infrastructure and operate older vessels on regional routes. This creates a widening gap between global progress and local readiness. Nonetheless, the shift is unavoidable, particularly as compliance with green standards becomes increasingly linked to market access.

Although Africa contributes relatively little to global maritime emissions, it is highly exposed to climate impacts. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events affect coastal infrastructure, ports, and trade corridors.

At the same time, international regulations and market mechanisms, such as Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), are raising the importance of low-carbon transport for exporters.

CBAM will require exporters to account for emissions related to production and transport, which could increase costs for African goods entering Europe if supply chains fail to align with greener standards. Avoiding such penalties will depend partly on cleaner port operations, better monitoring systems, and more efficient logistics.

Financing the transition remains the central challenge. Shifting to low-carbon maritime operations requires long-term investment in infrastructure, energy systems and technology. For developing economies, the scale of financing required is substantial. Gareth Phillips, manager for Climate and Environmental Finance at the African Development Bank (AfDB), has indicated that the bank has become a key player in supporting this transition.

A practical example is found at the Port of Cotonou, where AfDB financed climate-resilience measures to counter rising sea levels, enabling Benin to unlock $18 million in concessional co-financing from the Canadian AfDB Climate Facility. He explained that securing this level of climate-aligned finance would have been difficult without such structured support.

Phillips has also noted that green port projects attract stronger international backing when they offer additional benefits such as community resilience, improved safety, or gender-inclusive development. This approach strengthens funding proposals for African ports but requires careful planning and technical preparation.

Regulation plays a central role in the maritime transition. The IMO’s GHG strategy, reporting obligations, emissions monitoring, and fuel standards, will directly influence port operations and vessel access in the coming years.

James Ng’ang’a, Ports and Maritime Transport expert at AfDB, has stated that the bank is working closely with African governments to align national maritime policy frameworks with these international rules.

In Seychelles, the bank is supporting the Seychelles Ports Authority in preparing the Strategic Investment Plan 2025-2030, ensuring that climate resilience and environmental sustainability are embedded into future port development.

In Namibia, Ng’ang’a has explained that AfDB and the Government of South Korea are assisting in the development of a Green Port Policy, Strategy, and Investment Plan. Implementation is expected to begin in 2026, establishing a structured pathway towards sustainable port operations.

These policy frameworks are designed to keep African ports aligned with global shipping standards, maintain competitiveness, and reduce long-term operating risks.

Africa’s ports will not complete this transition alone. Collaboration with development banks, port authorities, and global shipping companies is essential. AfDB emphasises the importance of coordinated efforts to reduce knowledge gaps, share best practices, and implement practical solutions.

Ng’ang’a has highlighted the example of AfDB’s technical assistance to Transnet in South Africa, which focuses on designing energy-efficiency measures and exploring renewable-energy options for port operations. Such partnerships help African ports enhance performance while preparing for low-carbon requirements expected from international carriers.

The cost of delaying decarbonisation extends beyond environmental impacts. Trade competitiveness is also at risk. If African ports fall behind global standards, shipping lines may shift towards more efficient or greener routes. Exporters may face higher penalties under mechanisms such as CBAM.

Cargo delays, disruptions, and insurance costs could rise if ports are not equipped to manage climate impacts or meet compliance requirements. Phillips has remarked that by adopting cleaner technologies, improving emissions reporting, and integrating climate considerations into port investments, African exporters can avoid unnecessary costs and strengthen their access to international markets.

AfDB is exploring new financing solutions to support long-term maritime sustainability. While the bank does not yet operate a dedicated maritime decarbonisation fund, its activities align with broader development priorities such as resilient infrastructure and capital mobilisation under the President’s ‘Four Cardinal Points’.

Phillips has referred to emerging tools such as the Adaptation Benefits Mechanism, which aims to channel solidarity levies from high-emitting industries into climate-resilience projects. Such tools could support ports in developing infrastructure capable of withstanding rising sea levels, extreme weather, and other climate-related risks.

Across the continent, interest in blue economy strategies is growing. These programmes integrate maritime transport, coastal tourism, fisheries, and renewable marine energy into national development plans. Over time, they could support a broader transition towards greener and more sustainable ocean-based economies.

The global shift towards low-carbon shipping is accelerating. For Africa, the transition is challenging but necessary. Although the continent has not been a major driver of maritime emissions, its ports and exporters must adapt to remain competitive as sustainability standards increasingly influence trade decisions.

Decarbonisation is no longer optional; it is now directly linked to market access, cost efficiency, and long-term resilience.

“We maintain statistics, and when patterns emerge, my first step is to start having the conversations” with flag states, said Dominguez.","The head of the United Nations’ maritime agency warned of a disturbing rise in the criminalisation of seafarers, driven by geopolitical tensions and a surge in substandard shipping practices linked to the so-called dark fleet operating outside international norms.

Conflicts across the world that disrupt trade, growing operational costs and regulatory weaknesses have left thousands of seafarers in a 1.8 million person-strong workforce vulnerable.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is “very concerned” about worsening conditions for workers, its secretary-general, Arsenio Dominguez, told Context.

Governments must do more to ensure fair treatment and due process for seafarers caught in the growing web of unregulated shipping practices, he said.

“We’re seeing an increase in the abandonment and criminalisation of seafarers,” Dominguez said, pointing to the expansion of shadow fleets, made up of vessels that obscure their ownership and movements to bypass sanctions and oversight, often operating beyond the law.

The dark fleet routinely transports illicit cargo and sanctioned products, such as Iranian and Russian petroleum, flouts regulatory rules and employs unfair working practices, such as forced labour, according to industry experts.

“

We need to pace ourselves to maintain the quality of regulations and ensure they’re actually enforced. And if we’re really serious about attracting the new generations to seafaring, we need to start by actually treating better and keeping the seafarers right now.

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general, International Maritime Organization

Shipping analysts track between 1,300 and 1,400 vessels operating in the global shadow fleet, and about half are crude oil tankers.

“These ships are putting seafarers at risk. Substandard shipping and ships that do not comply with the IMO regulations should not be operating,” Dominguez said.

He confirmed that the IMO is now intervening in cases of seafarer abandonment, using the organisation’s diplomatic leverage to pressure governments and flag states to uphold international standards.

“Whenever there’s a case, I reach out to the member states and the flag states, and I work closely with organisations like the ITF to gather information and follow up,” he said, referring to the International Transport Workers’ Federation, which defends seafarers’ rights.

The IMO has recently adopted new guidelines on the treatment of seafarers facing criminal charges for working on board vessels found to be carrying illicit goods, despite having no control over cargo or routes. It is also reviewing its regulations to address seafarer fatigue, violence and harassment at sea.

Yet the IMO’s hands are tied when it comes to enforcement.

“It is not an intention of the IMO to engage or try to trespass into the judicial process of the countries. But I do ask for every single country to treat seafarers rightly, to provide them with due process,” said Dominguez.

Rights crisis

Ship abandonments, in which seafarers are left unpaid, often without food or repatriation, after the owner walks away from a vessel, more than doubled in 2024, according to the ITF.

The consequences can be dire. Crews may be left stranded for months, detained without charge or denied medical care.

Many of these vessels are linked to the sanctioned oil trade. The IMO does not enforce sanctions, but instead seeks basic standards for safety, environmental protection and seafarer welfare.

Owners sometimes register their ships under flags of convenience in countries with lax regulations and tax loopholes, and Dominguez acknowledged that boats flying certain flags routinely appear in databases on abandonment and violations.

Last year, 90 per cent of abandoned seafarers were working on vessels sailing under flags of convenience, the ITF said.

“We maintain statistics, and when patterns emerge, my first step is to start having the conversations” with flag states, said Dominguez.

This softer approach, Dominguez argued, is more sustainable. “Our job is to help build their capacity while ensuring they uphold their obligations.”

Dominguez is working to sign more countries onto the International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention, which sets minimum standards for seafarers. Several Middle Eastern countries and the United States have yet to ratify the agreement.

The proliferation of small ship-management companies has further complicated the picture. But expanding regulations should avoid creating rules that stifle the industry and cannot be realistically implemented, Dominguez said.

The maritime industry has a fuel problem. Despite a clear change in rhetoric in recent years regarding the need for shipping to decarbonise, 100% of the industry continues to rely, in some form, on fossil-fuel powered ships, whilst coal, oil and gas represent at least 40% of all products transported by global shipping. At the same time, the development of zero-carbon alternative fuel technology continues to be hampered by a myriad of challenges.

Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that despite a renewed focus on decarbonisation, the industry is in fact regressing in terms of its absolute output, with carbon emissions reported to have returned to 2008 levels. The current outlook is bleak, and shipowners’ “wait-and-see” attitude is likely to cost more in the long run, as regulations tighten and current assets fall into obsolescence.

Following the outcome of the recent MEPC meeting in October, the maritime industry must continue to contend with regulatory uncertainty amidst market volatility. Although a prevailing lack of clarity may continue to dominate policy, it certainly doesn’t have to dominate strategy.

The IMO’s delay changes the pace of regulation, not the direction of travel. Decarbonisation remains inevitable, but those who act early will capture the benefits first.

Shipowners have more control than they think. Regulatory pressure at the regional and multinational level has sparked an acceleration in the development of clean technologies in recent years, producing a range of viable options that can secure meaningful GHG reductions, today. From fuel-saving technologies like rotor sails and advanced hull coatings, to hybrid and emulsion fuels, such as MSAR and bioMSAR, there are clear routes to reducing emissions and improving operational efficiency that must be grasped with both hands.

All of the leading alternative fuel technologies that hold the promise of unlocking a net zero future for shipping – whether methanol, ammonia, or even nuclear – are suffering from a shortage of supply, poor and uncertain scale of distribution, as well as ongoing regulatory challenges.

However, there is a wide range of transitional fuels and technologies which, on their own or in combination, offer an immediate means of reducing fuel costs, as well as reducing CO2 and NOx emissions, whilst eliminating harmful particulate matter.

Many of these solutions also drive operational performance. This means that owners and operators are no longer having to forfeit commercial advantage in order to achieve regulatory compliance – unlocking a future in which energy efficiency improvements make real-world business sense.

Let’s be clear: shipowners cannot afford to wait for alternative fuels like ammonia or methanol to be readily available at the scale they are used to. Instead, they must seek to engage with a combination of practical and readily available transition fuels and energy efficiency technologies to reduce operational costs and as well as their GHG footprints.

While frustrating for some, the delay in adopting the new IMO rules may ultimately prove worthwhile if the end result creates a level playing field. The benefits of a consolidated framework are twofold; firstly, it will avoid creating a race to the bottom, as some shipowners may opt to align their operations with the most lenient regulatory regime; and secondly, to address the current compliance complexity by creating a unified regulatory environment that is better suited to support an inherently global business.

Despite the need for the industry to show meaningful emissions reductions by 2030, readily available transition fuels continue to face market challenges. Many of these fuels and technologies are at a critical stage where well-documented trials are necessary for them to be adopted more broadly.

However, class societies, flag states, as well as engine manufacturers risk becoming bottlenecks in this process if all of the industry’s resources are focused exclusively on developing engines that are capable of running on ammonia or methanol. A more balanced approach is needed; one that supports the evaluation and adoption of available fuels or technologies capable of advancing decarbonisation now, rather than later.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/OW-Bunker-Dynamic-Oil-Trading.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:58:06.223029

The global maritime industry is moving steadily towards lower emissions, driven by new regulations, shifting fuel technologies, and rising pressure from international trade partners. For many African countries, the pace of this transition is challenging, but the consequences of not adapting may be far greater.

A global shift that will reshape shipping

The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2023 greenhouse gas (GHG) strategy sets a clear target: the shipping industry must reach net-zero emissions around 2050. This global direction is already visible. Green methanol-fuelled vessels are entering service, and major ports in Europe and Asia are preparing for ammonia and other alternative fuels. Equipment such as electric cranes, digital yard systems, and shore-power connections are becoming mainstream in developed maritime hubs.

Africa’s starting point is very different. Many ports still depend on diesel-powered machinery, lack green bunkering infrastructure, and operate with older vessels on regional routes. This creates a gap between global progress and local readiness. However, the shift is unavoidable, especially as green compliance becomes linked to market access.

Africa’s exposure and the need for adaptation

Although Africa contributes relatively little to global maritime emissions, it is highly exposed to climate impacts. Rising sea levels and extreme weather events affect coastal infrastructure, ports, and trade corridors. At the same time, international regulations and market mechanisms, such as Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are increasing the importance of low-carbon transport for exporters.

CBAM, for instance, will require exporters to account for emissions associated with production and transport. This could raise costs for African goods entering Europe if supply chains do not align with greener standards. Avoiding such penalties depends partly on adopting cleaner port operations, better monitoring systems, and more efficient logistics.

Financing the transition: The central challenge

Shifting to low-carbon maritime operations requires long-term investment in infrastructure, energy systems, and technology. For developing economies, the scale of financing needed is significant.

According to Gareth Phillips, Manager for Climate and Environmental Finance at the African Development Bank, the bank has become a central player in supporting this transition. A practical example is the Port of Cotonou, where AfDB financed climate-resilience measures to address rising sea levels. This allowed Benin to unlock USD 18 million in concessional co-financing from the Canadian AfDB Climate Facility. Without such structured support, securing this level of climate-aligned financing would have been difficult.

Phillips explains that green port projects attract stronger international backing when they demonstrate additional benefits such as community resilience, improved safety, or gender-inclusive development. This approach helps African ports build stronger cases for funding but requires careful planning and technical preparation.

Aligning policies with global standards

Regulation is central to the maritime transition. The IMO’s GHG Strategy, reporting requirements, emissions monitoring, and fuel standards will directly influence port operations and vessel access in the coming years.

James Ng’ang’a, Ports and Maritime Transport Expert at AfDB, says the bank is working closely with African governments to align national maritime policies with these international rules. In Seychelles, the bank is supporting the Seychelles Ports Authority in preparing the Strategic Investment Plan 2025–2030, ensuring that climate resilience and environmental sustainability are included in future port development.

In Namibia, Ng’ang’a notes that AfDB and the Government of South Korea are helping develop a Green Port Policy, Strategy, and Investment Plan. Implementation is expected to begin in 2026, setting a structured pathway for sustainable port operations.

These policy frameworks aim to ensure that African ports stay connected to global shipping standards, protect competitiveness, and reduce long-term operating risks.

Working with strategic partners

Africa’s ports will not transition alone. Collaboration with development banks, port authorities, and global shipping companies is essential. AfDB emphasises the importance of coordinated efforts to reduce knowledge gaps, share best practices, and implement practical solutions.

Ng’ang’a highlights one such example: AfDB’s technical assistance to Transnet in South Africa to design energy-efficiency measures and develop renewable-energy options for port operations. These partnerships allow African ports to improve performance while preparing for low-carbon requirements expected from international carriers.

Why inaction could be costly

The cost of delaying decarbonisation is not limited to environmental risks. Trade competitiveness is also at stake. If African ports fall behind global standards, shipping lines may choose more efficient or greener routes. Exporters may face higher penalties under mechanisms like CBAM. Cargo delays, disruptions, and insurance costs could rise if ports are not equipped to handle climate impacts or meet compliance requirements.

Phillips notes that by adopting cleaner technologies, improving emissions reporting, and integrating climate considerations into port investments, African exporters can avoid unnecessary costs and strengthen access to international markets.

Building the green and blue economy

AfDB is exploring new financing solutions to support long-term maritime sustainability. While the bank does not yet have a dedicated maritime decarbonisation fund, its activities align with broader development priorities such as resilient infrastructure and capital mobilisation under the President’s “Four Cardinal Points”.

Phillips points to emerging tools such as the Adaptation Benefits Mechanism, which aims to channel solidarity levies from high-emitting industries into climate resilience projects. Such tools could support ports in building infrastructure that withstands sea-level rise, extreme weather, and other climate-related risks.

Across the continent, interest in blue economy strategies is growing. These programmes integrate maritime transport, coastal tourism, fisheries, and renewable marine energy into national development plans. Over time, such strategies could support a wider transition to greener and more sustainable ocean economies.

Preparing for a new maritime era

The global shift towards low-carbon shipping is accelerating. For Africa, the transition is complex but necessary. While the continent did not drive the rise in maritime emissions, its ports and exporters must adapt to remain competitive in a world where sustainability standards influence trade decisions.

Decarbonisation is no longer optional; it is now linked to market access, cost efficiency, and long-term resilience. The question ahead is not whether the transformation will happen, but how fast African ports can prepare, and how effectively they can mobilise the needed support.

The coming years will determine whether African maritime gateways are ready to operate in a global shipping environment shaped by new fuels, new technologies, and new expectations.",https://www.logupdateafrica.com/h-upload/2025/11/28/89322-industrial-port-de-barcelona-evening.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:58:46.270007

This year’s edition, At a Crossroads: Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors 2025, identifies 25 new green corridor initiatives, expanding the global total to 84 active initiatives. Initiatives have been launched in major developing economies like China, India, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, and Kenya, reflecting the significant economic opportunities that can be seized through the development of zero-emission marine fuels and bunkering capabilities in these regions.

The news comes only a month after discussions to adopt the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) landmark Net-Zero Framework, designed to establish a path for shipping to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, were delayed for at least one year.

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said. “But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade, and technology.”

For the first time since the report’s inception in 2022, four green shipping corridors have now reached the ‘realisation stage’, an important milestone at which the construction and/or operation of vessels, infrastructure, and/or fuel plants takes place. However, the report cautions that many of the 84 initiatives remain stalled by a ‘feasibility wall’ created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels – a challenge that the Net-Zero Framework, delayed until at least next October, could help overcome.

Despite this delay, the report warns that industry and governments should not surrender the next year to a ‘wait and see’ approach. Instead, corridors should make use of emerging policies and programmes from national governments, such as the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, H2Global, and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart programme – something that would unlock progress ahead of a global framework and put participants among the frontrunners to benefit from future IMO incentives.

“We have at least 12 months before the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework is adopted,” Fahnestock said. “That time can either be spent waiting, or used to build projects that create strategic economic advantages, generate learnings that can influence the IMO’s reward mechanism, and put participants first in line for future global rewards. Those who act now will be best positioned to benefit when regulation catches up.”

To best expand and progress green corridors, the report recommends the industry:

Pursue strategies to break inertia and maintain momentum, closing the cost gap and ensuring corridors are advanced enough to qualify for first mover rewards once they’re available.

Capitalise on the opportunity to shape IMO policy, like the reward mechanism, and be well-positioned to benefit from eventual regulation.

Better engage those with ambitious decarbonisation goals that can help scale solutions, particularly cargo owners who may be more willing to pay a premium for cleaner fuels.

Decarbonizing the Shipping Industry has become a top priority as international pressure mounts to address climate change. The Japanese government and private sector are spearheading innovative strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, aiming to transform the sector into a model of sustainability.

National Commitment to Green Shipping

Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) has outlined a comprehensive roadmap for achieving net-zero emissions in shipping by 2050. This vision aligns with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) global targets and reflects Japan’s commitment to environmental stewardship. The government is actively promoting research and development in alternative fuels, including hydrogen and ammonia, which produce no carbon emissions when used as ship propulsion energy sources.

Technological Innovations

Japanese shipbuilders and maritime companies are investing heavily in next-generation vessel technologies. Key projects include the development of hydrogen-powered ships, ammonia-fueled engines, and advanced battery systems for short-distance vessels. Leading firms such as Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and NYK Line are collaborating on pilot projects to test these technologies in real-world conditions. These efforts are supported by government subsidies and public-private partnerships, accelerating the pace of innovation.

Strengthening International Collaboration

Japan recognizes that decarbonizing shipping is a global challenge requiring international cooperation. The country is actively participating in IMO negotiations and working with other maritime nations to establish unified standards for low-carbon shipping. Japanese expertise is also being shared through joint ventures and technology transfers, helping developing countries upgrade their fleets and adopt greener practices.

Challenges and Future Outlook

Despite significant progress, Japan faces challenges in scaling up new technologies and ensuring their economic viability. The transition to alternative fuels requires substantial investment in infrastructure, such as bunkering facilities and supply chains. Additionally, global market fluctuations and regulatory uncertainties pose risks to long-term planning. Nevertheless, Japan’s proactive approach, supported by robust policy frameworks and industry collaboration, positions the country as a frontrunner in maritime decarbonization.

As Japan continues to innovate and lead, its initiatives offer valuable lessons for the global shipping industry. The nation’s commitment to sustainability, technological advancement, and international cooperation will be crucial in achieving a greener future for maritime trade.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img-japans-initiatives-for-decarbonizing-the-shipping-industry.webp,N,,2025-11-28 09:58:56.613948

The latest Annual Progress Report on Green Shipping Corridors from the Getting to Zero Coalition and the Global Maritime Forum shows the total number of active initiatives worldwide has risen to 84—up from 59 in 2024.

The fourth edition of the report, titled At a Crossroads, highlights a notable geographic shift. China and India each added four new corridors, while Brazil added two. Chile, Ghana and Kenya also strengthened their presence. According to the authors, these countries are moving early to capture new opportunities in clean fuel production, bunkering infrastructure and green trade flows.

The update comes shortly after the International Maritime Organization postponed adoption of its Net-Zero Framework to at least October 2026—a delay that, the report warns, could create hesitancy among investors and slow momentum.

For the first time, four corridor projects have progressed to the “realisation” stage, meaning work is now underway on vessels, fuel production or port infrastructure. However, many initiatives are still stuck in feasibility, constrained by the high price of alternative fuels and uncertainty around future regulatory incentives.

Sectoral activity remains broadly unchanged from last year, with one exception: a surge in tanker-related corridors, driven mainly by six new ammonia-carrier routes. The report also notes a rise in projects marked “to be determined,” reflecting the influx of fresh announcements that have yet to define vessel types or operational specifics.

The authors urge governments and industry stakeholders to use the window before the IMO finalises its framework to push projects forward rather than pause development. They point to existing national and regional programmes—such as the EU’s Global Gateway, Germany’s H2Global, and Australia’s Hydrogen Headstart—as mechanisms that could help move corridors into advanced stages and secure first-mover leadership.

To sustain progress, the report calls for targeted actions to close the cost gap between green and conventional fuels, prepare for future IMO incentives, strengthen collaboration with cargo owners willing to pay green premiums, and maximise the use of domestic policy tools to support early deployment.

Introduced through the Clydebank Declaration at COP26 in 2021, green corridors have become testbeds for the fuels, technologies and partnerships needed to decarbonise global shipping. With key 2030 climate deadlines approaching, the report stresses that the next few years will determine whether these pilot initiatives can mature into a robust, scaled global network capable of propelling the sector toward net-zero emissions.",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Green-shipping-gain-pace.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:59:04.873597

2025 Overview & Update

Whilst progress during 2025 overall has not proceeded as expected, the Company closes the year in a stronger position, with a clearer path towards commercialisation and the resources in place to achieve this. During the year the Company advanced preparations for the MSC trial, successfully completed a trial with Sparkle Power in Panama and recognised its first license fee revenues from Valkor.

Following the successful fundraise in January 2025 which raised £6.5m (before expenses), the Company recruited additional resources to enhance delivery capacity, accelerate growth and raise its profile in the marine sector. These included the appointment of Peter Borup as CEO with effect from 1 October 2025 and new additions at board, executive and advisor level.

These decisive appointments have resulted in a strengthened business development pipeline and allowed the Company to open discussions with multiple potential clients and supply partners in parallel.

The Company's position has also been strengthened by ongoing regulatory uncertainty. The IMO MEPC's decision in October 2025 to defer adoption of a mandatory Net-Zero Framework for shipping until October 2026 strengthens the Quadrise value proposition. Our technology offers immediate cost savings, significant emissions reductions, and a pathway to low-cost compliance with future regulations.

Progress in each of the Company's key projects is summarised below.

Marine: Following the signature of the 3-way agreement with MSC & Cargill in November 2024, finalisation of the remaining trial agreements has been slower than expected. This is primarily due to the need at MSC's request to consider post-trial go forward commercial supply and for the agreements to reflect the logistical complexities of the trial. Negotiations are ongoing and proceeding positively, with all parties remaining committed to the trials and working to finalise the agreements as soon as possible.

During 2025, the MAC² trial services agreement was executed. Trial operating permits and a dedicated bunker barge have been secured. Groundworks at MAC² are complete, with the trial equipment ready for shipment to Antwerp upon agreement finalisation. In parallel, discussions are ongoing with refineries with regard to commercial supply from key bunker hubs worldwide.

Following signature of the remaining agreements, installation and commissioning of trial equipment at MAC² will precede fuel production and Proof-of-Concept tests. The bioMSAR™ LONO trial will conclude 6 to 8 months after the 2-month Proof-of-Concept tests of MSAR® and bioMSAR™. During the LONO trial, the parties are aiming to finalise a Commercial Supply Agreement and secure permanent bioMSAR™ bunker supply operations for the marine sector by Cargill from MAC² facilities, contingent on successful trial completion.

Valkor: In September 2025, due to slower than expected production growth at Valkor's Utah operations, Quadrise and Valkor agreed a further addendum to the 2023 Site License and Supply Agreement. This sets out a revised timetable regarding payment to Quadrise of US$1.5m for licensing and equipment fees, quarterly support fees and the deployment of Quadrise equipment to Valkor's site.

Following receipt of an initial US$50k of the US$1m license fee, a further US$0.3m is now due by 31 March 2026, and US$0.65m by 30 June 2026. Quadrise will provide a 600 bpd Multifuel Manufacturing Unit (""MMU"") by 30 June 2026, for which Valkor will pay US$0.2m by 30 September 2026. An additional US$0.3m is payable upon delivery of a full-size 6,000 bpd MMU, in exchange for the 600 bpd MMU. A service charge of US$75k is due quarterly from 1 July 2026 for at least two years, covering engineering, process design, commissioning, site operations, and compliance support.

Valkor have now secured the funding required to progress drilling and site development, with their 500bpd oil sands pilot plant expected to be operational in Q2 2026. Representative oil samples for Quadrise testing are expected in Q1 2026 ahead of the deployment of Quadrise equipment to site and the commencement of marketing activities in the USA.

Americas: In September 2025, Quadrise was pleased to announce the successful completion of proof-of-concept and emissions testing for its MSAR® and bioMSAR™ fuels at the Sparkle Power SA plant in El Giral, Panama. These trials mark the first application of MSAR® and bioMSAR™ on Everllence (formerly MAN Energy Solutions) 4-stroke engines, broadening the commercial potential of the Company's fuels across additional engine types in energy-intensive sectors seeking cost-effective decarbonisation.

Testing has demonstrated improved engine efficiency and significant emissions reductions, and also validated expected performance for commercial deployment. The next steps are for Quadrise and Sparkle to confirm commercial supply arrangements and secure fuel permitting in Panama. In parallel, discussions with potential regional supply partners are underway.

OCP: In Morocco, the proposed 30-day commercial site trial continues to await final OEM approval. Quadrise and OCP are now working to obtain this or select alternative sites, and the trial is expected to commence once plans have been agreed, with the trial equipment on-site at OCP.

bioMSAR™ Development: During the year good progress has been seen on testing new biofuels for bioMSAR™ and bioMSAR™ Zero and the Company has also collaborated with technology companies to explore and unlock new renewable feedstocks. These included:

· Solvolysis: with Vertoro BV and partners

· Fast pyrolysis: with BTG Bioliquids BV and Alder Energy

· Hydrothermal Liquefaction: with Licella Holdings

· Undisclosed others under development

During the year Quadrise commenced the SEASTARS EU Horizon Project, a consortium of 19 partners from 8 countries working together to drive sustainable shipping forwards. The Company is also awaiting approval on other similar EU-funded projects.

Commenting on the update, Peter Borup, Chief Executive Officer of QED, said:

""We obviously would have liked to have more to say about progress of the Company's main projects. However, we have taken advantage of the successful fund raising to significantly increase our experience base and capacity to improve our marine project management and the commercialisation of our unique technology.""

""As a relatively small player dealing with larger and much more complex clients, our focus is now on more aggressive project management, with more assertive timeline management as well as pursuing parallel projects and trials to give ourselves more chances to advance our technology.""

""This is particularly important at a time where the maritime industry needs to select technologies that together can offer cost savings and emissions reductions to meet the requirements of the EU regulations and ultimately the IMO.""

We would position the FAAM aircraft in the area of operation.
A tighter air pollution zone operates in the Channel and North Sea.
This was largely effective but here two out of 33 ships breached limits.
Our work also showed that ships are a significant source of local air pollution when they are sailing close to shore.","In response to this challenge, Prof James Lee from the University of York began measuring air pollution from individual ships. He said: “We wanted to see how widely the new regulations were being adhered to and then look at the effect on the atmosphere. We flew the FAAM aircraft out from the UK and Portugal to investigate in 2019 and then again in 2021 and 2022.”

The UK’s FAAM aircraft started life as a prototype short-haul airliner for about 100 passengers. Nowadays it carries up to 18 researchers and four tonnes of science equipment.

Dr Dominika Pasternak, one of the researchers on the study, said: “The most difficult part was finding the plume. We would position the FAAM aircraft in the area of operation. A person back at the airport used a ship tracker website and relayed coordinates, heading and visual description over Satcom.

“We often flew just 30 metres over water. With data on wind speed and direction, the speed and heading of the ship, some trigonometry and very skilled flying, we were able to intercept 130 ship plumes.”

In the open ocean, eight ships out of 19 were emitting more sulphur than permitted in 2019. These included a 61,900 tonne container ship and an 86,100 tonne crude oil tanker. Five ships out of 78 exceeded the stricter limits in 2021 and 2022.

A tighter air pollution zone operates in the Channel and North Sea. This was largely effective but here two out of 33 ships breached limits. In one case, a 200,000 tonne container ship was found breaching sulphur limits in the open ocean but had later switched to cleaner fuel when it was sampled nearer land in the Channel and North Sea zone.

Air pollution from burning shipping fuels can be measured further inland – in London for example – and was estimated to have cost the UK £1.5bn in health impacts in 2017.

Lee offered a message to policymakers: “The reduction in sulphur shows that regulations can have an effect. Our work also showed that ships are a significant source of local air pollution when they are sailing close to shore.

“As the road vehicle fleet becomes cleaner, shipping and aviation are likely to become the main source. Consideration should be given to any policy to reduce these.”

The IMO is expected to adopt a new emissions control area for shipping around the western UK and the north-east Atlantic, which will come into force from 2027.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22752853/1000.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:59:14.599672
