MENA Aims to Boost IMO Liability, Compensation Rules

Maritime stakeholders from Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Yemen completed a regional workshop in Alexandria, Egypt (7-11 December) to strengthen their capacity to enforce the IMO liability and compensation regime.

The IMO liability and compensation regime ensures that victims of maritime incidents receive prompt and adequate compensation, while establishing clear, uniform and limited liability rules for shipowners to ensure a level playing field for safe and clean shipping in the region.

The Maritime Transport and Logistics Sector of Egypt, in cooperation with IMO hosted the workshop, bringing together representatives of maritime administrations and legal experts in the Middle East and North Africa region to enhance their understanding and improve application of key international conventions governing maritime liability and compensation, including:

the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (1992 CLC);

the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage (1992 Fund Convention);

the Protocol on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea (2010 HNS Convention);

the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (2001 Bunkers Convention);

the Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks (2007 Nairobi WRC); and

the International Convention on Salvage (1989 Salvage Convention).

Opening the workshop, Head of Maritime Transport and Logistics Sector of Egypt Rear Admiral Hussein Mustafa El Geziry, encouraged all participating Member States to accede to and fully implement all IMO treaties related to the liability and compensation regime. This would help ensure that costs arising from maritime incidents are properly covered and also enhance sustainable shipping, noting recent incidents where ships lacked the relevant insurance coverage.

Presentations were delivered by a team from the IMO Legal and External Relations Division, the IOPC Funds Secretariat, and the P & I Clubs, alongside contributions from national representatives highlighting their domestic law-making and implementation processes. These exchanges highlighted national experiences and challenges in aligning with the relevant IMO treaties.

The workshop is expected to contribute to the ratification, implementation and enforcement of the IMO's liability and compensation instruments across all participating Member States.

The corridor will operate 12-15 voyages per year, each lasting around 40 days.

Odfjell has established an offtake of B24 sustainable biofuel in Rio Grande to secure long-term fuel availability. The Ports of Antwerp, Rotterdam and Rio Grande are working together with Odfjell to advance the green corridor through increased efficiency and optimized port-stay processes.

A practical path to zero-emission shipping—starting now

“We do this to demonstrate that certified fuel, technology, and infrastructure are already available,” says CEO Harald Fotland. “Through this, we show that sustainable biofuel is a viable option for deep-sea shipping today.”

Fotland emphasizes that this is not a one-off demonstration but a long-term commitment.

“With this corridor, we integrate greener fuel as a new pillar in our decarbonization strategy. We activate the entire value chain to find ways to decarbonize our operations, and we are encouraged that key stakeholders are joining us in this groundbreaking initiative.”

Industry-led action for scalable infrastructure

Norway-headquartered Odfjell has taken independent action—self-funding the project and moving ahead without subsidies.

“By covering the additional cost ourselves, we eliminate the financial element and move directly into operational implementation. It may not be a perfect corridor yet, but a solid start. Its success depends on collaboration across the value chain, and we are committed to developing it further together with relevant stakeholders,” Fotland says.

This includes collaboration with ports to increase efficiency, with customers to maximize capacity utilization, and with fuel providers to increase the influx of green fuels.

In Brazil, the currently available sustainable biofuel quality is the so-called certified B24 – a blend of 24% renewable biodiesel derived from waste and 76% VLSFO.

Introducing biofuel marks another step in Odfjell’s decade-long work to reduce emissions. The company has already improved its carbon intensity by more than 54% compared to the 2008 benchmark, achieved through a wide range of technical and operational measures.

The initiative aligns with IMO’s 2030 targets and the EU’s Fit for 55 ambitions, and builds on the 2024 Norway-Brazil MoU to establish a green, transatlantic shipping corridor.

“We hope to inspire broader industry action and welcome continued collaboration with regulators, ports, producers, other ship operators, and customers to accelerate the transition to low-emission maritime transport,” Fotland ends.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/bow-leopard-odfjell-tankers_copy.png,N,,2025-12-16 03:56:30.862400

U.S. Gulf Coast Methanol Bunkering Push Could Be A Game Changer For Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (TSE:9101)

Simply Wall St

Reviewed by Sasha Jovanovic

December 15, 2025

In December 2025, American Bureau of Shipping, ENEOS, Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha and SEACOR Holdings began a joint study to develop a low‑carbon methanol bunkering and supply chain network along the U.S. Gulf Coast, targeting the first commercial-scale ship-to-ship methanol bunkering operations in the country.

The collaboration positions NYK Line to apply its LNG bunkering experience to emerging methanol fuel infrastructure, aligning its shipping operations with the International Maritime Organization’s 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal.

We’ll now examine how NYK Line’s move into U.S. Gulf Coast methanol bunkering could influence its investment narrative and future positioning.

Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha Investment Narrative Recap

To own NYK Line, you generally need to believe it can convert its scale in global shipping into sustainable earnings while managing cyclical freight markets and capital intensive decarbonization. The methanol bunkering study on the U.S. Gulf Coast supports NYK’s energy transition credentials, but the immediate focus for many shareholders is likely still on how the company manages its recently lowered earnings and dividend guidance, which remain the more material short term catalyst and risk.

In that context, the November 2025 update cutting the end year ordinary dividend forecast to JPY 85.00 per share, alongside reduced profit guidance for the year ending March 31, 2026, is highly relevant. It highlights management’s willingness to reset payouts when earnings soften, even after committing to a higher long term dividend policy, and frames decarbonization moves like methanol bunkering as part of a broader question about how reliably future cash flows will support shareholder returns.

Yet behind NYK Line’s energy transition initiatives, investors also need to be aware of how dividend cuts could signal...

Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha's narrative projects ¥2409.5 billion revenue and ¥218.4 billion earnings by 2028. This requires revenue to decline by 1.7% per year and an earnings decrease of ¥201.2 billion from ¥419.6 billion today.

, a 5% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Two fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span a wide band from ¥2,583.85 to ¥5,248.18, underscoring sharply different views on NYK Line. When you set those against the recent earnings and dividend downgrades, it reinforces how important it is to weigh several perspectives on the company’s ability to sustain profits through the energy transition.

“But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure.","The EU-funded feasibility study will focus on transatlantic traffic between Panama – a global hub for shipping – and Algeciras in Spain, located by the Strait of Gibraltar and one of Europe’s busiest container ports. Both locations are also key bunkering ports, making them strong candidates to play a role in shipping’s decarbonisation journey.

According to Ricardo, the study will investigate the technical, financial and policy conditions required to enable zero or low emissions trade across the route. This includes feasible fuel options, the cost of alternative fuel vessels versus existing ships, as well as compliance costs associated with regulations such as the IMO Net-Zero Framework, FuelEU Maritime, and the EU ETS. The project will also examine how policy can help bridge some of the cost gaps and accelerate deployment of green shipping technology.

Ricardo will lead the study in partnership with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority, and Maritime & Logistics Consulting Group.

“The Panama–Algeciras green shipping corridor is not only significant because of its trans-oceanic distance, but also because it connects two major global bunker hubs with strong potential to become green hubs,” said Alexi Pons, Ricardo’s associate director for Transport Policy.

“Developing green shipping infrastructure along this route could deliver transformative benefits for both regions. We’re very excited to be working with the Algeciras Bay Port Authority, the Panama Canal Authority, the Panama Maritime Authority and the EU on this project.”

According to the Global Maritime Forum, over 80 green shipping corridors have now been established worldwide, with China, India, and Brazil leading the way. However, its annual report also noted that just four of these corridors have reached the ‘realisation’ stage, where construction or operation of vessels or infrastructure has taken place.

The report states that many of these projects have been stalled by a 'feasibility wall' created by the cost gap between conventional and zero-emission fuels. The IMO Net Zero Framework has been designed to help address these issues, but recent talks to adopt it collapsed under threats from the US, which claims the regulations will cause it economic harm. But according to Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, green shipping represents a significant economic opportunity.

“The move of major countries like China, India, and Brazil into green corridors is hugely promising, as these are markets that will determine whether zero-emission shipping scales fast enough to meet global climate goals,” said Fahnestock.

“But even more importantly, we’re seeing recognition from these countries that green corridors are more than just environmental projects – they are strategic economic infrastructure. Countries that move early stand to gain competitive industrial and geopolitical advantages across energy, trade, and technology.”",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/oinihw1u/green.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 07:56:15.663230

Driven by rising global Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) standards and India’s obligations under Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs), the shift marks a decisive move towards safer, cleaner and more resilient port operations.

With a vast coastline rich in mangroves, coral reefs, lagoons and marine biodiversity, Indian ports are under increasing pressure from trade expansion and infrastructure development. To address these challenges responsibly, the country has aligned its maritime policies with the International Maritime Organization’s framework and nine UN Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on renewable power adoption, improved air and water quality, enhanced waste management and expansion of green cover.

The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways (MoPSW) has outlined this transition through the Maritime India Vision (MIV) 2030, a comprehensive blueprint to modernise the sector while embedding sustainability at its core. The strategy identifies clean fuels such as green hydrogen, ammonia, biofuels and LNG as critical to the future of maritime transport, supported by India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission.

Launched to reduce carbon emissions and position India as a global green hydrogen hub, the mission targets annual production of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030. It is expected to attract investments of ₹8 lakh crore, generate six lakh jobs and cut fossil fuel imports by ₹1 lakh crore. As part of this initiative, Kandla, Paradip and V.O. Chidambaranar (Tuticorin) ports have been identified for development as green hydrogen hubs.

The green maritime push is further reinforced by long-term policy roadmaps. Under Maritime India Vision 2030, investments of ₹3–3.5 lakh crore are projected across ports, shipping and inland waterways, supported by a recent ₹69,725 crore package to revitalise shipbuilding. Complementing this is the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047, which earmarks nearly ₹80 lakh crore for ports, green shipping, coastal shipping, inland waterways and shipbuilding, with over 300 actionable initiatives aimed at making India a leading maritime nation by its centenary year of independence.

To operationalise sustainability goals, the government has rolled out several green port initiatives. Ports are being encouraged to develop captive solar power through rooftop installations, unused land and floating solar projects on calm waters. Wind energy adoption is being expanded through onshore and offshore projects, including exploration of offshore wind potential near Okha and the southern peninsula, alongside tidal, wave and solar thermal energy pilots.

Flagship programmes such as the Harit Sagar Green Port Guidelines, National Green Hydrogen Mission and the Green Tug Transition Programme (GTTP) are reshaping port operations. The ₹25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund aims to catalyse investments in green infrastructure, alternative fuels and fleet modernisation. Under the GTTP, conventional harbour tugs will be replaced with greener alternatives, supported by 30 per cent government funding and aligned with the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

The ‘Panch Karma Sankalp’, announced in May 2024, outlines five major actions, including procurement of green tugs by major ports, development of green hydrogen hubs, creation of a single-window portal for cruise facilitation, and transformation of select ports into smart ports. Complementary initiatives such as the Harit Nauka (Green Vessel) guidelines for inland waterways and the Coastal Green Shipping Corridor—starting with the Kandla–Tuticorin route—are further strengthening low-emission maritime transport.

Ports are also focusing on emission reduction through cleaner fuels, shore-to-ship power, electrification of material-handling equipment and LNG bunkering. The government has set a target for 50 per cent of port vehicles to switch to cleaner fuels by 2030. Green belts are being expanded to control air and noise pollution, enhance biodiversity and improve coastal resilience, in line with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change’s mandate for 33 per cent green coverage.

A major legislative push comes with the Indian Ports Bill, 2025, which replaces the century-old framework with a modern law mandating global green norms and disaster readiness. The reform follows a decade of strong sector growth, with cargo handling at major ports reaching a record 855 million tonnes in FY 2024–25, port capacity rising nearly 87 per cent, and ship turnaround times halving to 48 hours. Indian ports have also gained international recognition, with nine featuring in the World Bank’s Container Port Performance Index.

On the global stage, India is strengthening partnerships and dialogues to advance sustainable maritime growth. Platforms such as Sagarmanthan and the Green & Digital Maritime Corridors Dialogue at Jawaharlal Nehru Port Authority have brought together global stakeholders to shape the future of green shipping. Bilateral initiatives, including the India–Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor, aim to accelerate low-emission technologies and digital transformation.

India is also enhancing marine pollution control through robust oil-spill response planning, satellite-based monitoring, oil-sensitivity mapping and prioritisation of ecologically sensitive coastal areas.

As India charts its course towards 2047, the maritime sector is emerging as a cornerstone of sustainable development. Through integrated policy reforms, green technologies and global cooperation, the country is positioning itself not only as a growing maritime power but also as a responsible steward of the oceans and a leader in sustainable shipping.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/26-2.png,N,,2025-12-15 06:56:15.482880

The disruptor-in-chief was the biggest factor shaping global affairs in 2025 and the top spot on our annual ranking of influence was never really in doubt.

His tariffs bludgeoned the multilateral trade system, his derailment of shipping’s net zero strategy has called into question the very future of global regulation for a global industry via the International Maritime Organization. Very few decisions in shipping this year were unaffected by the Trump factor.

No doubt that will be the case for as long as he remains in the White House, but don’t expect 2026 to simply be a rerun of what has just played out over the past 12 months.

Despite everything, most shipping markets did just fine in 2025.

But the disruptive forces that have allowed shipping markets to defy economic gravity thus far are not going to last forever.

Yes, friction is good for shipping, but over time it becomes a cost. While it was the big geopolitical factors shaping our world thus far, there are more homemade problems heading in our direction for next year.

Longer distances have powered shipping markets since 2020, but the forces fuelling those longer distances are changing.

A delivery bulge is nearing, and utilisation is set to slip as the fleet grows 5% against a 1.5% uptick in tonne-mile demand.

Fleet growth is set to outpace distance adjusted demand next year, and we are not going to be able to scrap our way out of this imbalance immediately, or at least not enough to offset the delivery wave.

The outlook for rates is turning tougher.

So yes, shipping thrives on unpredictability, crisis and luck.

But that doesn’t address the big issues shaping the industry’s future. It doesn’t insulate everyone from a downturn that has the potential to be brutal, regardless of how cash-rich owners feel they are right now.

Everything from technology to globalisation itself is changing around the traditional business model and if this year has taught us anything, it is that we should probably expect the unexpected.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/images/daily-view/ll-dv-monday.png?rev=c969b87b902549448d61fa9e9247af2b,N,,2025-12-15 06:56:20.997767

Poseidon Principles will expand to include more financial institutions—from private equity and hedge funds to capital markets underwriters—with an aim to further increase climate transparency in shipping finance.

15 December 2025, Copenhagen – Ship financiers’ lending portfolios are getting closer to reaching climate alignment with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) ambitious decarbonisation trajectories, with average scores against the ‘minimum trajectory’ improving by nearly 8 percentage points.

The news was revealed today in the Sixth Annual Disclosure Report of the Poseidon Principles, the world’s first sector-specific framework for financial institutions to assess and disclose the climate alignment of their shipping portfolios. With 36 signatories across 14 countries, representing nearly three-quarters of the world’s ship finance portfolio, the initiative establishes a benchmark for the industry in line with the IMO’s goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050.

This year, signatories disclosed 95% of their eligible portfolio activity, up from 93% last year and the second-highest level since reporting began.

Paul Taylor, Vice Chair of the Poseidon Principles and Global Head of Maritime Industries, Societe Generale, said: “Transparency is key. It fosters collaboration between financial institutions and shipowners, and guides capital toward more efficient vessels and cleaner fuels. The results of this year’s report show encouraging, measurable, real-world momentum and progress in action. Signatories are disclosing the vast majority of their portfolios, showing increasing collaboration between financiers and clients, and climate alignment scores have moved closer to the IMO’s decarbonisation pathways. This progress is particularly striking considering the pathways become more stringent year-on-year. In short, the Poseidon Principles continue to demonstrate the power of financial transparency in guiding the shipping industry’s transition.”

The report shows that emissions data is increasingly informing credit decisions and innovative financial products, such as sustainability-linked loans. Operational efficiency, retrofits, and emerging fuel pathways are noted as key drivers of score improvements this year, and the scores were also impacted by evolving methodologies and external factors, including rerouting vessels on longer routes and disruptions in supply chains. The framework positions financial institutions as active partners in the industry’s transition.

2025 Annual Disclosure Report key findings

Increasing transparency: Twenty-nine signatories disclosed 90% or more of their in-scope portfolio, while nine signatories achieved 100% reporting, the highest number of signatories to hit these two respective targets to date. The average disclosure rate across all signatories was 95%.

Improved climate alignment: While the average scores remain misaligned with the IMO’s net-zero pathways, substantial year-on-year improvements were recorded. Against the IMO’s ‘minimum trajectory’, the scores went from just over 19% misaligned last year to just under 12% misaligned this year, representing a nearly 8 percentage point improvement. Against the IMO’s ‘striving trajectory’, scores went from 25% misaligned to just over 18% misaligned.

Meaningful progress in the cargo and passenger segments: The cargo and passenger segments saw improvements from 14% to 6% misaligned, and from 38% to 26% misaligned, respectively. These shifts demonstrate advances in vessel efficiency, increased uptake of low-emission fuels, and the entry of more efficient dual-fuel vessels into the fleet.

It is important to note that the decarbonisation trajectories set by the 2023 IMO’s GHG Strategy get more challenging to reach each year, making it more difficult to achieve alignment as time goes on. Seeing improvements year-on-year is promising, but additional efforts are still needed to reach milestones in 2030, 2040, and 2050.

Reinforcing the initiative as an established, globally recognised standard for shipping finance, the Poseidon Principles methodology has been included as an acceptable method to set near-term and long-term portfolio alignment targets as part of the Science Based Targets initiative’s Financial Institutions Net-Zero Standard.

Associate membership expansion

Since 2019, the Poseidon Principles have matured into a globally recognised benchmark for transparent, industry-wide climate reporting that has been replicated by other critical sectors, such as steel, aluminium, and aviation. Now, there is a willingness to go further in bringing other institutions on board.

In addition to the lenders, lessors, and financial guarantors historically represented in the signatory list, the Poseidon Principles are now expanding to offer associate membership to a broader range of financial institutions, including private equity, hedge funds, and capital markets underwriters. This expansion will increase the initiative’s potential impact by engaging the wider financial community in the framework without initial reporting obligations. This expansion will strengthen the Association’s influence across the full maritime finance ecosystem and support a broader, more consistent approach to emissions accountability.

Michael Parker, Poseidon Principles Chair and Chairman of Global Shipping & Logistics, Citi, said: “The Poseidon Principles Annual Disclosure Report has become a vital pulse check for the industry, showing how global lending portfolios measure up against the climate ambitions set by the IMO. This consistent transparency gives us a clear view of progress across approximately three-quarters of global ship finance. Without it, we would have no meaningful way to understand how far we and the industry have come, or how far we still need to go. ""Today, the Poseidon Principles are taking another important step to deepen that transparency. By opening Associate Membership to any institution providing or arranging capital for the maritime sector—including private equity firms and hedge funds—we are broadening the lens through which climate considerations can be directly integrated into financing decisions. This expansion supports a broader commitment to transparency and accountability across finance and reinforces the sector’s contribution to a more sustainable future for shipping.”

The latest report cements the critical nature of finance in supporting the shipping industry’s shift toward a zero-emission future while emphasising the crucial role transparency plays in measuring climate alignment.

Poseidon Principles will expand to include more financial institutions—from private equity and hedge funds to capital markets underwriters—with an aim to further increase climate transparency in shipping finance.

15 December 2025, Copenhagen – Ship financiers’ lending portfolios are getting closer to reaching climate alignment with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) ambitious decarbonisation trajectories, with average scores against the ‘minimum trajectory’ improving by nearly 8 percentage points.

The news was revealed today in the Sixth Annual Disclosure Report of the Poseidon Principles, the world’s first sector-specific framework for financial institutions to assess and disclose the climate alignment of their shipping portfolios. With 36 signatories across 14 countries, representing nearly three-quarters of the world’s ship finance portfolio, the initiative establishes a benchmark for the industry in line with the IMO’s goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping by 2050.

This year, signatories disclosed 95% of their eligible portfolio activity, up from 93% last year and the second-highest level since reporting began.

Paul Taylor, Vice Chair of the Poseidon Principles and Global Head of Maritime Industries, Societe Generale, said: “Transparency is key. It fosters collaboration between financial institutions and shipowners, and guides capital toward more efficient vessels and cleaner fuels. The results of this year’s report show encouraging, measurable, real-world momentum and progress in action. Signatories are disclosing the vast majority of their portfolios, showing increasing collaboration between financiers and clients, and climate alignment scores have moved closer to the IMO’s decarbonisation pathways. This progress is particularly striking considering the pathways become more stringent year-on-year. In short, the Poseidon Principles continue to demonstrate the power of financial transparency in guiding the shipping industry’s transition.”

The report shows that emissions data is increasingly informing credit decisions and innovative financial products, such as sustainability-linked loans. Operational efficiency, retrofits, and emerging fuel pathways are noted as key drivers of score improvements this year, and the scores were also impacted by evolving methodologies and external factors, including rerouting vessels on longer routes and disruptions in supply chains. The framework positions financial institutions as active partners in the industry’s transition.

2025 Annual Disclosure Report key findings

Increasing transparency: Twenty-nine signatories disclosed 90% or more of their in-scope portfolio, while nine signatories achieved 100% reporting, the highest number of signatories to hit these two respective targets to date. The average disclosure rate across all signatories was 95%.

Improved climate alignment: While the average scores remain misaligned with the IMO’s net-zero pathways, substantial year-on-year improvements were recorded. Against the IMO’s ‘minimum trajectory’, the scores went from just over 19% misaligned last year to just under 12% misaligned this year, representing a nearly 8 percentage point improvement. Against the IMO’s ‘striving trajectory’, scores went from 25% misaligned to just over 18% misaligned.

Meaningful progress in the cargo and passenger segments: The cargo and passenger segments saw improvements from 14% to 6% misaligned, and from 38% to 26% misaligned, respectively. These shifts demonstrate advances in vessel efficiency, increased uptake of low-emission fuels, and the entry of more efficient dual-fuel vessels into the fleet.

It is important to note that the decarbonisation trajectories set by the 2023 IMO’s GHG Strategy get more challenging to reach each year, making it more difficult to achieve alignment as time goes on. Seeing improvements year-on-year is promising, but additional efforts are still needed to reach milestones in 2030, 2040, and 2050.

Reinforcing the initiative as an established, globally recognised standard for shipping finance, the Poseidon Principles methodology has been included as an acceptable method to set near-term and long-term portfolio alignment targets as part of the Science Based Targets initiative’s Financial Institutions Net-Zero Standard.

Associate membership expansion

Since 2019, the Poseidon Principles have matured into a globally recognised benchmark for transparent, industry-wide climate reporting that has been replicated by other critical sectors, such as steel, aluminium, and aviation. Now, there is a willingness to go further in bringing other institutions on board.

In addition to the lenders, lessors, and financial guarantors historically represented in the signatory list, the Poseidon Principles are now expanding to offer associate membership to a broader range of financial institutions, including private equity, hedge funds, and capital markets underwriters. This expansion will increase the initiative’s potential impact by engaging the wider financial community in the framework without initial reporting obligations. This expansion will strengthen the Association’s influence across the full maritime finance ecosystem and support a broader, more consistent approach to emissions accountability.

Michael Parker, Poseidon Principles Chair and Chairman of Global Shipping & Logistics, Citi, said: “The Poseidon Principles Annual Disclosure Report has become a vital pulse check for the industry, showing how global lending portfolios measure up against the climate ambitions set by the IMO. This consistent transparency gives us a clear view of progress across approximately three-quarters of global ship finance. Without it, we would have no meaningful way to understand how far we and the industry have come, or how far we still need to go. ""Today, the Poseidon Principles are taking another important step to deepen that transparency. By opening Associate Membership to any institution providing or arranging capital for the maritime sector—including private equity firms and hedge funds—we are broadening the lens through which climate considerations can be directly integrated into financing decisions. This expansion supports a broader commitment to transparency and accountability across finance and reinforces the sector’s contribution to a more sustainable future for shipping.”

The latest report cements the critical nature of finance in supporting the shipping industry’s shift toward a zero-emission future while emphasising the crucial role transparency plays in measuring climate alignment.

The V.O. Chidambaranar (VoC) Port is set to roll out a Green Hydrogen Pilot Project aimed at establishing a bunkering facility for green hydrogen and its derivatives. The initiative seeks to support the gradual adoption of green fuels in the shipping sector by providing refuelling infrastructure for vessels operating on both domestic and international routes.

According to a written reply in the Lok Sabha by the Union Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, the project is expected to significantly reduce CO₂ emissions while generating direct and indirect employment opportunities in the manufacturing, storage, and ancillary services associated with green fuels.

This pilot marks a strategic step toward decarbonizing India’s maritime transport and promoting sustainable fuel alternatives in the country’s shipping industry.

The Nigerian Port Economic Regulation of 2015 has remained our guiding document and the framework through which we currently execute our mandate.
At the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, we have carefully studied these infrastructural gaps and what is needed to address them.
Under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), it is evident that one of the biggest challenges will be maritime logistics.","In this interview, Executive Secretary/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC), Dr Pius Akutah, reflects on the Council’s most significant milestones, outlines expectations for the next phase under the current administration, and highlights how ongoing reforms from port regulation to inland logistics and dispute resolution are laying the foundation for a more efficient and globally competitive maritime economy. PAUL OGBUOKIRI reports.

Looking back at your two years as Executive Secretary, what would you identify as the most significant achievement of the Council on your watch?

Two years have indeed come and gone, and within that period, a great deal has happened in the Council. As you requested, I will highlight the most significant achievement we have recorded, and it is the passing of the Nigerian Port Economic Regulatory Agency Bill. At the moment, it is undergoing final refinements by the National Assembly after being vetted by the Office of the AttorneyGeneral of the Federation.

Once this stage is completed, it will proceed to the President for assent. This development is particularly important because the Council has long operated under a 1978 Decree, now codified as CAP N133 LFN 2004. The Nigerian Shippers’ Council Act is an outdated law that no longer reflects the realities or reform direction of the maritime sector under the administration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.

For us as a Council, this new legal framework is crucial. It equips us to address sectoral challenges more effectively and positions the industry to attain the targets set by Mr. President for a modern, efficient, and globally competitive maritime sector.

Can you give us an idea of what you expect in the second half of your tenure which you have stepped into now?

First of all, I must congratulate Mr. President for the leadership he is providing in driving the economic rebirth of this country. For many years, we have spoken about diversifying Nigeria’s economy, but for the first time, we are now witnessing true diversification in both real time and in practical terms.

The Maritime and Blue Economy sector holds immense potential. As we unlock these opportunities, we will generate significant wealth, create jobs, and lift many Nigerians out of poverty. The reality and importance of this sector are now clearly visible to everyone. Fortunately, we have a proactive Minister who is working tirelessly to reposition Nigeria on the global stage as a true maritime nation.

The passage of the Marine and Blue Economy Policy championed by His Excellency Adegboyega Oyetola, shows that the necessary foundations for the sector have been firmly laid. As we move into the second half of this administration’s tenure, the next two years carry great significance for the Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy. A lot has already been done to prepare the ground for what is coming next.

I believe that with the structures now in place, we will witness major progress in the next phase. For us as a Council in particular, we are focused on securing assent to our bill. By virtue of a government gazette, NSC to a large extent started performing its role as an economic regulator.

Now, could you give us an overview of your interaction with stakeholders in the sector and how they are cooperating with you in respect of this mandate that you have already undertaken so far? The Nigerian Port Economic Regulation of 2015 has remained our guiding document and the framework through which we currently execute our mandate.

I must acknowledge that stakeholders have demonstrated a genuine willingness to work collaboratively with us. Everyone recognizes that the sector is facing challenges, and no one is interested in sustaining these problems. Instead, stakeholders are focused on protecting their investments and ensuring profitability. So far, engagements with stakeholders have been smooth.

We have not encountered any major issues, and shippers’ associations across the country have fully cooperated with us. I am pleased to note that we have introduced certain policies, and stakeholders have promptly adjusted to them. This level of responsiveness has contributed to a healthy working relationship as we move forward. We all understand that the more reformed and efficient the sector becomes, the better it is for every player operating within it.

Today, the shipping sector has become one of the most attractive areas of employment, offering a minimum wage of over ₦200,000 a standard negotiated by the Council. While this wage structure has existed for over two decades, it is important to emphasize that achieving and sustaining this milestone would have been impossible without the active support and contributions of stakeholders.

To what extent are the various government agencies in the sector, especially those not in the same ministry with you, are keying into your reforms, and to what extent have you also modernized your operations to be in tandem with global best practices, talking about national single window and port community system?

Most of these interventions and reforms are still ongoing. Within the Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy, the traditional agencies that everyone is familiar with have now been fully integrated into the ministry’s policy framework.

As a result, challenges related to collaboration and coordination have significantly reduced, as the ministry now maintains firm oversight and alignment across its agencies. Today, the ministry hosts a wider range of agencies than before, including those moved from other ministries.

However, the maritime ecosystem still intersects with numerous ministries. For example, as a Council, we promote an intermodal transport system, which cannot be achieved without engaging the Ministry of Transportation. Over the years, the Council has signed various Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with agencies located in other ministries.

One such MoU exists with the Nigerian Railway Corporation, designed to ensure a harmonious working relationship and to promote key services within the sector. Specifically, this MoU guides cooperation between the Nigerian Shippers’ Council and the Nigerian Railway Corporation on cost structuring and ensures that shippers are not shortchanged when using the rail system recognizing that rail remains the most efficient and cost effective means of cargo movement across the country.

Similar agreements exist with other agencies across different ministries. The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) is also a major stakeholder in the country’s maritime structure, and we maintain an excellent and robust working relationship with them. As a Council, our guiding principle has always been to advocate for cooperation with every stakeholder, because collectively we are executing the mandate of Mr. President, as provided under Section 5 of the 1999 Constitution.

Can we have a measurable projection in respect to the Nigerian Port Economic Regulatory Bill? What are the immediate, medium, and long-term gains that we expect from that bill if signed into law?

In the medium term, we will see a surge in investment as investor confidence increases. Predictability both in regulation and in return on investment is a key factor for investors, especially in a sector as capitalintensive as the port and shipping industry. Investments here require significant financial commitments, and investors must be certain that the regulatory environment will remain stable.

They need assurance that policies and laws will not suddenly shift in ways that could negatively affect their investments. Without this clarity and predictability, no serious investor will commit substantial funds to such a sensitive and high-cost sector. In the long term, Nigeria will begin to fully integrate into the global maritime community.

Our processes would have been streamlined and key systems such as the cargo tracking note, the port community system, and the National Single Window will be fully operational. Together with a solid regulatory framework, these systems will create a modern and efficient maritime environment. At that point, Nigeria will truly stand out as a maritime nation of repute, recognized globally for its efficiency, competitiveness, and regulatory strength.

Can you give us an insight into the Truck Transit Park that has been promoted by the Nigerian Shippers Council, a brief into what the geographical spread is, project completion, and their contribution to the good and growth of the Nigerian economy, particularly the logistics sector?

Nigeria is a country located in West Africa, and across the continent from North Africa to West, Central, and Southern Africa you find port infrastructures spread widely. As the most populous nation on the continent, Nigeria remains a country the rest of Africa looks up to, even though they are not waiting for us. Several African nations are already making deliberate efforts to develop their maritime infrastructure, especially in the area of logistics.

Nigeria is not entirely behind, but we are behind to an extent, particularly because Africa expects us to take the lead in developing logistics infrastructure. At the Nigerian Shippers’ Council, we have carefully studied these infrastructural gaps and what is needed to address them.

Today, we have developed two important maps, one covering the entire African continent. It highlights the distribution of critical maritime infrastructure, especially those linked to logistics. Under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), it is evident that one of the biggest challenges will be maritime logistics. Connecting African countries remains extremely difficult.

For example, a vessel carrying cargo from Nigeria to Ghana may first go to Europe before returning to Ghana. This is inefficient and time consuming, underscoring the urgent need for proper African connectivity. A key challenge is that most African countries are not ship owning nations.

They lease vessels, and these vessels operate on predetermined routes that cannot easily be altered to create direct African shipping lanes. That is the crux of the problem. Bringing it back home, we examined logistics supporting infrastructure and concluded that, as a Council, we must promote the development of Inland Dry Ports, Transit Parks, Border Facilities, and similar structures.

These will support the movement of Transit Cargo from the hinterlands to the seaports and bring shipping services closer to shippers across the country. Regarding inland dry ports, we have several legacy projects. When Mr. President assumed office, he pushed for the completion of the nearly finished Funtua Inland Dry Port.

Currently, the operational dry ports are mainly in the north-western region, Kano, Kaduna, and Katsina. Others exist across the country, but their progress has been slow. We are working with state governments to accelerate their completion.

In Borno State, for instance, a privately developed inland dry port has been established. We are now engaging stakeholders to fast-track its completion so that it can be commissioned during the second half of the President’s tenure.

The Governor of Borno State is particularly committed to achieving this. For Vehicle Transit Parks, one of the major issues you raised, we observed that many road accidents are caused by driver fatigue. Drivers travel long hours without rest, leading to fatal accidents.

To address this, we began promoting the establishment of Vehicle Transit Parks. These parks are not only rest stops; they will also serve as economic hubs where drivers can relax, refresh, and secure their cargo. Rather than parking in unsafe roadside areas where goods can be stolen or damaged, drivers will have safe, secure, and well equipped facilities.",https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-14-090000.png,N,,2025-12-14 23:56:20.544710

These risks include potential tariff-related escalation; other protectionism-driven tensions such as port fees; the possible resumption of Red Sea transits; a potential conflict in Venezuela; and increasing competition for control of shipping value chains.
The rise in tonne-miles related to oil exports from Russia, and Red Sea disruption has kept overall demand for tankers high.

These risks include potential tariff-related escalation; other protectionism-driven tensions such as port fees; the possible resumption of Red Sea transits; a potential conflict in Venezuela; and increasing competition for control of shipping value chains.

We expect container-shipping performance to weaken in 2026, according to Global Shipping Outlook 2026, as lower freight rates resulting from a weakened supply-demand balance will lead to lower profits, alongside the risk to freight rates from a potential resumption of Red Sea transits. We expect regional variations, with container trade to North America remaining particularly weak compared with other regions.

The container order book, at about 30% of the existing fleet, is at its highest level in more than 10 years. This reflects continuing new orders to replace ageing fleets and to upgrade vessels to multi‑fuel capability to meet emissions‑reduction targets, as well as capacity growth. As a result, we expect supply to exceed demand; however, we also expect partial mitigation through increased fleet idling (from about 1% currently), blank sailings, scrapping and slow steaming.

Tankers should continue to perform well, particularly crude tankers, due to growth in end demand and tonne-miles. Seaborne oil trade grew in 2025 due to higher production by OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers, leading to about a 3% supply increase, with the same expected in 2026. The rise in tonne-miles related to oil exports from Russia, and Red Sea disruption has kept overall demand for tankers high.

We expect weak performance in the dry-bulk segment but volumes should be stable year on year. Order books remain healthy, at close to 11% and 16% of the existing fleet for dry bulk and tankers, respectively, which are needed to replace the ageing fleets. Further significant growth is limited by the shortage of yard slots for new orders over the next three years.

We expect performance across other segments, such as liquefied natural gas shipping and car carriers, to remain broadly stable.

A further increase in trade protectionism could also alter trade flows and limit demand for certain high-margin or critical products in the medium term. Some new trade lanes could strengthen to offset those more affected by tariffs, but we believe protectionism is overall negative for the shipping industry.

Emissions regulations have developed further and there is better visibility over the International Maritime Organisation’s longer-term plan through the Net-Zero framework, although it is yet to be approved. These regulatory developments are likely to put pressure on shipping companies’ margins in the medium term, and the extent of pass-through is not yet known.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Global_Shipping_and_Demand.png,N,,2025-12-12 23:31:04.567637

The world economy is shifting, and the political and legal clarity that the Paris Agreement consensus provided is at the root of this transformation.

What do we need from the next ten years to complete the job?

Not enough, but far better

That global emissions are still edging up hides half the story. Emissions are growing far more slowly than in the decade before Paris and China’s emissions have been flat or declining since 2024. Clean energy investment is at record levels and now outpaces fossil fuel investment by roughly two to one after reaching parity six years ago. Electrotech is driving growth in major economies and with renewable energy the cheapest and fastest energy source to deploy, non‑fossil sources already provide over 41% of the global energy mix. In 2015, we all predicted this scale of change would take until the mid‑2030s.

The world economy is shifting, and the political and legal clarity that the Paris Agreement consensus provided is at the root of this transformation. The latest round of national climate plans, the crux of the Paris Agreement architecture, still adds up to a pathway of 2.3-2.5 degrees of warming, but they do represent plans that will see emissions drop by at least 12% on 2019 levels by 2035. Countries just agreed in Belém that they should continue ramping up that ambition and – critically – develop implementation and investment plans to make sure it’s delivered. But the overwhelming message from commentators and analysts in response to the Belem COP30 result was “failure”.

Is there a future in which the shaky ground of multilateral cooperation can get us onto that 1.5C warming limit pathway? And are COPs the “least-worst system”, as the UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband put it, to get there?

Politics in a “down phase”, trajectory still up

Politically, the last decade has been anything but linear. There have been high points – the adoption of the Paris rulebook, the net zero pledging bonanza of COP26, the first mention of fossil fuels in a globally agreed climate decision, the tripling‑renewables and doubling‑efficiency goals, and the launch of loss and damage funding arrangements. There have also been very visible setbacks, including major emitters backtracking, growing climate polarisation and heavily contested COP outcomes. This ebb and flow is one we have become accustomed to.

But the trajectory of climate action has remained upwards. Since 2015, climate framework laws have more than tripled, climate policy instruments have increased roughly seven‑fold and around three‑quarters of global GDP (rising to just over four‑fifths including sub‑national pledges) remains covered by some form of net‑zero target, even after the retreat of the US federal goal.

Our political “down” phase today is complicated by a more difficult and different geopolitical environment. Climate diplomacy now unfolds amid wars, deepening strategic rivalry, reshoring of supply chains, and intensified competition over critical minerals and industrial policy. International cooperation is shifting away from multilateral frameworks towards a more explicitly bilateral and transactional model, centred on packages of energy, infrastructure and security deals. This direction is reflected in ACS2 outcomes, the EU’s revamped Global Gateway strategy (and, in its extreme version, the latest US national security strategy.). While this can leave space for mutual interest, investment and agency for partner countries, it also risks shortening political time horizons, fragmenting standards and weakening incentives to invest in governance and social safeguards.

The future of the COP space

Against this backdrop, frustration with the COP process is understandable. The system is overloaded. The expectations are enormous. And we are still far from where science – and people on the frontline of climate impacts – say we need to be. Fossil fuel subsidies remain pervasive while adaptation and loss –and damage support lag, deepening existing inequalities, with disproportionate burdens on low-income households, marginalised communities and workers in carbon-intensive sectors.

We are right to question whether COPs are the right place to address this crisis. But COPs are not sentient actors that “fail” or “succeed” on their own. They are (precious) political and institutional spaces that deliver only what governments, institutions and societies choose to invest in them – in terms of ambition, negotiating capital and implementation capacity.

Big results like the Paris Agreement demand a huge diplomatic lift and just the right convergence of political conditions, that are clearly not in place now (as the latest IMO talks on shipping emissions showed). Fortunately, we don’t need another Paris Agreement moment. We have a permanent global architecture with five yearly cycles of countries sharing their nationally determined climate plans followed by collective global stocktakes and an ‘Action Agenda’ for driving the action of non-state actors like businesses and city governments.

The climate ambitious are already evolving how they use the COP space, adapting to the new mission for implementation. Recent years have seen coalitions of the willing on issues such as grids, storage and methane effectively compel Presidencies to create room for outcome documents, roadmaps and Presidency‑led initiatives that go beyond the minimum consensus text. The fossil fuel transition roadmap and pledges launched alongside the formal COP30 decisions follow this trend. This model could become a disciplined tool for implementation, if it can transform layers of pledges into actual policy frameworks.

Designing the next phase of climate governance in a new world order

The bigger test is whether these new COP tools can stand up to our evolving geopolitical landscape. This will require addressing the material constraints facing most of the world, above all debt and access to capital. For many emerging and developing economies, climate ambition is constrained not by lack of plans or ambition but by high borrowing costs, limited fiscal space and inadequate volumes of concessional and grant finance. It will also depend on finding ways to integrate trade, industrial and climate governance. A fossil fuel transition roadmap, for example, would need to convince states that they will have routes to prosperity outside their fossil fuel extraction models: clearly addressing the risks and providing economic feasible alternatives backed by international financial tools to enable them. A big ask in a geopolitical maelstrom.

Nonetheless, the entry into force of the UN High Seas Treaty in 2025 shows that states can still agree ambitious rules for protecting global commons even in a period of heightened international tension. Currently, major countries from the Global South are openly pushing back against anti-multilateral approaches to climate and energy, arguing instead for an international order based on shared rules rather than bilateral power-plays. Indonesian President Probowo’s UN General Assembly speech rallied a defense of multilateralism in stark contrast to US President Trump’s tirade. At April’s IEA Energy Security Conference, the US’ push to resurrect the fossil economy was met with defiance from energy transition allies. The evolving geopolitical order is not yet doomed to a fortress world.

The biggest strategic question for the next ten years is thus whether climate cooperation can become a structuring element of a new global order, rather than a casualty of its disorder. Can west, east and south define a shared floor of responsibility and support, even as they compete on technology and industrial capacity?",https://eccoclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54908710444_2ba9a0ed18_c.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:56:42.191315

Request for an international livestock carrier code The letter urges the IMO to develop an international Code for the Carriage of Livestock.","On 5 December, a coalition of animal welfare organizations issued a letter to the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), asking for an improved regulatory framework on livestock carriers.

The signatories call for urgent action to address safety, welfare and environmental risks linked to the global livestock carrier fleet. They note that vessels in this sector average 40 years of age, far beyond typical safe operating life. Many ships are conversions of older vessels, vulnerable to corrosion from constant exposure to effluent, and linked to a long record of casualties involving both seafarers and animals.

Recent tragedies, including losses such as Gulf Livestock 1, Haidar and Queen Hind, are cited in the letter as evidence of systemic failings.

Concerns over weak oversight and regulatory gaps

The letter highlights recurring problems with ships operating under black and grey-listed flags, often associated with poor enforcement of MARPOL requirements, substandard safety equipment and inadequate working conditions.

Since existing IMO conventions do not address livestock-specific risks, issues such as ventilation, waste and carcass management, structural integrity and animal welfare remain largely unregulated.

The signatories report that untreated waste and dead animals are routinely discharged at sea, creating environmental and public health risks in Special Areas including the Mediterranean and Red Seas.

Animal welfare and crew wellbeing issues

According to the organisations, the absence of targeted regulation results in predictable animal welfare problems. These include heat stress, overcrowding, disease and prolonged exposure to waste during voyages lasting several weeks.

Crew members face heightened risks from unsafe working environments, close interactions with large animals, exposure to pathogens and the collapse of corroded decks.

Insurers and the International Transport Workers’ Federation report chronic financial instability across the sector, along with a disproportionate number of abandoned crews and high rates of port detentions.

Shift toward alternatives and call for action

The signatories point out that several exporting countries, including New Zealand, India, Australia and the United Kingdom, have adopted or announced bans or phaseouts of live animal exports.

These developments reflect increasing recognition of the risks associated with the trade. Despite this, about 110 livestock carriers remain active, many nearing the end of their usable lifespan, raising concerns about future incidents without coordinated international intervention.

Request for an international livestock carrier code

The letter urges the IMO to develop an international Code for the Carriage of Livestock. The signatories note that other high-risk cargo sectors are governed by specialized IMO codes. By contrast, the transport of millions of live animals each year is covered only by general shipping provisions that were not designed for this purpose.

As noted by the organizations, a dedicated code is necessary to protect seafarers, safeguard the marine environment and improve the welfare of animals transported by sea.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2446795825-e1765532543863.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 23:10:08.049157

Di Gilpin, whose company has trialed wing sails and digital performance models, argued wind should not be shoe-horned into a narrow “energy efficiency” box.
If you talk about primary energy transition, it’s more attractive to investors … Di Gilpin noted.
“One of the big problems in the wind propulsion market is overpromising on the impact and savings,” the panel heard.
Bottom line The MarRI-UK webinar underlined that wind propulsion is no longer a fringe idea.","Wind propulsion is moving from novelty to considered climate solution, but its wider adoption hinges on clearer rules, trusted performance data, and joined-up commercial models, industry leaders told a MarRI-UK webinar on “Wind Propulsion Technology & the Maritime Market.”

Hosted by MarRI-UK and chaired by John Hudson, the session brought together Diane (Di) Gilpin, founder and CEO of Smart Green Shipping (SGS), Frank Hendrikse, Manager, Tanker department, Norway, Hagland Shipbrokers, and Camille Bourgeon of the IMO’s environment division. The conversation ranged from the practical, crew reaction and retrofit challenges, to regulatory and financing obstacles, and returned repeatedly to the need for robust, standardized performance measurement.

Regulatory uncertainty and the NZF pause

Speakers agreed that the recent delay to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) have added uncertainty that complicates investment decisions across the sector.

The extraordinary session of the marine environment protection committee was adjourned for a period of one year in October. Work continues in the meantime, but the market has uncertainty

… Bourgeon stressed, but acknowledged the impact of the adjournment.

Panelists warned that fragmented regional rules could damage the global market unless a global IMO framework resumes. Frank Hendrikse argued that worldwide regulation remains “critically important for an international industry” and urged a return to global consensus so that owners and financiers can plan with confidence.

The MEPC outcome is unfortunate, and the worst-case scenario is that regional markets and countries start having their own rules and restrictions. World shipping is a global business, so IMO regulations are very important. We sincerely hope this is only a short delay and that we can continue our work.

… said Frank Hendrikse.

Where wind fits in the metrics debate

One focal point was how wind propulsion should be treated within the IMO’s emerging greenhouse gas metrics, especially the Global Fuel Indicator (GFI) being developed under the NZF.

Bourgeon said the GFI workstream is “the right vehicle” to accommodate wind technologies, but that technical discussions are still needed to ensure the metric is technology-neutral and properly reflects wind’s contribution.

Di Gilpin, whose company has trialed wing sails and digital performance models, argued wind should not be shoe-horned into a narrow “energy efficiency” box. “Wind is an energy source in its own right,” she said, noting that classifying it only as efficiency can reduce investor appetite.

If you talk about energy efficiency, there’s a lower level of appetite. If you talk about primary energy transition, it’s more attractive to investors

… Di Gilpin noted.

Panelists also encouraged technical work on life-cycle assessment (LCA) and urged industry stakeholders to engage in the ongoing GFI and LCA guideline development so wind solutions are measured consistently and credibly.

Data, validation and the trust barrier

A recurring theme was the need for independent, standardized validation to counter past over-claiming about fuel savings. “One of the big problems in the wind propulsion market is overpromising on the impact and savings,” the panel heard.

Di Gilpin described SGS’s approach: developing digital twins and using ITTC-aligned sea trials to validate predictive models. “We can guarantee fuel-saving performance through our prediction tools,” she said, adding that validated models make it possible to underwrite leases and performance guarantees, a commercial arrangement SGS favors because it transfers lifetime risk away from shipowners.

Bourgeon noted IMO work to improve measurement guidance and called for more “exchange of experience” and willingness to share granular performance data so regulators, owners, and charterers can build confidence.

Segments, retrofits and crew acceptance

Speakers said wind technologies are being trialed across many sectors, but that uptake varies by segment and vessel design. Hendrikse suggested tankers and smaller dry cargo ships, where deck space and cargo operations are more flexible, may be early candidates, while large containerships pose tougher packaging challenges. “Container ships are more challenging,” he said, though feeder vessels and kites have been trialed.

The panel also contrasted retrofit versus newbuild approaches. Retrofitting is constrained by existing ship geometries and stability limits, Hendrikse observed, whereas newbuild designs can optimize hull form, superstructure, and engine sizing around sails or rotors, potentially lowering the incremental cost of wind systems.

On human factors, the webinar found skepticism often gives way to enthusiasm once crews see the systems in action. Gilpin recounted trials aboard a chartered ship, the Pacific Gribb, where initial reluctance turned to engagement within an hour of raising a wing.

Speakers recommended integrating wind-system scenarios into bridge simulators and flagging the forthcoming STCW training review as an opportunity to fold wind-propulsion competence into seafarer standards.

Financing, business models and standardization

Panelists stressed that policy and finance levers can accelerate adoption. Participants pointed to several enablers: a clear, internationally harmonized regulatory framework, standardized performance metrics (an IMO priority), and financing structures that align costs and benefits across owners, charterers, and cargo buyers.

Gilpin and Hendrikse both emphasized the importance of champions, offtakers, or investors willing to underwrite early projects, and practical contracting solutions that allocate risk and reward. Di described SGS’s leasing model, which keeps lifetime and maintenance risk off owners’ balance sheets, helping bridge the gap between early prototypes and commercial maturity.

Bourgeon highlighted IMO’s ongoing work on performance standardization for wind propulsion technologies and encouraged stakeholders to engage in technical discussions to ensure new tools and metrics reflect operational realities.

Bottom line

The MarRI-UK webinar underlined that wind propulsion is no longer a fringe idea. A growing pipeline of pilots, validated modeling tools, and engaged cargo owners is shifting wind into the realistic innovation category.

But panelists were clear that progress requires aligned metrics, transparent validation, and financing mechanisms that share risk across the value chain.

Can the US live with net zero? Shipping awaits an IMO deal it can believe in

The delay at IMO has left shipping publicly confident but privately pausing alternative-fuel investments

Aligning the framework with US LNG interests may be the price of a deal, or the path to one.

But can the industry really decarbonise the molecule over time? Bio- and e-LNG supply chains have yet to materialise at scale

Analysis

Can the IMO craft a climate deal that satisfies US energy interests without sacrificing real emissions cuts?

The companies aim to establish the first commercial-scale ship-to-ship methanol bunkering operations in the U.S. as the maritime industry seeks practical pathways to meet the IMO’s net-zero GHG emissions target by 2050.

Low-carbon methanol, including green methanol produced from renewable or bio-based sources, is being considered due to its handling characteristics at ambient temperature and pressure and its potential to reduce emissions.

ENEOS will explore procurement and supply of low-carbon methanol, including green methanol planned from the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy project in Louisiana through C2X, in which ENEOS holds an equity stake.

NYK Line will provide technical expertise based on its LNG bunkering experience.

SEACOR will apply its Jones Act operational capabilities and engineering resources, while ABS will deliver class and regulatory support for establishing methanol bunkering in the U.S.

The companies state that the initiative is intended to support a carbon-neutral future for maritime transport. No financial terms or timelines were disclosed.

Understanding the distinction between greenhouse gas intensity rules and energy efficiency requirements has become increasingly important.
Energy efficiency continues to provide the most immediate opportunities for meaningful emissions reduction.
This creates a more complete and accessible resource for shipowners facing tightening expectations and evolving compliance requirements.
Conclusion Shipping’s decarbonisation journey will benefit greatly from global alignment, yet the path to that alignment may take time.","THE recent failure to secure agreement on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework has created renewed uncertainty for shipowners at a moment when long-term clarity is needed. A global path was expected to guide investment decisions and support consistent planning. Without it, there is a heightened risk that shipowners may face rising costs as they attempt to comply with a complicated and still developing mix of national and regional measures.

In the absence of a unified approach, regions are pressing ahead with their own initiatives, each designed to address emissions in ways that reflect local priorities. Europe is already far advanced with EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime, while regulatory ideas are gaining momentum in Asia and Africa.

Although these initiatives share the intention of reducing emissions, they differ in scope, data requirements and cost structures. Shipowners trading across multiple areas must therefore prepare for obligations that may vary depending on where their vessels operate.

Understanding the distinction between greenhouse gas intensity rules and energy efficiency requirements has become increasingly important. The introduction of European measures highlighted how easily unplanned exposure can arise. Operators that call at European ports for only part of the year found that even short visits carried consequences they had not anticipated. With other regions exploring their own approaches, the challenge of forecasting how operational patterns influence compliance costs is becoming a central concern for owners.

Alongside regulatory questions, owners must assess which technological paths offer practical progress. LNG continues to be the preferred option for many newbuildings due to its maturity and established infrastructure. Methanol is attracting attention for retrofits, offering a more straightforward transition from traditional liquid fuels. Ammonia is also being explored, particularly for merchant vessels, although handling and safety considerations remain significant factors.

Energy efficiency continues to provide the most immediate opportunities for meaningful emissions reduction. Improvements in hydrodynamic design, propulsion systems and energy utilisation are already delivering measurable gains. Waste heat recovery, once mainly associated with newbuildings, is now being applied more widely to existing vessels. Battery systems and shore power connections are also becoming more common, providing options for reducing consumption without depending on future fuel availability.

A stronger partnership offering shipowners more than the sum of its parts

The passenger and cruise sectors have been early adopters of many energy efficiency and retrofit solutions. These ships present unique engineering challenges because of their dense machinery layouts and significant hotel loads. Foreship’s extensive experience in this segment, developed through thousands of projects, has produced practical insights that are increasingly valuable across the wider maritime industry. Lessons learnt from integrating new systems into constrained spaces and maintaining operational continuity translate directly to other vessel types.

RINA’s acquisition of Foreship has brought together deep expertise in the passenger and cruise sectors with comprehensive capabilities. This creates a more complete and accessible resource for shipowners facing tightening expectations and evolving compliance requirements. As regulation continues to evolve, the combined organisation offers shipowners practical engineering insight helping them assess their options with greater confidence at a time when environmental rules are shifting and compliance pathways are still taking shape.

Conclusion

Shipping’s decarbonisation journey will benefit greatly from global alignment, yet the path to that alignment may take time. Until then, owners must navigate a landscape that is still forming, shaped by regional initiatives and advancing technologies. Realistic, integrated guidance will be essential. By drawing on the combined strengths of RINA and Foreship, shipowners gain a more reliable foundation to manage uncertainty and prepare their fleets for a lower-carbon future.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/sponsored-content/2025-rina/marine-1-download-copy.png?rev=92c5eb6129574a54b616e9ee7d744ba5,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:14.880885

The shipments range from 17 antelopes, a rescued baboon, and 37 tons of art to a helmet that Michael Schumacher signed that same year

Singapore, December 8, 2025 – Parcels, planeloads, and packed shipping containers are what people typically associate with DHL Group, the world’s leading logistics provider. However, this only scratches the surface of what the company delivers throughout the year. Here are just five of the most extraordinary shipments the global market leader in logistics handled in 2025

151 Bear Sculptures on a Journey from Germany to Singapore

When art goes on tour: In June 2025, 151 life-sized bear sculptures embarked on a journey of about 10,000 kilometers from Wustermark near Berlin to Singapore. Crafted from weather-resistant fiberglass, each sculpture stands about two meters tall. Known as the “United Buddy Bears”, this colorful art project was launched in Berlin in 2002 to spread a message of peace and tolerance. Every bear is painted by an artist from a different country, symbolizing that nation’s culture and identity. DHL oversaw the secure transport of these valuable artworks. Weighing a total of 37 tons, the shipment was packed into eight sea containers, loaded by crane onto trucks, and transported to the Port of Hamburg. From there, the bears began their sea voyage to Singapore, where they were displayed for two months, continuing their mission of promoting international understanding.

USA to Kenya – Rare Antelopes Go Home

13,000 kilometers for survival: In February 2025, DHL transported 17 mountain bongo antelopes from a conservation center in Loxahatchee, Florida, to a wildlife sanctuary on the slopes of Mount Kenya, Africa’s second-highest peak. These animals are descendants of mountain bongos relocated from Kenya in the 1970s. Today, after decades of poaching, habitat loss, and forest degradation, the species is critically endangered, with fewer than 100 surviving in the wild. To ensure the Florida bongos’ safety and comfort on their journey, DHL provided a dedicated flight equipped with custom-built crates supplied by a wildlife protection organization. The animals received continuous care from a veterinarian and two bongo specialists. Their new sanctuary offers a secure environment where they can breed and thrive. Their offspring will one day return to the wild, reclaiming Mount Kenya’s forests as their natural home.

Across Continents, Signed by Legends – A Far-Traveled Helmet Meets Michael Schumacher

From Switzerland to Brazil, a helmet like no other embarked on a tour across continents in March 2025. On its journey, the helmet was signed by all 20 living Formula 1® world champions, becoming a unique piece of motorsport history. One signature was particularly moving: Michael Schumacher’s, the seven-time world champion who has withdrawn from public life since his severe skiing accident in 2013. His wife, Corinna, helped guide his hand to write his initials, “M.S.”, on the helmet – a gesture that resonated deeply with fans around the world. A replica of the helmet was later featured as a raffle prize to help fund the “Race Against Dementia” charity. Founded by three-time Formula 1® champion Sir Jackie Stewart, the organization funds research into prevention and treatments for dementia – a cause close to his heart after his wife’s diagnosis. Under strict security measures, DHL transported the helmet from Switzerland to the homes of multiple champions so they could add their signatures. The route included stops in Ibiza in Spain, London in the UK, and Brasília in Brazil.

Saving Saadoon – A Young Baboon Moves from the Middle East to East Africa

An unusual passenger boarded a DHL flight from Bahrain to Djibouti, East Africa, in November 2025 – Saadoon, a young male baboon. He was found abandoned and in critical condition in Bahrain in 2024, at just three months old, in a country where baboons are not native. Saadoon was a victim of illegal wildlife trade. After more than a year of intensive care by an animal welfare organization, he needed an environment suited to his species. Djibouti’s climate and ecosystem offered exactly that. DHL flew Saadoon from Muharraq in Bahrain to Djibouti airport, where he was transferred to a specialized refuge near Djibouti City. Custom boxes, veterinary oversight, and an accompanying animal welfare representative minimized stress during the flight. Now living in a sanctuary tailored to his needs, Saadoon shares a new home with a female baboon, essential for social bonding among these intelligent primates. His new surroundings give him a chance to adapt and, hopefully, live freely one day.

Paraguay to Peru – South America’s Iconic Club Football Trophy on the Move

In November 2025, DHL delivered the iconic trophy for the CONMEBOL Libertadores Final, South America’s most prestigious club football showdown. The journey began at CONMEBOL’s headquarters in Luque, Paraguay, and ended in Lima, Peru, where the decisive match took place on November 29. Standing alongside Europe’s UEFA Champions League, the CONMEBOL Libertadores brings together the best clubs from across South America, each chasing the ultimate prize and the privilege to represent the continent at the FIFA Club World Cup. Known for its electrifying atmosphere and passionate fans, the final is a sports highlight watched by millions worldwide. As CONMEBOL’s Official Logistics Partner, DHL ensured the trophy’s safe and timely arrival. Roughly one meter in height, it traveled in a custom metallic case with a special security lock and was handled exclusively with gloves to preserve its flawless shine. Even sealed inside the case, the trophy sparked excitement – fans who spotted it often gathered to snap photos and share the moment. This year, Flamengo of Rio de Janeiro claimed the trophy after an unforgettable all-Brazilian clash against Palmeiras of São Paulo.

The Green Pioneer was named one of TIME’s Best Inventions of 2025.

The conversion journey of its diesel-electric power system to dual-fuel ammonia started in 2022, on land, when Fortescue converted a four-stroke Cummins engine at is Perth testing facility in Western Australia.

“The Fortescue Green Pioneer is proof that safe, technical solutions for ammonia power engines exist” said Dr. Andrew Forrest, the Chairman of Fortescue back in 2024, and he has continued to push for “real zero” fossil-free operations on land and at sea.

Fortescue Shipping owns a fleet of eight conventionally powered Singapore-flagged very large ore carries as well as the Green Pioneer. Fortescue plans to retrofit all of its own ships with ammonia engines by 2030 and any newbuilds will feature ammonia engines.

Fortescue also charters in ships which contribute to the group’s Scope 3 emissions, the Net Zero target for which is 2040.

Fortescue has also developed a decarbonized mining approach. By 2030, the company’s mines will feature battery electric trucks, excavators and drills, autonomous vehicles, fast battery chargers for mobile mine equipment, and ore processing powered by wind and solar, supported by battery energy storage systems.

The company’s Green Metal project will use renewable energy and green hydrogen reduction technology to produce low emissions metal suitable for most global steel plants. Shipping semi-processed metal instead of the ore will also reduce shipping volumes with a consequential reduction on shipping emissions, supporting the company’s aim to reduce emissions intensity levels from shipping iron ore by 50% from 2021 levels by 2030.

The findings of a report, commissioned by Fortescue and published prior to COP30, support Forrest’s ambition, indicating that the world has reached a green tipping point. “Firmed renewable energy is now the cheapest form of energy in nearly every corner of the world.”

The economics of Real Zero are clear across three sectors, according to the research, which finds:

Heavy trucking (Europe): Battery-electric long-haul trucks are projected to reach cost parity with diesel equivalents by 2026 – a tipping point for zero-emission transport.

Fertilizer (India): By 2026, green ammonia for fertilizer production will carry only a marginal cost premium over grey ammonia (made from fossil fuel) in parts of India, and by 2030 will undercut grey ammonia in renewables-rich regions.

Steel (Japan): Green hydrogen-based steelmaking could be cheaper than fossil routes by the early 2030s – even sooner with modest carbon pricing – while scrap-based electric arc furnace production is already cost-competitive.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/source-fortescue-166287.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:37.884170

Lloyd’s Register (LR), EXMAR and the Belgian Federal Public Service (FPS) for Mobility and Transport have helped to develop interim guidelines to enable the safe use of ammonia cargo as fuel on gas carriers

The Belgium FPS Mobility and Transport, with support from LR and EXMAR, led work to secure an amendment to the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC Code) more than two years ago, removing restrictions previously preventing the consumption of ammonia cargo as fuel. The three stakeholders provided the initial draft of the Interim Guidelines to the IMO Correspondence Group considering the guidelines. Subsequent development involved cooperation with Member States in a Correspondence Group to ensure consensus.

The Guidelines were finalised during the IMO’s Sub-Committee on the Carriage of Cargoes and Containers (CCC 11) and are expected to be formally approved at MSC 111 in May 2026.

Ammonia has long been recognised for its potential as a zero-carbon fuel, but until recently ammonia cargo could not be used as fuel on gas carriers certified in accordance with the IGC Code. The new framework balances safety and flexibility, allowing shipowners and operators to move forward with ammonia-fuelled vessel designs under a recognised regulatory pathway.

Claudene Sharp-Patel, Global Technical Director, LR, said: “This collaboration shows what’s possible when industry leaders, regulators and technical experts come together to enable change. LR has been involved in ammonia-as-fuel projects from their earliest stages through to realisation. The deep knowledge and expertise we’ve developed directly benefit our clients as they look to decarbonise their fleets. Being part of this pioneering work reinforces LR’s position as a trusted advisor and innovation leader in the maritime energy transition.”

Kristof Coppé, Director Fleet Operations and Technical Business Development, EXMAR, said: “EXMAR’s journey toward ammonia as a marine fuel began in 2021, when our company received Approval in Principle from Lloyd’s Register for an ammonia-fuelled mid-size gas carrier. Using our own cargo as fuel has long been a strategic priority for EXMAR. A commitment previously demonstrated through our pioneering adoption of LPG as a propulsion fuel. Ammonia now marks the next step forward, offering the added benefit of reducing direct CO₂ emissions by up to 90 percent.

“Our close collaboration with Lloyd’s Register and FPS Mobility in Belgium has been instrumental throughout this process. Their support, particularly on the regulatory front, has been a cornerstone in advancing this project toward success.”

Nathalie Deleuze, Maritime Expert – Alternative Fuels at FPS Mobility and Transport of Belgium, said: “Decarbonisation is a key priority for Belgium. At the FPS Mobility and Transport, we’re committed to facilitating the shift toward alternative fuels. To make this happen, we combined our expertise in IMO processes with the technical know-how of pioneering Belgian shipowners and Lloyd’s Register. Together, we’re charting the course toward a cleaner future.”

LR’s Fuel for Thought: Ammonia gathers into one place the most relevant information on the use of ammonia in shipping, serving as a convenient reference for shipowners considering alternative fuel options for their fleets, and for maritime professionals seeking a deeper understanding of the zero-carbon transition. The report combines expertise from LR and other shipping knowledge leaders on topics including the current state of ammonia as a clean fuel, including its safety considerations, drivers for adoption, production and supply chain, and technology readiness.",,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:50.459070

Australian Energy Producers Chief Executive Samantha McCulloch said the decision reaffirms the essential role of natural gas to Australia’s energy security and the necessity for continued investment in new gas supply.
“Exploration is a critical first step in the discovery and development of new oil and gas resources needed to ensure Australia’s long-term energy security,” McCulloch said.","Australia’s Albanese Government has opened five new areas for bidding in the Otway Basin for offshore gas exploration to lower power prices, in order to ensure that the domestic industry has access to gas at affordable prices, the country’s Department of Industry, Science and Resources said Dec. 11.

The release of new areas follows a review of the process for making new offshore acreage available for exploration and extensive consultation with the industry and stakeholders, Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia Madeleine King said on the department’s website.

The development also follows an announcement by the Victorian Government on Dec. 10 to release petroleum exploration permits in the Otway and Gippsland basins.

“Exploration and new discoveries will play an important role in underpinning our energy needs and support Australian industry and households as we meet our net zero commitments,” King said.

“The release of new acreage supports our Future Gas Strategy and will help ensure Australians continue to have access to gas at affordable prices,” she added.

The Future Gas Strategy maps the Australian Government’s plan for how gas will support the country’s transition to net zero.

King said the new release areas, located in Commonwealth waters, have been designed to protect neighboring marine parks, with buffer zones established to safeguard marine park boundaries.

All projects will be required to meet strict environmental and emissions standards per usual processes, she said.

Public consultation on the nominated new areas will be open for eight weeks until Feb. 6, 2026, while applications for the exploration permits will close on June 30 next year, she said.

These new release areas have been agreed under the joint authority regime with the Victorian State Government. This offshore acreage complements South Australia’s and the Victorian State Government’s exploration programs, she added.

Releasing new acreage would help address the structural gas shortfalls forecast from 2029 by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the statement said, recognizing that tackling shortfalls is vital for manufacturers who require gas as a feedstock or as a heat source and cannot transition to alternatives in the short to medium term.

Industry welcomes move

In a separate statement on Dec. 11, the Australian Energy Producers said that it welcomed the release of new acreage.

Australian Energy Producers Chief Executive Samantha McCulloch said the decision reaffirms the essential role of natural gas to Australia’s energy security and the necessity for continued investment in new gas supply.

“Exploration is a critical first step in the discovery and development of new oil and gas resources needed to ensure Australia’s long-term energy security,” McCulloch said.

“Bringing new gas supply online sooner is the only sustainable solution to put downward pressure on prices,” she added.

In June, the Department of Industry, Science and Resources stated on its website that it was conducting a Gas Market Review in conjunction with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.

The review aims to examine the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism, the Gas Market Code and the Heads of Agreement with east coast LNG exporters, it said at the time.

“With the outcome of the gas market review expected to be announced shortly, we will continue to work with governments on measures to increase gas supply and ensure Australian homes and businesses have reliable and affordable energy,” McCulloch added.

Australia is among the world’s top LNG exporters, with market participants monitoring the country’s production prospects to determine global demand-supply balances and the impact on international prices of the fuel.

According to the Resources and Energy Quarterly report by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources earlier this year, Australia’s LNG export volumes are forecast to reach 82 million mt/year in the fiscal year 2026-27 (July-June), up from a forecast of 80 million mt/year in FY 2025-26.",,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:56.944358

The report finds that while ships are becoming more fuel-efficient, rising economic activity, longer trade routes, and structural fleet trends continue to offset these gains. Shipping represented roughly 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions in 2024—placing it on par with some G7 economies.

Container and Bulk Carriers Drive the Sector’s Footprint

Container ships and bulk carriers account for nearly half of global maritime CO₂ emissions. Over the five-year period, container ship emissions rose 14.7% while bulk carrier emissions increased 10.6%. The OECD attributes the spike largely to increased global trade volumes and higher transport intensity—tonne-miles growing faster than GDP.

Fleet characteristics also play a role. Vessels aged 20 years and older now number nearly 80,000 globally, up from about 70,000 in 2019, extending reliance on older, fossil-fueled hulls. Meanwhile, mega-containerships over 10,000 TEU now represent about 42% of the world’s container capacity. While these larger vessels offer better per-tonne fuel performance, they also lock in long-lived fossil infrastructure.

Efficiency Is Improving, but It’s Not Enough

The analysis uses a decomposition method to identify major forces influencing emissions. Fuel intensity—the fuel required per unit of nominal capacity—showed the strongest downward effect, indicating that ships are operating more efficiently due to slow steaming, operational improvements, and compliance with IMO’s Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). These regulatory shifts, however, have not significantly altered the sector’s fuel mix, which remains dominated by oil-based fuels despite growth in LNG and early adoption of methanol-ready designs.

Distance-driven emissions turned positive in the latter part of the period. Geopolitical disruptions—including Red Sea rerouting, Panama Canal constraints from drought, and altered trade flows following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—pushed vessels onto longer routes. This added millions of tonne-miles to global shipping activity and reduced the emissions benefits gained through efficiency.

Capacity utilization trends vary by region. Globally, underutilization has increased emissions by leaving more tonnage in operation than needed. In the OECD fleet, utilization improved slightly, exerting a modest downward effect.

Implications for Policy and the Maritime Transition

The OECD’s findings underscore the scale of the challenge facing the maritime sector as it works toward the IMO’s 2050 net-zero ambition and interim 2030 and 2040 reduction targets. Efficiency gains alone continue to be overtaken by market-driven factors—particularly the growth of global trade and rerouted maritime corridors.

Regulations entering force after 2024 will exert stronger pressure. The EU Emissions Trading System now applies to large ships entering European ports, and FuelEU Maritime will begin limiting the lifecycle carbon intensity of fuels. These measures are expected to push operators toward low-carbon fuels such as green methanol, ammonia, or advanced biofuels—pathways that E+E Leader reporting has shown carry both potential and sustainability risks.

For companies with maritime-linked supply chains, the report highlights rising exposure to carbon costs and route volatility. Many firms are already reevaluating procurement strategies, assessing the carbon intensity of shipping partners, and tracking whether carriers invest in alternative-fuel vessels.

The OECD’s analysis ultimately reinforces a key trend across the global transport sector: operational efficiency is improving, but structural patterns in trade, fleet composition, and fuel availability are determining emissions outcomes.

CATL states that since entering the shipping sector in 2017, it has delivered nearly 900 fully electric ships equipped with its battery systems.","CATL, which is primarily known until now for its EV batteries, sees significant future potential in expanding its offerings from land-based mobility to waterways. The company aims to provide the global shipping industry with a new green, intelligent and sustainable development path. CATL expects that battery-electric ships will soon be active not only on rivers, lakes and harbours, but on the oceans.

Su Yiyi, Head of CATL’s Marine Division, stated at Marintec China: “CATL’s marine business already covers inland rivers, lakes and coastal waters and is now evolving towards deep-sea applications. In the near future – possibly within the next three years – we will see fully electric ships on the open sea.”

Ships with a fragmented supplier system

According to CATL, the shipping industry currently faces a fundamental challenge: propulsion, energy supply and maintenance of a ship are typically managed by different partners, leading to coordination issues and unclear responsibilities. Additionally, battery-electric ships face high acquisition costs, a lack of energy infrastructure, range anxiety, complex water conditions and inconsistent technical standards.

These factors represent a major barrier to the large-scale adoption of zero-emission shipping. Moreover, technologies from road transport cannot simply be transferred to ships, as their development must account for extremely demanding conditions such as high humidity, salt spray, long operating hours and high power requirements.

CATL’s new complete solution for battery-electric ships

This is where CATL’s integrated “Ship-Shore-Cloud” solution comes into play. According to the company, it is a bespoke complete solution for the shipping industry, featuring seamless integration from onboard energy systems to landside charging and battery-swapping networks, and cloud-based intelligent management. This approach aims to eliminate the traditional weaknesses of the industry’s fragmented multi-supplier structures.

Onboard, the system integrates batteries, propulsion and intelligent navigation systems to ensure safe and stable operation. On land, a network of charging and battery-swapping stations, along with the “ship-battery separation” model, is designed to significantly reduce energy and cost risks.

CATL states that since entering the shipping sector in 2017, it has delivered nearly 900 fully electric ships equipped with its battery systems. One example is the excursion ship Yujian 77, which operates in Xiamen Bay and has already been featured by us. CATL is also proud of the Changjiang Sanxia 1, the world’s largest fully electric inland passenger ship, and the Qinggang Tug 1, China’s first hybrid tugboat. Additionally, with the Jining 6006, CATL has demonstrated that battery swapping for cargo ships is feasible.

The incident continues to serve as a case study for understanding how plastic pollution disperses across ocean currents.
Perishable cargo environmental footprint Refrigerated container losses present different environmental challenges, as demonstrated by recurring banana spills across European waters.
The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios.","The shipping industry's ongoing battle with container losses at sea reveals a complex web of environmental consequences and supply chain vulnerabilities that extend far beyond the initial moment cargo goes overboard.

Each year, thousands of containers slip into the ocean, transforming single shipping incidents into chronic pollution sources that persist for decades while simultaneously disrupting global trade networks.

The mechanics behind these losses combine natural forces with human and technical failures. Rough seas, high waves and strong winds create the immediate physical threat, particularly when containers are improperly stacked or inadequately lashed. Human factors including fatigue, poor communication and complacency during loading operations compound these risks, while mechanical issues such as valve failures or uneven weight distribution further exacerbate the problem.

Joe Kramek, President & CEO of the World Shipping Council (WSC) says: ""Even one container lost is one too many.”

Decades of marine plastic pollution

A February 1997 incident involving the Tokio Express, operating under Evergreen Marine's service at the time, demonstrates how a single container loss can become a long-term environmental liability. Hit by a large wave off the coast of Cornwall, the vessel lost 62 containers overboard, including one loaded with millions of Lego pieces.

The lost cargo has washed up for decades on beaches in Southwest England, making it one of the best-known examples of traceable marine plastic pollution. Many of the Lego pieces were ocean-themed items such as flippers and octopuses, providing marine scientists with valuable long-term data on plastic persistence and drift patterns.

The incident continues to serve as a case study for understanding how plastic pollution disperses across ocean currents. Beachcombers and researchers still document finds of these distinctive pieces, creating an ongoing record of marine debris movement.

The longevity of these plastic items in the marine environment highlights the persistent nature of polymer-based materials. This single container loss has generated decades of environmental impact and scientific observation.

Perishable cargo environmental footprint

Refrigerated container losses present different environmental challenges, as demonstrated by recurring banana spills across European waters.

On 15 November 2025, a vessel transporting bananas for major importers and retailers lost several containers in the English Channel, leading to large numbers of loose bananas, broken boxes and associated packaging washing up along parts of the UK coast.

While the fruit itself biodegrades, the long-term environmental burden comes from non-biodegradable elements such as plastic wrap, strapping, pallets, insulation and cooler foams that persist in marine environments. These materials fragment into microplastics over time, entering the food chain.

The visual impact of perishable cargo losses often generates significant public attention and media coverage. However, the less visible packaging materials create the more enduring pollution problem.

Refrigerated containers also contain coolants and insulation materials that can release harmful substances when compromised. The environmental footprint of these losses extends well beyond the organic cargo itself.

Industrial materials contaminating coastlines

Beyond consumer goods and perishables, industrial materials constitute some of the most severe marine pollution incidents.

The X-Press Pearl incident off Sri Lanka in 2021 released 70 to 75 billion plastic pellets, known as ""nurdles"", now considered one of the largest marine plastic spills in history. The ship was operated by X-Press Feeders and carried cargo for multiple chemical and polymer producers.

These tiny plastic pellets, the raw material for plastic manufacturing, spread rapidly across vast ocean areas and coastlines. Their small size makes recovery virtually impossible, and they persist indefinitely in marine ecosystems.

Other notable cases include consumer goods such as trainers, motorbikes, televisions, whisky and IKEA products arriving on beaches after container losses on major Asia-Europe and transpacific routes. Biobeads and industrial polymers have contaminated shorelines in the UK and elsewhere, creating pollution challenges that differ markedly from organic cargo losses.

The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios. Each material type requires different clean-up approaches and presents unique environmental risks.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/67d4c168c5d3f1fe3d45b35a36f722bd:d38a7b3e0c2c0929be02941b3ebacd31/gettyimages-1032544878.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 15:56:52.432224

The research shows a dramatic fall in pollution since the 2020 fuel sulphur limit came into effect.
Before the rule change in 2019, the average apparent fuel sulphur content (aFSC) across open Atlantic waters was around 3.03%.
The researchers from the Royal Society of Chemistry also looked at how shipping companies were adhering to new limits.
This illustrates the intricate fuel‑switching routines global shipping lines must manage, which impact both operational planning and cost efficiency.","A lot is expected of global trade nowadays when it comes to sustainability. That said, heavy freight is still widely regarded as a hard-to-abate sector.

Air and sea shipping are the main culprits here. While lorries are able to carry just a fraction of the loads of planes and boats, there are readily available electric alternatives to old school, fossil fuel-powered road vehicles.

Progress is well underway though, whether that's the development of sustainable aviation fuel or the kinds of biofuel or hydrogen that boats are experimenting with.

Regulations are being written to reflect and encourage this gradual transition too. When it comes to ships specifically, a new piece of research by the International Maritime Organization has sought to examine just how effective legislation is at the moment when it comes to nautical sustainability.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, the IMO's study is full of data that could prove crucial for how supply chain professionals understand the day-to-day impact of global fuel rules.

The report, which is titled SO₂ and NOₓ emissions from ships in North‑East Atlantic waters, sets out to measure sulphur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) directly, using aircraft and onshore sensors to sample exhaust plumes from 2019 to 2022.

This approach offers a more precise picture of emissions for a sector that operates largely beyond easy observation.

What kind of impact is tighter regulation having on shipping?

The research shows a dramatic fall in pollution since the 2020 fuel sulphur limit came into effect. Before the rule change in 2019, the average apparent fuel sulphur content (aFSC) across open Atlantic waters was around 3.03%.

By 2021, this had dropped to roughly 0.31%, and further declined to 0.25% by 2022.

Researchers concluded that “a nearly 10-fold decrease in the mean aFSC demonstrates the strong impact the International Maritime Organization regulation change in 2020 had on sulphur emissions from ships.”

The findings underline a smooth transition toward lower-sulphur fuels across the sector.

The study also gauged nitrogen oxide emissions, finding that the NOₓ/CO₂ ratio was significantly lower in ports than at sea, probably because ships rely on smaller auxiliary engines when docked – an operational factor with implications for port logistics and emission tracking.

How are companies complying with sustainable shipping restrictions?

The researchers from the Royal Society of Chemistry also looked at how shipping companies were adhering to new limits.

In 2019, before the new restrictions, eight of the 19 ships sampled surpassed the 3.5% sulphur threshold then in force.

By contrast, during 2021–2022, only five of the 78 ships tested were non‑compliant under the tougher 0.5% cap. This high level of compliance demonstrates the regulation’s effectiveness, although a small proportion of breaches remains.

Failure to comply still poses risks for supply chain stakeholders, ranging from shipment delays to reputational repercussions.

Collecting this evidence required complex operations, including flying an aircraft at altitudes as low as 30 metres to capture and analyse 130 ship exhaust plumes.

The finer details of the study

Within special environmental zones like the European Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA), stretching across the English Channel, the limits are even stricter. Average sulphur content in these waters was measured at around 0.04%, well below the 0.1% ceiling.

Direct measurements enabled scientists to flag non‑compliant ships that computer models might miss. For example, one container vessel exceeded sulphur limits on the open sea but switched to cleaner fuel closer to shore within SECA boundaries.

This illustrates the intricate fuel‑switching routines global shipping lines must manage, which impact both operational planning and cost efficiency.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a0d4400bb489589df7433fda5bd66a6c:0d118856c8132941191580789cbe12e2/graphics-for-work-2025-12-10t172834-228.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:04.742795

U.S. support of the maritime fuel market will grow domestic business, creating new revenue for farmers, and strengthening rural economies.
The ABMI will highlight this underutilized opportunity as policymakers shape future U.S. production of maritime fuels,” said Patrick Serfass, Executive Director of ABC and co-chair of the Initiative.

For more information about biofuel and maritime market opportunities or to join this growing coalition, visit biofuelsformaritime.org or contact Jessica Bennett.","The American Biofuels Maritime Initiative (ABMI), a unified group of bioenergy stakeholders co-chaired by theRenewable Fuels Association and the American Biogas Council (ABC), announced its official launch today. The new group plans to work with President Trump’s Administration and Congress to establish strong policies that accelerate the use of American-made energy and biofuels in the global maritime sector – thereby establishing U.S. dominance in the future of international maritime shipping.

Adding biofuels such as ethanol, biomethane, bio-LNG, biodiesel, and renewable diesel, among others, to the existing maritime fuel portfolio can fill opportunity gaps and help shippers meet both their economic and environmental goals.

Maritime fuel policies and international frameworks are developing rapidly. Incentivizing the increased use of biofuels creates an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made energy produced from feedstocks grown in the United States like corn, sorghum, and soybeans, as well as the organic byproducts and farm waste from several domestic industries. The maritime sector represents a new opportunity to strongly position American farmers and fuel producers to lead in a developing market, leveraging existing infrastructure and encouraging new investments in energy and maritime sectors while enhancing the economic resilience of U.S. agriculture and rural communities.

ABMI will advocate for policies that expand market access for U.S. farmers and biofuel producers in maritime applications, and the advancement of technologies that deploy these advanced fuels, planning to work with the Trump Administration and Congress to establish the U.S. as a global leader in maritime fuels policy.

“Every day, America generates organic waste that should be turned into clean, domestic energy. U.S. support of the maritime fuel market will grow domestic business, creating new revenue for farmers, and strengthening rural economies. The ABMI will highlight this underutilized opportunity as policymakers shape future U.S. production of maritime fuels,” said Patrick Serfass, Executive Director of ABC and co-chair of the Initiative.

Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of RFA and ABMI co-chair, said: “The maritime sector represents an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made renewable fuels produced from crops grown across America’s heartland. U.S. ethanol is one of the lowest-cost alternative maritime fuels available at scale and represents an incredibly competitive option for the shipping industry worldwide.”

Thoughtfully crafted international frameworks and national policies can drive demand for U.S. agricultural and waste-derived fuels and therefore support American farmers, biofuel producers, and the rural communities that produce them.

This legislation is poised to transform India’s maritime sector by replacing the outdated Merchant Shipping Act of 1958. The urgency to pass the bill was marked by ongoing disruptions related to separate demands concerning electoral roll discussions in Bihar.

The new bill significantly updates the definition of “vessels,” expanding it to encompass various types of watercraft, including mobile offshore drilling units and submersibles. It allows for partial ownership of vessels by Indian citizens, corporations, and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs), subject to regulations that the central government will define. An important provision is the temporary registration of unregistered vessels intended for recycling in India, which is expected to invigorate recycling operations, particularly at hubs like Alang.

A key feature of the Merchant Shipping Bill is the empowerment of the Director-General to oversee maritime education and training. This measure aims to ensure that Indian seafarers receive quality education, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in the global maritime arena. Additionally, the bill mandates pollution prevention certificates for all vessels, aligning India’s regulations with international standards by incorporating treaties such as MARPOL and the Wreck Removal Convention. This aims to reinforce environmental protection within the industry.

The bill further addresses ownership criteria, thereby enhancing India’s shipping capabilities and fleet size, which could position Indian shipping companies to compete effectively on a global scale. Moreover, the legislation aligns with international maritime labor standards, establishes a certification system for Indian seafarers, and ensures access to social security, thus fostering improved welfare and working conditions for seafarers.

Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal, highlighted that the global maritime industry has witnessed notable changes in recent years, creating challenges that necessitated reforms in the outdated 1958 act. The adjustments in ownership and the revamped regulatory framework aim to modernize the maritime sector, boost competitiveness, and align with international benchmarks to meet evolving demands.

In conclusion, the Merchant Shipping Bill, 2024, represents a substantial leap towards modernizing India’s maritime landscape. Its comprehensive provisions emphasize safety, security, sustainability, and the economic potential of the maritime industry, promising growth and better social welfare outcomes. This legislation is positioned to enhance India’s role in global maritime trade and bolster the industry’s overall effectiveness.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lok-Sabha-Approves-Merchant-Shipping-Bill-2024-Maritime-Revolution.webp.webp,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:15.332516

According to Reuters, oil prices rose after the announcement about the oil tanker.","The US has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, says US president Donald Trump, according to the Reuters news agency.

“We have just seized a tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a very large tanker, very large, the largest ever, in fact, and other things are happening too,” Trump said.

Reuters reports that the seizure has caused oil prices to rise and is likely to increase political tensions between the US and Venezuela.

Trump has ordered a massive build-up of US military presence in Latin America. Recently, fighter jets and tens of thousands of US soldiers have been sent to the region.

The seizure of the oil tanker – a VLCC supertanker – may be a sign that the US will start targeting Venezuela’s oil, which is the country’s main source of income, Reuters writes.

According to the US media outlet CNN, Trump did not elaborate on the reason for the seizure. The president simply stated that it took place “for a very good reason.”

He was also asked what would happen to the oil that the tanker was transporting.

“We’re keeping it, I think,” Trump replied, according to CNN.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi also reported on the incident after Trump’s announcement on social media.

She stated that the seizure was carried out by the FBI, the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) police unit, and the US Coast Guard.

Sanctioned oil

According to Bondi, they acted on a court order to seize the oil tanker. The minister claims it was used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.

“For several years, the oil tanker has been subject to US sanctions due to its involvement in an illegal oil transport network that supports foreign terrorist organizations,” Bondi writes.

British Vanguard, which deals with maritime risk assessments, has announced, according to Reuters, that the oil tanker “Skipper” is believed to have been seized off the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday.

However, it has not yet been officially confirmed by the US that it is the “Skipper.”

On Thursday night CET, Guyana’s maritime authorities said that the “Skipper” was carrying Venezuelan oil and was sailing under the Guyanese flag without being registered in Guyana.

Following Trump’s announcement, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro addressed his supporters in the capital Caracas, according to the AFP news agency.

“From Venezuela, we ask and demand an end to the illegal and brutal interventionism of the US government in Venezuela and in Latin America,” Maduro said.

According to Reuters, oil prices rose after the announcement about the oil tanker. The price of Brent oil rose 0.4% to USD 62.21 per barrel.

This mandate has triggered the most significant technological and financial upheaval the sector has ever faced. This article explores the core challenge—the decarbonization dilemma—focusing on the complex regulatory landscape (CII, ETS) and the intense, multi-fuel race to find viable, scalable, and safe ""green fuels."" We analyze the leading contenders—ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen—highlighting their pros, cons, and the colossal infrastructure investment required to power the future of global shipping.

The Green Fuel Race: Solving the Decarbonization Dilemma

The biggest hurdle is the ""decarbonization dilemma"": the need to commit billions to a specific fuel pathway without a guaranteed global supply or regulatory consensus. Currently, three contenders dominate the discussion:

1. Green Methanol 🟢

Pros: A well-understood liquid fuel that can be handled using near-conventional bunkering infrastructure. It offers a clear, immediate pathway for transitioning internal combustion engines.

Cons: Lower energy density than Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), meaning larger tanks are required, reducing cargo space. While it burns cleanly, it is highly toxic and its production must be verified as ""green"" (from biomass or renewable hydrogen) to meet climate goals.

2. Green Ammonia ( 🔵

Pros: Expected to be highly scalable and cost-effective as a carrier for hydrogen. It is considered a zero-carbon fuel at the point of combustion (no $\text{CO}_2$ emissions).

Cons: **Highly toxic** and corrosive, requiring extensive new safety protocols and material changes for engines and tanks. Its combustion can produce nitrous oxides ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$), a potent GHG, posing a serious environmental and technical challenge.

3. Green Hydrogen ⚪

Pros: A true zero-emission fuel (water is the only byproduct). Can be used in fuel cells, offering extremely high efficiency for smaller, shorter-distance vessels.

Cons: Requires cryogenic storage and has an extremely low energy density by volume, demanding massive tank sizes. The infrastructure for production, storage, and bunkering is virtually non-existent for deep-sea shipping.

Beyond the Tank: Technology and Operational Efficiency

Decarbonization involves more than just swapping fuels. Immediate and complementary steps are being taken to reduce energy demand and bridge the gap until green fuels are universally available.

Energy Saving Devices (ESDs): Technology such as propeller boss cap fins, air lubrication systems, and optimized hull coatings that physically reduce drag and improve hydrodynamic performance.

Wind-Assisted Propulsion (WAPs): The re-emergence of wind power using modern rotor sails or wing sails to supplement engine power, significantly reducing fuel consumption on long voyages.

Digital Optimization: Using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and advanced software for dynamic route optimization, predictive maintenance, and real-time performance monitoring to minimize fuel burn.

Conclusion: The Cost of Transition and the Path Forward

The journey to net-zero is characterized by immense capital expenditure: billions must be spent on new vessels, engine retrofits, and global bunkering infrastructure. This investment carries a ""first mover"" risk, but also offers a first-mover advantage in charter markets demanding green shipping solutions.

The industry consensus is moving toward a **multi-fuel future**, where different vessel types and trade routes will adopt the most suitable green fuel. Success hinges on unprecedented collaboration between energy producers, technology providers, regulators, and financiers to ensure safety, scalability, and ultimately, a viable, sustainable future for global trade.

“This tripartite agreement aims to advance carbon neutrality in global maritime transportation through the development of innovative propulsion systems.”

— Maritime Industry Experts, Busan Innovation Initiative

What Timeline Should Investors and Shippers Expect?

The consortium has entered the critical design and concept analysis phase, with commercial viability testing as the next major milestone. Full prototype development and real-world testing on demonstration vessels typically require 3-5 years in maritime R&D projects of this complexity.

International regulatory approval through IMO and national maritime authorities adds additional timeline considerations. However, the participation of Korean Register streamlines approval pathways. Early adoption could position HMM vessels and other compatible fleets as sustainability leaders within the shipping industry by 2028-2030.

In the above chart we have measured COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important.
So How Is COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' ROCE Trending?
Investors would be pleased with what's happening at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings.
COSCO SHIPPING Holdings does have some risks, we noticed we think you should know about.","What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings ( ) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for COSCO SHIPPING Holdings, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.11 = CN¥43b ÷ (CN¥500b - CN¥130b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025).

So, COSCO SHIPPING Holdings has an ROCE of 11%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 5.4% generated by the Shipping industry.

In the above chart we have measured COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free .

So How Is COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' ROCE Trending?

Investors would be pleased with what's happening at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 11%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 106%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.

The Key Takeaway

A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what COSCO SHIPPING Holdings has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 416% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.

Under the theme “Accelerating Action and Mobilizing All Actors to Conserve and Sustainably Use the Ocean,” the conference emphasized the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14), which targets life below water through a three-pronged Nice Ocean Action Plan.

The three main priorities of the conference included:

Completing multilateral processes related to the ocean.

Mobilizing financial resources for sustainable ocean initiatives.

Strengthening and disseminating marine science knowledge to improve policy-making.

A pivotal aspect of the UNOC was progress on the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty, adopted in 2023. This treaty is an international agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) aimed at conserving and sustainably utilizing marine biodiversity in international waters. Key components of the treaty involve establishing marine protected areas (MPAs), mandating environmental impact assessments for high-seas activities, regulating access to marine genetic resources, and providing capacity-building support to developing nations. The treaty aligns with global biodiversity goals, pushing for the protection of 30% of marine and coastal areas by 2030.

Despite 160 countries signing the BBNJ Treaty, only 56 have ratified it, with a requirement of 60 ratifications needed to initiate a 120-day countdown for it to become legally binding. Both India and the United States have not yet ratified it, with India in the process of doing so, and the U.S. still evaluating its position.

The conference acknowledged significant hurdles in advancing the BBNJ Treaty. Disputes over how to share benefits from marine genetic resources, lack of consensus on regulating extraction activities, and warnings about potential risks to ocean ecosystems and biodiversity are major challenges.

Several notable achievements were recorded at UNOC, including:

Financial Commitments: The European Commission pledged over €1 billion, with Germany, New Zealand, and other nations making substantial contributions towards ocean conservation and governance.

Expansion of Marine Protected Areas: French Polynesia committed to creating the world’s largest marine protected area, while Spain planned five new MPAs to protect a significant portion of its marine territory.

Global Coalitions and Initiatives: The conference saw the establishment of the High Ambition Coalition for a Quiet Ocean to address noise pollution and the One Ocean Finance process, which aims to secure funding from blue economy sectors.

In conclusion, the UNOC 2025 made headway in ocean protection through financial pledges, treaty advocacy, and the formation of coalitions, laying the groundwork for stronger governance of international waters and promoting sustainable practices in line with global biodiversity goals.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-10 19:56:08.306689

Future Maritime Leaders Eye Green Transition in Malaysia

Maritime students in Malaysia learned first-hand how climate action is reshaping the maritime sector during a youth event held in Johor Bahru (8 December).

The event, jointly organized by IMO's GreenVoyage2050 programme, the Malaysian Maritime Department (MMD) and the Netherlands Maritime University College (NMUC), brought together more than 60 university students and 30 maritime lecturers to discuss how shipping and ports are responding to global decarbonization efforts and how young professionals can contribute to these efforts.

The focus was on emerging career pathways and training requirements linked to low- and zero-emission fuels, port operations, digital solutions and sustainable maritime services. Participants also discussed Malaysia's role as a key maritime and logistics hub and the need for a skilled workforce to support the transition in line with the IMO 2023 GHG Strategy.

A key feature was a dialogue with Captain Emanuel, one of Malaysia's pioneering women Pilot Harbour Masters from the Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP). She offered insights into her daily responsibilities, leadership experience and the evolving skills required as the sector moves toward lower-emission operations.

""If you have a dream to work in the maritime sector, find role models, stay curious and keep working towards it. The industry is changing, and there is space for more women and young people to shape its future,"" Captain Emanuel told participants.

Her participation underscored the importance of visible role models in attracting more women to maritime careers.

Prof. Dato' Sri Dr. Captain Razali Yaacob, Founder & Executive Chairman from the Netherlands Maritime University College added: ""Connecting students with practitioners and current sustainability challenges helps them see the breadth of opportunities available in maritime careers today and the important role they can play in shaping the sector's future.""

The event was part of GreenVoyage2050's wider efforts to promote awareness, inclusivity and capacity-building in maritime decarbonization, ensuring young people are equipped to support the global transition to sustainable shipping.

This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.","Autonomous vessels are set to revolutionize the shipping industry, whereby they will gradually and eventually transform global maritime trade through advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensor technologies and remote operations. As traditional shipping faces ever-growing challenges - from aging fleets to rising safety concerns to ever-increasing environmental rules and regulations - autonomous ships offer a compelling solution that promises increased efficiency and safety whilst simultaneously reducing carbon emissions and operational costs.

Whereas fully unmanned ships remain on the horizon, 2025 marks a pivotal milestone as semi-autonomous ships enter practical commercial service, leveraging remote control centres and advanced AI-driven navigation to optimise routs, enhance situational awareness and mitigate human error. Supported by regulatory frameworks and rapid technological advancements, autonomous shipping is set to become a cornerstone of the maritime industry, ushering in a new era where intelligent machines and human oversight work cohesively to redefine how goods move across our oceans.

The IMO's involvement

For the past few years, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has already been laying the groundwork for the eventual widespread introduction of autonomous ships into the shipping industry. The aim of the IMO is to regulate new and advancing technologies through its framework, whereby they seek to balance the benefits from said technologies against concerns of security and safety, the impact on the environment and on the facilitation of international trade, the potential costs to the shipping industry and their impact on personnel, both onboard and on shore. IMO wants to ensure the framework regulating Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) keeps up the rapidly evolving technological developments.

Following the completion of the IMO's scoping exercise on MASS back in 2021, the main goal of which was to assess which existing IMO instruments could apply to ships of varying degrees of automation, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), through its 109th session, agreed to a revised roadmap for the development of an official MASS Code.

The scoping exercise covered four degrees of autonomy regarding MASS, these being:

1. Ships with automated processes and decision support systems. Seafarers are still present onboard to operate and control the ship's systems and functions. Certain operations may be automated and at times unsupervised, with seafarers onboard ready to take control in case of malfunctions or errors.

2. Remote-controlled ships with seafarers on board. The ship is controlled and operated from another location whereby seafarers are available onboard to take and operate the ship's systems and functions.

3. Remote-controlled ships without seafarers onboard. The ship is controlled from another location without the presence of the human element onboard.

4. Fully autonomous ships. The operating system of these ships would be able to make decisions and determine specific actions by itself.

The outcome of this scoping exercise highlighted a number of critical issues which were present across several of the IMO's instruments, whereby these involved the creation of MASS terminology and definitions, including an internationally agreed definition of MASS and clarification on the definitions of ""master"", ""crew"" and ""responsible person"", particularly in Degrees Three (remote-controlled ships) and Four (fully autonomous ships) as described earlier.

Other key issues identified included the need to address the functional and operational requirements of the remote-control station/centre and the possible designation of a remote operator as seafarer. Further potential gaps that were identified related to manual operations and alarms on the bridge, provisions related to actions by personnel such as firefighting, cargo stowage and securing, maintenance, search and rescue, watchkeeping and information required to be kept onboard for safe operation of the ship.

At the following session, at MSC 110, the abovementioned roadmap was fine-tuned and the committee agreed on the following milestones:

MSC 111 (scheduled for May 2026) will aim to finalise and adopt the non-mandatory MASS Code;

MSC 112 (scheduled for December 2026) will seek to develop a framework for the Experience-Building Phase (EBP) of MASS;

The IMO plans to kickstart development of the mandatory MASS Code in 2028, based on the non-mandatory MASS Code and results from the EBP;

By 1st July 2030 at the latest, the goal is to have widespread adoption of the mandatory MASS Code, whilst its entry into force is scheduled for 1st January 2032, at the earliest.

It is important to keep in mind that the non-mandatory MASS will merely act as a supplement to The International Convention on the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) and that its entry into force will not automatically relax any of the requirements as laid out under the latter. Exemptions from the requirements of SOLAS must be agreed upon by the flag State during the approval process of the non-mandatory MASS Code.

Key issues that are yet to be addressed are the roles and responsibilities of both the master and the remote operator, general questions surrounding liability and the onboard carriage of certificates. The IMO determined that its internal committees are to discuss these issues at future meetings before taking an official position on the way forward, seeing as this will affect the global shipping industry.

Benefits of autonomous ships

Autonomous ships offer significant operational advantages reducing human error, lowering crew-related costs and enhancing overall safety. One of the biggest achievements would be mitigation of human error, seeing as it is the cause behind 96% of all maritime incidents. The advanced AI and sensor systems onboard autonomous ships enable precise navigation and real-time hazard detection, which lead to fewer accidents, thus performing overall safer voyages.

Moreover, autonomous vessels optimize route planning and engine performance, ensuring improved fuel efficiency and reduced operating costs. The reduction, and eventual elimination of onboard crew requirements not only cuts costs of labour but also allows ships to be designed with more cargo space, further enhancing economic viability.

On the environmental front, autonomous ships contribute to cleaner maritime operations by minimizing fuel consumption through optimized navigation and the integration of alternative, low-emission fuels. These vessels are equipped with sophisticated monitoring systems that swiftly detect and mitigate environmental risks such as oil spills or leaks. By supporting smarter logistics and reducing unnecessary voyages, autonomous shipping plays a crucial role in meeting global decarbonization goals, ultimately fostering a safer and more sustainable maritime industry.

Autonomous ships, by virtue of their advanced automation and optimized operation, are estimated to significantly reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby aligning with European Union's (EU) stringent emission reduction targets, one of these being the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS).

EU ETS, which operates on a cap-and-trade principle, enables shipping companies buy and sell allowances for their emissions, meaning that autonomous vessels could benefit from lower allowance costs due to their cleaner operations. This creates an incentive for shipping operators to adopt MASS technologies, as the reduced emissions directly translate into fewer allowances needed and thus, lower compliance costs and aligning with the market-driven push towards a globally greener shipping sector.

Furthermore, the EU's ongoing integration of carbon removal technologies highlights a broader policy environment where innovations like MASS can contribute significantly to achieving ambitious net-zero goals while benefiting from and contributing to a sustainable, market-based climate policy system.

The pitfalls of autonomy

Autonomous ships, whilst offering revolutionary benefits, come with significant challenges that must be addressed to ensure their safe and reliable integration into the maritime industry. One of the foremost concerns is cybersecurity. These vessels, being heavily dependent on digital communication and automated control systems, are vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks.

Such breaches could disrupt navigation, impair situational awareness or even hijack control of the ship, potentially leading to collisions, environmental disasters or theft of cargo. Given the complexity of integrating operational technology with information technology systems, the security framework for autonomous ships requires robust design, continuous monitoring, and real-time anomaly detection to effectively mitigate these risks.

Operationally, autonomous vessels face technical and regulatory pitfalls. The reliability of AI in interpreting complex and unpredictable maritime environments remains a challenge, especially under adverse weather or congested port conditions. Additionally, the legal landscape has yet to fully catch up, with ambiguities surrounding insurance coverage and compliance with international maritime conventions.

The human element also plays a major role as the transition to autonomous operations confronts resistance from seafarers concerned about job security and highlights the need for new training paradigms for remote operators and shore-based personnel. Lastly, the high upfront investment costs and the infrastructural changes required to accommodate autonomous ships add layers of financial and logistical complexity that may slow widespread adoption. Overall, these challenges call for a cautious, phased implementation strategy coupled with ongoing technological innovation and international regulatory cooperation.

Conclusion

The rise of autonomous vessels represents a transformative leap for the shipping industry, bringing with it promises to enhance safety, efficiency and environmental sustainability whilst simultaneously reshaping fundamental operational standards and principles. Central to this evolution is the proactive role of the IMO in developing a comprehensive regulatory framework tailored to MASS.

With the IMO's ongoing efforts culminating in the forthcoming MASS Code, regulations are being crafted to address critical aspects such as navigation autonomy, safety management, liability and crew responsibilities both in remote and in fully autonomous operations. This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.

One of the IMO's principal goals is the commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by about 2050, in tandem with interim goals for reducing the carbon footprint in shipping.

Malaysia prioritises the adoption of low-carbon technology and fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), biofuels, and hydrogen, in order to accomplish fleet carbon reductions.

We seek to decrease our maritime carbon footprint by incentivising shipowners to retrofit vessels with energy-efficient designs and alternative propulsion systems, consequently complying with the IMO's Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and Carbon Intensity Indicator requirements.

As a key player in Southeast Asia's trade routes, Malaysia has the potential to leverage this role to align national policies with IMO objectives, therefore assuring sustainability, safety, and competitiveness in an evolving global shipping environment.

The upcoming Malaysia Maritime Masterplan 2026–2040, scheduled for launch next year, will serve as a framework for changing the nation's marine industry into a resilient, sustainable, and competitive structure.

From an academic perspective, the 2026–2040 framework represents our most concerted effort to synchronise maritime governance, infrastructure modernisation, and blue economy development.

It builds upon lessons learnt from the Malaysia Shipping Master Plan 2017–2022 (MSMP), which strengthened fleet competitiveness, promoted regulatory transparency, and cultivated maritime human capital.

While the MSMP achieved significant progress, challenges remained in ship financing, port integration, innovation adoption, and workforce sustainability, all of which are being addressed under the new masterplan.

The Maritime Masterplan integrates climate action and low-carbon initiatives into domestic shipping operations.

This not only aligns with IMO's environmental guidelines but also establishes Malaysia as a leader in sustainable shipping within Asean, attracting environmentally-aware multinational carriers and decreasing operational costs via enhanced efficiency.

Maritime safety is also among the fundamental objectives of the masterplan, with continuous initiatives aimed at accident prevention, piracy and robbery suppression, and the welfare of seafarers.

In order to stay competitive, Malaysia's plans emphasise digitalisation and trade facilitation to preserve its competitive advantage.

The masterplan emphasises human capital development, targeting the specialised training of maritime professionals in digital competencies, maritime cybersecurity, and sustainable operations, targeting the global deficit of proficient seafarers.

By cultivating a skilled workforce, Malaysia guarantees that its shipping industry stays adaptable in the face of technology challenges, like autonomous boats and AI-driven operations.

Malaysia's dedication to the Women in Maritime initiative is equally vital, aligning with the IMO's enduring goal of enhancing female representation within the industry.

We seek to develop a more diverse, innovative, and future-ready maritime workforce by enhancing educational opportunities, advancing leadership programmes and enacting gender-inclusive policies at work.

The masterplan advocates for the blue economy, utilising marine resources to foster sustainable development in sectors like aquaculture, offshore renewable energy, and tourism.

This comprehensive strategy fulfils IMO objectives and bolsters Malaysia's competitiveness by attracting foreign direct investment, generating employment, and augmenting its participation in global trade volumes.

With Malaysia's accession to the IMO Council, the launching of the Maritime Masterplan in 2026 is timely.

This comprehensive 15-year strategy outlines a framework for addressing issues such as geopolitical conflicts, climate change, and technology advancements, while leveraging opportunities in global commerce.

According to S&P Global Energy, the daily reference price for January deliveries to Western Europe (NWM), based on ex-ship (DES), is $8.787/mmBtu, representing a $0.45/mmBtu discount compared to the price at the TTF hub. Daily spot prices for LNG tankers remain at $130,000 for the Atlantic and $87,500 for the Pacific, according to Spark Commodities.

The declining price of gas will boost demand, but shipping company shares are dropping. One reason is the limited influence of spot rates on fleets mainly operating under long-term contracts.

The ratio of declining to rising companies from UPI was 12:9, with a median movement of -0.26%. Trading volume reached a record high.

Constituents

The declines were not significant, remaining below 2%, with many less than half a per cent. However, COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation (SS: 600026) experienced the most severe loss, falling by 5.3%. The price reached a support level amid increased volume, and the coming weeks will determine the next direction.

The second company with a loss beginning with a two is NYK Line (TSE: 9101). Here, the loss was 2.4%. Despite this decline, the share price remains above support, although only just.

Awilco LNG (OSE: ALNG) and Exmar (BSE: EXM) recorded almost identical losses, differing by one hundredth of a per cent. These were 1.37% and 1.38%, respectively. Nevertheless, Awilco seems to be poised for more significant growth for the second week in a row, while Exmar is moving sideways.

In percentage terms, further changes are not significant, but one group demonstrates a broader trend. This primarily involves the ongoing movement towards support levels of individual companies. This applies to MISC (KLSE: 3816), Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (TSE: 9104), “K” Line (TSE: 9107), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Shell (NYSE: SHEL).

Among the rising companies, New Fortress Energy (NYQ: NFE) once again led with a nearly 29% increase, while Korea Line Corporation (KRX: 005880) rose by almost 14%. KLC broke out of its sideways trend on very high volume and nearly reached the highest prices within its sideways trading range since the summer.

Adnoc L&S (ADX: ADNOCLS) rose nearly 5%, trying to sustain its growth trend after a correction.

Dynagas LNG Partners (NYSE: DLNG) made another attempt to rebound from support, rising 4.17%. It has not yet broken through the range.

Golar LNG (NYQ: GLNG) increased for the second consecutive week, returning to its previously broken support level. The rise was 3.6%.

Excelerate Energy (NYQ: EE) made a cautious attempt at growth, rising above the primary resistance zone, which is a price level that has not been sustained. The increase was 2.1%.

Nakilat (QSE: QGTS) remains in the support area but records a 0.5% growth.

The overall impression of the individual companies is therefore not negative, but they are on the cusp of change. However, strong fundamentals do not justify a long-term break through support levels; quite the opposite.

Crystal Ball

The late-summer rise was rejected, and UPI returned to its previous range, where it now trades. This area provides firm support. In the short term, we estimate a rise in volatility of UPI´s constituents.

Our outlook remains positive in the long term. Rising spot rates, the scrapping of steam vessels, and new liquefaction capacities push the sector higher.",,N,,2025-12-09 18:56:11.647196

The sector will also be affected by the lower GDP growth we expect across most major economies in 2026 compared to 2025, with downside risk from any correction in financial markets. A key event risk across shipping segments is a resumption of Red Sea transits leading to a reduction in tonne-mile demand, although there is limited visibility on this possible development

Tariff disputes have moderated expectations for volume growth, particularly for container shipping, in 2025 and 2026. The medium-term impact from protectionist measures remains difficult to quantify but should be negative overall. An increase in trade protectionism could also alter trade flows and limit demand for some high-margin or critical products over the medium term, although some new trade lanes could strengthen to offset those more affected by tariffs.

We expect container shipping performance to weaken in 2026 as lower freight rates resulting from weakened supply-demand balance will lead to lower profits in 2026.

The initiative aims to drive coordinated research, investment and deployment across industries with high emissions.

A Strategic Push for Hard-to-Abate Sectors

The roadmap focuses on sectors such as cement, power and steel—areas where emissions are difficult to reduce with conventional methods. By promoting CCUS, India aims to develop scalable solutions that can extract, utilise or store carbon dioxide generated from industrial and energy systems.

Government Funding and Institutional Support

Launched by the Principal Scientific Adviser Ajay Kumar Sood, the initiative will draw from the government’s ₹1 lakh crore Research, Development and Innovation funding pathways. This support is expected to accelerate breakthroughs and reduce technology-deployment timelines. Earlier this year, the government also announced five CCU testbeds in the cement sector to create a research cluster for industrial decarbonisation.

How CCUS Works and Global Debate

CCUS includes processes that separate CO₂, compress and transport it, and inject it into geological formations for permanent storage. Alternatively, captured CO₂ may be reused as feedstock for industrial products. While CCUS is widely viewed as essential for net-zero transitions, some experts warn it may prolong fossil fuel dependence and add greenhouse emissions if not deployed carefully.

Exam Oriented Facts

India launched its first national CCUS R&D roadmap in 2025.

The initiative supports the 2070 net-zero emissions target.

₹1 lakh crore RDI funding will accelerate CCUS technologies.

Five CCU testbeds were created earlier in the cement sector.

In general, the past few years have seen steadily growing interest in ethanol from the market. We always do our utmost to listen to these signals and had accordingly been carrying out the necessary design considerations, which has provided us with a solid technical foundation.

Shipping is becoming more complex, and Anglo-Eastern is responding with it. 2025 brought significant uncertainty, with changing regulations and tariffs being the biggest topics. Anglo-Eastern reflagged certain vessels in response to tariffs, though always at the owner’s discretion.

The company manages more than 50 dual-fuel vessels of various fuels, with 87 under newbuilding and project management. Highlights include Windcat Rotterdam (IMO: 9995337), a next-generation offshore support vessel, as well as the first wind-assisted aframax, Brands Hatch (IMO: 1034199), and two ammonia-ready newcastlemaxes.

In 2025, Anglo-Eastern launched Sustainability and Performance Services, combining environmental compliance and performance services to help owners, charterers and operators. It boasts that its tools have saved a combined 225,000 tonnes of fuel, or $135m.

Anglo-Eastern set a 2030 target for 30% of its officers to be promoted to management before turning 30, to speed up certifications earlier in their careers.

02 / Tommy Olofsen, OSM Thome

Norway’s OSM Thome heads into 2026 under the new leadership of group managing director Tommy Olofsen, following the retirement in November 2025 of chief executive Finn Amund Norbye.

The 2023 mega-merger of OSM Maritime Group and Singapore’s Thome Ship Management created a giant with more than 1,000 ships under management, employing some 30,000 seafarers, from 20 offices around the world.

Asset manager Oaktree, which bought into OSM Maritime Group in 2018, sold its stake to JP Morgan Asset Management in August. OSM founder Bjørn Tore Larsen and Skagerak Holding, owned by the Eek Thorstensen family that founded Thome, continue to have “significant ownership stakes” in OSM Thome.

03 / René Kofod-Olsen, V.Group

René Kofod-Olsen takes issue with calling V.Group a mere technical manager, preferring “global shipping services company”. What matters is not the number of ships under management, he says, but “the quality that we are delivering on those ships”.

That said, with 900 ships in its fleet — and sizeable services and digital divisions expected to stand on their own two feet — V.Group is in a good position.

Kofod-Olsen says scale is increasingly important in his business as the industry gets more complex. Shipmanagers running 50 or fewer ships are fighting an uphill battle, he warned in November 2025.

V.Group is working with tanker company International Seaways to make ships more female-friendly. Kofod-Olsen said diversity was a “must-win battle for the entire industry”.

04 / Jesper Kristensen, Synergy Marine

Jesper Kristensen joined as Synergy’s group chief executive in March, after 34 years at Unifeeder, and succeeding long-time leader Rajesh Unni.

Company highlights over the past 12 months included a carbon capture refit on an LR1 tanker, one of the first in its class, and converting a 30-year-old liquefied natural gas carrier into a modern floating storage and regasification unit.

The company is expanding into managing methanol-fuelled containerships for an Asian shipowner and formed a joint venture with a Norwegian operator of geared bulkers.

A sea training institute in India will open in 2026 with capacity for 500 trainees a year. The group also expects more consolidation among mid-tier managers as compliance, digital and ESG requirements intensify.

05 / Sebastian von Hardenberg, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement

Hamburg-based BSM strengthened its expertise in the LNG segment, when its LNG specialty arm Pronav took on management of the FSRU Turquoise P (IMO: 9823883) in the Aegean Sea near Izmir, Turkey.

BSM took on the first methanol vessel, has 50 ships with LNG engines, and announced it will manage the world’s first ammonia bunkering vessel.

It has six maritime training centres — the most recent opened in Ghana in August — as well as 10 shipmanagement centres and 28 crew service centres. The company employs 40,000 crew and 2,000 people on shore.

06 / Rajalingam Subramaniam, Fleet Management

Fleet Management is part of Hong Kong’s Caravel Group, led by commodity trading legend Harry Banga and his son Angad Banga.

2025 was its first year under managing director Rajalingam Subramaniam, who joined from Malaysian shipowner MISC in January.

It opened its first Athens office that month, and in March acquired the International Maritime Institute, a training centre in Noida, India. It is expanding in Japan and the Philippines, where it opened an enlarged crewing and training facility in the capital Manila.

The company has 620 ships under technical management (300 bulkers, 220 tankers and 100 containerships and PCTCS), with another 130 newbuildings in the pipeline.

07 / Mark O’Neil, Columbia

Columbia Group has expanded across its integrated maritime, logistics, leisure, and energy and offshore services platform in 2025.

The company got into the FuelEU Maritime pooling business through its EmissionsLink platform, hoping to capitalise on confusion over emissions rules — especially since the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework delay, which the company warned could lead to overlapping regional rules.

Columbia formed a JV in 2025 with Egypt’s Pan Marine Shipping Services, saying this will let it work more closely with local talent and institutions.

08 / Haakon Lenz, Wilhelmsen Ship Management

Norway’s Wilhelmsen Ship Management, celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2025, is now under the leadership of Haakon Lenz, following the retirement of chief executive Carl Schou.

The company has come a long way since it was born out of the Hong Kong liner service Barber Blue Seas in 1975.

Lenz has said having just over 300 vessels is about where the company needs to be, if it is to make the most of efficiencies while keeping in touch with customers and seafarers.

The company hopes to convince owners of the benefits of third-party shipmanagement by helping deal with more complicated regulations.

09 / Guo Jinkui, Seacon Shipping Group

China’s Seacon Shipping has continued to grow steadily, with notable progress in crew-only management in 2025. The company attributes this to enhanced crew training, especially for LNG and car carriers.

The company has also got into the ship leasing business, acquiring 40% of CIMC Xinde Leasing, and establishing the first FuelEU compliance pool in China.

Seacon says it has also recently developed a “Seacon-AI” model to enhance its capability and efficiency. Approval from the China Classification Society has also been gained for its new shipmanagement software platform.

10 / John Rowley, Wallem

Hong Kong-based Wallem celebrated 100 years of being based in the city, where it moved 22 years after its founding in Norway by shipbroker and agent Haakon ‘Typhoon’ Wallem in 1903.

Wallem plans to stick around in Hong Kong for another century by prioritising safety, quality and sustainable growth while adapting to technological changes and decarbonisation.

The company has been owned since 2006 by Tom Steckmest, the founder’s great-grandson, and Nigel Hill, Wallem’s current chairman.

A tightening global supply of trained seafarers could affect recruitment, increase operational costs and complicate the adoption of alternative fuels across the Cyprus-managed fleet.","The global shipping industry is facing an escalating human-resources crisis as more seafarers leave life at sea for work ashore, according to reporting by Paul Bartlett, who noted during a COP30 side-event titled ‘The Global Seafarer Emergency’ that the trend now threatens the safe operation of the fleet carrying more than 80 per cent of world trade.

Growing dissatisfaction among crews reflects a familiar list of pressures, bullying, discrimination, excessive working hours, fatigue, little or no shore leave and limited connectivity with family and friends.

In many cases, contracts are extended for months, contributing to sustained physical and psychological strain.

At the webinar, Lloyd’s Register Chief Marketing Officer Philippa Charlton said shipping underpins global trade across containers, dry and liquid cargo, and gases.

She added that the sector’s shift to low- and zero-carbon fuels requires extensive new training in methanol, ammonia and hydrogen for both new recruits and existing seafarers.

Lloyd’s Register Foundation Chief Executive Ruth Boumphrey outlined the scale of the challenge.

Around 1.9 million seafarers currently work on 112,500 merchant ships worldwide, with half coming from the Asia-Pacific region, 33 per cent from Europe and 4 per cent from Africa, while women account for just 1.3 per cent of the global workforce.

She also noted that 64 per cent have not received any training on decarbonisation or new fuels over the past two years. By 2030, an estimated 450,000 will require specialist training, rising to 800,000 thereafter.

Recent data elsewhere reinforce the seriousness of the situation.

The International Chamber of Shipping estimates the global seafaring workforce at 1,892,720, while a Drewry forecast points to a shortage of senior officers reaching 10 per cent by 2030 due to fleet expansion, early retirements and limited new entry.

Surveys also show deteriorating conditions: one 2025 study found 42 per cent of seafarers plan to retire early, with many reporting delayed or incomplete wage payments.

Meanwhile, the ITF recorded a 30 per cent surge in abandonment cases in 2025, with more than 2,286 seafarers stranded on 222 vessels.

A report by the Global Maritime Forum warned that labour shortages have reached a 17-year high, threatening the resilience of global supply chains.

Capt Stylianos Dimouleas, founder of Almi Tankers and a former seafarer, highlighted the pressures crews face during geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts.

Welfare and wellbeing, he said, must form part of management systems, adding that digital connectivity “is a right, not a benefit”.

He also noted that leadership and management training for senior officers helps strengthen safety culture across fleets.

The implications extend far beyond the ships themselves, particularly for countries with large maritime clusters.

Cyprus, one of the world’s top three ship-management hubs, relies heavily on internationally sourced seafarers to operate the vessels under its management.

According to the Chambers Global Practice Guide, Cyprus is the largest third-party ship-management centre in Europe.

More than 200 shipping-related companies are active on the island, employing around 55,000 seafarers worldwide. Recent financial data show ship-management revenues in Cyprus reached €978 million in the first half of 2025, with crew-related costs accounting for 66 per cent of total expenses, emphasising the industry’s dependence on an increasingly strained global workforce.

For Cyprus, whose maritime priorities will feature prominently during its EU Council Presidency in 2026, the growing labour drain at sea intersects directly with the sector’s decarbonisation and safety objectives.

A tightening global supply of trained seafarers could affect recruitment, increase operational costs and complicate the adoption of alternative fuels across the Cyprus-managed fleet.

Taken together, the accelerating exodus from seafaring, the widening training gap and the rise in abandonment cases demonstrate a sector under significant stress at a critical moment.",,N,,2025-12-09 06:56:10.035187

Looking ahead The one-year postponement offers maritime companies a window, but not a waiver.","A key global decarbonization milestone for maritime shipping has been postponed. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted during its October meeting to defer, opens new tab by one year a decision on the much-anticipated Net-Zero Framework, opens new tab, an industry-wide regulatory regime intended to require binding greenhouse-gas (GHG) standards and a global carbon pricing mechanism for shipping.

The delay leaves the shipping sector in regulatory limbo even as companies, investors, and insurers press ahead with net-zero goals. It also raises fresh questions for legal, commercial, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) teams about how to keep decarbonization strategies on track while expectations for formal regulation remain unsettled.

What the framework would have done

Although formal adoption has been pushed back, the framework previously negotiated by IMO member states remains a useful roadmap. Under the terms agreed in April 2025, the package would have introduced a dual system combining a fuel-intensity standard and a market-based compliance mechanism.

Ships of 5,000 gross tons and above, representing roughly 85% of global shipping emissions, would have been required to limit the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted per unit of energy. Vessels exceeding that threshold would either purchase Remedial Units (RUs) or pay a carbon fee, while ships outperforming the standard would earn Surplus Units (SUs) that could be banked or traded. Earlier drafts pegged the fees at about $100 per metric ton of CO2-equivalent for lower-tier breaches and $380 per ton for more severe noncompliance.

Revenues from those charges were slated to flow into a new IMO Net-Zero Fund, projected to raise $11–12 billion annually between 2028 and 2030. The fund would finance alternative fuel infrastructure, energy efficiency retrofits, and capacity building assistance for developing and small-island states.

The rule’s first compliance period was expected to begin around 2027 or 2028, giving the industry a limited window to adapt before obligations formally took effect.

Impacts of the delayed vote

The one-year postponement carries significant implications for maritime stakeholders, affecting investment timelines, compliance planning, and ESG accountability.

Alternative-fuel initiatives such as ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen bunkering depend on a predictable regulatory environment to attract capital and scale infrastructure. Without clear long-term rules in place, financing and deployment are likely to slow as investors reassess the commercial case for cleaner fuels.

For companies that had already begun preparing for the IMO framework, whether through carbon pricing models, fuel switch strategies, or contract revisions, the pause introduces uncertainty rather than relief. The underlying legal and operational architecture remains essential, but the absence of a firm regulatory anchor means planning must now account for a wider range of potential outcomes.

At the same time, ESG and litigation risks persist. Many carriers and logistics providers have set voluntary net-zero targets, and those commitments remain subject to investor scrutiny regardless of regulatory delays. If tangible progress lags behind public pledges, companies may face allegations of greenwashing or misrepresentation, particularly as disclosure standards tighten across jurisdictions.

The delay also increases the likelihood of regional fragmentation. In the absence of a single global standard, jurisdictions such as the European Union and the United Kingdom are advancing their own maritime carbon pricing systems, and others may follow. The resulting patchwork could complicate compliance for global operators and create uneven cost structures until an international framework is ultimately adopted.

What maritime stakeholders can do now

While the IMO finalizes its approach, maritime companies, financiers, and legal advisers can treat this interim period as a strategic window to strengthen compliance foundations, enhance operational resilience, and position themselves for long-term advantage in the event global rules do take effect. Stakeholders should focus in on the following areas.

Fuel strategy and contract readiness

Maritime companies should assess each vessel’s fuel intensity baseline, modeling alternative fuel scenarios and incorporating carbon compliance provisions into charterparties, ship management contracts, and fuel supply agreements. Clear terms on emissions liability, audit rights, and cost allocation will be critical as carbon performance becomes a defining commercial metric.

At the same time, early investment in low-carbon fuel partnerships (e.g., green ammonia, methanol, bio-LNG) and infrastructure projects can help operators manage future price volatility, mitigate regulatory risk, and secure a competitive advantage as the industry moves toward decarbonization.

Data monitoring and verification systems

Effective decarbonization requires rigor. Firms should consider deploying or upgrading emissions monitoring systems, fuel consumption analytics, voyage optimization software, and third-party verification protocols. Transparency will be a major target for investor and litigation scrutiny.

Disclosure, governance, and ESG alignment

Board-level oversight of climate strategy now overlaps directly with compliance risk. Legal teams should ensure that emissions and other ESG disclosures reflect credible transition pathways. Misstatements or overly optimistic timelines may expose firms to fiduciary duty or securities law claims.

Scenario planning and carbon price readiness

Even absent formal regulation, companies should stress-test multiple carbon price trajectories, fuel availability timelines, and compliance cost impacts. Legal counsel should prepare for a scenario in which IMO pricing reemerges in 2026 at higher levels than initially projected. Risk mitigation strategies may include hedging, alternative fuel leases, or early vessel retirement strategies.

Regional regimes and supply chain exposure

Firms should continue monitoring regional regimes and the demands of supply chain actors for low-carbon shipping services. Legal teams should evaluate risks of indirect exposure through charters with cargo owners, scope 3 disclosure obligations, and contractual carveouts for non-compliant vessels.

Transition opportunities and ESG takeaways

Although the framework delay is a setback for regulatory clarity, it does not change the decarbonization direction: The maritime shipping industry’s emissions matter, and ESG stakeholders are watching. Companies that continue advancing their transition plans now will be better positioned to meet investor expectations, secure financing, and shape the rules once they arrive.

Early movers stand to gain a distinct advantage by investing in alternative fuel access, low-carbon vessels, and fuel contract strategies that appeal to cargo owners and financiers. Proactively upgrading monitoring systems, contracts, and fuel arrangements can also reduce future stranded-asset risk and potential litigation exposure.

Additionally, demonstrating measurable progress through credible data, retrofits, and low-carbon commitments can help build stakeholder confidence, reinforce ESG credibility, and keep companies aligned with net-zero targets even before formal regulation takes effect.

Looking ahead

The one-year postponement offers maritime companies a window, but not a waiver. Stakeholders should treat this period not as a pause but as a preparation phase. The next IMO session (expected around October 2026) will likely revisit the framework. When that happens, the baseline for compliance may shift, meaning strategic readiness today will be key to risk mitigation in the future.

Legal, finance, and operations teams should synchronize efforts now on modeling scenarios, negotiating contracts, mapping fuel supply access, strengthening disclosure and governance, and ramping up efficiency programs.",,N,,2025-12-09 06:56:16.188289
