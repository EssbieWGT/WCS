By the end of Hong Kong Maritime Week, the city will have completed three LNG bunkering operations alongside cargo handling.
Hong Kong’s deep capital markets, record IPO activity, and strong green finance ecosystem make it uniquely placed to fund this transition.
Highlighting Hong Kong’s fintech strengths, Banga pointed to potential applications for stablecoins.","Speaking at the World Maritime Merchants Forum during Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025, Mr. Angad Banga, Chief Operating Officer of The Caravel Group, the parent company of Fleet Management Limited, and Chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners’ Association and Chairman of the Promotion and External Relations Committee of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board, called for urgent and coordinated investment to accelerate the maritime industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.

“If we wait for perfect clarity, we will lose ground,” Banga urged in his keynote address, “Unlocking Global Maritime Capital: Hong Kong’s Role in Leading the Green Transition”. He urged shipowners, regulators, and financiers to act decisively in the wake of the IMO’s recent postponement of its Net-Zero Framework. “This creates a leadership opportunity — and Hong Kong is ready to lead”.

Banga positioned Hong Kong as a gateway between China and the global market, combining its role as an international maritime hub and financial powerhouse to fund decarbonisation as well as explore innovative financial tools — from sustainability-linked loans to Stablecoins and the digital yuan — to drive the transition.

Infrastructure and Green Fuel Readiness

Hong Kong shipowners control nearly 10% of the global merchant fleet by deadweight tonnage, with four of the world’s top 10 ship management companies headquartered in the city. Banga reaffirmed Hong Kong’s push to expand capacity for alternative fuels — ammonia, methanol, hydrogen, biofuels, and LNG — supported by the Hong Kong Government’s Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering.

By the end of Hong Kong Maritime Week, the city will have completed three LNG bunkering operations alongside cargo handling.

“Our location in the Greater Bay Area, near Mainland China’s renewable fuel production hubs, gives us a unique advantage as one of the most practical and efficient green fuel supply centres,” he told delegates.

Financing the Transition

Hong Kong currently ranks third globally in the Global Financial Centres Index, just narrowly behind London and New York, and facilitates over 70% of global offshore RMB payments. In 2025 alone, 80 companies went public with a pipeline of 300, while companies raised nearly US$60 billion through IPOs, placements, convertibles, and exchangeable bond offerings.

Banga stressed that infrastructure must be matched by incentives and policy certainty to support early adopters and avoid stranded assets.

“Shipping is the backbone of global trade, and decarbonisation is creating new markets for fuels, technologies, and services — all of which require capital,” he said. Hong Kong’s deep capital markets, record IPO activity, and strong green finance ecosystem make it uniquely placed to fund this transition.

Policy Alignment and Global Leadership

Addressing the recent postponement of the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework, Banga warned that fragmented regulations such as CII, EEXI, EU ETS, and FuelEU create a “patchwork” of overlapping requirements that slow investment and risk stranded assets.

“Without clear incentives and predictable frameworks, the risk of stranded assets is real,” he said, urging shipowners, regulators, and financiers to “work together to harmonise frameworks, build supply chains, and share costs.”

Innovation and Digital Assets

The Hong Kong Government has issued HK$240 billion in green bonds since 2018, while the Core Climate carbon marketplace, launched in 2022, connects capital with climate action.

,,2025-11-18 22:07:04+00:00,www.hellenicshippingnews.com,Malaysian palm oil industry plays crucial role in achieving net zero targets,Not Available,,,,,https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/malaysian-palm-oil-industry-plays-crucial-role-in-achieving-net-zero-targets/,"The major palm oil industry players in the country have set their own net zero targets, alongside various sustainability goals that are aligned with the national targets and global demands.
To further support the industry, the Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) published a study in November 2024 to drive the Malaysian palm oil industry towards carbon neutrality and net zero emissions.
The MSPO certification is mandatory for the palm oil industry and its plantations in Malaysia, and it is a national initiative to make palm oil production more responsible, ethical and competitive.
The MSPO standards are also facilitating the Malaysian palm oil industry to achieve their net zero commitments and mitigate climate change.
Clearly, there is a lot of developments and innovations in the palm oil industry to head towards zero waste and net zero emissions.","The Malaysian palm oil industry has long practised zero waste principles by turning agricultural waste into useful resources, which also prevents carbon emissions from decomposition of waste.

Whether it is solid waste — comprising empty fruit bunches (EFB), fibre and shells — or liquid waste, which is the palm oil mill effluent (POME) generated from the processing of fresh fruit bunches to crude palm oil, all parts of the oil palm are turned into fertiliser, fuel and other products.

This is a crucial step towards achieving a true circular economy, where nothing is wasted, and it aligns with three of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG): SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG 13 (climate action).

These efforts by the palm oil industry also support Malaysia’s goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, which is outlined by policy documents like the National Energy Transition Roadmap and New Industrial Master Plan 2030.

The major palm oil industry players in the country have set their own net zero targets, alongside various sustainability goals that are aligned with the national targets and global demands.

To further support the industry, the Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) published a study in November 2024 to drive the Malaysian palm oil industry towards carbon neutrality and net zero emissions.

The study, done in collaboration with Swinburne University of Technology (Sarawak campus), outlines a roadmap for the industry to reach net zero and strengthen its role as a global leader in climate-smart agriculture.

It also showcases the industry’s ability to achieve net zero emissions above the global average through compliance with the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification.

The MPOC’s study reviews current systems in place and introduces emerging technologies. It also provides an overview of challenges faced by the industry in implementing these solutions, and provides recommendations for consideration.

Some of the current practices that have achieved significant outcomes are the use of combined heat and power systems and biogas capture from POME. The MSPO certification requirements coupled with industry best practices have resulted in 68.8% of the industry’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction by replacing fossil fuels and avoiding methane emissions.

POME is a highly acidic but nutrient-rich wastewater, which emits methane gas that can be harnessed to generate energy. The energy is used to either power operations in remote mills or sold to the grid.

Other organic waste from plantations like fronds, palm tree trunks and EFB are used as mulch and fertiliser for healthier soil. Waste from palm oil mills like palm mesocarp fibre, palm kernel cake and palm kernel shells are burned in controlled facilities to generate energy, thus reducing the use of fossil fuels.

Many of the emerging technologies introduced in the study involve more effective use of EFB. The current industry practice is to return EFB to plantations as mulching materials, or to convert them into biofertiliser or animal feed. Some advanced power plants might be able to use EFB as feedstock.

An emerging solution identified in the report is to convert EFB into briquettes or pellets, which can be used to generate renewable energy. Another is to convert EFB into biochar via pyrolysis, which is where organic matter is heated in a stable environment without oxygen. The resulting product is a black solid called biochar that can be used for soil aeration as well as water retention in soil, improving its quality and also enhancing carbon storage in soil, contributing to long-term sequestration.

Moreover, EFB can be used in gasification technologies to produce synthetic gas, which in turn is used for green power generation. Gasification is a process where feedstock, EFB in this case, is exposed to high temperatures without actual fire, with minimal oxygen and steam. EFB can also be fermented to obtain bioethanol, which has many uses across industries.

For more of these emerging technologies to be implemented at a large scale, more research and development (R&D) is required. Collaborative efforts between industry players, researchers and government agencies are also needed.

Additionally, to reduce the cost of the technological solutions, the local manufacturing of equipment has to be expanded. For instance, biomass power generation requires high-pressure steam generators, of which local manufacturers are unable to produce. Besides, some anaerobic digestion components used in the biogas production pipeline are also imported from Germany, according to MPOC’s study.

On the other hand, more efficient collection, transport and storage of biomass materials is needed, and the yield and quality of the materials used must remain consistent.

With a consistent and high-quality feedstock, coupled with good infrastructure — such as reliable electricity grid access and transport networks — the palm oil industry can lead in producing green energy for the nation from agricultural waste.

Of course, for that to happen, substantial capital injection would have to be available, so more can be done for companies to access financing, grants and incentives to alleviate the financial burden of adopting emerging technologies.

The MSPO certification is mandatory for the palm oil industry and its plantations in Malaysia, and it is a national initiative to make palm oil production more responsible, ethical and competitive.

The certification standards are routinely reviewed to ensure they are up to date and can help Malaysian planters meet global demands, while assisting smaller planters who might require more resources to transition to sustainable practices.

For example, an independent plantation smallholder with less than 46ha would not be audited under the same guidelines as a plantation with more than 500ha.

The MSPO standards were last updated in 2022, and implemented earlier this year. The revised standards were strengthened with more stringent sustainability requirements, including a “No Deforestation” cut-off date of Dec 31, 2019, and high conservation value (HCV) assessments. They also focus on social responsibility, transparency and ethical conduct, as well as improved traceability systems.

The MSPO standards are also facilitating the Malaysian palm oil industry to achieve their net zero commitments and mitigate climate change. On the environmental front, companies are now required to identify sources of GHG emissions, and monitor and plan for emissions reductions.

To assist companies along this journey, MSPO developed a GHG calculator, which will be released later this year for public use.

Recognising the global pressure on oil palm companies to adopt sustainability, many Malaysian companies have already been investing in these efforts and pushing the boundaries of innovation in sustainability.

Generating energy using POME in mills is quite commonly done by the plantation companies, as is the use of solid waste from oil palm as fertiliser. But the companies are not stopping there, and continue to invest in R&D to innovate new solutions.

SD Guthrie Bhd, for instance, recently launched a project in Carey Island, its innovation hub, where all machinery and previously diesel-powered vehicles have transitioned to B30 biodiesel, which is a blend of 30% palm oil and 70% diesel. According to the company, it achieved up to 23% reduction in GHG emissions from this initiative.

Meanwhile, IOI Group replaced diesel-powered agricultural machines used on its plantations with electric-powered ones. In remote estates, it is using solar farms to generate renewable energy.

The company has also established IOI Palm Wood Sdn Bhd to convert unused oil palm trunks into high-performance palm wood panels for furniture and the building industry, and partnered with Nextgreen Global Bhd to develop a zero-waste paper pulp plant from EFB.

Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd started installing the filter belt-press (FBP) system, which reduces methane formation and turns POME into fertiliser. Water, which is a by-product from the process, is recycled for cleaning purposes. According to the company, 35 FBPs have been installed.

United Plantations Bhd, which received the world’s first Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil certificate in 2008, has been tracing its emissions using life cycle assessments (LCA), completing the first LCA on palm oil in 2008.

The latest LCA report from February 2025 found that the company has shown a 60% reduction in GHG emissions per kg of palm oil produced from 2004 to 2024, when including indirect land use change and nature conservation, as well as Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.

On the other hand, FGV Holdings Bhd invested in a waste-to-wealth initiative that generates energy from POME, and exports palm kernel shells to Japan as biofuel. More recently, FGV invested in spent silica valorisation and glycerine pitch valorisation processes.

Spent silica, which is a by-product from the biodiesel pre-treatment plant, is repurposed to absorb 90% of phosphorus and 60% of free fatty acids in crude palm oil. Meanwhile, glycerine with impurities, which comes from the glycerine refinery plant, is repurposed as a catalyst for solid biofuel production.

Clearly, there is a lot of developments and innovations in the palm oil industry to head towards zero waste and net zero emissions. As the industry players continue to invest in R&D to implement more innovative solutions, the path forward for sustainable Malaysian palm oil is clear and achievable.

The association has formed a strategic alliance with other European cruise associations – Cruise Baltic, Cruise Britain, Cruise Norway, and Cruise Europe – to coordinate best practices and harmonise environmental and tourism sustainability initiatives across Europe’s cruise destinations.","Stakeholders from the world of transport, accommodation, restaurants, and activities have signed a declaration committing to decarbonising by 2050. For cruise ships, which combine all of those areas into one, the challenges are very particular.

Holidays can be an enchanting escape from reality, and cruise tourism can be a particularly exciting adventure ­– a floating city that carries you to exotic locations. But it can also have big impacts on local environments if not managed correctly.

Cruise ships combine the impacts of hotels, transport, and entertainment into a single package, and the sector has grown fast since the pandemic pause. The cruise industry has been looking at ways to monitor and improve its sustainability performance.

The global cruise industry, including both ship operations and related activity, is estimated to account for around 0.6%-0.7% of total tourism-related CO₂ emissions according to MedCruise, an industry association representing over 160 ports and cruise destinations across the Mediterranean and its adjoining seas.

“Although this share is relatively small within the broader tourism system, the per-passenger footprint can be higher due to the energy demands of operating large vessels and providing hotel-level amenities at sea,” explains MedCruise president Theodora Riga. “It is also important to note that there is wide variation across the sector, as emissions depend heavily on factors such as ship size, itinerary, fuel type, distance travelled, and occupancy levels.”

Direct comparisons difficult

Direct comparisons with a flight show that purely as a mode of transport, cruise ships are more emissions-intensive. One recent overview by GreenMatch estimates that even relatively efficient large cruise ships emit around 250 g of CO₂ per passenger-kilometre, whereas typical air travel ranges from about 10-130 g CO₂ per passenger-kilometre, depending on aircraft and route. But of course, cruise ships aren’t a means of transport like an airplane.

Combining all the impacts of a holiday – the transport, accommodation, and activities – into one means direct emissions-intensity comparisons to the total emissions of a land-based holiday are difficult to calculate.

“Beyond CO₂, cruise operations involve other environmental aspects including air pollutants like SOx, NOx, and particulates, waste management, and water usage,” notes Riga. “Overall, while cruising remains a relatively small but visible segment of global tourism emissions, its growth trajectory means decarbonization is both a priority and a responsibility shared across the industry.”

Stakeholder declaration

Last year, the various elements of the European tourism sector signed up to a declaration committing to decarbonisation actions. The declaration, signed in Rhodes, Greece, by industry groups including the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the hospitality association HotRec, Airports Council International, and attractions industry association IAAPA, reaffirms the sector goal of working toward decarbonisation by 2050, in line with the EU’s target.

“The travel and tourism industry is neither immune to, nor unaware of, the challenges posed by climate change,” they wrote. “Severe environmental impacts such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and habitat destruction threaten the very resources tourism relies on.”

Of course, what isn’t measured can’t be reduced. Certification schemes will be needed to show that progress is being made. The Global Sustainable Tourism Council is managing the global GSTC Standards for sustainable travel and tourism, as well as providing international accreditation for sustainable tourism certification bodies.

“An assessment consists of making objective ratings of compliance to all the elements of a standard,” explains GSTC CEO Randy Durband. “They are benchmarking tools and not marks. “A proper certification mark is one in which the assessment is made by an expert auditor with full impartiality by a 3rd-party agent.” For each element of the assessment, a tourism provider is deemed to be compliant or non-compliant.

Improvements to sustainability performance for cruise ships can be made through actions such as “improving ship design to include recycling facilities and first-level sewage treatment,” he notes.

“Those we work with are driving their land suppliers to use more clean energy vehicles and other improvements per our standard for tour operators. CLIA is providing some financial support to ports to conduct GSTC Destination Assessments in order to drive improvement.

It isn’t just voluntary industry commitments driving the change.

Durband says one of the biggest policy drivers that is driving improvement in Europe is the mandate that by 2030, all cruise ports must provide the capacity for ships to plug into the local electricity grid in order to shut down their engines while in port. This practice is known as “cold ironing”.

That is unique to the EU, and “there are no truly significant regulations for big ships outside the EU that we’re aware of,” he says. He also points to local policies, such as the Port of Amsterdam requirement that riverboats be certified green in order to discharge passengers in the city centre.

Improvements so far

Several large cruise lines have invested in LNG-powered ships. LNG can significantly reduce SOₓ, NOₓ, and particulate emissions compared with heavy fuel oil and can lower CO₂ emissions on a tank-to-wake basis.

However, LNG can suffer from methane slip, where unburnt methane escapes, and methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, which could undermine climate benefits. So proper installation and handling are essential. Companies and shipyards are also exploring bio-LNG, green methanol, and synthetic fuels, though these are still at pilot scale.

There are also design elements available to reduce emissions. These include optimised hull forms and low-friction coatings, high-efficiency propulsion and hotel systems, LED lighting, and smart HVAC. Route optimisation software can minimise fuel use. And in some cases, hybrid systems with batteries can handle peak loads or enable short zero-emission operation in sensitive areas.

Riga from MedCruise says that at the global level, the IMO’s Greenhouse Gas Strategy, revised in 2023, has helped guide the global industry toward a goal of net-zero GHG emissions by around 2050.

“The MARPOL Annex VI regulations on air pollution have also been transformative, particularly through the creation of Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), now extended to the Mediterranean, where sulphur content in fuels is limited to 0.1%,” she says. She notes that within Europe, the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) has become “the single most impactful instrument”.

“Since January 2024, cruise ships calling at EU ports must purchase carbon allowances for their CO₂ emissions, 40% in 2024, rising to 100% by 2026. This represents a direct economic incentive for cruise lines to cut emissions through cleaner fuels, operational efficiency, and optimised itineraries,” she says.

Further action

In 2024, MedCruise conducted a study entitled “Sustainability Investments and Projects in the Mediterranean Ports”, analysing the implementation of environmental monitoring programs, OPS deployment, alternative fuels, pollution prevention and biodiversity protection. It finds a number of possible areas for future action, such as fuel-switching, net zero propulsion research and smarter itineraries.

The association has formed a strategic alliance with other European cruise associations – Cruise Baltic, Cruise Britain, Cruise Norway, and Cruise Europe – to coordinate best practices and harmonise environmental and tourism sustainability initiatives across Europe’s cruise destinations. They are also a partner in the EU-funded BlueMissionMed initiative, part of the EU Mission “Restore our Ocean and Waters by 2030,” which supports research, stakeholder engagement, and investment toward cleaner Mediterranean waters.

One of the most important factors is cooperation with the ports that cruise ships dock in, Riga says.

“Cruise sustainability ultimately depends on strong port and city collaboration, since the environmental and social effects of cruising are most visible at the local level,” she says.

MedCruise works with member ports, who in turn work closely with their municipalities and destination authorities to develop joint frameworks for emissions reduction, waste and water management, and visitor flow control.

“Many of our member ports co-invest with their cities in shore power systems, while others adopt fuel-switching policies or anchor restrictions to protect sensitive marine ecosystems such as Posidonia meadows,” notes Riga.

Sustainable tourism management is another key focus. “Together with local authorities, cruise ports and destinations have implemented measures to better manage passenger flows, including berth allocation, which manages the number of calls per day and adjusts scheduling to avoid peak times.”

Cruise lines have also been promoting alternative excursions that distribute visitors more evenly, and are looking into the development of low-impact experiences, such as walking or cycling tours and connections to nearby communities. “These destination-level collaborations demonstrate that sustainability is not only about technology but also about responsible management and respect for local communities,” she says.

The industry has made genuine steps, such as installing LNG, shore power, efficiency retrofits, and advanced wastewater treatment. But these steps risk being outpaced by growth in ship size and traffic. As the sector develops, it will be essential to continue efforts at developing cleaner fuels, better passenger management, and shore-side solutions.

Tech neutrality Moises Blanco Rios, a policy officer for clean transport transitions at the European Commission’s research and innovation directorate (DG RTD), echoed Tomassini.
He highlighted that shipping decarbonisation translates into real impacts and opportunities for EU citizens and coastal communities.","The International Maritime Organization has pushed back the adoption of its first binding Net Zero framework for shipping, deferring a decision that would shape the industry’s decarbonisation trajectory for decades. The delay underscores the regulatory uncertainty facing global carriers as they weigh investment in alternative fuels.

Brussels, however, is pressing ahead. The European Union’s FuelEU Maritime initiative seeks to accelerate the uptake of low-emission energy sources, positioning the bloc as a frontrunner in maritime climate policy. This divergence creates both risk and opportunity: while the absence of a global standard complicates planning, it also opens the door for Europe to set the pace.

Among the options under consideration, clean ammonia is emerging as a credible candidate for deep-sea shipping. Its potential role in the energy transition was the focus of a recent event hosted by Ammonia Europe and Euractiv on 30 October.

Key messages underscored the need for the EU to seize this opportunity and define effective decarbonization strategies. A full value chain consideration is crucial for addressing the entire ammonia ecosystem, with joined-up policies like the EU Maritime Industrial Strategy and the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) needed to enhance clean ammonia markets.

The discussions included perspectives from experts in sustainability, policy, and technology, focusing on the essential questions about the implications of the IMO delay, the role of ammonia in decarbonization, and how EU policies can facilitate clean ammonia adoption while ensuring its availability and affordability.

These dialogues highlighted the intersection of innovation, regulation, and economic growth within the maritime sector’s shift toward cleaner fuels.

Reduce costs, accelerate transition

Ammonia produced using renewable and low-carbon energy emits no carbon when combusted and benefits from an existing global production and trade network. Leveraging this infrastructure could help reduce costs and accelerate the transition to cleaner fuels – provided that production, safety, and environmental standards are robustly managed. By investing in ammonia-ready vessels and infrastructure, the EU could become a leader in global innovation.

Manuela Tomassini, head of the sustainability and technical assistance department at European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), kicked off the event with a keynote speech that examined the sector’s current trajectory and the safety considerations around ammonia.

“As we explore clean ammonia’s potential, and we look into pathways to enable ammonia for green shipping, sharing lessons learned and working together across the industry and regulators will be essential to ensure progress that is both sustainable and safe,” said Tomassini.

“After the recent events at IMO, we really need to keep the momentum, and we need to take every possible opportunity to remind all of us that the current climate crisis is still ongoing… It still requires decisive and undoubted measures to be adopted, and it still requires commitment and engagement by all relevant stakeholders,” she said.

As of September 2025, 154 ammonia-fuelled vessels and 261 ammonia-ready vessels have been ordered, added Tomassini, before saying more work must be done.

Tech neutrality

Moises Blanco Rios, a policy officer for clean transport transitions at the European Commission’s research and innovation directorate (DG RTD), echoed Tomassini.

“The European Commission continues to focus on competitiveness on sustainability, and also safety, which is going to be key for this issue. Our approach is very clear. We’re technology neutral. Ammonia can be a piece of the puzzle to decarbonise the industry. In RTD, our goal is to try to solve all the technical challenges that are coming along the way, and we look forward to continuing to resolve them,” he said.

MEP Sérgio Gonçalves, a member of the transport and tourism committee in the European Parliament representing the island region of Madeira, underlined the maritime sector’s local and economic importance. He highlighted that shipping decarbonisation translates into real impacts and opportunities for EU citizens and coastal communities.

“The European Union has been leading the effort to decarbonise the maritime sector. However, this is a fight that we cannot win alone. This is why it was deeply disappointing that the International Maritime Organisation decided to delay the vote on its decarbonisation framework following the pressure from the United States.”

“Shipping knows no borders, as we know, and neither does the fight against climate change. An international framework would allow us to reduce emissions more effectively and ensure that companies and operators working in European waters are not disproportionately burdened. That said, we must not lose momentum. The new IMO vote is scheduled for 2026, and the EU and its member states should exert their full diplomatic weight to secure an agreement next year,” said Gonçalves.

“It is not feasible for islands or other small-scale regions to locally produce multiple fuels or to pay for their transportation and maintain separate storage, bunkering, and refuelling infrastructures. Therefore, ideally, we would have one or two primary fuels for ship,s and if not, we should at least ensure shared interoperable infrastructures,” he added.

Zero emissions

Dr Domagoj Baresic, a senior research fellow at the University College London Energy Institute, explained his work tracking progress along the lines of adoption of zero-emission or scalable zero-emission fuels together with a team of researchers.

“The way we do the analysis, I think, is quite pertinent to this discussion. Because, beyond the IMO, there is the European Union, there are national actions, and there are other aspects that are quite important in terms of managing expectations and in terms of mobilising support for these fuels. And this is specifically true for ammonia as well. So, I would say the discussion has to continue, especially from a European Union perspective,” he said.

Finally, Roy Campe, chief technology officer at CMB.TECH – a member of Ammonia Europe – gave a hands-on industry insight into how global trends, EU policy, and technological innovation are shaping real-world decarbonisation and investment decisions in the maritime sector.

“CNBtech is a diversified, future-proof maritime group. We have about 250 seagoing ships, which consume a lot of fuel. I can tell you we are using about three billion litres of diesel on a yearly basis, with assets that are quite powerful, sailing 6,000 hours a year, and have a typical lifetime of 20 years. So, you can imagine that the question for us is ‘what should we be owning as an owner? How can we make money? And we believe it’s not on a pure diesel ship’”, explained Campe.

“We need to look ahead when we invest. If you buy a diesel ship today, you lock in your emissions for the next 20 years. We believe that should be different. How do we build future-proof assets? It has to run on clean fuel. And I believe one of the clear winners for big ships will be ammonia,” he concluded.

Despite US economic threats, The Pacific Islands walked out of the meeting in protest, with Vanuatu’s Minister for Climate Change condemning the delay as “unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change”. Meanwhile, the world’s largest polluter, China, initially supported the NZF in April but reversed its stance this October after strong opposition from the US.

With over 100,000 commercial vessels and millions of smaller marine crafts, decarbonizing this sector is a significant challenge. Pressures are increasing, specially as global trade is expected to double by 2050, while the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has mandated a 50% reduction in emissions compared to 2008 levels. In essence, the industry must achieve deep decarbonization while continuing to grow operations, delivering more shipments with fewer emissions.

The shipping industry’s emissions challenge

To meet these targets without slowing growth, the industry has started to uncover the vast potential of marine batteries. Today, different watercraft require batteries for diverse applications such as propulsion systems, auxiliary power, and power back-ups.

Marine batteries: A game-changer for decarbonization

Replacing traditional fuels with batteries is helping the marine industry in reducing emissions, maintenance costs, noise pollution, and also enhance operational efficiency, resulting in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly marine industry. Marine batteries result in –

Innovative battery solutions leading the charge

Take, for instance, the world’s first battery-powered container ship – a 700 TEU vessel launched by Cosco Shipping in May 2023. This 10,000-DWT river/coastal ship is powered by container-sized batteries and two 900 kW propulsion motors. With a Length Overall (LOA) of 119.8 meters, it cuts emissions by about 32 tons per day compared to conventional fuel ships. In addition to zero emissions, it operates without noise, marking a milestone in green, carbon-neutral shipping. In some cases, the impact is already tangible.

EnerSys – a key player in the marine batteries market has launched its NexSys PURE Thin Plate Pure Lead (TPPL) battery that helps reduce the unexpected operating costs by eliminating the need for watering, thereby cutting unplanned downtime and labor associated with conventional lead-acid batteries. These batteries can be fast-charged in <2 hours, and are 10% more energy dense.

Leclanché’s Marine Rack System (MRS), powered by lithium-ion cell batteries, was developed especially for the maritime industry and will reduce the ships’ consumption of fossil fuels by 40%.

Asia-Pacific: The epicenter of marine electrification

The marine fleet is anchored by the Asia-Pacific region. There are several facts to back this up. More than half of the world’s ship carrying capacity is owned in Asia, naturally positioning the region as the prime hub for marine electrification.

The same trend is reflected in the global marine battery market as well, since, in value terms, the global sector crossed USD 505 million in 2024, with over USD 340 million; that is – nearly 60% of the total value coming from APAC alone.

The reason behind such humongous demand can be attributed to the nature of trade, wherein short sea and coasting shipping, particularly in China and Southeast Asia, operates on fixed routes, perfectly suited to battery integration.

Furthermore, as per Marine Insights, China alone controls over 62% of the global orderbook in 2025, with 3,454 vessels worth 175.4 million gross ton (GT). Apart from China, APAC countries including South Korea, Japan, etc. together account for the bulk of global newbuild orders.

Just in the first half of 2025, Chinese yards secured 402 newbuild orders, South Korea followed with 117 orders, and Japan, though smaller, but held ~11% of total orders.

On the top of that, governments across the region are tightening emissions rules in major ports, aligning with International Maritime Organization (IMO) decarbonization targets and nudging shipowners toward hybrid and battery solutions.

Now that we’re talking about the IMO and decarbonization, Europe won’t be lagging behind either. The region has been proactively advancing marine battery adoption, driven by stringent emission control regulations, IMO-aligned decarbonization targets, and incentives for greener shipping practices. As a result, the region now represents ~13% of the global marine battery market, reflecting steady growth in alignment with both regulatory pressure and sustainability commitments.

Cargo ships: The backbone of battery adoption

According to UNCTAD’s Review of Maritime Transport 2024, the global fleet comprised nearly 109,000 vessels at the start of 2024, carrying over 2.35 billion deadweight tons (DWT). This fleet is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2025. Cargo ships, including bulk carriers, oil tankers, and container ships, dominate, accounting for 88% of the world’s fleet capacity and serving as the engines of global trade. The fleet averaged 22.4 years in 2024, with over half of the vessels older than 15 years, leading to higher emissions and fuel consumption.

Owners are addressing this by retrofitting or ordering new builds, with 387 deliveries expected in 2025, 529 in 2026, and 419 from 2027 onward. Global trade, valued at $300 billion in early 2025, continues to drive fleet expansion. Cargo vessels, as the backbone of seaborne trade, will remain the largest consumers of marine batteries, supporting the energy transition.

Material matters: The evolution of marine battery technology

Though, material choices for marine batteries include Lead-acid batteries (Flooded, VRLA-Gel, and VRLA-AGM), Lithium-ion batteries, and Nickel-cadmium batteries, >85% of marine batteries are made of lead acid materials, especially Valve Regulated – Absorbed Glass Mat (VRLA-AGM), due to their proven reliability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to handle high cranking currents, making them ideal for onboard auxiliary services and starting diesel engines.

Lead-acid batteries remain dominant in maritime operations due to their reliability and cost-effectiveness. EnerSys’ NexSys PURE TPPL batteries reduce operating costs, while PowerSafe SBS batteries offer long-life and high-energy density. Lithium-ion batteries are gaining traction for their superior energy density and minimal maintenance. Without policy action, shipping’s GHG emissions could grow 50% by 2050, contradicting IMO’s net-zero targets. The IMO emphasizes that over 60% of CO₂ cuts must come from alternative fuels. Batteries, as part of the zero-carbon toolkit, are ideal for short routes and hybrid systems, though full electrification of large ships remains unrealistic. Marine batteries are poised for significant growth, driving decarbonization and sustainability in the shipping industry over the coming years.

Navigating challenges in the marine battery supply chain

The marine battery supply chain faces raw material shortages, production bottlenecks, and limited charging infrastructure. In addition, the tariff-driven cost hikes such as US import duties on lithium-ion batteries reaching 104%, have also resulted in significant price increases, delays, and uneven access.

However, in response to a few supply chain challenges and to meet the growing batteries demand, the battery industry is focusing on possible substitutes such as Li-air or Li-sulphur, etc.

The future of marine batteries: Toward a greener ocean

Lastly, by revolutionizing marine transport, enabling cleaner, efficient, and sustainable operations worldwide, the global marine batteries market will become a critical pillar of the future maritime ecosystem. the global marine battery market is poised for growth, projected to surge from ~USD 505 million in 2024 to reach USD 615 million in 2030.

While too many politicians falter and forsake in their climate responsibility, the world needs urgent climate action.","IN OCTOBER, members of the International Maritime Organization shocked the world by delaying by one year the adoption of one of the biggest global climate policy breakthroughs in recent years: the IMO Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

The NZF is historic because it is set to be the world’s first meaningful global carbon price on any industry polluter. This rather complex mechanism consists of gradually increasing carbon intensity targets (a technical element) and penalty fees for non-compliance with these targets (an economic element). Crucially, as an amendment of Annex VI of the existing Marpol Convention, it will be legally-binding for all international ships over 5,000 gt.

The NZF is the single most important tool the IMO has to achieve its 2023 Revised Strategy goals, which countries agreed requires both economic and technical measures. It would also generate real action and substantial finance, which three decades of COP meetings have failed to deliver.

While the NZF adoption in October was expected to be a formality, since a clear majority of countries agreed to the text at MEPC83 in April, this all collapsed within a week of negotiations under relentless pressure from the opposition. This was namely delaying tactics by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the US reported threats to IMO member states, especially to the most vulnerable countries in the Caribbean, Africa, and the Pacific.

Many oil producer countries strongly oppose the NZF since they sell around 300m tonnes of fuel to the shipping industry every year. Whether crude oil serves as a feedstock for energy, plastics, or petrochemical applications, it will produce heavy fuel oil as a toxic byproduct of refineries. If ships stop using this sludge for propulsion, refineries would have to dispose of it at a cost, rather than sell it for profit.

Crucially, however, the opponents to the NZF failed to achieve their ultimate goal: to garner enough support among countries to reject the agreement in its entirety. Instead, they proposed and won a vote to adjourn the decision by one year (out of 127 countries at the meeting, 57 voted for a delay, 49 voted against, and 21 abstained).

Despite these pressures, a strong coalition of countries, including Pacific Islands, Brazil, Chile, Namibia, Mexico, Seychelles, DR Congo, the UK, Mexico, Canada, and the European Union remain committed to adopting the NZF as soon as possible.

What happens in the next 12 months lies solely in the hands of the IMO members, and here are five options of how it could play out.

Five possible scenarios for 2026

First, the best possible outcome for the NZF is its survival through a majority vote to adopt next year. On top of being adopted, survival also requires using a “tacit” acceptance procedure. This means that the NZF enters into force automatically, unless 1/3 of MARPOL Annex VI parties (who account for 50% of tonnage) explicitly oppose. This has been common practice for the IMO’s decision-making since the 1970s.

The second option is to keep the NZF in its current state: in a coma. This would require a majority vote to again adjourn the discussions when they resume. It’s a straightforward and likely scenario that would keep the NZF in the running, but not implemented. However, though with every further delay, the chance of it ever being adopted shrinks. Meanwhile, fragmentation of action for shipping decarbonization, will continue to spread notably beyond the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, creating a patchwork of measures for the shipping industry to comply with.

The third option is the death of the NZF, through a majority vote against adoption among MARPOL Annex VI parties, which is the outcome the opposition camp was not able to find a majority for in October. However, only a handful of states with little interest in climate action would want to go on the record for having killed the NZF, making this outcome unlikely. Though the NZF’s death would create clarity and momentum to start drafting a new measure.

The most disastrous option: the NZF could turn into a zombie. This fourth scenario would require a majority vote in favour of adopting the NZF through the uncommon “explicit” acceptance procedure. Explicit procedure means that the NZF would enter into force only if a set threshold of countries (⅔ MARPOL Annex VI parties and flag states representing 50% of global tonnage) explicitly declare their acceptance to the IMO. The NZF would be alive (because “adopted”) but dead (because it would face the high risk of never being “accepted”, which is required for it to enter into force). Such an “empty shell” outcome is a more elegant option for opponents who want to quietly kill the NZF, since countries would need time and political commitment to go through national procedures, this option would make entry into force altogether unlikely.

Finally, the fifth version of the NZF is a mutant that re-opens political discussion. This would lead to delays that undermine the phase out of fossil fuels and would make a just and equitable transition even more challenging, which is a red line for many least developed countries and small island developing states. Moreover, any substantive changes would trigger a new vote on “agreement”, followed by a vote on “adoption” six months later.

What will it take?

The IMO as an organisation is caught in a double bind. On the one hand, it needs to ensure institutional survival in an increasingly challenging geopolitical context. On the other hand, it needs to deliver on its commitments on climate action — including the 2023 GHG Strategy, which its members unanimously adopted. The role of the IMO’s secretary-general and the MEPC chair will be more critical than ever in 2026.

A zombie NZF would also undermine the IMO well-functioning mechanism of tacit acceptance. Changing the adoption process to explicit also sets a dangerous precedent for any future policies, not only climate regulations, to be adopted “explicitly”, weakening the IMO as a global regulator.

A mutant NZF without an economic element would kneecap the green transition for shipping, both in terms of phasing out fossil fuels and delivering it in a just and equitable manner.

Neither death, coma, zombie nor mutant could be seen as a success for climate change.

The the only credible way forward is to get the NZF adopted in 2026. It’s difficult but possible.

It will require strong unity of IMO members committed to climate action, further clarity on the guidelines and implementation of the NZF and its fund, as well as procedural fairness (which was missing on so many levels throughout the negotiations) both inside and outside the IMO building.

While too many politicians falter and forsake in their climate responsibility, the world needs urgent climate action. Delivering this requires unwavering commitment, by everyone at the IMO. The NZF is a hard-fought compromise that deserves survival so it can be strengthened as soon as possible.

by Benny Hilström, vice president of market development, WinGD

With or without the IMO Net Zero Framework, LNG remains a viable transition pathway towards decarbonization and, with X-DF technology, ultra-low air pollution.

Going into the extraordinary session of IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in mid-October, many in the industry had high hopes that the Net Zero Framework (NZF) would be adopted. WinGD was and remains one of the believers; incentivising the production and uptake of clean fuels is the only way to meet both IMO emissions ambitions and wider global climate targets.

The NZF does not mean, as some have suggested, that the case for LNG fuel or for installing dual-fuel LNG technology is over. Just like our X-DF-A ammonia-fueled and X-DF-M methanol-fueled engines, our X-DF dual-fuel LNG engines are ready to use zero or near-zero emissions (ZNZ) fuels. In the case of LNG those ZNZ fuels are bio-methane and e-methane, produced using captured carbon and renewable electricity, which can be used without modification and in any blend in X-DF engines.

Had the NZF been adopted with reduction targets and penalties stringent enough to drive people towards bio-methane, and rewards high enough to encourage e-methane production and use, the transition towards those fuels would have come sooner. A pause in implementing the policy only pushes the transition from fossil LNG further down the road.

That is why the NZF delay has made more operators consider LNG propulsion. Without a global carbon pricing policy and immediate e-fuel incentives, it remains the most affordable, widely available and well-established of all marine alternative fuels. Even fossil LNG can push vessels a long way towards the 30% reduction in emissions sought by 2030—an intermediate checkpoint under IMO’s GHG reduction strategy (which remains in place even after the NZF vote postponement).

WinGD’s X-DF concept has been in service since 2016, with more than 900 engines sold. Over that time we have amassed more than 8 million running hours of experience and continuously refined fuel consumption and emissions performance via innovations including iCER and VCR technology.

Advancing GHG reduction benefits

Take methane slip as an example. In less than a decade we have reduced slippage by 60%, thanks to iCER, VCR and other design adaptations. Combined with low fuel consumption, this means that X-DF outperforms current high-pressure LNG engines in total greenhouse gas emissions in several vessel applications. In even more applications, low opex and initial system costs mean that total vessel lifecycle costs remain lower for X-DF than for high-pressure counterparts, regardless of IMO penalties.

Time in the market and continuous improvement have enabled us to develop an engine platform that will yield the best performance whether operating in fossil LNG or biological or synthetic derivatives. Regardless of the status of NZF, those years of refinements will pay dividends for operators choosing methane.

What happens next is far from clear. If the global framework were to fail, a patchwork of regional regulatory regimes would likely follow. Across several regions, port authorities are working to lower air pollution in their communities. It is therefore possible that, as regions regulate, they expand the scope of emissions policy to include not only GHG but also air pollutants.

In such a case, X-DF again has benefits for operators, offering the best air pollution profile of any LNG dual-fuel engine. That includes SOx, NOx and particulate matter. While IMO’s threshold requirements for NOx and SOx hide X-DF’s advantages, under schemes where operators pay for polluting the air, its low emissions profile would translate to real cost savings.

The Net Zero Framework would not have killed the use of LNG, but its pause certainly enhances the business case. Regardless, WinGD’s near decade of optimizing the X-DF platform means operators will pay less, whether they use fossil LNG or transition to cleaner variants. And it opens up new opportunities for air pollution improvements that could also have a significant financial impact on operators.",https://www.marinelog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Benny-Hilstrom-Vice-President-of-Market-Development-WinGD.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 11:56:31.688008

Alexandros Josephides: The biggest challenge for the next decade is steering Cyprus Shipping towards a global, sustainable and pragmatic decarbonisation framework while safeguarding the industry’s competitiveness, sustainability and resilience. Achieving this requires close collaboration among stakeholders to develop practical solutions, fuels and infrastructure for a balanced and realistic transition. Without a global framework, there is a real risk of fragmentation through regional or unilateral measures, which could increase costs, reduce competitiveness and create regulatory uncertainty. CSC’s role is to navigate this complexity while safeguarding Cyprus’s position as a leading maritime hub.

S4S: What is your vision for the maritime sector for the next 5 years and your key priorities?

A.J.: Our primary goal remains to promote and safeguard the legitimate interests of our Members and of Cyprus Shipping as a whole. Over the next five years, we aim to strengthen policies that ensure a viable, resilient and globally competitive Cyprus Shipping Industry. A cornerstone of this effort is our close cooperation with the Shipping Deputy Ministry, which has been critical in establishing Cyprus as a respected international shipping hub. By deepening this partnership, we can proactively address emerging challenges, seize new opportunities and enhance both the competitiveness and sustainability of our sector. I look forward to continuing this collaboration with a shared commitment to continued excellence.

S4S: What do you see as the biggest opportunities and challenges related to the human element in shipping’s decarbonisation journey?

A.J.: The biggest opportunities and challenges lie in workforce adaptation and capability-building. As the Shipping Industry transitions into a smart-shipping era, with increased digitalisation and automation, companies are aligning their strategies with these technological changes. The opportunity is clear: by investing in upskilling and reskilling, the workforce can drive innovation, efficiency and the successful adoption of decarbonisation solutions. The challenge is ensuring the workforce can adapt fast enough to keep pace with evolving technologies while maintaining safety and competitiveness.

S4S: What needs to change to raise industry’s profile and attract future talents?

A.J.: Our industry has made significant strides in raising awareness of shipping and promoting career opportunities. At the Cyprus Shipping Chamber, we have a long-standing commitment to maritime education through a three-tiered approach, targeting students from primary school to high school. Initiatives like our successful ‘Adopt a Ship’ Programme, now in its 19th year and targeting 10-12 year old children, high school presentations explaining shipping careers in simple and engaging terms, participation in career fairs and support for cadets and maritime graduates in finding employment demonstrate this commitment. Continuing and expanding these efforts is essential to attracting talent and further raising the industry’s profile in Cyprus.

S4S: Do you have any new developments/ or any new projects on the pipeline that you would like to share with the industry?

A.J.: The Cyprus Shipping Chamber is planning a series of initiatives for 2026 to further elevate the profile of Cyprus Shipping. In parallel with Cyprus’ upcoming Presidency of the European Commission, the Chamber will be actively involved in key local and European projects and events to highlight the strategic importance of our industry. These include high-level business functions for industry executives, government officials, and Member-Companies, as well as social and community events under our CSR programme. Together, these initiatives aim to strengthen industry engagement, promote Cyprus as a leading maritime hub, and attract both local and international stakeholders.

S4S: What is your key message to industry stakeholders to foster a more sustainable future for shipping?

A.J.: Real progress towards a sustainable future for shipping requires coordinated action across all industry stakeholders. The path to decarbonisation will be the industry’s foremost challenge and the onus should not be borne by the shipowners alone. In particular, fuel suppliers must come forward with Zero or Near Zero fuels if the end goal for a net zero emissions shipping is to be achieved. On a local level, the Chamber’s members represent the majority of Cyprus’s leading shipping companies, contributing around 7% to the Cyprus GDP, providing onboard employment to over 80,000 seafarers globally at any one time and 5,000 employees ashore. The industry’s voice and expertise, expressed through the Chamber, must continue to be present and be heard. Close collaboration should focus on aligning incentives, sharing knowledge and developing practical solutions that safeguard this key pillar of the Cyprus economy, ensuring its continued growth, competitiveness and long-term viability.

Olsen Cruise Lines has welcomed UK government officials and energy stakeholders aboard Borealis for a roundtable discussion hosted by CLIA, focused on accelerating the cruise industry’s path to net zero

The event, held at Portsmouth International Port Cruise Terminal, brought together voices from across the energy and transport sectors, including the Energy Networks Association, Ofgem, the National Energy System Operator, and officials from the Department for Transport and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.

Chaired by CLIA, the roundtable provided a forum to explore methods for achieving the cruise sector’s goal of net zero emissions by 2050, in alignment with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2023 strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships.

Attendees discussed the cruise industry’s evolving energy landscape and the role of Onshore Power Supply (OPS) in this transition. OPS enables ships to draw electricity from the grid while berthed, significantly reducing in-port emissions. Portsmouth’s OPS system, currently under installation, is projected to cut carbon emissions by 20,000 metric tonnes annually from 2027.

Mike Sellers, director at Portsmouth International Port, said: “It’s evident there is a real appetite for sustainable fuel technology. While delivering this innovative system is not without its challenges, it was great to know that there’s a support and willingness for this to be a success.”

Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines utilises OPS wherever available across its equipped sister ships – Borealis and Bolette – while investing in low-carbon technologies, like silicone-based hull coatings and advanced propeller systems designed to improve hydrodynamic efficiency and fuel performance.

Samantha Stimpson, CEO of Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, said: “We are proud to have hosted this important discussion aboard Borealis and help shape the cruise industry’s path toward net zero emissions. Achieving net zero by 2050 is ambitious, which makes events like this vital for identifying practical strategies and collaborative solutions.

“For us, sustainability is more than a goal – it’s a responsibility. By adopting solutions such as shore power and working hand in hand with government and industry partners, we can make meaningful progress in reducing our impact and protecting the oceans we sail and the destinations we’re privileged to visit.”

Andy Harmer OBE, managing director of CLIA UK & Ireland, added: “The Roundtable hosted onboard Borealis was a great opportunity to discuss the importance of Onshore Power Supply which is a crucial component of our industry’s decarbonisation journey.

This study was conducted on a low-speed, two-stroke, in-line six-cylinder diesel engine used as the main propulsion system of a 9,196-ton class passenger vessel for international voyages. The engine delivers an output of 6,618 kW at a maximum speed of 146 RPM and uses Bunker A fuel, which is a blend of 70% diesel and 30% heavy fuel oil. The experimental vessel departed from its home port, Mokpo, Republic of Korea, and sailed in coastal waters. Data were collected in various operational modes during the navigation. Table 1 lists the detailed specifications of the vessel and engine used in the experiments.

During vessel operation, the actual CO2, CO, and NOX emission data were collected from the exhaust gases emitted by the main propulsion engine. The engine operating data were obtained from the alarm monitoring system (AMS), which comprehensively manages and monitors the operational data of the vessel’s machinery. The AMS collects and monitors the real-time machinery status through various sensors installed during ship construction, enabling the verification of each piece of machinery’s operating conditions and functional status. The OBS-ONE-GS12 HDV model (Horiba Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) was used to measure gas emissions, and continuous measurements were conducted for the device’s maximum operational duration (4 h) during the voyage. The measurement device was calibrated before and after the measurement, and because the exhaust gas from the main propulsion engine of the vessel contained significantly more particulate matter than that from road mobiles, the internal filter was replaced every 4 h to maintain measurement reliability. The emission measurement method was designed following the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) guidelines. CO2 and CO were measured using a nondispersive infrared (NDIR) method, and NOX was measured via chemiluminescence detection (CLD)25. The detailed specifications of portable emission measurement system (PEMS) are provided in Table 2.

AMS and PEMS data were synchronized during acquisition, a residual latency between the two systems cannot be entirely excluded because of sensor response and signal processing delays in the PEMS. In this study, the latency was considered negligible relative to the 0.1 Hz sampling interval; therefore, no explicit alignment correction was applied. However, for broader development, quantifying the time offset between AMS and PEMS and adjusting the window alignment accordingly is recommended to ensure robust training and real time applicability.

Figure 1 shows a schematic of the data acquisition process. Data were collected over the entire operational sections of the vessel, including arrival and departure. The collected data include engine operating conditions and actual measured emission data. The engine operation data comprise 104 variables, including the RPM, torque, power, exhaust gas temperature for each cylinder, and maximum combustion pressure. These were compiled with the CO2, CO, and NOX emission data into a database. The data sample rate of the AMS was set to 0.1 Hz, resulting in 7,147 samples. Among them, 3389 samples were used as the training set, and the remaining 3758 samples were allocated to the test set for the prediction model.

The modeling was conducted in a controlled computing environment to ensure efficient training of the proposed deep learning models, reproducibility, and to clearly define the constraints on scalability. The hardware configuration included an Intel Core i9-10900KF CPU and 32 GB of RAM. The software environment consisted of Python version 3.9.13 running on window 10 Pro 64-bit. Detailed hardware and software specifications are summarized in Table 3.

Prediction modeling with TSF-Transformer and XGBoost

Figure 2 shows a flowchart for developing the stacking emission prediction model based on TSF-Transformer and XGBoost. The entire dataset was divided into training (3389 rows) and test (3758 rows) samples, with each dataset including different operational modes—from dead slow to full navigation. Nonnumerical fields and missing values were removed from the raw data to minimize errors during model training, and min–max scaling was applied to improve the learning stability and convergence speed. LASSO-based feature selection was performed to identify key input features that affect the target variables, and the final input dataset was constructed based on the selected features. Furthermore, the hyperparameters for both the TSF-Transformer and XGBoost were optimized through K-Fold cross-validation (k = 5) using the Optuna framework. Based on the obtained results, a stacking-structured prediction model was developed, and its performance was evaluated using the test dataset.

Figure 3 shows the structure of the proposed stacking prediction model. Input features selected using LASSO are structured into time-series sequences and fed into the encoder block of the TSF-Transformer, which captures the temporal dependencies using multi-head attention and feedforward layers. Simultaneously, the same features are used to train an XGBoost regression model, and each model performs an initial prediction independently. Subsequently, the predictions from the Transformer and XGBoost models and their first-order differences are combined to form the meta input, which is then fed into the final XGBoost-based meta-model to produce the final prediction. This ensemble structure compensates for the weaknesses of individual models while leveraging their complementary strengths, thereby improving both prediction performance and robustness.

Table 4 lists the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the proposed model. To maximize the prediction performance of the proposed model, the Optuna framework was used to perform hyperparameter optimization using a Bayesian optimizer based on the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE). For each hyperparameter combination, five-fold cross-validation was performed. In each fold, the TSF-Transformer was first trained, followed by the construction of meta-inputs using its output along with the XGBoost predictions and their first-order differences. Based on these inputs, the final metal model was trained. During validation, the objective function of Optuna was defined to minimize the RMSE. Because CO2, CO, and NOX have distinct time-series characteristics, scales, and combinations of influential variables, optimal hyperparameter tuning was performed separately for each target. The final optimized combination of hyperparameters improved the prediction accuracy while preventing overfitting in each prediction model, providing a basis for designing the optimal structure for each target. The training time for each model was also recorded to indicate the computational demand of the proposed approach. Specifically, the training required 108.21 s for the CO2 model, 40.79 s for the CO model, and 24.24 s for the NOX model. These results confirm that, even with a training dataset of 3389 samples and the adopted hyperparameter configurations, the training process can be completed efficiently within a relatively short time on the specified hardware environment.

Training variables for each emission’s prediction model

LASSO feature selection was employed to identify the most influential input variables for prediction each pollutants. The final sets of selected features are summarized in Tables 5, 6 and 7. For the CO2 emission prediction model, a total 50 variables were selected, including fuel consumption and main engine air cooler cooling water outlet temperature. For the CO prediction model, 15 variables were used, including main engine load, whereas 27 variables were applied for the NOX prediction model. All input data, excluding the emission measurements, were derived from vessel operation information acquired through the alarm monitoring system at a sampling frequency of 0.1 Hz.

For CO emissions, previous studies (Will et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2021) have reported that the intake pressure of diesel engines significantly affects CO formation26,27. Based on this evidence, adding combustion-specific variables was considered, namely the average maximum cylinder pressure and the average cylinder compression pressure, in addition to the LASSO-selected features. However, the experimental results revealed that including these combustion-specific variables did not improve model performance; instead, the prediction accuracy deteriorated in terms quantitative indicators such as MAE and RMSE. This suggests that the additional features may have introduced noise or redundancy that hindered effective learning. Consequently, these variables were excluded from the final model. Nevertheless, it is anticipated that incorporating other combustion-specific parameters not included in this study—such as fuel injection timing and injection pressure—could further enhance the accuracy and robustness of CO emission prediction in future work.

The influence of the selected variables differed depending on the target pollutant. Some variables directly contributed to increasing emissions (LASSO, +), whereas others acted as suppressing factors(LASSO, -). Notably, the experimental vessel was equipped with a controllable pitch propeller (CPP), allowing the propeller angle to be adjusted for propulsion. Variances in the CPP pitch were found to affect emission formation; an increase in propeller pitch tended to reduce CO2 and NOX emissions, but conversely led to an increase in CO emissions. This indicates that CPP dynamics exert a nonlinear influence on combustion conditions and exhaust gas formation. Accordingly, the same input variable can exert opposite effects depending on the emission species, highlighting the limitation of using a single independent variable sets and optimization procedures for each pollutant, which substantially improved the overall predictive performance of the proposed model.

Bottom–up emission prediction approach

We compared the performance of the proposed model with that of the bottom–up approach reported by the IMO and EEA, which is commonly used to calculate vessel emissions. The bottom–up method estimates fuel consumption based on vessel characteristics and operational data to calculate emissions. It exhibits higher accuracy than the top–down approach, which relies solely on fuel sales data28,29,30.

To calculate fuel consumption, information about the engine load and power from vessel activity data is essential. Based on the load data obtained from the AMS, the fuel consumption was calculated using the method proposed by the IMO. The specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) according to the load can be expressed as follows:

$$\:{SFOC}_{load}={SFOC}_{baseline}\times\:\left(0.4555\times\:{load}^{2}-0.71\times\:load+1.28\right),$$

(1)

where SFOCload ​is the SFOC under the engine load (g/kWh), and SFOCbaseline is the SFOC as fuel (g/kWh). In this study, Burker A was used as fuel in the slow-speed engine. It was consumed at 175 g/kWh31.

Using the SFOCload calculated in Eq. (1) and the engine power data, the fuel consumption can be estimated as follows:

$$\:{q}_{f}={SFOC}_{load}\times\:P,$$

(2)

where qf is the fuel consumption (g), and P is the engine power (kW).

According to the IMO and EEA, CO2 and CO emissions can be calculated by multiplying the fuel consumption by the emission factor (EF), as expressed in Eq. (3). However, the EEA calculates NOX emissions by multiplying the fuel consumption by EF, whereas the IMO calculates using Eq. (4). The EF values for various pollutants are listed in Table 8. Although the IMO does not explicitly define Bunker A as s separate fuel category, it is generally considered as a residual fuel oil with properties similar to low-sulphur heavy fuel oil. Accordingly, the emission factors were selected based on the default carbon content and fuel-specific coefficient reported in the Fourth IMO GHG Study (2020) and the IMO NOX Technical Code (2008), which are applicable to residual marine fuel.

$$\:{EM}_{i}=FC\times\:{EF}_{i},$$

(3)

where EM is the emission quantity (g), and i indicates the emission type.

$$\:{EM}_{NOx}={EF}_{NOx}\times\:\frac{{SFOC}_{base}}{{SFOC}_{CG}}\times\:P,$$

(4)

where EFNOx is the emission factor for NOx, and SFOCCG is the SFOC value proposed by Cooper and Gustanffson (2004)32,33.

The prediction performance of the proposed model was evaluated by comparing the emissions estimated using the proposed model and the bottom–up methods proposed by the IMO and EEA.

Figure 4 shows the correlation between SFOC and load according to the engine RPM. The correlation follows a cubic relationship or the propeller law34. Typically, for vessels with medium- to large-scale low-speed engines, the engine is directly connected to the propeller without a reduction gear. Here, the SFOC was higher under low-speed, low-load conditions during maneuvering and lower under high-speed, high-load conditions during sailing. This result can be attributed to the reduced thermal efficiency under low engine loads due to the lower fuel injection pressure, suboptimal fuel injection timing, and insufficient scavenging air for combustion35. However, as shown in the yellow-shaded area of Figure 4(a), some data deviate from the general trend, which can be attributed to the fact that the experimental vessel was equipped with a CPP rather than a fixed-pitch propeller (FPP) for propulsion. CPPs allow thrust adjustment by varying the propeller pitch while maintaining constant engine RPM. The variations in the propeller pitch in those sections result in nonlinear fuel consumption patterns. Excluding such sections, Figure 4(b) shows a pattern consistent with the propeller law typically observed for FPPs. In this study, the entire operational dataset, including the sections affected by pitch variations, was used for training to ensure generalized performance under diverse operating conditions. However, the 100–120 RPM range is classified as a critical RPM zone due to structural resonance issues in the engine. In actual operations, it is avoided to prevent mechanical damage to the engine. In this range, the sudden increase in fuel injection rate can cause a transient rise in exhaust gas pressure, potentially leading to measurement errors in the PEMS. In addition, non-physical or unrealistic values from the AMS and PEMS (e.g., abnormal emission spikes, sensor malfunctions) were identified through cross-checking with engineering and temporal continuity, and subsequently removed. This screening process ensured that only physically meaningful and consistent data were used for model training.

Figure 5 shows the operational activity of the experimental vessel during the measurements. In certain sections, changes in the propeller pitch resulted in differences in the load and speed despite the constant RPM. These sections correspond to the deviations from the trend in Figure 4(a). These results indicate that, unlike FPPs, CPPs require additional variables for accurate emission calculations. Therefore, we included such sections in the training data and constructed the prediction model accordingly. In the sections not affected by the CPP, pitch, load, and speed varied in a similar pattern with respect to the RPM. Although minor differences were observed, the trend is similar to that of FPPs. Therefore, the proposed prediction model based on CPPs can exhibit comparable performance when applied to vessels with FPPs. This will be verified in future studies by collecting vessel operation and emission data without variations in the propeller pitch.

In addition, a SHAP-based sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare the CPP-affected segments with non-affected ones. The results show that the contribution of the propeller pitch variable exhibited no significant change between the two segments, indicating that the model did not rely heavily on pitch variation for prediction (see Supplementary Fig. S1–S3). This suggests that the proposed model retains generalizability and can adapt to vessels equipped with FPP without retraining.

The prediction results obtained using the proposed hybrid prediction model were compared with the emissions estimated using the conventional bottom–up approaches reported by IMO and EEA and those measured using a PEMS. Figures 6(a)–(c) compare the measured and predicted emissions for each pollutant. The magnified areas in the figures highlight representative segments where the differences in model performance are pronounced. Overall, the proposed model outperformed the bottom–up methods, especially under dynamic conditions.

As shown in Figure 6(a), the CO2 emissions estimated by the IMO and EEA approaches are identical because the same EF and equation are used in both cases. Both methods significantly underestimated CO2 emissions compared to the measured values, especially under high-load conditions. In contrast, the proposed model estimated CO2 emissions close to the measured values not only under high-load conditions but also during transient events, such as rapid load increases and decreases caused by large changes in RPM.

Figure 6(b) compares the predicted and measured CO emissions. CO emissions vary significantly compared with CO2 and NOX emissions. The IMO and EEA methods showed similar general trends but significantly underestimated the emissions, especially under high-load conditions. In contrast, the proposed model tends to overestimate CO emissions at high load, despite the hyperparameter being optimized. This suggests that the features selected by LASSO may not fully represent combustion processes under steady high-load conditions. Moreover, the relatively narrow yet highly fluctuating distribution of CO may have introduced instability in pattern learning. Additional factors such as sensor noise and limited sample converge at critical operating points could also have contributed to these deviations. Therefore, future work should consider preprocessing techniques (e.g., noise reduction) and incorporating combustion-specific variable to address these limitations. And multi-task learning that leverage the correlation among CO, CO2 and NOX emissions may improve robustness.

The proposed model accurately captured the emission trend, except in certain sections where a sharp emission spike was observed. These results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits improved prediction performance.

Figure 6(c) shows the predicted and measured NOX emissions. The IMO bottom–up approach underestimated the emissions relative to the measured values, whereas the EEA method overestimated them. The EEA values more significantly deviated from the measured values than the IMO values, which can be attributed to the fact that the IMO method uses EFs that depend on the engine RPM, whereas the EEA method uses constant EFs. The proposed model, which predicts emissions based on actual engine operating data, accurately predicted the emission trends and achieved minimal deviation from the measured emissions.

Figure 7 shows the regression analysis results of the CO2, CO, and NOX emissions predicted using the proposed model with respect to the measured values. A residual plot is provided for each subplot to evaluate the validity of the regression model. The adjusted R² and slope for Figure 7(a) are 0.9935 and 0.9627, respectively, indicating that the predicted and measured CO2 emissions are in good agreement. The residuals are evenly distributed around zero, indicating no heteroscedasticity and supporting the validity of the regression model.

As shown in Figure 7(b), CO emissions had relatively larger residuals than the other pollutants. The adjusted R2 value was 0.6324, and the slope was 0.7660, indicating moderate prediction accuracy. The larger residuals can be attributed to the inherently high variations in the measured CO emission data. In future studies, more standardized CO data should be collected to retrain the model and improve its robustness. While CO showed comparatively larger residuals, this may also reflect feature insufficiency with respect to combustion-specific mechanisms. Prior studies indicate that injection timing and resulting in-cylinder pressure/heat-release phasing markedly influence incomplete oxidation products such as CO in compression-ignition engines4,36. Accordingly, future work will instrument combustion-specific variables (e.g., fuel injection timing, valve event timing) and retrain the model to better capture CO formation dynamics under diverse operating regimes.

As shown in Figure 7(c), although some data points deviate from the main trend, the adjusted R2 and slope are 0.9716 and 0.9623, respectively, indicating excellent prediction of NOX emissions by the proposed model using only the engine data. Except for a few outliers, the residuals were uniformly distributed, confirming that NOX emissions can be accurately estimated using only engine operation data.

Figure 8 shows the prediction and estimation error distributions of the proposed model and conventional bottom-up approaches (IMO and EEA) for each pollutant. In the histograms, the right- and left-skewed distributions indicate underestimation and overestimation, respectively. For all pollutants, the bottom–up approaches exhibited skewed error distributions, showing either underestimation or overestimation. In contrast, the proposed model exhibited approximately normal error distributions centered around zero, indicating better fit and accuracy.

Figure 8(a) presents the error distribution of CO2 emission prediction. The proposed TSF-Transformer model shows that most errors are concentrated near zero, indicating closer agreement with the actual emissions compared to the IMO and EEA methods. While the IMO and EEA approached consistently underestimate emissions with peaks around − 60 to − 80, the proposed model exhibits a higher frequency in the − 20 to 0 range, reflecting better reproduction for actual values under high-load conditions. This characteristic is particularly advantageous for maritime applications, as vessel spend most of their operation time in high-load sailing segments where accurate emission estimation is critical. Nevertheless, a residual bias toward underestimation remains in the distribution tails. Future works should focus on refining feature selection and applying advanced preprocessing techniques to reduce this bias. Moreover, separating stable segments from highly variable transient segments and analyzing feature sensitivity may future reduce variance in the error distribution and narrow the confidence interval of emission estimates.

For CO emissions (Figure 8(b)), despite the high variability of the measured data, the proposed model shows that errors are concentrated around zero. While the IMO and EEA approaches predominantly underestimate emissions, the proposed model exhibits a slight tendency toward overestimation, but with substantially smaller errors overall. Similar to CO2, underestimation is observed in the low-load region, whereas overestimation appears in the high-load region. To mitigate these issues, not only should feature selection be further refined, but combustion-specific variables such as fuel injection timing and pressure should also be incorporated. In addition, applying preprocessing techniques such as noise reduction—within the range that preserves the reliability of highly variable measured data—may enhance the model’s pattern recognition and learning effectiveness.

For NOX emissions (Figure 8(c)), the IMO method tends to underestimate while the EEA method tends to overestimate, whereas the proposed model demonstrate an error distribution centered closer to zero. The error range is also much narrower than those of the bottom-up approaches, highlighting the substantial improvement in prediction accuracy.

Figures 9(a)–(c) show the distribution of the CO2, CO, and NOX prediction errors with respect to the engine operating conditions, particularly the RPM and torque, which are key indicators of engine variability. The left and right plots in each subplot project the error distributions with respect to the RPM and torque, respectively. In all subplots, the shaded blue area represents the ± 5% error band relative to the maximum measured emission. The percentage of predictions within this band is also indicated.

As shown in Figure 9(a), 85.63% of the predictions fall within the ± 5% band, indicating consistently strong performance across most operating condition. Lager deviation appear mainly at low-RPM and torque segments, which are characterized by transient behavior and reduced engine stability. Because the test set is dominated by high-load operation, the improved accuracy in those segments makes the approach particularly suitable for estimating real-world CO2 emissions. Reducing the residual bias at low-load will likely require segment-specific rather than a single global model.

In contrast, CO remains the most challenging pollutant. Only 18.03% of prediction lie within ± 5%, and the error frequency increases toward high-RPM and torque where combustion changes rapidly. Two factors appear to limit performance. First, feature sufficiency: the LASSO-selected variables capture steady-state trends but under-represent combustion dynamics that strongly affect CO (e.g., fuel injection timing, pressure, air-fuel ratio indicators). Second, measurement scale and noise: although the PEMS was calibrated with a 4.74% CO span gas, voyage measurement were typically 0.01–0.03%. Operating far below the calibration span increase relative noise and makes short sparks hard to learn. To address these issues, we plan to (ⅰ) incorporate combustion-specific variables obtainable from the engine control/monitoring system; (ⅱ) adopt noise-aware preprocessing, e.g., stationary wavelet denoising to suppress isolated spikes while preserving step changes; (ⅲ) rebalance training with load-aware sampling so that low- and high-load segments are adequately represented; and (ⅳ) use robust/heteroscedastic objectives and a two branch architecture that learns separate experts for low- and high-load regimes with a simple load-based gate. In parallel, we will recalibrate the analyzer with lower-range span gas aligned to the observed concentration range to reduce instrument noise and improve label fidelity. These targeted steps are expected to improve CO robustness beyond what can be achieved by hyperparameter tuning alone.

For NOx (Figure 9(c)), 53.72% of the predictions are within the ± 5% range. Although the proposed model exhibited high performance under most operating conditions, larger deviations can occur under extremely high or low engine loads due to the nonlinear nature of NOX formation or insufficient training data for such edge cases.

The results confirm that the proposed data-driven approach substantially improve CO2 and NOx estimates under representative operating conditions, while CO accuracy remains limited by feature sufficiency and measurement scaling. Rather than attributing CO underperformance solely to “inherent variability”, we identify concrete, testable remedies—combustion-aware features, load-aware modeling, robust losses, wavelet-based denoising, and calibration range matching—that we will implement next to close the gap.

Table 9 presents the quantitative evaluation of the proposed model compared with conventional emission estimation methods. The comparison indicators are the coefficient of determination (R2), adjusted R2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

For CO2, all methods, including the proposed model, exhibited high R2 values, ranging from 0.9935 to 0.9947. However, the proposed model exhibited significantly lower RMSE (43.52) and MAE (35.75) than the bottom–up approaches proposed by IMO and EEA (RMSE = 65.69 and MAE = 59.59). Compared with the conventional bottom–up approaches, the RMSE of the proposed model was improved by approximately 34%, and the MAE was improved by approximately 40%, indicating that the proposed model not only maintains a high correlation but also exhibits improved accuracy in absolute terms.

For CO, the proposed model exhibited an R2 of 0.6324 and an RMSE of only 0.94, which are lower than those of the IMO and EEA methods 0.7339 and 1.72, 1.78, respectively), indicating that the proposed model significantly outperforms the conventional approaches. In addition, the MAE of the proposed model (0.78) was significantly lower than that of the EEA method (1.61), indicating better generalizability of the proposed model despite significant variations in CO emissions. Compared with the EEA method, which showed a larger discrepancy than the IMO approach, the RMSE and MAE of the proposed model improved by approximately 45% and 47%, respectively.

For NOX, the proposed model exhibited an R2 of 0.9716, which is slightly lower than that of the conventional bottom–up approach method; however, its RMSE (1.60) is much lower than that of the IMO and EEA methods (2.71 and 5.08, respectively), indicating a more balanced performance. In addition, with an MAE of 1.27, the proposed model demonstrated more than a 40% improvement in RMSE and 48% improvement in MAE compared with the IMO method, which estimates emissions while reflecting engine characteristics. Overall, the proposed hybrid prediction model consistently exhibited higher predictive accuracy and lower error variance than the conventional bottom–up approaches for all pollutants.

To isolate the contribution of the hybrid architecture, a base learner (XGBoost) was compared against the stacked model under an identical protocol. For each pollutant, the same LASSO-selected features, identical train/test spilit, and tuning budgets were used. The meta-learner received the base predictions and their first differences, enabling it to reconcile sequence-level trends (from TSF-Transformer) with instantaneous nonlinear interactions (from XGBoost).

For CO2, relative to the XGBoost-only baseline, the stacked model reduced RMSE from 45.50 to 43.52 (\(\:\varDelta\:\)RMSE \(\:\approx\:\) 4.35%) and MAE from 38.29 to 35.75 (\(\:\varDelta\:\)MAE \(\:\approx\:\) 6.63%). Because R2 values were already saturated(\(\:\approx\:\)0.9935–0.9946), these absolute-error reductions are more indicative of practical gains, especially for inventory applications that penalize bias at higher loads.

In case of CO, the benefit of stacking was mixed. While the stacked model achieved slightly higher R2 than XGBoost-only, its RMSE was marginally worse (\(\:\approx\:\)+2% relative difference), with MAPE remaining similar. When target variance is dominated by unobserved combustion-specific factors, the marginal utility of combining learner becomes limited. In short, the hybrid model offers better calibration in some regimes but does no uniformly lower point error for CO given the current feature set.

For NOX, the stacked model improved over XGBoost-only, reducing RMSE from 1.70 to 1.60 (\(\:\varDelta\:\)RMSE \(\:\approx\:\) 5.9%) and MAE from 1.39 to 1.27 (\(\:\varDelta\:\)MAE \(\:\approx\:\) 8.6%), while maintaining competitive R2. These gains suggest that fusing short-horizon temporal cues (captured by TSF-Transformer) helps in regimes where formation chemistry interacts with engine load and temperature dynamics.

Stacking provided consistent, modest improvement for CO2 and NOx, where temporal structure and nonlinear interactions are complementary. For CO, the hybrid did not dominate the best single learner, indicating diminishing returns under heavy noise/omission (e.g., lack of fuel injection timing).

Although this study was validated on a single diesel engine vessel equipped with a CPP, the proposed hybrid framework (TSF-Transformer + XGBoost) was designed on the basis of time-series engine data acquired from the AMS rather than fuel-specific constants, suggesting its potential applicability to other vessel types. The engine data used in this work were collected under controlled condition together with emission measurements (HORIBA OBS-ONE-GS12) and are real time capable (0.1 Hz, 174 samples), thereby providing a realistic operational envelope for assessing scalability. With the recent introduction of alternative fuels in maritime sector (e.g., LNG, methanol, ammonia), applying this framework to new propulsion systems would require additional analysis of emission characteristics arising from combustion and re-training of the base framework. Because the proposed model learns the interactions between engine operating states and emission outputs rather than relying on fixed factor, it is expected to be sufficiently extensible. Furthermore, aside from CPP-affected segment, the operating relationship among RPM, load, and speed follows the propeller law, which was also observed in this study. SHAP-based sensitivity analysis indicated that the prediction results were not substantially influenced by pitch variations, thereby supporting the feasibility of extending the framework to vessels equipped with FPP.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-24393-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_24393_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-11-18 12:58:52.187737

As disclosed in a social media post, the 40-meter-long newbuildings were delivered to the Bermudan government ahead of schedule. The vessels were designed by Australia’s One2Three Naval Architects.

The handover of the units, which will be able to carry around 550 passengers, marks the first collaboration between Bermuda and the Singaporean vessel construction player, according to officials from Strategic Marine. The parties reportedly shook hands on this project around two years ago.

The environmentally friendly catamarans, which are now ready for deployment in Bermudan waters, are described as having been built with features that would ensure operational efficiency as well as sustainable ferry services.

To be specific, as Strategic Marine has elaborated, the ferries were engineered to meet Bermuda’s current and future operational requirements, with projections that they could lead to a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction level of at least 25%, particularly when compared to the already deployed units on a passenger-mile basis.

Reflecting on this development, Owen Darrell, JP, MP, Bermuda’s Minister of Tourism and Transport, Culture & Sport, remarked that the eco-conscious newbuilds could play a ‘significant’ role in supporting the country’s environmental goals and, at the same time, foster “long-term savings for the taxpayer”.

It is worth noting that Strategic Marine had been given the technical acceptance for the aluminium caramaran duo back in September this year, which marked the first step before the vessels’ handover and deployment.

Despite the trials and tribulations concerning global environmental regulations, particularly the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net Zero Framework, which strives for climate neutrality by (or around 2050), Bermuda has kept pace with its sustainability targets.

Laldia will be the country’s first green port and the single largest European foreign direct investment in Bangladesh,” Chief Adviser of the Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, commented.","The Dutch container terminal operator APM Terminals, a part of Denmark’s shipping giant A.P. Moller – Maersk, has signed a concession agreement valued at $550 million with the Bangladeshi Chittagong Port Authority (CPA), aiming to deepen the South Asian nation’s infrastructural development and sustainability efforts.

The 30-year concession agreement, reportedly one of the largest public-private partnership (PPP) investments in Bangladesh’s history, concerns the development of the Laldia Container Terminal in Chattogram. The initiative will also be joined by local partner QNS Container Services.

The Laldia Container Terminal is to be fully designed, funded, constructed and operated by the investors, which is said to be a “first-of-its-kind” model for the country’s port infrastructure.

More importantly, according to officials from APM Terminals, the project is part of the Sustainable Green Framework Engagement between Denmark and Bangladesh, a bilateral collaboration that seeks to pave the way for green investment, sustainable economic relations and job creation.

“The Laldia Container Terminal demonstrates Bangladesh’s commitment to reform, transparency and investment-friendly growth. Laldia will be the country’s first green port and the single largest European foreign direct investment in Bangladesh,” Chief Adviser of the Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, commented.

“Bangladesh is one of the fastest-growing economies of the world, and with the graduation from LDC just around the corner, it’s an ideal time for Bangladesh to experience the reduced cost of trade from cutting-edge technology and best practices of an ‘international standard’ terminal operator,” Nurul Qayyum Khan, Chairman of QNS Container Services, further remarked.

As highlighted, the agreement will strive to build what is described as “one of South Asia’s first energy-efficient, low-emission terminals”, aligned with net-zero targets and envisaged to support Bangladesh’s long-term climate goals.

Key features of the project are set to entail electrified cargo-handling equipment, solar power installations on terminal structures, and shore power-ready systems allowing ships to plug into the grid. These measures are expected to slash greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as noise and air pollution and thus, benefit not just the environment but also the workforce and the nearby communities.

Once operational (approximately in 2030), the terminal is anticipated to expand Bangladesh’s annual port handling capacity by over 800,000 TEUs, which could ‘improve’ the country’s global trade efficiency and connectivity.

Moreover, as disclosed, the new deep-water facility will allow the Port of Chattogram to handle vessels potentially up to 6,000 TEUs over time, whilst it can handle those of just up to 2,800 TEUs at the present moment.

In terms of its sustainability efforts, Bangladesh has had its peaks and valleys over the years, especially in the maritime transport industry, the world’s main trade artery.

In April 2025, the country received around $650 million from the World Bank to develop the Bay Terminal Marine Infrastructure Project in Chittagong to ‘modernize’ the port’s facilities. The effort encompasses the construction of a ‘climate-resilient’ breakwater and access channel to fit larger vessels, per Reuters.",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/11/18085848/Screenshot-2025-11-18-085819.png?image-crop-positioner-ts=1763452729,N,,2025-11-18 05:56:07.391063

Despite progress, Soga argued that the main challenge remains the high cost of green ammonia.
""So the foundation for using ammonia as a marine fuel is in place, but the main barrier right now is cost,"" Soga said.
""Green ammonia, specifically blue or green ammonia, is still much more expensive than traditional options.
Soga sees these grey ammonia plants to play a foundational role in the development of blue and green ammonia plants in the future.","Japanese shipping firm NYK Group says ammonia bunkers will be its primary fuel to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

It sees the use of ammonia-powered vessels starting this year and growing streadily through 2050 and beyond.

In that time, use of LNG and LPG-powered vessels peaks around 2035 with that tonnage transitioning to ammonia.

Methanol also still has a place in NYK's plans, albeit playing a smaller role than that of ammonia, with uptake starting around 2030 and growing steadily through 2050 and beyond.

The plans were laid out Monday by Takaya Soga, president and CEO of NYK, in his opening address at the World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025, where Ship & Bunker was in attendance as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025.

The choice of ammonia as NYK's principal route to net zero is notable.

Both LNG and methanol are widely seen as the main alternatives to traditional oil bunkers and continue to receive significantly more backing from the industry with only five ammonia vessels ordered so far this year, compared to 147 powered by LNG and 47 by methanol.

""The development and introduction of ammonia-fuelled vessels is positioned as our main scenario,"" Soga said at the event, adding that the company is already gaining ammonia expertise by operating its ammonia-fuelled tugboat, Sakuyake.

The Sakuyake had completed a three-month demonstration voyage in March 2025, during which it achieved a GHG emission reduction of up to 95%.

Soga noted that ammonia is recognized for its ability to produce zero harmful emissions, making it a key solution for decarbonization in the shipping industry, but left unsaid was the widely-held concerns over the toxicity of ammonia, a factor considered by many as its main drawback when compared to methanol and LNG.

Still, Soga did note that NYK is advancing its ability to handle ammonia safety and highlighted the ship-to-ship ammonia cargo transfer that took place between the NYK-owned ammonia carrier Berlian Ekuator and Eco Enchanted off Spain in September 2025.

""This achievement demonstrates the safety and the practicality of large-scale ammonia transportation,"" Soga said.

Despite progress, Soga argued that the main challenge remains the high cost of green ammonia.

""So the foundation for using ammonia as a marine fuel is in place, but the main barrier right now is cost,"" Soga said.

""Green ammonia, specifically blue or green ammonia, is still much more expensive than traditional options.

""On the other hand, currently, numerous grey ammonia plants exist globally.""

Soga sees these grey ammonia plants to play a foundational role in the development of blue and green ammonia plants in the future.

""To overcome the cost of the barrier, we need to accelerate clean ammonia development to enable mass production and drive down costs,"" he concluded.",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_1444e6cb8c621deb817b1d8f3b9ffe8b.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 04:56:07.485901

In this edition of Hydrogen Compass, we explore how delayed international frameworks, recalibrated national strategies, and new legislative moves reveal a region still defining its hydrogen future. However, as governments debate the path forwards, developers are pressing ahead, moving projects from planning to execution and signalling that Europe’s hydrogen market is still taking shape.

The next edition will be published in December. In the meantime, if you have any comments or feedback, please do reach out to Jun Sasamura (jsasamura@westwoodenergy.com).

Project developments press ahead

Across Europe, developers pressed ahead with major projects. From refinery decarbonisation in Portugal and large-scale e-fuel initiatives in Spain, to new electrolysis plants in Germany and the UK, investment continued and key milestones were reached. This momentum reflects the relative resilience of the industry, even as regulatory and commercial challenges persist. Against this backdrop of positive progress, it is important to acknowledge that policy uncertainty is ongoing, shaping the pace and structure of future developments overall.

Policy turbulence across Europe

Policy delays and uncertainty have continued to define the pace of the European hydrogen market and October was no exception. While the EU advanced key regulatory frameworks, national governments took divergent paths. Meanwhile, international developments, particularly in maritime regulation, added further complexity.

IMO delays net-zero framework

The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) voted in October to delay its Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by one year. This delay could significantly impact future demand for hydrogen and green ammonia in the maritime sector. Originally designed to accelerate the uptake of renewable and low-carbon fuels, the NZF’s postponement introduces further uncertainty for developers and investors.

The delays followed intense opposition from the US, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia. The US president publicly condemned the NZF, calling it a ‘Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping’ and reportedly threatened visa restrictions and higher trade costs for countries supporting the framework.

IMO Secretary General Aresenio Dominguez and International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) Secretary General Thomas Kazakos both expressed disappointments, calling the outcome a setback for zero-carbon shipping and investment in green fuels.

With the NZF now on hold, demand forecasts for hydrogen-derived marine fuels are likely to be revised downward, potentially slowing investment in hydrogen supply projects and green ammonia production capacity.

Diverging national strategies in Europe

While the EU continues to refine its hydrogen policy framework, national governments are taking varied approaches, with some accelerating and others reassessing.

EU: The European Parliament approved the EU’s Delegated Act on low-carbon hydrogen in October. The Act, originally adopted by the Commission in July, sets a 70% emissions reduction threshold for low-carbon hydrogen compared to fossil fuels.

It aims to provide clarity on CCS-enabled hydrogen and non-renewable-powered electrolysis and allows such project to access funding under the European Hydrogen Bank. Commissioner Dan Jørgensen confirmed that projects making investment decisions now won’t be subject to future revisions of the Act, which creates an important reassurance for developers.

By expanding eligibility and establishing clear emissions criteria, the Delegated Act is expected to strengthen investor confidence and maintain momentum in Europe’s hydrogen market, particularly as the sector seeks greater flexibility in production pathways.

Portugal: Portugal’s Secretary of State for Energy, João Barroca, criticised the previous government’s heavy focus on renewable hydrogen last month, calling it a misguided priority that diverted resources from more practical decarbonisation options like biomethane. He warned that an export-driven hydrogen strategy has failed to create domestic value or support Portuguese industry.

Reflecting this change in direction, the government revised its electrolyser capacity target down from the previous administration’s 5.5GW target to 3GW in the October 2024 climate plan. Despite this recalibration, Portugal has continued to progress key infrastructure projects, including a 10% hydrogen blending trial in the gas grid and the CelZa pipeline linking to Spain as part of the H2Med corridor.

This more pragmatic stance signals a strategic pivot, focused on aligning hydrogen policy with domestic industrial needs and long-term economic resilience.

Finland: In October, the Finnish government announced plans to finalise its dedicated hydrogen law by the end of 2025, with implementation scheduled for 2026. The legislation will clarify rules for production, transmission, ownership, pricing and safety, replacing the current reliance on natural gas regulations.

State-owned Gasgrid is already progressing with the national hydrogen network and the 2,500km Nordic-Baltic Hydrogen Corridor. Environmental assessments have also begun, with Worley appointed to lead front-end engineering through 2028.

Finland’s proactive approach aims to provide greater regulatory certainty, supporting its position as a key player in Northern Europe.

Germany: Germany’s hydrogen strategy came under scrutiny in October following a report from the federal audit office, which called for a revision to safeguard both climate and economic goals. The report criticised slow progress towards the country’s 10GW (6.6 GW(LHV)) 2030 target and flagged financial risks associated with the planned 9,000km hydrogen core network.

Despite these concerns, the German government advanced several key measures last month. The federal cabinet approved the draft Hydrogen Acceleration Act, which aims to streamline permitting for hydrogen production, imports, storage, and infrastructure. The law will designate hydrogen projects as being of ‘overriding public interest,’ giving them priority in planning and legal processes. Amendments to the Federal Mining Act will also permit natural hydrogen exploration in the country.

Germany also plans to review and potentially overhaul its renewable hydrogen support framework. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWK) acknowledged that the market has underperformed, prompting a review of funding schemes and a shift toward imports and cost-efficiency. Current programmes include €2.6 billion for H2Global import auctions, €4.6 billion for the Hy2Infra network, €30 million per project for overseas hydrogen investments, and a €6 billion Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD) to support industrial decarbonisation, which opened for applications for its second round in October.

Looking ahead, policy is expected to focus on reducing system costs by optimising electrolyser siting and utilising excess renewable power. Germany also plans to open capacity reservations for its hydrogen core network in 2026, a key enabler for market activation. The country’s hydrogen policy is shifting towards ensuring execution, focusing on cost discipline, infrastructure readiness, and streamlined governance to restore investor confidence.",https://www.westwoodenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Webpage-Header-H2Compass.jpg,N,,2025-11-18 04:56:12.880493

Most of this is coming from the major classification societies – all have recently published studies which confirm the viability of nuclear as an emission-free power source. And shipbuilders and designers are starting to come up with firm proposals.

It is tempting to speculate on why this might be. After all, the focus has been on using future fuels like ammonia, methanol or hydrogen, with ‘bridging’ fuels like LNG and bio-diesel being promoted to fill the gap between realisation on the need to cut emissions – both quickly and significantly – and the alternative fuels becoming available.

It’s true to say that the green revolution has - temporarily we hope - stalled. Some of this feeling is no doubt down to the still-unanswered questions of when, and how, supplies of future fuels will be available in the quantities, and at affordable cost, to satisfy the considerable demands of the world’s shipping fleet alongside other hard-to-abate industries.

Classification society DNV and the World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) ESG team on Monday (17 November) published a new guide to help shipowners navigate evolving challenges, an effort supported by industry organizations in Hong Kong and worldwide.

The guide was created in response to the maritime industry experiencing a period of significant transformation, driven by rapidly evolving regulations, increasing commercial pressure, and a global shift towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The Net-Zero Guide: Practical Approaches for Global Shipping Companies provides a structured roadmap for advancing decarbonization. Drawing on data-driven insights and real-world operator experience, the guide offers actionable steps for shipowners to align operational and investment decisions with both international and regional regulations.

It also helps companies navigate uncertainties, adopt best practices, and take pragmatic actions that prepare them for future changes in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO, DNV Maritime, said: “Shipping’s decarbonization journey continues despite the postponement at the IMO. The reality is that energy efficiency and fuel flexibility or readiness are still considered and implemented on vessels. Continuing on this course will maintain competitiveness and contribute to the sector’s long-term decarbonization goals. The collaboration with World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) on this guide is itself a testament to the importance of working together to pave the way for successful decarbonization.”

Mr. Wang Yong Xin, the President of China Merchants Energy Shipping (CMES), said: “The Net-Zero Guide offers the industry a wealth of practical reference cases in a complex transition environment, helping shipping companies strike a balance between short-term operations and long-term emissions reduction.”

The guide addresses the increasing complexity and cost of compliance, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and outlines procedures to manage costs while supporting the transition of fleets toward net-zero emissions. It also sets out cost-effective actions, such as energy-efficiency upgrades, phased fuel transitions, and targeted fleet renewal or retrofits, to control expenses and avoid stranded assets. By aligning investments with operational improvements and market expectations, shipowners can strengthen their commercial resilience and position themselves for long-term success.

Shipowners are also urged to embed decarbonization into their core business strategies. This includes linking compliance with fleet investment and financing, while adopting a lifecycle approach to fleet management that balances renewal, retrofits, and operational optimization.

Structured competence development and robust change management are essential to building organizational capability and supporting sustainable growth. By leveraging partnerships across the value chain and investing in digitalization and data governance, companies can enhance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term efficiencies.

Once a week, bunker intelligence platform ENGINE will publish a snapshot of alternative and conventional bunker fuel prices in the world’s two biggest bunkering hubs. The following is the latest snapshot:

17 November 2025

Rotterdam’s B100–LSMGO spread above $400/mt

B100’s discount to LNG widens in Rotterdam

LNG edges closer to VLSFO for high methane slip engines

Rotterdam’s B100 discount to VLSFO has widened by $15/mt to $118/mt, and its discount to LSMGO has gone up by $22/mt to $420/mt.

For vessels sailing between Rotterdam and non-EU ports, B100 is now only $53/mt costlier than LSMGO. This gap has narrowed by about $59/mt from last week’s $112/mt.

B100 has also become cheaper than LNG in Rotterdam, by around $11/mt.

B100’s discount to LNG for vessels with Otto medium-speed (Otto MS) engines has widened to $217/mt, while the discount for vessels with diesel slow-speed (diesel SS) engines has increased to $79/mt.

For Otto MS engines, LNG’s premium over VLSFO in Rotterdam has narrowed by a modest $4/mt in the past week, to $29/mt. For diesel SS engines, LNG stands at a $109/mt discount to VLSFO.

Liquid fuels

Rotterdam’s VLSFO price has increased by $16/mt over the past week, while LSMGO has gained by a greater $23/mt. Fuel availability has improved slightly in the wider ARA bunkering hub, but prompt supplies remain tight for all fuel grades.

Rotterdam’s B100 price has been broadly steady, edging up by $1/mt. The Dutch HBE rebate for marine B100 has increased by $17/mt this week, adding some downward pressure on the benchmark.

Antwerp-Bruges’ biofuel bunker sales rose by 33% from the second quarter to 56,000 mt in the third quarter. That was the highest level since the port authority started reporting biofuel sales in the third quarter of 2024.

Singapore’s VLSFO price has not moved much in the past week, while its B100 price has jumped by $37/mt.

Demand for conventional bunker fuels remains subdued in Singapore. VLSFO delivery times vary widely among suppliers, ranging from 3-12 days.

Liquid gases

Rotterdam’s LNG price has gained by $12/mt on the week, and its LBM price has gained by $8/mt.

LNG bunker sales in the Port of Antwerp-Bruges fell by 22% between the second and third quarters. Around 69,000 mt of LNG was sold in the third quarter, according to the port authority.

Singapore’s LNG bunker price has edged up by $3/mt in the past week.

LNG is priced at a $43/mt premium over VLSFO in Singapore when consumed in Otto MS engines, but at a $26/mt discount to VLSFO when used in diesel SS engines.

In the political arena, they should vote out so-called “climate deniers.” In the economic sphere, carbon taxes are offered as a technocratic quick fix to carbon emissions.
Carbon taxes are not a matter of scientific fact.
In the case of carbon taxes, the time horizon selected plays a major role in the outcome.
Carbon taxes, if sufficiently high, can prevent or significantly delay these processes, thereby undermining their supposed purpose.","Unelected regulators and bureaucrats from the United Nations have pushed for crushing the global economy in the name of saving the planet.

In October, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a specialized agency within the U.N., proposed a carbon tax in order to slash the emissions of shipping vessels. This comes after the IMO’s April 2025 decision to adopt net-zero standards for global shipping.

Had the IMO agreed to the regulation, it would have been the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions. Thankfully, the United States was able to effectively shut down those proposals; however, while these regulations have been temporarily halted, the erroneous ideas behind them continue to grow in support.

Proponents of carbon taxes generally argue that since climate change is an existential threat to human existence, drastic measures must be taken in all aspects of our lives to address the projected costs. People should eat less meat and use public transportation more often. In the political arena, they should vote out so-called “climate deniers.” In the economic sphere, carbon taxes are offered as a technocratic quick fix to carbon emissions. Is any of this worth it? Or are the benefits greater than the costs? In the case of climate change, the answer is no.

Carbon taxes are not a matter of scientific fact. As with all models, the assumptions drive the analysis. In the case of carbon taxes, the time horizon selected plays a major role in the outcome. So, too, does the discount rate and the specific integrated assessment models.

In other words, “Two economists can give vastly different estimates of the social cost of carbon, even if they agree on the objective facts underlying the analysis.” If the assumptions are subjective, as they are in carbon taxes, then they are not scientific facts. As I’ve pointed out, “carbon pricing models are as much political constructs as they are economic tools.” One must also ask whether carbon taxes will remain unchanged or gradually increase over time to advance other political agendas. In this proposal, the answer is that it increases over time.

Additionally, since these models are driven by assumptions, one would be right in asking who gets to impose these taxes? Of course, those would be the unelected bureaucrats at the IMO. No American who would be subject to these taxes ever voted for the people attempting to create the “world’s first global carbon tax.” It brings to mind the phrase “no taxation without representation.”

In an ironic twist, imposing carbon taxes on global shipping might actually be one of the worst ways to slash emissions, given the enormous gains from trade. Simply put, trade makes the world grow rich. Not just wealthy nations like those in the West, but every nation, even the most poor, grows richer. In wealthy countries, trade can help address climate change by enabling adaptation and innovation. For poorer countries, material gains from trade can help prevent their populations from starving and also help them advance along the environmental Kuznets curve.

In other words, the advantages of trade can, over time, make a country go from being so poor that a high level of air pollution is necessary for its survival to being rich enough to afford reducing or eliminating pollution. Carbon taxes, if sufficiently high, can prevent or significantly delay these processes, thereby undermining their supposed purpose. Not to mention, as of today, maritime shipping accounts for only about 3% of total global emissions.

The same ingenuity that brought us modern shipping will continue to power the global economy and fund growth and innovation, if we let it. The world does not need a layer of global bureaucracy for the sake of virtue signaling. What it needs is an understanding of both economics and human progress.

History shows that prosperity, innovation, and free trade are what make societies cleaner, healthier, and richer. Our choice is not between saving the planet and saving the economy; it is between free societies and free markets or surrendering responsibility to unelected international regulators and busybodies. The former has lifted billions out of poverty, and the latter threatens to drag us all backwards.

Olsen Cruise Lines hosted a pivotal roundtable discussion aboard the Borealis on 12th November 2025, inviting UK government officials and energy sector leaders to explore the future of the cruise industry in a low-carbon world. The event, held at Portsmouth International Port Cruise Terminal, provided a platform for key stakeholders to delve into the critical steps needed to achieve net zero emissions in the cruise sector.

The gathering, facilitated by the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), united experts from across various sectors, including the Energy Networks Association, Ofgem, the National Energy System Operator, and officials from the Department for Transport and the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero. The roundtable was part of an ongoing dialogue aimed at identifying actionable solutions to accelerate the cruise industry’s shift towards sustainable practices.

A Collaborative Approach to Decarbonizing the Cruise Sector

The roundtable centred on the cruise industry’s ambitious net zero target by 2050, in line with the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2023 strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions from maritime vessels. CLIA, which led the discussions, emphasized the importance of cross-industry collaboration in shaping a sustainable future for cruising.

A major focus was the industry’s transition to cleaner energy, specifically the role of Onshore Power Supply (OPS) systems. OPS technology enables cruise ships to draw electricity directly from the shore grid while docked, thus eliminating the need for onboard diesel generators and significantly reducing emissions while at port.

Portsmouth’s Role in the Green Transition

One of the most significant initiatives highlighted was the installation of OPS at Portsmouth, where a new system is being rolled out. The project is expected to reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 20,000 metric tonnes annually starting in 2027. This effort aligns with the UK’s broader decarbonisation goals and marks a key milestone in advancing sustainable energy solutions for the cruise industry.

The roundtable discussions underscored that transitioning to OPS and other clean technologies is vital for reducing the environmental impact of the cruise sector. As the industry embraces innovative energy solutions, the partnership between government, energy stakeholders, and cruise operators will play a central role in meeting the ambitious sustainability targets set for the coming decades.

The collaboration fostered at Portsmouth reflects the shared commitment to reducing the cruise industry’s carbon footprint and further establishes the UK as a leader in green maritime technology.

Mike Sellers, Director at Portsmouth International Port, commented: “It’s evident there is a real appetite for sustainable fuel technology. While delivering this innovative system is not without its challenges, it was great to know that there’s a support and willingness for this to be a success.”

Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines has pledged to incorporate Onshore Power Supply (OPS) on its sister ships, Borealis and Bolette, wherever possible, while continuing to invest in low-carbon technologies aimed at shaping a more sustainable cruising future. Recent enhancements to the vessels include the application of silicone-based hull coatings and the installation of advanced propeller systems, both designed to improve hydrodynamic efficiency and optimize fuel performance.

During the event, attendees were also given the exclusive chance to explore behind the scenes aboard the Borealis, with guided tours that included the Engine Control Room, Shore Power Room, Recycling Centre, and the Bridge. These tours offered valuable insight into the cruise line’s operations and the sustainability initiatives being adopted to reduce its environmental footprint.

Samantha Stimpson, CEO of Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, said: “We are proud to have hosted this important discussion aboard Borealis and help shape the cruise industry’s path toward net zero emissions. Achieving net zero by 2050 is ambitious, which makes events like this vital for identifying practical strategies and collaborative solutions.

“For us, sustainability is more than a goal – it’s a responsibility. By adopting solutions such as shore power and working hand in hand with government and industry partners, we can make meaningful progress in reducing our impact and protecting the oceans we sail and the destinations we’re privileged to visit.”

Andy Harmer OBE, Managing Director of CLIA UK & Ireland, added: “The Roundtable hosted onboard Borealis was a great opportunity to discuss the importance of Onshore Power Supply which is a crucial component of our industry’s decarbonisation journey. Over 50% of the global cruise fleet is already able to plug in, allowing ships to turn off their engines for emissions reductions of up to 98%.

“CLIA has a vital role in bringing industry together with Governments, raising the importance of environmental technologies and practices so that we can work together in our pursuit of net zero emissions by 2050.”

The event highlighted the crucial role of collaboration between cruise lines, ports, and government bodies in reaching decarbonisation goals and the overarching target of achieving net zero emissions. Industry-wide, operators are implementing strategies like Onshore Power Supply (OPS), alternative fuels, and energy-efficient technologies to drive faster progress towards these objectives.

The company is already gaining ammonia expertise by operating its ammonia-fuelled tugboat -Sakuyake, Takaya Soga, president and CEO of NYK, said at the opening of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 on Monday.

""The development and introduction of ammonia-fuelled vessels is positioned as our main scenario,"" Soga said at the event.

""We see ammonia as a core next-generation marine fuel.""

The firm has previously talked of other alternative marine fuels including methanol and LNG as being under consideration for its decarbonisation plans.

The Sakuyake had completed a three-month demonstration voyage in March 2025, during which it achieved a GHG emission reduction of up to 95%.

Ammonia is recognized for its ability to produce zero harmful emissions, making it a key solution for decarbonization in the shipping industry, he said.

Soga said that NYK is also advancing operational expertise to handle ammonia safety.

He highlighted the ship-to-ship ammonia cargo transfer that took place between the NYK-owned ammonia carrier Berlian Ekuator and Eco Enchanted off Spain in September 2025.

""This achievement demonstrates the safety and the practicality of large-scale ammonia transportation,"" Soga said.

Despite progress, Soga argued that the main challenge remains the high cost of green ammonia.

""So the foundation for using ammonia as a marine fuel is in place, but the main barrier right now is cost,"" Soga said.

""Green ammonia, specifically blue or green ammonia, is still much more expensive than traditional options.

""On the other hand, currently, numerous grey ammonia plants exist globally.""

Soga sees these grey ammonia plants to play a foundational role in the development of blue and green ammonia plants in the future.

As explained, the city’s long-term vision is to serve as the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade.","Addressing the opening ceremony on 17 November, Chief Executive John Lee highlighted the challenges of geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change. The theme for Hong Kong Maritime Week, “Navigating to a Greener Future,” signals a shared destination for the industry. Complementing this, the theme of the World Maritime Merchants Forum, “Steering Sustainability Through Changes,” serves as a navigational chart for the journey ahead. Together, the themes aim to serve as a warning and a call for coordinated action.

In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action.

…said John Lee.

According to the Chief Executive, in this era of profound and complex transformation, Hong Kong’s role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of “one country, two systems” remains the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s success, providing a foundation for continued development.

As the nation’s only bilingual common law jurisdiction, Hong Kong offers a simple and low tax regime, free-port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

Furthermore, for the sixth consecutive year, the city has ranked fourth globally in the International Shipping Centre Development Index, reflecting strengths in port infrastructure, maritime services and the overall operating environment.

According to Lee, Hong Kong’s tax concession regime for high value-added maritime services continues to attract global businesses. Additionally, plans are also underway to extend half-rate tax concessions to physical commodity traders, further integrating the pillars of trade, commodities and shipping within the city.

Green transition

Beyond its business-friendly foundations, Hong Kong is firmly oriented towards the future, particularly the imperative of green growth which is the defining challenge and opportunity of this generation, according to Lee.

With the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero Framework (IMO NZF) targeting net-zero carbon emissions in international shipping by around 2050, Hong Kong aims to play a leading role as a premier green maritime fuel-bunkering centre.

Since publishing our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering a year ago, we have materialised regular commercial liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkering. Our vision is to become the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. And our proximity to the Chinese Mainland, the world’s largest producer of green maritime fuel, is a critical advantage.

…John Lee highlighted.

As explained, the city’s long-term vision is to serve as the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. The proximity to the Chinese Mainland provides a critical strategic advantage and collaboration with maritime associations and business partners worldwide will continue to drive the transition toward sustainability.

Call for collaboration

Collaboration on an unprecedented scale is essential, particularly in the face of geopolitical tensions, trade protectionism, technological disruption and the climate crisis, issues far too extensive for any single economy to resolve alone.

Let’s work together to build green shipping corridors and digital trade lanes that will define the future of safe, efficient and sustainable global shipping.

…Lee noted.

John Lee reaffirmed that Hong Kong stands prepared to serve as a committed partner, through policy support, professional expertise and strategic vision as the city is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in navigating the next era of global shipping and advancing a more sustainable and collaborative future.

Together, we can steer a course towards a more sustainable, prosperous and collaborative future.

In response, DNV and the World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) ESG team have published a new guide to help shipowners navigate these evolving challenges, an effort supported by industry organizations in Hong Kong and worldwide.

The ""Net-Zero Guide: Practical Approaches for Global Shipping Companies"" provides a structured roadmap for advancing decarbonization. Drawing on data-driven insights and real-world operator experience, the guide offers actionable steps for shipowners to align operational and investment decisions with both international and regional regulations. It also helps companies navigate uncertainties, adopt best practices, and take pragmatic actions that prepare them for future changes in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO, DNV Maritime said: “Shipping’s decarbonization journey continues despite the postponement at the IMO. The reality is that energy efficiency and fuel flexibility or readiness are still considered and implemented on vessels. Continuing on this course will maintain competitiveness and contribute to the sector’s long-term decarbonization goals. The collaboration with World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) on this guide is itself a testament to the importance of working together to pave the way for successful decarbonization.”

Mr. Wang Yong Xin, the President of China Merchants Energy Shipping (CMES) said: “The Net-Zero Guide offers the industry a wealth of practical reference cases in a complex transition environment, helping shipping companies strike a balance between short-term operations and long-term emissions reduction.”

The guide addresses the increasing complexity and cost of compliance, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and outlines procedures to manage costs while supporting the transition of fleets toward net-zero emissions. It also sets out cost-effective actions, such as energy-efficiency upgrades, phased fuel transitions, and targeted fleet renewal or retrofits, to control expenses and avoid stranded assets. By aligning investments with operational improvements and market expectations, shipowners can strengthen their commercial resilience and position themselves for long-term success.

Shipowners are also urged to embed decarbonization into their core business strategies. This includes linking compliance with fleet investment and financing, while adopting a lifecycle approach to fleet management that balances renewal, retrofits, and operational optimization. Structured competence development and robust change management are essential to building organizational capability and supporting sustainable growth. By leveraging partnerships across the value chain and investing in digitalization and data governance, companies can enhance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term efficiencies.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Net-Zero-Guide_cover.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 10:57:23.321637

“Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry.
At what point will shipping wake up to the fact that we can and must ‘Do No Harm’?","Fresh from rubbishing LNG at Nor-Shipping in June, speaking at COP30 Fortescue Chairman Andrew Forrest called for the maritime sector to “expose the thugs” that used “gangster tactics” to delay the IMO’s net zero framework (NZF).

The IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee met in a special session in October to approve the NZF that laid a pathway to net zero shipping by 2050, and which was finally agreed in April this year.

Prior to the October Extraordinary Session at the IMO US officials aided by Saudi Arabian representatives had made efforts to scupper the NZF in its entirety, threatening nation states with reprisals if they voted for the regulations.

IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez remained upbeat believing that the NZF would be passed, but ultimately it was agreed to delay its implementation by a year.

In a panel discussion organised by the IMO’s head of climate action Roel Hoenders and moderated by Lloyd’s Register’s Katherine Palmer, at COP30, an audience member asked, “how we will prevent another debacle at the following MEPC-ES2?”

Andrew Forrest responded: “The IMO did not fail. Thugs who, knowing that they had lost on the inside, reverted to gangster tactics outside the building, threatening countries and individuals.”

According to Forrest the solution to defeating these subversives was transparency.

“Expose the thugs. If we let the world know what they're doing as they're doing it, they will lose their power.”

He added that he and others would do what they could to indemnify those under threat.

Australian miner Fortescue has thrown its weight behind green ammonia as the way forward to decarbonise shipping and transport operations.

The maritime industry, however, remains divided with those closer to consumers, such as container ship operators, generally for a global regulation and those that operate general cargo vessels, such as tankers and bulk operators against.

The World Shipping Council along with the International Chamber of Shipping and three other industry bodies released a statement shortly after the Extraordinary Meeting in October backing the IMO.

“Only global rules will decarbonise a global industry. Without the Framework, shipping would risk a growing patchwork of unilateral regulations, increasing costs without effectively contributing to decarbonisation,” said the letter.

Meanwhile, speaking at October’s Cyprus Maritime conference Greek shipping magnate George Procopiou told the audience: “It is the first time that shipowners and environmentalists are aligned, all of us want less pollution. But he added, no green fuels are available. “If there is a good quality fuel that makes less emissions, tell us where to buy it.”

Madadh MacLaine, the Secretary-Generalat Zero Emission Ship Technology Association told Seatrade Maritime News: ""Shipping needs to accept the fact that we cannot continue to pollute the ocean. We've crossed the planetary boundary for ocean acidification, and yet shipping continues the fantasy of using so called “ZNZ” fuels that release CO2 and other toxins into the atmosphere and marine environment.”

MacLaine added: “The ocean is the Earth's regulatory system, covering more than 70% of its surface. Shipping views it as a means for trade, but over 3 billion people rely on it for food—and all of us rely on it for oxygen. At what point will shipping wake up to the fact that we can and must ‘Do No Harm’?

Drawing on data-driven insights and real-world operator experience, the guide offers actionable steps for shipowners to align operational and investment decisions with both international and regional regulations as they stand. It also helps companies navigate uncertainties, adopt best practices, and take pragmatic actions that prepare them for future changes in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO, DNV Maritime said: “Shipping’s decarbonization journey continues despite the postponement at the IMO. The reality is that energy efficiency and fuel flexibility or readiness are still considered and implemented on vessels. Continuing on this course will maintain competitiveness and contribute to the sector’s long-term decarbonization goals. The collaboration with World Maritime Merchants Forum (WMMF) on this guide is itself a testament to the importance of working together to pave the way for successful decarbonization.”

Mr. Wang Yong Xin, president of China Merchants Energy Shipping (CMES) said: “The Net-Zero Guide offers the industry a wealth of practical reference cases in a complex transition environment, helping shipping companies strike a balance between short-term operations and long-term emissions reduction.”

The guidance acknowledges the growing complexity and rising costs of regulatory compliance, challenges that are particularly acute for small and medium-sized operators. It provides practical procedures to help manage expenditure while progressing towards net-zero operations. Among the recommended measures are incremental improvements in energy efficiency, staged transitions to alternative fuels, and selective fleet renewal or retrofitting, enabling shipowners to mitigate financial risk and avoid assets becoming prematurely obsolete. By aligning investment decisions with operational performance and evolving market expectations, owners can bolster commercial resilience and secure their long-term competitiveness.

A key message is the need for decarbonisation to become integral to strategic planning rather than a parallel exercise. This involves closely linking compliance requirements with fleet investment and financing decisions, supported by a lifecycle approach that considers renewal, retrofits, and operational efficiency as interconnected elements. The guidance also emphasises the importance of building internal capability through structured competence development and effective change management. Strengthened collaboration across the maritime value chain, together with greater use of digital tools and sound data governance, is highlighted as a means to improve transparency, ensure regulatory alignment, and drive lasting efficiency gains.",https://d3f3h35mrzf979.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/7/1/7/334717_knutrbecknilssen_ceomaritime_dnv_large_531274.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 10:57:30.706234

The “Net-Zero Guide: Practical Approaches for Global Shipping Companies” aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing decarbonization, drawing on data-driven insights and real-world operator experience.

According to the report, given the ongoing fragmentation and rapid evolution of regulatory and commercial frameworks, compliance requirements are becoming increasingly complex and costly.

This is particularly challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which must navigate overlapping requirements across jurisdictions and develop holistic strategies that integrate technology adaptation, value-chain transformation, and responsiveness to shifting market dynamics.

Shipowners are urged to embed decarbonization into their core business strategies. This includes linking compliance with fleet investment and financing, while adopting a lifecycle approach to fleet management that balances renewal, retrofits and operational optimization.

Furthermore, structured competence development and robust change management are essential to building organizational capability and supporting sustainable growth. By leveraging partnerships across the value chain and investing in digitalization and data governance, companies can enhance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term efficiencies.

“Supplying renewable bio-LNG to TT-Line’s ferries allows us to contribute to lower emissions in shipping,” said Markus Pille, Managing Director of EnviTec Energy.

The move comes in response to the EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation, which sets mandatory limits on the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels used on ships over 5,000 gross tonnes in commercial passenger or freight service.

The rules remain in effect while the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has delayed its decision on a global “Net Zero Framework,” which would have introduced a CO₂ pricing system and a pathway for shipping to reach climate neutrality by 2050.

Torben Nikolay, CFO of TT-Line, noted that Peter Pan and her sister ship Nils Holgersson are the largest LNG-powered Ro-Pax ferries worldwide.

“These ships go beyond simply meeting regulatory requirements. We aim to prepare our fleet for a more sustainable future. Earlier this year, we carried out several bio-LNG deliveries by bunker barge, and this agreement with EnviTec allows us to refuel by truck as well,” he said.

TT-Line operates routes connecting German Baltic ports at Travemünde and Rostock with Świnoujście in Poland and Klaipėda in Lithuania, as well as southern Swedish ports including Trelleborg and Karlshamn.

​Following are the closing remarks by the Secretary for Transport and Logistics, Ms Mable Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Mr Grimaldi (Chairman of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), Mr Emanuele Grimaldi), your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, all the distinguished guests that have come to this summit today,

Good afternoon. As we bring this impactful Summit to a close, may I express my gladness seeing that our discussions in the past two days have powerfully demonstrated how our global maritime community is navigating shared challenges - from trade realignment and supply chain resilience to financing our industry’s future. These dialogues have been frank and collaborative, as to be seen from our closed-door session yesterday as well as today's sessions, reflecting our common goal and the spirit of partnership we all value. During the summit, we have heard a number of buzzwords: fragmentation, deglobalisation, protectionism, unpredictability, collaboration, partnership and most important of all - solutions.

Scene setting

In an era of volatility, isolation or unilateralism is certainly not the solution. It must be forged through partnership. The government's role is not to direct, but to enable - to build the fundamental and foundational backbone that allows the private sector to innovate, invest and thrive. This philosophy underpins our recent establishment in Hong Kong of the Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board (HKMPDB) under the able leadership of the Honourable Dr Moses Cheng (Chairman of the HKMPDB, Dr Moses Cheng Mo-chi), ensuring government and industry work as co-pilots in shaping our maritime future.

Guided by this principle and bolstered by our nation's strong support, Hong Kong adopts a clear dual strategy: reinforcing the resilience of our local maritime ecosystem, while expanding opportunities in the Chinese Mainland and in the rest of the world.

First, we are enhancing both our port competitiveness and world-class maritime services. Our port's efficiency remains a key advantage, with vessel-handling speeds nearly double the global average - earning us the ""catch-up port"" reputation. We are capitalising on this by establishing a comprehensive ""rail-sea-land-river"" intermodal system to extend our cargo hinterland into inland provinces of the Chinese Mainland. Meanwhile, we are not only driving digital and green transformation through launching a new Port Community System for real-time cargo tracking amongst all stakeholders, we are also working, with the port operators, toward reducing our Kwai Tsing Container Terminals' carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

Complementing our port assets, we have an unparalleled cluster of over 1 200 shipping and maritime service companies, including the world's top ship managers, major protection and indemnity clubs and leading financers, as supported by one of the world’s largest fleets by gross tonnage flying the Hong Kong flag. To future-proof this leadership, we are streamlining our shipping registry procedures, enhancing tax incentives for the ship lessors and shipping commercial principals as well as introducing tax concessions for commodity traders, with legislative amendments coming right next year. Further, we will strengthen collaboration with international marine insurance organisations to upscale the training of marine insurance talents, whilst expanding the scope of the Maritime and Aviation Training Fund to cover more green energy courses, thereby reinforcing Hong Kong maritime strengths.

Secondly, we are proactively forging international partnerships to unlock new growth potential and solidify our role as a global ""super connector"". To counter protectionism, we are building partner port relationships with strategic ports in the Chinese Mainland and key Belt and Road regions for enhancing mutual competitiveness and resilience. Do expect our announcement of the first batch of our partner ports shortly later today. At the same time, central to this strategy is the Hong Kong Maritime Week itself, including the ICS World Trade Summit - our cornerstone platform for deepening international exchanges and collaboration. Every November, this gathering transforms our city into a vital nexus where global industry leaders converge to shape and drive positive changes for the future of the maritime trade. I am excited to share with you that we will be welcoming the Silk Road Maritime Association's summit one year from now during Hong Kong Maritime Week 2026, so stay tuned. This event and the week-long event will foster a strategic dialogue to unlock new opportunities in Belt and Road shipping for Hong Kong and the global community.

Despite the postponement in the IMO(International Maritime Organization)'s schedule, which we touched upon a lot during these two days, we, in Hong Kong remain steadfast in advancing our pace to strengthen and solidify Hong Kong's role as an international green maritime fuel bunkering and trading hub. Our prime location at the southern tip of China places us at the crossroads of international fairways, ideal for serving the global shipping community's bunkering needs. We rank seventh globally in shipping fuel bunkering, second in China and first in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Since the first LNG (liquefied natural gas) bunkering operation in February this year, over 200 000 metric tonnes of biodiesel and LNG have been bunkered in Hong Kong, involving a total of 13 LNG bunkering operations. Having established biodiesel and LNG bunkering, we are pioneering the next-generation fuels - including methanol, ammonia, and hydrogen. We will commence feasibility studies for ammonia and hydrogen bunkering and mandate mass flow meters for methanol operations by next year. Further, leveraging our nation's green fuel supply advantages and Hong Kong's robust financial infrastructure, we are developing a global green maritime fuel trading centre, hosting various matchmaking events to catalyse supply chains and support our nation in reinforcing its leadership in this emerging sector.

The geopolitical landscape today affirms that the old rulebook is being rewritten. In this new chapter, Hong Kong's value proposition under ""one country, two systems"" becomes more relevant than ever after - offering a stable, sophisticated common law platform with a trusted legal framework, free flow of capital and information, as well as professional expertise that de-risks global trade. Hong Kong is here to serve and facilitate you to not just navigate today's challenges, but seize tomorrow's opportunities.

Ladies and gentlemen, while this Summit is about to conclude, I trust that the collaboration and dialogue will go on. As Hong Kong Maritime Week continues with other events, I look forward to welcoming you there.

Thank you to the ICS, our co-organisers, and all of you for your invaluable contributions. Congratulations to the ICS for, once again, hosting and staging such a successful summit this year. I wish you a productive remainder of your time in Hong Kong and enjoy the buzz and the nice weather outside of the Asia's World City. Thank you.

Speech by CE at Opening Ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 cum World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025

Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at the Opening Ceremony of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 cum World Maritime Merchants Forum 2025 today (November 17):

Honourable Vice Chairman C Y Leung (Vice-Chairman of National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference), Honourable Director Zhou Ji (Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government (CPG) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)), Vice Minister Fu Xuyin (Vice Minister of Transport), Deputy Head Chen Feng (Deputy Head, Office for Safeguarding National Security of the CPG in the HKSAR), Acting Commissioner Li Yongsheng (Acting Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the HKSAR), Chairman Miao Jianmin (Chairman of China Merchants Group), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. A very warm welcome to Hong Kong, Asia's world city, and to the opening of Hong Kong Maritime Week 2025 and the fifth World Maritime Merchants Forum, which bring together our maritime cluster, and underline Hong Kong's status as one of the world's leading maritime centres.

The theme for the Hong Kong Maritime Week, ""Navigating to a Greener Future"", signals our shared destination. Complementing this, the theme of the World Maritime Merchants Forum, ""Steering Sustainability Through Changes"", is our navigational chart for the journey ahead.

In a world being reshaped by geopolitical discord, technological disruption and climate change, these themes are more than aspirational. They sound an alarm, a wake-up call to collective action.

In this era of profound and complex transformation, Hong Kong's role as a stable, reliable and dynamic maritime hub has never been more vital. The principle of ""one country, two systems"" is the cornerstone of our success, providing us with an unshakeable foundation.

As our country's only bilingual common law jurisdiction, Hong Kong offers a simple and low tax regime, free port status and the unfettered flow of capital, information and talent.

Our standing is consistently acknowledged, and endorsed, by the international community. For the sixth consecutive year, Hong Kong ranked fourth, globally, in the International Shipping Centre Development Index. This pays tribute to our strengths in port infrastructure, maritime services and overall operating environment.

Hong Kong is home to more than 1 200 port and maritime-related companies, a thriving cluster of global leaders in ship management, finance, insurance and law. The Hong Kong Shipowners Mutual Assurance Association's launch ceremony, in just a few minutes, will mark a milestone development, further enriching our maritime services and reinforcing Hong Kong's role as a ""super-connector"" and ""super value-adder"".

Our tax concession regime for high value-added maritime services continues to attract global businesses. And we are planning to extend half-rate tax concessions to physical commodity traders, further integrating the critical pillars of trade, commodities and shipping here in Hong Kong.

Beyond our business-friendly foundations, our focus is firmly on the future. And the imperative for green growth is the defining challenge, and opportunity, of our generation.

With the International Maritime Organization's Net-Zero Framework targeting to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in international shipping by around the year 2050, Hong Kong is determined to be at the forefront, as a premier green maritime fuel-bunkering centre.

Since publishing our Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering a year ago, we have materialised regular commercial liquefied natural gas and biodiesel bunkering.

Our vision is to become the epicentre of the global green maritime fuel trade. And our proximity to the Chinese Mainland, the world's largest producer of green maritime fuel, is a critical advantage. We will continue to collaborate with maritime associations and business partners globally to drive the transition towards sustainability.

Indeed, collaboration on an unprecedented scale is essential as we face challenges from geopolitical tensions, trade protectionism, technological disruption, and the climate crisis - issues too vast for any single economy to solve alone.

Let's work together to build green shipping corridors and digital trade lanes that will define the future of safe, efficient and sustainable global shipping.

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong is ready to be your partner. Our policy support, expertise, strategic vision and unwavering commitment can play a pivotal role in navigating the next era of shipping. Together, we can steer a course towards a more sustainable, prosperous and collaborative future.

I wish you all a rewarding Hong Kong Maritime Week, a productive World Maritime Merchants Forum, and fair winds and following seas, in business as in life.

Following is the speech by the Financial Secretary, Mr Paul Chan, at the Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit today (November 17):

Dr Emanuele Grimaldi (Chair of the International Chamber of Shipping), Your Excellencies, Ministers, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. It is a pleasure to welcome you all to the second Hong Kong Global Maritime Trade Summit, co-hosted by the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), the Hong Kong Shipowners Association, and the newly formed Hong Kong Maritime and Port Development Board.

This important event brings together more than 300 global maritime leaders from some 30 economies for vital dialogue and collaboration. Your presence speaks to the global significance of the discussions here.

I would like to thank the ICS for once again choosing Hong Kong to host this pivotal summit, casting a strong vote of confidence in us as an international maritime centre. Representing over 80 per cent of the world's merchant fleet, your leadership in shaping the global maritime agenda is unparalleled.

Building Resilience in an Age of Transformation

The theme of this Summit - ""Building Resilience, Driving Growth and Investment"" - speaks directly to our moment. Global maritime trade is no doubt facing headwinds: geopolitical tensions, tariff escalations, and new trade barriers are reshaping shipping routes and disrupting established patterns. The UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) Review of Maritime Transport 2025 forecasts seaborne trade growth of merely 0.5 per cent this year, down from 2.2 per cent in 2024 - the slowest pace in years. Vessel rerouting has pushed ton-miles to record levels, forcing ships to travel longer distances at higher cost.

Yet this is not necessarily a story of decline, but of transformation. Allow me to offer three observations.

Shifting maritime trade patterns

First, in my view, geopolitics will reshape rather than weaken maritime trade flows. Consider China. It has stood as the world's largest manufacturing economy for 15 consecutive years, commanding close to 30 per cent of global manufacturing output. It has an industrial ecosystem spanning the entire classification of industrial categories recognised by the United Nations. Despite talk of supply chain diversification, no country possesses China's completeness, scale, efficiency or integrated capacity. Indeed, supply chain reconfiguration arising from trade tensions is creating a complementary, not substitutional, relationship across the region.

While Southeast Asian nations are attracting more investments and manufacturing activities, in this process, they are reinforcing the two-way trade flow with China, in raw materials, components, semi-finished goods and finished products. As a matter of fact, China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) trade reached a record of some US$690 billion in the first eight months of 2025. Hong Kong, as a key re-export hub, has witnessed substantial growth in this business.

As a manufacturer, China will continue to demand vast quantities of raw materials and components from Southeast Asia, Africa and the Pacific (like Australia). Meanwhile, as a consumer market of 1.4 billion people with a rapidly expanding middle income group, China will drive continued growth in the import of food, fashion, electronics, and more.

At the same time, Southeast Asia, with approximately 700 million people with a median age of 32, is experiencing a significant demographic dividend. More importantly, their incomes are rising substantially. By 2030, ASEAN will contribute 140 million new consumers, representing 16 per cent of the world's new consumer class.

Beyond Asia, the broader Global South, currently accounting for 18 per cent of global GDP, is projected to grow at 4.2 per cent annually through 2029. By 2033, South-South trade is expected to approach US$14 trillion.

I believe this economic dynamism will be reshaping maritime trade. Intra-regional trade is emerging as a powerful engine of growth. Intra-Asia container volumes are projected to reach more than 42 million TEUs (Twenty Equipment Unit) by 2028, representing 3.8 per cent growth per year, outpacing the global average.

The maritime sector itself is evolving, too. Intra-regional trade is driving demand for smaller, fuel-efficient vessels optimised for short-sea shipping. Scheduling patterns are also shifting to accommodate new supply chains and regional trade growth. Bulk commodities remain dominant in seaborne trade, and containerised cargo - including consumer electronics, automotive components, and renewable energy products - is experiencing robust growth, particularly in intra-Asia routes.

Decarbonisation as both imperative and opportunity

My second observation is that decarbonisation of maritime operations is both an imperative and opportunity. The IMO (International Maritime Organization) has set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from international shipping by 2050. This is not environmental aspiration alone. It is regulatory reality.

To this end, the liner shipping industry is making substantial progress, with 79 per cent of the deadweight tonnage of container and vehicle carriers capable of operating on renewable fuels. Yet scaling green fuel production and creating financial mechanisms to support adoption remain challenging. It requires strong political commitment and cross-sectoral collaboration.

The opportunity is substantial. Maritime decarbonisation represents a multi-trillion-dollar investment opportunity through 2050. The transition to zero-emission marine fuels could create up to 4 million jobs globally across the energy supply chain. Here in Hong Kong, we are embracing this. For example, we have published an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering, positioning ourselves as a regional hub for sustainable fuel supply. Our goal is to provide bunkering services for green fuels to ocean-going vessels more than 60 times per year by 2030, involving over 200 000 tonnes of green maritime fuels.

Harnessing digital transformation

My third observation is on technology's transformative power. Ports and global container lines are commonly deploying artificial intelligence, blockchain and advanced data analytics to improve operational efficiency, optimise routes, and reduce downtime and carbon emissions. This is where Hong Kong also comes in, with our vibrant technology and startup community. Many of them are pioneering innovations in smart logistics. They can play a role not only in supporting our own transformation but also in serving the broader region.

Technology is also reshaping what is shipped and how. As consumer preferences shift and companies adopt new production methods, the mode of maritime trade also evolves. Consumers are now preferring sustainable, traceable products, driving demand for supply chain solutions that can verify environmental and social credentials in real time. Besides, the speed of technology adoption in operation and management will determine competitive success in this decade. Those who are able to digitalise their operations will reduce costs, capture market share, and be better able to meet the expectations of increasingly sophisticated customers and regulators.

Concluding remarks

Ladies and gentlemen, the maritime industry stands at a pivotal moment. Geopolitical fragmentation, shifting patterns of global commerce, climate imperatives and technological advancement are formidable forces. Yet they create opportunity precisely because they demand agility, innovation and vision.

Yes, the currents are shifting, and the waters may be uncharted. But like the explorers in the Age of Discovery, there lies tremendous opportunity for those with the vision to navigate with strategy, courage and conviction. I am convinced that the voyage ahead is one of extraordinary growth for those who are willing and ready.

On this note, I wish you all a most rewarding Summit, and the best of health and business in the time ahead.

And for those of you coming from afar, I would like to appeal to you: don’t just work, but enjoy the city. We have wonderful hiking trails, beaches, about 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants, great museums, and above all, we don’t impose duty on wine! And remember to shop till you drop! Thank you.
