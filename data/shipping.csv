Wärtsilä Marine in brief Wärtsilä Marine is a global pioneer in power, propulsion and lifecycle solutions for the marine market.","Technology group Wärtsilä will provide its advanced Wärtsilä 25 Ammonia solution to power a new cargo vessel for Norway-based Skarv Shipping Solutions. This vessel, which will be built at the Huanghai shipyard in China, will be the first newbuild to benefit from the solution. This marks a significant milestone in sustainable maritime innovation. The 4-stroke ammonia engine enables a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and supports Skarv Shipping Solutions' commitment to deliver sustainable short-sea shipping in Northern Europe. In addition to the engine, Wärtsilä will also supply the complete fuel gas supply system and exhaust after-treatment. The order with Wärtsilä was booked in Q4 2025.

Ammonia has emerged as a promising alternative fuel and will play a significant role in achieving the net-zero-emissions target for 2050. A report from Wärtsilä - ‘Sustainable fuels for shipping by 2050 – the 3 key elements of success’ - highlights the role that sustainable fuels will play in achieving this target which is set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). According to the report, existing decarbonisation solutions, such as fuel efficiency measures, could cut shipping emissions by up to 27 percent. Sustainable fuels, such as ammonia, are then a critical step in eliminating the remaining 73 percent.

“Our aim is to prove that it is possible to renew the European short-sea fleet while making it more climate-friendly. That means implementing a whole array of technologies. We see ammonia as one of the future fuels and are happy to see strong European companies like Wärtsilä leading the push towards carbon-free propulsion. The Wärtsilä 25 Ammonia solution promises exactly what we are looking for: robust safety and environmental measures combined with advanced energy efficient technology,” says Jan Øivind Svardal, CEO – Skarv Shipping Solutions.

Wärtsilä will supply the complete ammonia solution including the Wärtsilä 25 Ammonia engine, AmmoniaPac Fuel Gas Supply System, the Wärtsilä Ammonia Release Mitigation System (WARMS), and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system designed for ammonia. Safety, efficiency and reliability are central to Wärtsilä’s solution design. Total greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by at least 90% when running the engine on sustainable ammonia, compared to equivalent diesel engines. This allows operators to meet current EU emissions targets for 2050, and to also exceed the IMO target for 2040.

“The Wärtsilä 25 Ammonia engine and the whole solution is the result of extensive research and testing over a number of years, in line with our commitment to decarbonising shipping operations,” comments Roger Holm, President of Wärtsilä Marine & Executive Vice President at Wärtsilä Corporation. “Through our focus on continuous improvement, we have developed the Wärtsilä 25 engine, along with our associated ammonia handling systems, to deliver outstanding levels of safety, efficiency, reliability and sustainability. This solution offers the marine industry a future-ready solution that is available today.”

The Wärtsilä 25 Ammonia engine, which is available as part of the Wärtsilä 25 engine platform, was developed based on the company’s vast safety and operational experience gained from low pressure dual-fuel (DF) engines running on LNG. The equipment delivery for this newbuild is scheduled to begin in Q4 2026.

Associated British Ports (ABP), LBC Tank Terminals, North Sea Port and the Port of Esbjerg signed two memoranda of understanding during the International North Sea Summit in Hamburg, where regional leaders gathered to advance cross-border energy transition initiatives.

The agreements will explore the feasibility of dedicated CO2 shipping corridors linking industrial emitters in Northern Europe with offshore geological storage sites in the UK and Denmark.

The partnerships reflect growing interest in maritime transport as a flexible alternative to pipeline networks, particularly for industrial clusters located away from existing CO2 infrastructure. By connecting capture sites to storage hubs, port operators are positioning themselves as critical intermediaries in the emerging carbon logistics market.

Ports Expand Role in Carbon Transport Infrastructure

ABP has already secured planning approval for its Immingham Green Energy Terminal, which will serve as a handling hub for the Viking CCS project and connect shipped CO2 to depleted gas reservoirs in the UK Southern North Sea.

LBC Tank Terminals will contribute expertise in liquid bulk storage and terminal operations, supporting temporary CO2 storage, conditioning and transfer activities.

On the European mainland, North Sea Port plans to leverage its central location to consolidate captured emissions from multiple industrial zones before onward shipment offshore. Meanwhile, the Port of Esbjerg is advancing infrastructure for Denmark’s Greensand CCS project, including a new CO2 transit terminal with six large storage tanks currently under construction.

Relevant: First UK Offshore CCS Project Moves To Construction

Under the agreements, partners will jointly assess port design requirements, develop cross-border transport value chains and identify efficiency improvements across the CCUS logistics network.

Industry groups argue that regional coordination could unlock cost savings by increasing utilisation rates and creating scale. A recent analysis by the Carbon Capture and Storage Association suggests that integrating UK and EU transport and storage networks could reduce CO2 shipping and storage costs by up to 20%.

By aligning infrastructure investment across borders, North Sea ports aim to transform captured carbon into a new maritime commodity while strengthening their position in Europe’s low-carbon industrial transition.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/abp-carbon-capture-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 07:57:03.977370

Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono said the transport decarbonisation roadmap is expected to be finalised and released in May 2026 following coordination among ministries, state agencies and state-owned enterprises.

“We have a clear timeline. By May, we expect to have a final product for Indonesia’s transport decarbonisation roadmap,” Yudhoyono said at a town hall meeting on accelerating transport decarbonisation in Jakarta on Monday (Jan. 26, 2026).

Indonesia, which ratified the Paris Agreement in 2015, has reaffirmed its climate commitments in international forums. President Prabowo Subianto reiterated Indonesia’s pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2060 during the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025.

Yudhoyono said the commitment must be translated into concrete and measurable policies, noting that the transport sector is a key contributor to emissions from the energy sector.

Government data show the energy sector is Indonesia’s largest source of emissions, with transport accounting for around 22% of energy-related emissions. Road transport dominates the sector, contributing about 89%, while rail, aviation and maritime transport make up smaller shares.

“The biggest challenge lies in road transport, driven by rapid growth in vehicle numbers,” Yudhoyono said.

The government plans to prioritise the expansion of public transportation, including buses and rail systems, not only in the Greater Jakarta area but also in other metropolitan cities. Improving fuel efficiency and promoting lower-emission fuels for existing vehicles are also part of the near-term strategy.

In the medium to long term, Indonesia aims to accelerate the adoption of battery electric vehicles to reduce transport-related emissions.

“If the share of electric vehicles increases, emissions from the transport sector can be significantly reduced from 2030 to 2045 and beyond,” Yudhoyono said.

Rail transport is also expected to play a larger role, with plans to expand commuter lines, freight rail services and revive inactive railway routes. The government is pushing forward regulatory frameworks for the Trans-Sumatra, Trans-Kalimantan and Trans-Sulawesi railway networks.

In aviation, Indonesia is preparing regulations to support the use of sustainable aviation fuel, while the maritime sector will focus on developing green ports. Carbon offset mechanisms for transport subsectors are also being considered as part of the roadmap.",https://ecobiz.asia/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bersama-jajaran-@kemenkoinfra-saya-hadir-dalam-forum-Town-Hall-Meeting-Dekarbonisasi-Transportas-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 07:57:14.009194

Denmark looks to Beijing Meanwhile, a European diplomat said that Denmark – northern Europe’s premier maritime nation – and the Netherlands have themselves held separate meetings with China.
Another EU diplomat suggested that developments involving the US at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week point to a renewed European effort to re-engage Washington.","The EU is struggling to maintain a united front on a global agreement to cut maritime greenhouse gas emissions, as major European shipping countries side with China or the US.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) was supposed to rubber-stamp an agreement to transition to sustainable fuels, but with Washington threatening sanctions just days ahead of the October vote, Greece and Cyprus abstained. Others, including Saudi Arabia, sided with the US, and the vote was postponed for a year.

The defection rattled policymakers in Brussels, while ministers and diplomats privately expressed anger over Athens and Nicosia breaking ranks. Now, in the run-up to the delayed vote, Brussels is struggling to draft a new joint position.

The IMO is now divided between those backing the original deal – designed to replace cheap but highly polluting bunker fuels with climate-friendly biofuels and hydrogen-based alternatives – and those, led by the US and its allies, who favour liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a “transition fuel.”

As well as producing CO2 when burned, LNG comes with a heavy environmental footprint upstream. The provisionally agreed Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NZF) would apply a steadily increasing carbon price to maritime fuels, gradually pricing fossil hydrocarbons out of the market.

The US-Saudi camp

Athens struck the first blow, when it agreed during an official visit to Riyadh, to make an alternative joint proposal to overhaul the clean-shipping deal – a move widely seen as a public breaking of ranks with the EU, whose 27 members unanimously backed the NZF last year.

Brussels urged the bloc to maintain its unity after Euractiv reported on Greece’s intentions, while – Euractiv understands – pressuring Athens to clarify its stance.

Whatever may or may not have passed through diplomatic channels, Greece’s energy minister, Stavros Papastavrou, quickly rowed back earlier remarks in an interview with Mega TV.

“We will work first with our European partners,” he said.

“At present, however, there is a deadlock,” Papastavrou said. “We are cooperating to shape a mutually acceptable and realistic solution – first at European level, and then, over the course of the coming year, with the United States and other interested countries.”

Despite the minister’s assurances, Euractiv was told there is currently no EU-level coordination around a concrete proposal.

Denmark looks to Beijing

Meanwhile, a European diplomat said that Denmark – northern Europe’s premier maritime nation – and the Netherlands have themselves held separate meetings with China.

The diplomatic source told Euractiv that both countries “debriefed” their EU partners afterwards – something Athens did not do following its meeting with Saudi Arabian officials. Danish and Dutch diplomats reported that Beijing had signalled a willingness to de-escalate and seek common ground with Washington.

Meanwhile, asked by Euractiv to confirm the meetings, the Danish Maritime Authority said it routinely engages with a wide range of IMO member states on global climate regulation and the NZF in particular. “We are not in a position to share information about specific informal meetings,” it said.

Diplomacy in Davos

A separate diplomatic source suggested the onus now lies with Greece, having broken ranks in October, to help resolve the political impasse.

“Brussels expects them to come forward with a realistic proposal,” the diplomat told Euractiv.

The European Commission has said it stands ready to “build bridges” with all parties. Another EU diplomat suggested that developments involving the US at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week point to a renewed European effort to re-engage Washington.

“There has been a decision to avoid any kind of escalation with the US,” the diplomat said.

A long time coming

The IMO has spent years working towards a pathway to reduce the climate impact of a sector that accounts for close to 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other pollution linked to the fuels it uses.

In practice, the framework would tilt the market towards low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen, biofuels and synthetic e-fuels derived from renewable energy – a shift that would favour countries such as Denmark and China, which have invested heavily in these technologies.

The initiative now appears caught in a widening divide between a US that has embraced fossil fuel expansion during the first year of Donald Trump’s second term, and countries that have invested in clean technologies and stand to gain from pressing ahead with the energy transition.

Speaking at a media briefing, Dominguez stressed that IMO’s decarbonisation work was continuing but he was speaking to all parties and open to compromise over the exact formulation of the NZF. All parties should focus on what is already “on the table” and work from that, he stressed, adding that it was too soon to predict what resumption of NZF discussion in November would bring.

Dominguez also said governments continue to support the emissions reduction targets agreed in 2023, including cutting shipping emissions by 20–30% by 2030 and reaching net zero by or around 2050. While the 2030 emissions target is achievable, he noted that wider uptake of clean fuels may be slowed by high costs.

To remind, a decision on the Net Zero Framework, which would incentivise cleaner shipping through economic measures, was postponed until 2026 following a narrow vote at the IMO last October. In the recent press briefing, Dominguez urged continued dialogue to avoid fragmented regulations, particularly around the EU’s emissions trading system.

In particular, he called for greater clarity from the EU on how its ETS would be aligned with any future global system, warning that fragmented approaches could increase costs for ship operators and disrupt international trade. Finally, Dominguez stressed the importance of maintaining dialogue within the IMO to avoid regulatory duplication.

Industry voices, however, urged caution. For example, at a recent event organized by the Greek Shipping Co-operation Committee, Haralambos J. Fafalios, Chairman, highlighted that while new ships are being built with multi-fuel capabilities, green fuel supply will initially be limited by shore-based demand. He also stressed that alternative fuels such as ammonia remain largely unproven and pose safety concerns, and that carbon-free solutions are unlikely to be widely available for 10–20 years.

Fafalios argued that levying additional taxes without practical solutions risks placing a greater burden on consumers and that the NZF, without direct industry involvement in drafting, could amount to little more than symbolic regulation.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/55057232010_f28ec5587f_c.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:57:21.088981

More than four years on, the focus is increasingly shifting from policy frameworks to implementation, with short-sea Green Shipping Corridors widely recognised as the fastest and most viable way to move from commitment to delivery.
NatPower Marine’s route-based, fully funded infrastructure model removes the need for upfront capital investment by ferry operators, enabling decarbonisation to scale without compromising connectivity, affordability, or competitiveness.
Short-sea corridors show that when port-side power is in place, emissions fall immediately and commercially.
That is how Green Shipping Corridors move from policy commitment to operational delivery.”","Interferry, a global trade association for the ferry industry, has warned that ferry operators are facing rising costs under the EU Emissions Trading System faster than practical decarbonisation solutions are being deployed.

The warning potentially renews and intensifies scrutiny of how maritime decarbonisation commitments are being translated into action. Emissions are being priced before the infrastructure needed to reduce them is in place, says the group, raising costs for operators without yet delivering equivalent emissions reductions.

Green Shipping Corridors, formally launched at COP26 through the Clydebank Declaration, were designed to provide that delivery pathway. More than four years on, the focus is increasingly shifting from policy frameworks to implementation, with short-sea Green Shipping Corridors widely recognised as the fastest and most viable way to move from commitment to delivery.

Against this backdrop, attention is turning to solutions that translate regulation and ambition into real emissions reductions, enabling ferry, short-sea cruise and RoRo operators to act in practice rather than absorb rising costs.

NatPower Marine says the concerns raised by the ferry industry further highlight a widening gap between regulation and the rollout of enabling infrastructure. Pricing emissions without rapidly giving operators the means to reduce them risks increasing costs, undermining route viability and pushing up ticket prices, without accelerating real-world decarbonisation. In some cases, this may even weaken the role of ferries in shifting passengers and freight away from higher-emissions road transport.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine UK, said the Interferry warning reflects a structural challenge facing maritime transport. “The ferry industry is signalling that obligations are rising faster than the infrastructure needed to meet them,” he said. “Climate policy only delivers results when operators can act on it in practice.”

While much of the regulatory debate continues to focus on long-term fuel pathways, NatPower Marine recognises that short-sea ferry and RoPax routes present the most immediate opportunity to turn Green Shipping Corridors from commitments into operational reality. These services operate on fixed schedules, with frequent port calls and sufficient dwell time to fully benefit from port-side electrification.

Shore power and high-capacity e-ship charging enable vessels to eliminate emissions while at berth, delivering immediate reductions in carbon dioxide alongside significant cuts in nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and particulate matter. In addition to improving compliance metrics such as the IMO’s Carbon Intensity Indicator, port-side power delivers tangible air-quality benefits for port cities and island communities that depend on ferry services.

Sommadossi said electrifying ports strengthens ferries as part of the climate solution rather than penalising them. “If emissions pricing pushes freight and passengers away from ferries and back onto already congested road networks, overall emissions increase,” he said. “Port-side power does the opposite. It reinforces sea transport as the lowest-emissions corridor and supports long-standing objectives to shift traffic from road to sea.”

The company points to routes such as the 142 mile (123 nautical miles) Heysham–Belfast route as examples of how short-sea Green Shipping Corridors can move rapidly from policy ambition to delivery on the quayside. By installing shore power and e-ship charging infrastructure at the port, emissions can be cut immediately, giving operators the confidence to invest in electric and hybrid vessels.

The Heysham initiative represents a landmark step forward, with the potential to eliminate more than 10,000 tonnes of CO2 annually and sending a clear signal of commitment from all involved.

NatPower Marine’s route-based, fully funded infrastructure model removes the need for upfront capital investment by ferry operators, enabling decarbonisation to scale without compromising connectivity, affordability, or competitiveness.

“The challenge facing maritime decarbonisation is not a lack of ambition,” Sommadossi concluded. “Since the Clydebank Declaration, regulation has accelerated, from FuelEU Maritime to the EU ETS, while a global IMO framework remains uncertain. What has not kept pace is the rollout of enabling infrastructure. Short-sea corridors show that when port-side power is in place, emissions fall immediately and commercially. That is how Green Shipping Corridors move from policy commitment to operational delivery.”",https://envirotecmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Entry-gate-to-interior-of-car-ferry-traveling-from-Portsmouth-to-Fishbourne-1200px.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:57:34.458941

These events have been increasingly frequent, with major events occurring in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2022, 2024, and 2025. Now, in an unexpected turn of events, it appears that regulations introduced in 2020 to reduce ship fuel pollution may have actually increased the solar radiation that leads to increased coral bleaching, according to a study published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment.

Fuel-sulfur shipping regulations in 2020

Much of the world's trade cargo is moved via the maritime industry, and Australia relies on this method for over 99% of its imports and exports. However, the resulting pollution from ship fuel reduces air quality, with sulfur in particular, leading to respiratory issues in humans and a potential for acid rain.

To mitigate these effects, the International Maritime Organization introduced regulations in 2020 putting a global upper limit of 0.50% on the sulfur in ship fuel oil, reduced from 3.50%. This new limit equated to a 77% drop in overall SOx emissions from ships, or approximately 8.5 million metric tons of SOx. While these regulations were helpful for improving air quality and human health, they had some unexpected effects on incoming solar radiation.

Sulfur aerosols, solar radiation, and ocean heating

According to the new study, the sulfur aerosols had initially been acting as a kind of screen for some solar radiation, and when sulfur pollution was reduced, this resulted in an increase in incoming solar radiation. This solar radiation led to increased ocean water heating, ultimately worsening coral bleaching events.

To come to this conclusion, the team used atmospheric models with a detailed ship emissions inventory, called STEAM, to simulate aerosol, cloud, and radiation changes. They then compared three scenarios: pre-regulation, post-regulation, and no ship emissions, across different weather periods in 2022 and 2023. The model results were also evaluated against meteorological and air quality observations.

""Primary and secondary sulfate aerosol from ships interacts with radiation directly, as well as indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Extra CCN alters cloud properties by dividing the available cloud water among more droplets, decreasing the size of the cloud droplets and thereby enhancing cloud albedo, cloud lifetime, and optical depth. Ship-polluted clouds can also exhibit liquid water path increases, which also enhances cloud albedo,"" the study authors explain.

They calculated that the 2020 shipping regulations led to 11 W/m² more daytime solar radiation above the GBR during clear, calm periods in February 2022. They note that clear skies and warmer temperatures lead to a stronger influence on ship emissions change. Models showed that the increase in solar radiation likely raised sea surface temperatures by 0.05–0.15°C, adding 5–10% more thermal stress to coral in the GBR during bleaching-prone conditions.

The study's findings highlight the problem that while cleaner ship fuels improve air quality, they also potentially worsen coral bleaching risk. Further research should assess long-term and global impacts of shipping emission changes on coral reefs, while also informing policy on balancing air pollution control with the protection of the GBR and other ecosystems.

The Coastal States of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea with Iceland:","We, the Coastal States of the Baltic Sea and the North Sea (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom) with Iceland are approaching the International Maritime Community, especially flag and port states, national authorities, flag registries, classification societies, shipping companies, managers and operators as well as seafarers, with this letter.

Dear Members of the International Maritime Community,

Modern maritime transport is fundamentally built on the reliability of satellite-based navigation. For over three decades, global shipping has advanced by developing vessel operations to increasingly depend on the position, timing, and navigation (PTN) data provided by satellite systems. This shift has brought great efficiency but has also created a new dependency.

The accurate and uninterrupted functioning of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is not a technical luxury; it is a critical safety requirement. GNSS signals support not only ship navigation but also precise time synchronization vital for systems such as the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). Disruption of these signals is a risk to the safety and reliability of maritime transport.

We are now facing new emerging safety situations due to growing GNSS interference in European waters, particularly in the Baltic Sea region. These disturbances, originating from the Russian Federation, degrade the safety of international shipping. All vessels are at risk.

Equally vital is the integrity of the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which plays a key role in traffic coordination, enhances situational awareness and emergency response. Spoofing or falsifying AIS data undermines maritime safety and security, increases the risk of accidents, and severely hampers rescue operations.

We therefore call upon the international maritime community and national authorities to:

1. Recognize GNSS interference and AIS manipulation as threats to maritime safety and security.

2. Ensure vessels have adequate capabilities and properly trained crew as required by international conventions to operate safely during navigation system outages.

3. Cooperate on the development of alternative terrestrial radionavigation systems which may be used in place of GNSS in the event of disruption, loss of signal or interference.

Maintaining trust in maritime navigation requires more than technology – it demands responsibility, transparency, and decisive action. We must ensure that our seas remain safe, including when systems fail or face disturbances.

Furthermore, recognizing the essential role of maritime transport in global trade and the economy, and emphasizing the importance of safe, efficient, and environmentally sustainable shipping, we stress that the full and consistent implementation of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations is fundamental to ensuring maritime safety, the smooth functioning of shipping, and the protection of seafarers and the marine environment, especially in the new emerging situations affecting safety at sea, such as the increasing use of shadow fleet vessels to circumvent international sanctions.

In order to uphold and strengthen maritime safety in the Baltic Sea and North Sea region, we require that all vessels exercising freedom of navigation strictly comply with applicable international law, whether customary international law or as contracting parties to international conventions, including the 1972 Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG), the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and all other relevant IMO conventions and resolutions which contain the generally accepted international rules and standards referred to in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

We wish to highlight, in particular, the following:

1. Vessels shall sail under the flag of only one State and vessels that sail under the flags of two or more states, using them according to convenience, may be treated as a ship without nationality, as according to UNCLOS Article 92.

2. Vessels must maintain valid documentation and certification according to the above-mentioned IMO Conventions, including but not limited to insurance or other financial security in accordance with the rules laid down in Article VII of the 1992 Civil Liability Convention and Article 7 of the 2001 Bunker Convention.

3. Companies must maintain a safety management system onboard the vessels operated, according to SOLAS Chapter IX (ISM code).

4. Flag States shall take any steps which may be necessary in order to ensure that ships flying their flag only proceed to sea in compliance with the requirements of the international rules and standards, including investigations for the maintenance of ships’ condition after survey according to UNCLOS art. 94 and 217 and SOLAS Regulation I/11. Such steps include prohibiting ships from sailing if they fail to comply with said requirements.

5. Vessels, when underway, shall comply with the applicable requirements of the STCW Convention, SOLAS Regulation V/14, and Rule 5 of the COLREGs regarding bridge watchkeeping and lookout.

6. Vessels shall maintain the AIS and the LRIT equipment continuously in operation according to SOLAS V/19.2.4.7 and A.1106(29) and SOLAS V/19-1.5.

7. Vessels must provide information about ship identification and any other required information when entering an area covered by a ship reporting system according to SOLAS V/11.7:

SOLAS V/11.7: 7 The master of a ship shall comply with the requirements of adopted ship reporting systems and report to the appropriate authority all information required in accordance with the provisions of each such system.

8. Vessels must maintain clear communication with relevant maritime authorities including in communication regarding Ship Reporting Systems and Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) (SOLAS V/11.7 SOLAS V/12.4 (VTS).

9. Vessels shall comply with local navigation restrictions and any mandatory ships' routeing systems adopted by IMO in accordance with SOLAS chapter V, regulation 10.7. Other IMO-adopted routing measures and areas to be avoided designated under IMO and HELCOM frameworks shall be taken into account as appropriate for safe navigation.

SOLAS V/10.7: 7 A ship shall use a mandatory ships' routeing system adopted by the Organization as required for its category or cargo carried and in accordance with the relevant provisions in force unless there are compelling reasons not to use a particular ships' routeing system. Any such reason shall be recorded in the ship's log.

10. Vessels must report incident involving discharges of oil and other harmful substances as required by international and national rules. (MARPOL art. 8 and Protocol I, International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation 1990, art. 4, Protocol on Preparedness, Response and Co-operation to pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances 2000, art. 3).

11. Vessels shall carry on board shipboard oil and marine pollution emergency plans as required by the MARPOL Convention (Annex I Reg. 37, Annex II, Reg. 17).

12. Vessels shall carry onboard flag approved ship-to-ship operations plans according to MARPOL Convention Annex I Reg. 41.

13. Vessels shall not conduct ship-to-ship transfers without sufficient and timely notification to the coastal state in whose exclusive economic zone the transfer is to take place (MARPOL Annex I, Reg. 42).

The EU plans to phase out soy biofuels to curb the use of crops linked to indirect land-use change (ILUC), a major driver of CO₂ emissions and biodiversity loss. The Commission’s report highlights the deforestation risks associated with promoting food and feed crops for fuel, a concern that grows as global biofuel consumption continues to rise, T&E notes.

Soy is now set to follow the same path. While this move removes one of the most environmentally damaging feedstocks from Europe’s energy mix, rising EU demand for biofuels means competition for alternative feedstocks is likely to intensify.

More than 100 million tonnes of sugar cane is used in global biofuels production today. This is expected to grow by 50% by 2030. This includes problematic projects in regions like Papua, Indonesia, where clearance of natural forest is already underway to make space for sugarcane cultivation.

Additional engine and generator set (genset) options are expected to be introduced in 2026 as OEMs gain approvals and complete successful tests and pilot installations.

This comes as demand for using low-carbon fuels intensifies, and the first methanol-fuelled tugboats and biofuelled pusher vessels come into service in 2026.

In its first tugboat application, Everllence has provided dual-fuel methanol 175DF-M engines for a 35-m TRAnsverse tug Uzmar is building for Svitzer, ready for delivery in Q2 2026.

Svitzer and Everllence (then MAN Energy Solutions) signed a memorandum of understanding in 2024 for the supply of these dual-fuel engines for future newbuild projects..

While methanol could be viable in European, North American and Asian markets, ethanol could become a preferred alternative fuel in Latin America.

“By using biodiesel, these engines are expected to lower total greenhouse gas emissions”

At the end of 2025, Everllence confirmed its 21/31 dual-fuel engine successfully ran on ethanol at all load points at its test facilities in Frederikshavn, Denmark.

Everllence launched a small-bore, four-stroke, methanol-burning generator set in 2024 – the 21/31DF-M unit – and in 2026, several were put into commercial operation.

“This engine platform has shown great promise when burning alternative fuels and, during testing, we even managed to expand the ethanol fuel-share compared with methanol,” said Everllence head of four-stroke, small-bore engineering Rasmus Frimann Nielsen.

“The past few years have seen steadily growing interest in ethanol from the market,” he said.“Tests in Frederikshavn have now provided us with the technical know-how to take us to the next level.

""We are still evaluating the data, which confirms our earlier assumption that we could run the 21/31 engine on ethanol without issues.”

Everllence said its port fuel-injection concept for the methanol and ethanol 21/31 engines has helped it to become established, particularly in the genset and diesel-electric propulsion configurations on board vessels.

In Spain, Caterpillar is supplying methanol- and biofuel-ready engines and generators for a diesel-electric hybrid tug being built by Gondan Shipyard for Østensjø Rederi’s offshore operations in Norway.

The enginebuilder’s distributor in Norway, Zeppelin Power, reported it will supply two Cat 3516E main engines, two Cat 3512E variable speed gensets, one Cat 9.3 harbour generator and one Cat C4.4E emergency generator for the 50-m offshore tug, which will have a bollard pull of 150 tonnes.

The Cat diesel gensets and main engines will be prepared for biofuel and conversion to methanol operations, and the engines will be connected to a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) aftertreatment system for removing NOx from exhaust and for IMO Tier III compliance.

“The newbuild represents a major step in further strengthening our offshore towage fleet,” said Østensjø Rederi chief executive, Kristian Helland Vea.

When delivered, the newbuild will be the largest and most powerful offshore tug in the Norwegian owner’s fleet.

“The tug ticks all the boxes. The combination of high bollard pull, advanced hybrid propulsion and large winch capacity ensures high operational flexibility,” said Mr Vea.

The vessel will be based on Skipsteknisk ST-933 design and delivered in Q1 2028 with DP2-class dynamic positioning, a beam of 17 m and Kongsberg Maritime’s permanent-magnet RIM-drive manoeuvring propellers.

Zeppelin Power said the vessel’s two 16-cylinder Cat 3516E generator sets will run at variable speeds to optimise fuel consumption, reduce noise, and minimise emissions.

“When maximum pulling power is required, the two 3516E engines connect directly to the shafts, delivering immense power within a very compact footprint,” said the distributor.

Six sequential turbochargers will significantly boost the Cat 3516E engines’ power and efficiency across the entire speed range.

Inland waterways

In North America, Caterpillar has engineered its new Cat C32B marine engines to run on biodiesel and hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO) for tugs and towboats operating in marine areas and internal waterways.

The US-based OEM has also increased the time before overhaul by up to 50%, specifically 15,000 hours for top-end and 30,000 hours for major overhauls, which helps increase vessels’ time on the water.

Caterpillar has reduced the maintenance frequency, extended engine life, and improved fuel efficiency. It also lowers emissions when linked to an SCR for compliance with IMO Tier III, European Union Stage V and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 exhaust standards.

“The C32B reliably delivers power up to 895 kW and 5,861 Nm for US EPA Tier 4, and 839 kW and 5,499 Nm for EU stage V,” said Caterpillar. A version for EPA Tier 3 requirements offers a peak rating of 1,007 kW and 6,166 Nm.

“The piston for the new C32B features increased compression height enabling increased power density,” said Caterpillar. “The cylinder head has been upgraded to include design features that integrate external fuel lines along with an optimised water jacket geometry to improve heat transfer.”

EPA Tier 4 first

Baudouin worked with Hornblower Marine to introduce its first EPA Tier 4 engine, the 6M33.3, with high torque at low speeds, for the US vessel market. This is part of a wider range of propulsion systems the European OEM provides for workboat applications, from inland river service boats to large offshore support vessels.

Power ratings span from 130 kW to over 2,200 kW, and its range includes compact six-cylinder in-line engines, such as the 6W105M, and high-output V12 and V16 configurations, such as the 12M33.2 and 16M33.3, while displacements vary from 6.7 to 52.3 litres.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/181/RAsalvor_4400-DFM_launch_at_Sanmar1_Thumb.png,N,,2026-01-26 07:57:30.384474

Shipping activity is so frequent that it releases a lot of sulphate aerosols, more than other oceanic regions.
Similar, though weaker, declines were also detected along busy shipping routes in the Red Sea.
Lightning poses risks to ships, crews and onboard equipment and can disrupt visibility and normal maritime operations.
Jin also plans to examine whether long-running clean air policies in Asian countries have led to similar declines in lightning activity over land.","Stricter international limits on sulphur in ship fuel are reducing lightning activity along some of the planet’s busiest shipping routes, according to new research from the University of Kansas.

The study links a sharp drop in sulphur emissions from oceangoing vessels to a significant decline in lightning stroke density over heavily trafficked routes in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea. The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Climate and Atmospheric Science.

Researchers found that lightning strokes – individual electrical discharges – fell by about 36% in these regions after a 2020 rule by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) capped the sulphur content of marine fuel. Earlier studies had shown that the regulation led to roughly a 70% reduction in suphate emissions over the Bay of Bengal.

Lead author Qinjian Jin, an assistant teaching professor of geography and atmospheric science at the University of Kansas, said: ‘I think there are two reasons for this. Shipping activity is so frequent that it releases a lot of sulphate aerosols, more than other oceanic regions. And the Bay of Bengal has strong convection, which is required for lightning to occur.’

Sulphate aerosols, whether from natural sources or human activity, play a key role in cloud formation. When released into the atmosphere, they act as cloud condensation nuclei, helping clouds form smaller droplets that persist longer and are more likely to grow into tall, ice-rich clouds capable of producing lightning.

Jin explained: ‘The drop in sulphates from ships can cause fewer cloud condensation nuclei, larger cloud drops, weaker convection and storms, and thus fewer ice crystals and less frequent lightning.’

Using data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network, the researchers tracked lightning activity before and after the 2020 sulphur cap. Similar, though weaker, declines were also detected along busy shipping routes in the Red Sea.

While the IMO regulation was designed to reduce air pollution and protect human health, the reduction in lightning may be an added benefit. Lightning poses risks to ships, crews and onboard equipment and can disrupt visibility and normal maritime operations.

There is, however, a downside to the eradication of sulphur in the atmosphere. Sulphates help to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight and making clouds brighter and more reflective. With fewer sulphate aerosols in the atmosphere, clouds can become darker and absorb more solar radiation.

Jin said earlier research by his team suggests that the reduction in ship-emitted sulphates may have contributed to record-breaking global temperatures observed in 2023 and 2024.

Future research will focus on better quantifying this effect using high-resolution regional climate models, which can more accurately capture cloud formation processes than traditional global models. Jin also plans to examine whether long-running clean air policies in Asian countries have led to similar declines in lightning activity over land.

Fafalios (pictured, centre). His remarks came at the London-based GSCC’s traditional Vasilopeta cake-cutting ceremony, held late last week n the presence of IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez (right).

Fafalios began by alluding alluded to the fact that shipping markets were generally prospering and shipbuilding yards full despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainties. But he added: “Of these new ships a certain proportion are being built to be multi-fuel suitable but without knowing if there will be sufficient green fuels available to supply them. Supply of green fuels to shipping will only be available after shore-based demand is satisfied! A larger number of vessels are being designed to be very fuel efficient using existing and new technologies and therefore making significant strides to becoming truly greener.

He continued: “Outside of the fossil fuel and biofuel solutions, including LNG and LPG, other fuels, such as ammonia, are not tried and tested or safe for that matter for the entire global fleet.

“Shipping needs global solutions and tramp shipping in particular, which encompasses the largest part of the world shipping fleet, cannot rely on haphazard solutions which are not yet there in terms of reliability and more importantly, in terms of safety.

“The carbon-free solution is still not around and will not be so for the next 10-20 years and therefore levying more taxes will not encourage a cleaner world. Those who are levying these taxes should be responsible for finding the real solutions.

“No member of the environmental lobby has come up with a workable solution for our future fuel needs. All stick and no carrot.

“With regards to IMO NZF (Net Zero Framework), unless the world shipping industry can be directly involved in the drafting of this legislation, it cannot be anything more than window dressing. More taxes only mean a greater burden for the consumer since it is they alone who will pay.

“Never forget that the world shipping industry transports more than 90 percent of the world’s commodities with the lowest global carbon footprint and with a high level of safety.”

At a media briefing the following day, Mr Dominguez stressed that IMO’s decarbonisation work was continuing but he was speaking to all parties and open to compromise over the exact formulation of the NZF.

Key outcomes from the SDC 12

Draft Guidelines on Remote Inspection Techniques (RIT)

A new set of draft guidelines on the use of remote inspection techniques (RIT) for ESP Code surveys has been finalised and are expected to be approved by MSC 111 in conjunction with the related ESP Code amendments. These changes will enter into force in January 2028.

Escape arrangements from the lower part of machinery spaces

There was strong support that no safety issues can be associated with current ship building methods and arrangements. SOLAS will not be amended at this stage.

Safe Return to Port (SRtP)

Draft amendments to MSC.1/Circ.1369 – Interim explanatory notes for the assessment of passenger ship systems’ capabilities after a fire or flooding casualty have been finalised. This extensive review includes more than a decade of industry learning to expand the scope of the circular to the full life-cycle of SRtP passenger ships (from concept / initial design to operations). These amendments are expected to be approved by MSC 111 (May 2026).

SOLAS amendments relating to traditional and non-traditional steering system and propulsion requirements

The work on amendments to SOLAS chapters II-1 (part C – Machinery Installations) and V – Safety of Navigation and related instruments, was progressed and is expected to be finalised by 2028 and enter into force in January 2032. Further discussion on the associated draft MSC resolution for International Standards for Ship Manoeuvrability (ISSM) took place which highlighted the need for further information and data before finalisation. The road map has been updated accordingly.

Development of engine control room alert management (ECRAM) performance standards

The work on a new set of ECRAM performance standards was started and there was agreement on high level principles and a road map. An intersessional correspondence group will begin the technical drafting work. This work is expected to be finalised by 2028.

Underwater Radiated Noise (URN)

The Experience Building Phase (EBP) will be extended to 2028 to allow the industry to collect more data and experience around the implementation of MEPC.1/Circ.906/Rev.1 – Revised guidelines for the reduction of underwater radiated noise from shipping to address adverse impacts on marine life, noting the barriers which hinder the uptake. A list of technical aspects to effectively reduce URN was agreed and it is expected to be developed during the EBP. Additionally, the MEPC draft circular – Technical guidance on co-optimizing energy efficiency and underwater radiated noise at the design and retrofit stage was finalised and is expected to be approved at MEPC 84.

Draft guidelines for use of fibre-reinforced plastics (FRP) within ship structures

The draft guidelines have been finalised. In the revision, particular attention has been given to alignment with existing IMO instruments, maintaining a performance-based approach and the introduction of new fire test methodologies and structural performance.

Nuclear

A high-level work plan has been developed and will be submitted to MSC 111. A correspondence group will work to prepare an inventory of topics/challenges relating to the use of nuclear reactors for maritime applications.

During this week’s IMO meeting, member states agreed on clear guidance on how we must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts during the proposed extension of the experience building phase.

Valued at about US$1.4 billion, this facility is slated to crank out roughly 200,000 tonnes of low-carbon methanol each year—just the ticket for cleaner shipping fuel. They’re eyeing a 2029–30 launch, tapping into the area’s plentiful Odisha renewable energy supply, port connectivity, and sweeteners under India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission. This venture also marks ACME Group’s bold dive into large-scale green methanol, pushing their dream of delivering a lineup of zero-carbon molecules worldwide.

A Bold New Step for Sustainable Shipping

This build seriously steps up India’s place in the game for sustainable bunkering and shipping decarbonization. Shipping emits around 3% of the world’s CO₂, and as regulations clamp down on sulfur and carbon in marine fuels, green methanol jumps in as a drop-in fix for loads of existing vessels. ACME’s Odisha spot isn’t just ticking boxes at home; they’ve got their sights set on exports to Europe, Southeast Asia and beyond. By hooking production directly to the port, they’re cutting out middleman headaches and keeping fuel costs in check.

How the Technology Works

Here’s the magic behind the green methanol plant: wind and solar farms juice up electrolyzers that crack water into hydrogen (and release some oxygen). That hydrogen gets cleaned up and pumped to high pressure. Meanwhile, CO₂—scavenged from bio sources or even yanked right out of the air—is scrubbed and compressed. Once those streams collide in a catalytic reactor at just the right heat and pressure, you end up with methanol and water. The water gets spun off and cycled back in, while the methanol is distilled to ship-engine purity. Depending on your power mix and CO₂ source, you can slice over 90% off lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions versus conventional marine fuels. And the best part? You can store and ship it using the same infrastructure we already have for liquid fuels.

Who’s Steering the Ship?

ACME Group: One of India’s biggest renewable energy champions, celebrated for launching the world’s first fully integrated green ammonia plant in Bikaner, Rajasthan, and now developing green hydrogen and ammonia projects in Duqm, Oman and Gopalpur, Odisha.

Anil Taparia: COO of ACME’s Green Hydrogen and Ammonia Business Unit, the technical mastermind ensuring the plant runs smoothly and connects ACME’s carbon-free molecules to global markets.

IPICOL: The Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation of Odisha Ltd., your go-to partner for land deals, clearances and hooking up with local suppliers to keep everything moving at pace.

Why Odisha?

Odisha brings a perfect blend: a deep-water port at Paradip, nearby power parks pumping out competitively priced solar and wind, and ACME’s existing green ammonia plant sharing utilities, storage and trained staff. The state government is all in, offering pro-investment policies sweetened by central subsidies under the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Plus, local sources of biogenic CO₂—from agricultural residues to fermentation units—cement a steady feedstock pipeline. Put it all together and you’ve got a spot that slashes costs and guarantees steady operations, season after season.

Building India’s Green Molecules Portfolio

This project is another milestone in ACME Group’s march toward a full suite of zero-carbon fuels and chemicals. After pioneering green ammonia in Rajasthan and scoring six SECI awards for a combined 370,000 tonnes per year, they’re gunning for a 10 MMTPA ammonia capacity by the early 2030s across Rajasthan, Duqm and Gopalpur. Branching into methanol opens doors beyond fertilisers—think shipping, plastics and specialty chemicals—all hunting for low-carbon feedstocks. And with ammonia and methanol markets maturing at different paces, ACME’s diversified lineup means steadier demand and smoother revenue streams. In short, they’re serving up a complete menu of green molecules—from green hydrogen and ammonia to methanol—to help decarbonize industries worldwide.

Economic and Social Uplift in Odisha

It’s not just about slashing emissions. This green methanol plant will create a wave of jobs—from engineers and plant operators to folks in equipment manufacturing, logistics and CO₂ supply chains. It dovetails perfectly with Odisha’s strategy of leveraging its mineral assets and port infrastructure to attract new industry. ACME’s teaming up with local technical institutes to roll out training in electrolysis, catalysis and process control, boosting the region’s skilled workforce. And thanks to IPICOL’s knack for fast-tracking land allocation, clearances and community engagement, the project’s risk profile gets a serious trim. Once up and running, you’ll likely see related services—like hydrogen compression and methanol blending facilities—sprout up, anchoring these green molecules firmly in the local economy.

What Does This Mean for Shipping Decarbonization?

Freight shipping accounts for roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions, so finding cleaner fuels is mission-critical. Green methanol shines here: you can tweak existing engines to burn it or blend it with conventional bunker fuels to chip away at carbon intensity. It also slashes sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides emissions. Both FuelEU Maritime and the IMO’s net-zero-by-2050 roadmap give green methanol a green light. ACME’s already lining up offtake talks with major shipping lines to match production to demand. As ports worldwide upgrade bunkering standards, a reliable stream of certified green methanol could make Indian exporters a competitive force and help global fleets transition faster.

This 109.9‑metre-long, 7,500 DWT vessel with 10,362 m³ of cargo tank capacity recently completed its first ship-to-ship bunkering operation on 21 January at Yantian Port in Shenzhen, supplying 200 tonnes of green methanol to the container ship COSCO SHIPPING Carnation.

“The green methanol was supplied by CIMC Enric Holdings Limited from its Zhanjiang (Guangdong) facility which started operations in December 2025,” the company said.

“We are proud to support Yantian Port (Shenzhen) in this landmark operation, which represents a major leap in building the fuel-port-vessel ecosystem within the Greater Bay Area.”

Technology group Wärtsilä on Thursday (22 January) said it will supply the engines for a new purpose-built semi-submersible Heavy Transport Vessel (HTV) which is designed to minimise exhaust emissions and maximise fuel efficiency.

The ship is being built for Switzerland-based offshore contractor Allseas Group at the Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI) facilities in China. The engine order was booked by Wärtsilä in Q4 2025.

The future-proof Wärtsilä 31 engine was selected because of its modular design, which enables a significant reduction in maintenance requirements and costs, and its readiness to use alternative sustainable fuels.

“This new HTV strengthens the flexibility of our fleet and how we deliver projects. We selected the Wärtsilä 31 engine for its high efficiency, future-ready design and ability to transition to low- and zero-carbon fuels, which supports both operational adaptability and our long-term sustainability ambitions,” said Sytske de Groot, Manager, Naval Architecture – Allseas.

The vessel will operate with four Wärtsilä 31 engines, each fitted with a Wärtsilä NOx Reducer for emissions abatement. Delivery is scheduled for the first quarter of 2028.

“The Wärtsilä 31 engine delivers what the industry needs today and prepares operators for tomorrow. Its exceptional fuel efficiency reduces operating costs immediately, while its capability to convert to sustainable fuels ensures a clear path toward decarbonisation. This makes it one of the most future-ready propulsion solutions available,” commented Stefan Nysjö, Vice President, Power Supply, Wärtsilä Marine.

Wärtsilä has already supplied equipment to a number of vessels for Allseas, including the engines for Allseas’ purpose-built cargo barge, Braveheart.

Jiangnan Shipyard, China Shipbuilding Trading and COSCO Shipping Lines have signed a contract for twelve 18,000 TEU LNG dual-fuel container vessels, according to the shipyard on Tuesday (13 January).

The 18,000 TEU LNG dual-fuel container ship signed this time is the “Kun” (KUN-18N) type, independently developed and designed by Jiangnan Shipyard. It uses LNG as its primary fuel and possesses complete independent intellectual property rights.

All performance indicators have reached advanced domestic levels, boasting advantages such as high efficiency, energy saving, and environmental friendliness, meeting the shipowner’s strategy and plan to reduce carbon emissions throughout the fleet’s subsequent operating cycle.

Furthermore, this ship type incorporates the shipowner’s personalised requirements, significantly improving the vessel’s economic efficiency and market adaptability, and highly aligning with the current trend of green and low-carbon development in the shipping industry.

With the successful signing of this agreement with COSCO Shipping Lines, the “KUN” series of container ships has expanded to 49 vessels, covering various fuel types such as conventional fuel power, methanol dual-fuel power, and LNG dual-fuel power.

“This fully demonstrates Jiangnan Shipyard’s profound strength in the research, design, and construction of large container ships, further expands Jiangnan Shipyard’s influence in the mainstream dual-fuel large container ship market, and also marks another milestone for Jiangnan Shipyard in the field of large container ships,” it added.

According to COSCO Shipping Lines, the ships are expected to be delivered between 2028 and 2029 , and they are expected to be deployed on major east-west routes after delivery.

Dominguez added that the one of the main questions that is asked of the IMO is about its procedures and he explained that the extraordinary session had not voted, but had been suspended.
“The committee will decide when to reactivate it [the extraordinary session], but the committee continues to meet and the work continues within the remit,” added Dominguez.
Dominguez rejected the view that the US remained in the IMO because President Donald Trump wanted to kill off the IMO’s NZF.
[The US] recognised the value for this global sector in how we have made shipping more secure, more environmentally friendly and more sustainable,” said Dominguez.","IMO Secretary General Arsenio Dominguez called for member states to find a compromise deal that will allow the maritime industry to move forward with decarbonisation.

Last October was meant to see the Net Zero Framework (NZF) approved by MEPC 83, in April, finally enter into force following an extraordinary session of MEPC in October, but heavy lobbying by the US and Saudi delegations led to a decision to delay a vote on the NZF for one year.

According to Dominguez: “Our role right now is taking into account the global climate in relation to multilateralism and negotiations on climate change and the outcomes of COP30 in Brazil, our focus is on the substance [of what we have on the table].”

The Secretary General insists that the way forward for the regulatory body is to take into account some of the concerns that have been raised by member states, including the two major issues of how money collected from the industry will be dispersed, and the regulations around LNG and biofuels.

It is understood that many feel that LNG regulations are too stringent and that the gas can be a transitional fuel, but that the penalties imposed on the methane rich LNG would mean it is not economically viable.

Some owners believe that with no other fuel currently available, over-pricing LNG would be detrimental to the industry. Others argue that the way forward is to improve the efficiency of ships with existing technology, such as Mewis ducts, air lubrication and wind power along with weather routing.

Dominguez added that the one of the main questions that is asked of the IMO is about its procedures and he explained that the extraordinary session had not voted, but had been suspended.

“The committee will decide when to reactivate it [the extraordinary session], but the committee continues to meet and the work continues within the remit,” added Dominguez.

IMO accepts that it does not have unanimity on some elements of the NZF, in fact Dominguez says there are three camps, those that are in favour of the framework, those who have some issues, but can live with it and those that have more concerns.

Nevertheless, Dominguez emphasised that IMO has, “A strategy that was agreed back in 2023, and even during the last assembly, the objectives of the strategy were reiterated.”

IMO has a mandate to protect the environment, including mitigating atmospheric pollution, so the work of the organisation is to find compromises, while “respecting all the different views”.

Earlier this month the Trump administration announced that it would withdraw from 66 international organisations, including the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It did not, however, withdraw from the IMO.

Dominguez rejected the view that the US remained in the IMO because President Donald Trump wanted to kill off the IMO’s NZF.

“If you have the opportunity to listen to their statement at the assembly of the organisation in December, it was very supportive of all the work that the organisation carries out.

As a meeting of the International Maritime Organizations (IMO) Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC 12) closed Friday, the Clean Arctic Alliance welcomed the clear guidance on how the IMO must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts, and the recommendation of a two year extension of the three-year ""experience building phase"" (EBP). The information is reported by Hellenic Shipping News.

During SDC 12, Member States finalized a list of key technical aspects for reducing underwater noise from shipping, which will inform future policy considerations by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) during the proposed two-year extension of the Experience Building Phase, and will be initially considered by MEPC 84 in April.

The Clean Arctic Alliance, made up of 24 not-for-profit organisations, is calling on member states to ensure the IMO continues to push for progress and action in reducing underwater noise from shipping, especially in Arctic waters where the levels of underwater noise are anticipated to nearly quadruple by 2030.

""During this weeks IMO meeting, member states agreed on clear guidance on how we must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts during the proposed extension of the experience building phase. At the two forthcoming MEPC meetings this year, we hope to pursue policy that will move beyond voluntary guidance"", said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy.

For many marine organisms sound is the most important means of communication. Under water vision is restricted and without good hearing ability, elementary functions such as navigating, finding prey and partners can be hampered.

""Much of the Arctic has been free of anthropogenic (human-sourced) sound for a long time, but with increased human activity, Arctic waters are becoming more noisy every year"", said Bobbe. ""An important source of noise is shipping, specifically from propellers and engines.""

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF provides new maps that show, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean. Marine mammal migratory corridors are specified in both the URN Guidelines and the Polar Code as areas of special concern.

""By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them"", said Melanie Lancaster, Senior Specialist, Arctic species conservation for WWFs Global Arctic Programme.

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic that build on the practice within IMO to safeguard whales from the adverse impacts of shipping. Mandatory ship reporting systems and recommendatory seasonal areas to be avoided have been adopted for North Atlantic right whales along the United States east coast.

Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes, highlighted parallels with the Gulf of California. ""Our recommendations to SDC 12, and to the forthcoming discussions at MEPC 84, for the Gulf of California are equally important for the Arctic as both regions could see devastating impacts from future increased shipping, especially from LNG tankers"", he said.

Key IMO Papers:

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF and presented during a lunchtime side event, SDC 12-INF.17 – Spatio-temporal information on Arctic whale migration routes for consideration in voyage planning and other measures to reduce the impacts of underwater radiated noise on marine life provides new maps that show, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean.

Marine mammal migratory corridors are specified in both the URN Guidelines and the Polar Code as areas of special concern because they contain high concentrations of animals sensitive to impacts of shipping. The maps provide mariners with new information on where they need to take measures in migratory months, which in the Arctic, are in spring and autumn. Operational measures, such as rerouting and restricting speed, can reduce impacts on migrating whales, and these measures go hand in hand with technical measures to quieten ships through new builds and modifications. WWF invites mariners to use the maps in voyage planning, and urges member states and the IMO to implement location-specific rules and recommendations to reduce impacts of underwater noise in migratory corridors.

“By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them”, said Melanie Lancaster, Senior Specialist, Arctic species conservation for WWF’s Global Arctic Programme and member of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “From the maps, we see that whales migrate impressive distances between their summer and winter habitats, some swimming thousands of kilometres across national borders and even into the high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean. It will take international cooperation among states, ship operators, shipping companies and IMO to ensure their safe and quiet passage.”

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic that build on the practice within IMO to safeguard whales from the adverse impacts of shipping.

Mandatory ship reporting systems and recommendatory seasonal areas to be avoided have been adopted for North Atlantic right whales along the United States east coast and recommendatory speed restrictions have been adopted as an Associated Protective Measure (APM) for whales in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The paper provides the necessary information for similar preventative measures to be adopted to safeguard whales in the Arctic.

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by the Clean Shipping Coalition – SDC 12/8/3 and sent onto MEPC 84 for consideration, shares the findings of a study on the potential underwater radiated noise (URN) impacts of LNG development on marine mammals in the Gulf of California. The paper examines the potential effects of URN from LNG tanker traffic on migratory and resident whales, as well as related impacts on air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The proposed LNG terminals and the resulting increase in LNG tanker traffic are expected to pose serious threats to the Gulf of California’s unique biodiversity and conservation areas, including those designated as a UNESCO “World Heritage Site” and “Important Marine Mammal Areas”. These developments increase the risks of air, water, and underwater noise pollution. Given the Gulf of California’s critical ecological role—particularly as a habitat for resident and migratory marine megafauna—a precautionary approach to industrial development is essential. It is increasingly evident that the region’s ecological integrity is incompatible with the scale and nature of heavy marine traffic associated with proposed LNG facilities.

Many regions, such as in the Arctic and the Gulf of California in Mexico, share similar potential impacts from underwater noise, and both have seen low shipping traffic in the past. Shipping traffic has been increasing in the last decade in the Arctic, while in the Gulf of California the developing LNG infrastructure will bring unprecedented vessel traffic to a marine area with enormous ecological value, in particular for marine mammals.",,N,,2026-01-25 17:56:49.739302

In the still­ness of a Sat­ur­day morn­ing, a large ship docked on the wa­ter­front near the Hy­att Re­gency in Port-of-Spain. There are many ships that dock on those wa­ters week­ly, but this ves­sel presents a glimpse in­to an in­dus­try long­ing to be dis­cov­ered in this coun­try.

The Fortes­cue Green Pi­o­neer has slow­ly made its way from Belem, Brazil (where the UN Cli­mate Change Con­fer­ence took place last No­vem­ber) to the Port of Port-of-Spain. It will spend a week in T&T wa­ters. How­ev­er, the orig­i­nal sched­ule was a mere pit stop for fu­el be­fore sail­ing high­er up the Caribbean chain. That changed when in­dus­try lead­ers learned of the ves­sel’s unique­ness.

In 2025, it was list­ed by Time Mag­a­zine as one of the best in­ven­tions of the year: “a sea­wor­thy so­lu­tion to ship­ping pol­lu­tion.”

The word am­mo­nia lit a bulb in the heads of Trinida­di­ans who wel­comed the ves­sel.

This coun­try is a glob­al leader in am­mo­nia pro­duc­tion and ex­ports, boast­ing eleven world-scale am­mo­nia plants with a to­tal an­nu­al ca­pac­i­ty of ap­prox­i­mate­ly 5.2 to 5.67 mil­lion met­ric tonnes.

You’ve got an in­fra­struc­ture that ex­ists to­day. It’s been around for quite some time... It’s al­ways been a key trans-ship­ment hub. It’s been a key oil-fu­elling hub. I think it’s a great op­por­tu­ni­ty.”

This week, stu­dents from var­i­ous uni­ver­si­ties will have a tour of the ship to learn about its key el­e­ments. Hoare is look­ing for­ward to this week in Trinidad. He added, “I think that’s go­ing to be one of, hope­ful­ly, the most warm­ing el­e­ments of the run to Trinidad and To­ba­go. It is to out­reach with stake­hold­ers there. I’m sure there’s go­ing to be high­er-lev­el, maybe gov­ern­ment-po­lit­i­cal types there as well, or the in­dus­try types, but I think prob­a­bly the most warm­ing will be the fact that we’re not just steer­ing the boats at the top. We are try­ing to cre­ate a mar­ket, change a mar­ket, and I think in the case of T&T, we’re try­ing to en­sure that you re­tain your po­si­tion in that mar­ket.”

They see it as an op­por­tu­ni­ty for them to show­case the work they’re do­ing in am­mo­nia-pow­ered ships. The Green Pi­o­neer re­mains the on­ly ship that has ac­tu­al­ly proven in­ter­na­tion­al move­ment us­ing am­mo­nia as a fu­el. How­ev­er, Hoare said there are small pi­lots hap­pen­ing in the ports, and their first ships don’t come out un­til the end of the year.

“I think the ex­cit­ing part of it is that it shows us a tan­gi­ble ex­am­ple of an al­ter­na­tive and emerg­ing fu­el that the world is look­ing at for the mar­itime in­dus­try,” Julien said.

Pro­man is one of the mul­ti-na­tion­al com­pa­nies in T&T pro­duc­ing am­mo­nia. In a con­ver­sa­tion with the Sun­day Busi­ness Guardian last week, its Deputy Man­ag­ing Di­rec­tor, Giselle Thomp­son, said her com­pa­ny has been us­ing methanol as a fu­el for their mar­itime ser­vices. How­ev­er, she added, “There is like­ly room in the mar­ket in terms of the mar­itime sec­tor for any fu­el that is low­er in car­bon in­ten­si­ty, as the sec­tor has to move to some of those cli­mate goals and the tar­gets put out by the In­ter­na­tion­al Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion (IMO). I’m sure there is room in the mar­ket for am­mo­nia-pow­ered ships, LNG-pow­ered ships, and methanol-pow­ered ships.”

Hoare and his team will em­bark on a Caribbean tour af­ter their T&T vis­it. When asked why this re­gion was so im­por­tant to their en­deav­ours, he an­swered, “Our group res­onates close­ly with the Caribbean states be­cause we’re very close to the South Pa­cif­ic is­land states of Aus­tralia. There are cer­tain sim­i­lar­i­ties. We’ve all seen the ter­ri­ble chal­lenges in Ja­maica last year with poor weath­er, which we could prob­a­bly say may be cli­mate-re­lat­ed. Like­wise, we see first­hand in the South Pa­cif­ic is­lands the im­pact of ris­ing sea lev­els there, with com­mu­ni­ties al­ready be­ing dis­placed. Al­though we’re more aligned and cog­nizant of the South Pa­cif­ic, I think by be­ing in the Caribbean, it gives us a chance to lis­ten and to show the ship be­yond a Pow­er­Point pre­sen­ta­tion.”

Julien be­lieves the Gov­ern­ment’s Blue­print Plan aligns with the po­ten­tial of this mar­itime in­dus­try change. How­ev­er, when ques­tioned how far in­to the fu­ture such a de­vel­op­ment could be­come a re­al­i­ty, he stat­ed, “I think the hori­zon match­es the de­vel­op­ment time. That’s the best way to put it, so this isn’t so far off that we can­not start with the de­vel­op­ment work now in or­der to de­vel­op those things that would make Trinidad a com­mer­cial­ly vi­able and at­trac­tive port of choice.”

It comes as the In­ter­na­tion­al Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion ac­tive­ly pur­sues a fu­ture for the ship­ping in­dus­try void of car­bon-emit­ting fu­els. Last Oc­to­ber, it was forced to walk back on a de­ci­sion to ini­ti­ate the world’s first glob­al car­bon pric­ing sys­tem on any in­ter­na­tion­al pol­luter - glob­al ship­ping. It was seen as a ma­jor set­back in meet­ing the mar­itime in­dus­try’s de­car­bon­i­sa­tion tar­gets. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in the Unit­ed States was a staunch crit­ic of the move.

How­ev­er, while the bat­tle for a net-ze­ro fu­ture rages geopo­lit­i­cal­ly, an op­por­tu­ni­ty seems to have sailed on­to T&T’s shores. The chal­lenge for every gov­ern­ment has been to see (and plan) for down the road as op­posed to ex­tract­ing the fi­nite joys of the nat­ur­al gas rich­es now. Julien, who has cham­pi­oned low-car­bon and green hy­dro­gen de­vel­op­ment in this coun­try, now sees an ad­di­tion­al op­por­tu­ni­ty for the coun­try’s eco­nom­ic ex­pan­sion.",http://www.guardian.co.tt/neo/1/icon32x32.png,N,,2026-01-25 09:56:48.287338

According to a publication from Stephenson Harwood, 2025 was a year in which maritime decarbonisation made headlines far beyond the maritime press. Provisional approval of the IMO Net Zero Framework in April and the postponement of the vote on its formal adoption in October attracted global attention.

The industry also grappled with the first verification period of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and the first reporting period of FuelEU Maritime. The proposed extension of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme took shape through final policy decisions, and other national regulators advanced plans for national emissions regulation.

Commercially, the drive for lower GHG intensity fuels brought the industry into contact with biofuel and alternative fuels markets, and a new compliance market emerged connected to FuelEU pooling. Contractual innovation was essential throughout the year to define responsibilities and liabilities amid regulatory, commercial, and technological change.

Key Questions for Owners and Charterers

The source text outlined five key questions for the industry. The first addressed whether emissions from a vessel that left the European Economic Area (EEA) before 1 January 2024 but was still on its departure voyage on that date are within the EU ETS. Different interpretations could leave the ""shipping company"" short of required allowances.

The second question considered continuing obligations under the EU MRV and EU ETS when selling a vessel that has been trading in Europe, noting penalties for non-compliance include publication of names, financial penalties, and potential vessel expulsion.

The third question urged parties to check charterparty EU ETS provisions, as shipping companies rely on the charterparty chain to obtain EU Allowances (EUAs) required for surrender by 30 September 2025. Gaps in supply could force last-minute purchases at market highs.

The fourth question examined the implications of using biofuels to reduce GHG intensity for charterparties and fuel supply contracts. It noted that typical charterparty terms do not adequately address biofuel handling, consumption, or valuation, and that fuel must meet specific sustainability criteria for regulatory benefits.

The fifth question explored considerations for FuelEU pooling and compensation for compliance surplus in time charterparties. It highlighted that FuelEU regulations leave most pooling details to private contract, making charterparty terms critical for determining which party benefits from a surplus and how it is valued.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2026-01-25 10:57:02.237319

As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC 12) closes today, the Clean Arctic Alliance welcomed the clear guidance on how the IMO must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts, and the recommendation of a two year extension of the three-year “experience building phase” (EBP).

During SDC 12, Member States finalized a list of key technical aspects for reducing underwater noise from shipping, which will inform future policy considerations by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) during the proposed two-year extension of the Experience Building Phase, and will be initially considered by MEPC 84 in April.

The Clean Arctic Alliance, made up of 24 not-for-profit organisations, is calling on member states to ensure the IMO continues to push for progress and action in reducing underwater noise from shipping, especially in Arctic waters where the levels of underwater noise are anticipated to nearly quadruple by 2030.

“During this week’s IMO meeting, member states agreed on clear guidance on how we must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts during the proposed extension of the experience building phase. At the two forthcoming MEPC meetings this year, we hope to pursue policy that will move beyond voluntary guidance”, said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy, a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition. “So far, this work has not kept pace relative to the growing threats faced by regions experiencing increased shipping traffic, such as the Arctic, underscoring the need for parallel policy advancement through the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee in the coming months.”

For many marine organisms sound is the most important means of communication. Under water vision is restricted and without good hearing ability, elementary functions such as navigating, finding prey and partners can be hampered. This is of particular importance for marine mammals, and also for fish and even invertebrates.

“Much of the Arctic has been free of anthropogenic (human-sourced) sound for a long time, but with increased human activity, Arctic waters are becoming more noisy every year”, said Bobbe. “An important source of noise is shipping, specifically from propellers and engines. Since shipping has increased substantially during recent decades, underwater noise is a growing problem, contributing to serious impact on the Arctic ecosystem.”

Key IMO Papers:

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF and presented during a lunchtime side event, SDC 12-INF.17 – Spatio-temporal information on Arctic whale migration routes for consideration in voyage planning and other measures to reduce the impacts of underwater radiated noise on marine life provides new maps that show, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean.

Marine mammal migratory corridors are specified in both the URN Guidelines and the Polar Code as areas of special concern because they contain high concentrations of animals sensitive to impacts of shipping. The maps provide mariners with new information on where they need to take measures in migratory months, which in the Arctic, are in spring and autumn. Operational measures, such as rerouting and restricting speed, can reduce impacts on migrating whales, and these measures go hand in hand with technical measures to quieten ships through new builds and modifications. WWF invites mariners to use the maps in voyage planning, and urges member states and the IMO to implement location-specific rules and recommendations to reduce impacts of underwater noise in migratory corridors.

“By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them”, said Melanie Lancaster, Senior Specialist, Arctic species conservation for WWF’s Global Arctic Programme and member of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “From the maps, we see that whales migrate impressive distances between their summer and winter habitats, some swimming thousands of kilometres across national borders and even into the high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean. It will take international cooperation among states, ship operators, shipping companies and IMO to ensure their safe and quiet passage.”

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic that build on the practice within IMO to safeguard whales from the adverse impacts of shipping.

Mandatory ship reporting systems and recommendatory seasonal areas to be avoided have been adopted for North Atlantic right whales along the United States east coast and recommendatory speed restrictions have been adopted as an Associated Protective Measure (APM) for whales in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The paper provides the necessary information for similar preventative measures to be adopted to safeguard whales in the Arctic.

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by the Clean Shipping Coalition - SDC 12/8/3 and sent onto MEPC 84 for consideration, shares the findings of a study on the potential underwater radiated noise (URN) impacts of LNG development on marine mammals in the Gulf of California. The paper examines the potential effects of URN from LNG tanker traffic on migratory and resident whales, as well as related impacts on air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The proposed LNG terminals and the resulting increase in LNG tanker traffic are expected to pose serious threats to the Gulf of California's unique biodiversity and conservation areas, including those designated as a UNESCO ""World Heritage Site"" and ""Important Marine Mammal Areas"". These developments increase the risks of air, water, and underwater noise pollution. Given the Gulf of California's critical ecological role—particularly as a habitat for resident and migratory marine megafauna—a precautionary approach to industrial development is essential. It is increasingly evident that the region's ecological integrity is incompatible with the scale and nature of heavy marine traffic associated with proposed LNG facilities.

Many regions, such as in the Arctic and the Gulf of California in Mexico, share similar potential impacts from underwater noise, and both have seen low shipping traffic in the past. Shipping traffic has been increasing in the last decade in the Arctic, while in the Gulf of California the developing LNG infrastructure will bring unprecedented vessel traffic to a marine area with enormous ecological value, in particular for marine mammals.

“Our recommendations to SDC 12, and to the forthcoming discussions at MEPC 84, for the Gulf of California are equally important for the Arctic as both regions could see devastating impacts from future increased shipping, especially from LNG tankers, for marine wildlife particularly sensitive to noise, like marine mammals”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes - a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition. “The recommendations include: acknowledging the irreversible impacts of underwater noise caused by LNG tanker traffic on marine mammals' behaviours and habitat; promoting the development of ship design that takes into account the serious damage underwater noise causes to the marine habitat; and opposing LNG traffic in critical ecological marine areas because of, among others, the underwater noise pollution it causes, affecting marine mammals and other marine species. Both the Gulf of California and the Arctic are marine areas of incredible ecological, social and biodiversity importance for the planet, the impacts of increased noise would change the quality of the marine habitats irrevocably.”

The findings have been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for review, reports Biodiesel Magazine.

The study highlights major reductions in black carbon, a form of soot released by ships that worsens air pollution, affects human health and accelerates global warming, particularly in the Arctic. Experts involved in the CLEANSHIP project reported that ships running on biodiesel, specifically B100 FAME, recorded up to an 81 per cent drop in black carbon emissions compared with those using conventional marine fuel.

The data was collected from the Uni-Tankers vessel Falstria Swan during normal sailing operations. An advanced monitoring device, developed by Green Instruments in partnership with the Danish Technological Institute, enabled continuous and real-time tracking of emissions while the ship was in regular service.

Researchers said the results were stronger than expected, especially at lower engine power levels. They noted that biodiesel not only lowers overall carbon emissions but also sharply reduces black carbon, which plays a key role in the shipping industry’s climate impact. The new monitoring technology also provided more detailed emission data than previously possible.

Officials from Uni-Tankers said the real-world findings offer valuable insight into both soot and carbon emissions linked to biodiesel use. They added that this information will help the company meet its emission reduction goals and support broader efforts to reduce pollution across the shipping sector.

Despite the positive results, the study noted that current global biofuel production is not sufficient to meet the full energy needs of the global shipping fleet. Researchers said further analysis is ongoing to identify practical ways to reduce black carbon and other emissions from ships.

The findings have been compiled into a white paper and submitted to the IMO. The document is expected to support international efforts to curb black carbon emissions, especially in sensitive regions such as the Arctic.

Both the Gulf of California and the Arctic are marine areas of incredible ecological, social and biodiversity importance for the planet, the impacts of increased noise would change the quality of the marine habitats irrevocably.”",https://www.ilnautilus.it/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Underwater-Noise-From-Ships.png,N,,2026-01-24 09:56:33.607514

Arsenio Dominguez, secretary-general of the International Maritime Organization, told a new year’s press conference in London on Friday that, even if governments don’t sign up to the framework later this year as planned, the clean-up of the industry responsible for 3% of global emissions will continue.

“I reiterate my call to industry that the decarbonisation has started. There’s lots of research and development that is ongoing. There’s new plans on alternative fuels like methanol and ammonia that continue to evolve,” he told journalists.

He said he has not heard any government dispute a set of decarbonisation goals agreed in 2023. These include targets to reduce emissions 20-30% on 2008 levels by 2030 and then to reach net zero emissions “by or around, i.e. close to 2050”.

Dominguez said the 2030 emissions reduction target could be reached, although a goal for shipping to use at least 5% clean fuels by 2030 would be difficult to meet because their cost will remain high until at least the 2030s. The goals agreed in 2023 also included cutting emissions by 70-80% by 2040.

In October 2025, a decision on a proposed framework of practical measures to achieve the goals, which aims to incentivise shipowners to go green by taxing polluting ships and subsidising cleaner ones, was postponed by a year after a narrow vote by governments.

Ahead of that vote, the US threatened governments and their officials with sanctions, tariffs and visa restrictions – and President Donald Trump called the framework a “Green New Scam Tax on Shipping”.

Dominguez said at Friday’s press conference that he had not received any official complaints about the US’s behaviour at last October’s meeting but – without naming names – he called on nations to be “more respectful” at the IMO. He added that he did not think the US would leave the IMO, saying Washington had engaged constructively on the organisation’s budget and plans.

EU urged to clarify ETS position

The European Union – along with Brazil and Pacific island nations – pushed hard for the framework to be adopted in October. Some developing countries were concerned that the EU would retain its charges for polluting ships under its emissions trading scheme (ETS), even if the Net Zero Framework was passed, leading to ships travelling to and from the EU being charged twice.

This was an uncertainty that the US and Saudi Arabia exploited at the meeting to try and win over wavering developing countries. Most African, Asian and Caribbean nations voted for a delay.

On Friday, Dominguez called on the EU “to clarify their position on the review of the ETS, in order that as we move forward, we actually don’t have two systems that are going to be basically looking for the same the same goal, the same objective.”

He said he would continue to speak to EU member states, “to maintain the conversations in here, rather than move forward into fragmentation, because that will have a very detrimental effect in shipping”. “That would really create difficulties for operators, that would increase the cost, and everybody’s going to suffer from it,” he added.

Despite the intensification of coral reef bleaching, experts do not think that the regulations should be called back.
To prevent coral reef bleaching, greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced, which lowers global warming, which further triggers the bleaching.","Environmentalists worldwide were elated when the decision to reduce sulfur from shipping fuels was announced. However, the call has had some worrisome aftereffects, as published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. The study claims that it has enhanced a coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. This event took place back in the early months of 2022, when the reduction of sulfur emissions from the ship allowed more than typical amounts of sunlight to reach the reef. This elevation led to 10% more heat stress on the corals of the Great Barrier Reef during the mass bleaching event. It was the first bleaching event to unfold in a La Niña year.

The limitation was put into effect by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2020 regulation. As per this regulation, the sulfur content in the marine fuels was reduced from 3.5% to 0.5%. This decision proved to be fruitful, as it reduced harmful sulfur emissions and improved air quality. However, it also hampered a cooling effect in the atmosphere and particularly Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. In this cooling phenomenon, sulfur becomes a sort of layer that prevents some amount of sunlight from reaching the surface. Reduction of sulfur from the fuel led to less of this element in the atmosphere. This weakened the layer, causing more sunlight than before to reach the surface.

To make the assertions, researchers considered the ship data of the region from 18 to 28 February 2022. During this time, 5,000 ships supposedly moved in the Great Barrier Reef. The heat was progressively building up on the reef at that time. After gathering the data, they created computer models to figure out the amount of sulfur emission in the setup with the regulation, and what it would have been without it. The models essentially try to shed light on how sulfur particles emitted from the vessels drifted over the reef, and the cooling it facilitated.

The team also evaluated the weather conditions at the site to understand how sulfur moved in the air. Past observations had revealed that prevailing winds in the region blow the sulfur from above the reef. The results indicated that 5% to 10% more solar energy was hitting the reef’s waters with regulations than it would have without limitations. Researchers believe that the increased amount of sunlight, due to reduced sulfur emissions from the vessels, intensified the 2022 coral bleaching event on the Great Barrier Reef. The intensification is dangerous as it further hampers the marine ecosystem.

This is not an isolated event. The cooling effect occurs worldwide, and hence the removal of sulfur also increases temperatures across the globe, due to an enhanced amount of sunlight. Professor Steven Sherwood, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, not involved in the research, shared that the removal of sulfur aerosols from the atmosphere due to reduced emissions elevated the global temperatures by 32F. “This new study points out that while the overall effect on climate is small, the local effect on ocean temperatures in the tropics can be larger. This is because the air pollution absorbs some sunlight in addition to reflection to space,” Sherwood said, per The Guardian.

“Thus, they find a bigger effect, maybe up to 0.15 °C (32.27 °F), which is enough to increase the heat stress on the corals as reported. This is an important result since it shows the impact on corals might be nontrivial even though the overall global warming impact is pretty small,” Sherwood added. Despite the intensification of coral reef bleaching, experts do not think that the regulations should be called back. Reduction of sulfur pollution is essential for safeguarding human health. To prevent coral reef bleaching, greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced, which lowers global warming, which further triggers the bleaching.

This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint.
Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand.
Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.
This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment.","New Danish data, collected during real-world sailing, documents significant climate benefits from biofuel for the shipping industry. The findings have been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Soot particles – also known as black carbon – are among the most harmful emissions from shipping, both for the climate, where they contribute to global warming and melting of Arctic ice, and for public health through poor air quality. Now, experts from the CLEANSHIP project document that using biodiesel, specifically B100 FAME, during normal operation can reduce Black Carbon emissions by up to 81 percent compared to traditional marine gas oil (MGO).

The measurements were carried out on the Uni-Tankers vessel Falstria Swan, where an advanced online Black Carbon sensor from Green Instruments, developed in collaboration with Danish Technological Institute, made it possible to track emissions in detail and in real time during the vessel’s normal operation.

“We expected that biofuel would lead to cleaner combustion, but the magnitude of the reduction – especially at lower engine loads – is a very positive surprise. This demonstrates that biodiesel can reduce not only net CO₂, but also Black Carbon, which is highly significant for the shipping sector’s total climate footprint. At the same time, the measurement technology allows us to monitor emissions with much greater detail than ever before,” says Simon Bastrup Spangenberg, consultant and measurement specialist in alternative fuels and emission reduction at Danish Technological Institute.

For Uni-Tankers, the measurements translate directly into new, practical knowledge:

“The latest real-world sailing data on biodiesel (B100) give us a clear picture of both the black carbon footprint and actual CO₂ emissions. This insight is crucial for achieving our own reduction targets, while also contributing to better, data-driven recommendations for reducing emissions across the shipping industry,” says Troels Reppien, Technical Director at Uni-Tankers.

Although biodiesel demonstrates a significant reduction in Black Carbon, current global production of biofuel can only cover a small share of the global fleet’s total energy demand. Therefore, the Cleanship project continues to analyse data and work towards recommendations on how Black Carbon and other emissions can be effectively reduced in shipping.

The results from the measurement campaign have now been submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in the form of a white paper. This documentation will contribute to the international efforts to reduce Black Carbon emissions – especially in Arctic regions, where soot particles have a particularly significant climate impact on ice and the environment. The white paper is scheduled for consideration at IMO’s 13th session of the Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response (PPR), which will take place from 9–13 February 2026.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Danish_Maritime_Jan26_678a24ca4c.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 11:56:47.622884

The association recalls that it accepted the inclusion of shipping in the ETS on the condition that revenues would be reinvested in decarbonising the sector and that road transport would soon follow.
However, the recent decision by the Council to continue exempting road transport has raised serious concerns, as end users of maritime transport — including island communities — are being asked to shoulder the cost unilaterally.
“Excluding road transport creates an immediate and serious competitive disadvantage for ferries,” said Interferry Director of Regulatory Affairs Johan Rous.
“The current approach neither strengthens competitiveness nor cohesion and limits the sector’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies,” Rous said.","Interferry, the global association representing the ferry industry, is calling for an immediate freeze on the further application of the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) to shipping, warning that the current framework creates serious competitive distortions and risks shifting passengers and freight back to Europe’s already congested road networks.

The organisation urges the EU to keep the obligation to surrender emission allowances at the 70% level applied in 2025 and to suspend the planned increase to 100% from 2026, until road transport is also included in the ETS and a clear framework is established for channeling revenues towards the decarbonisation of shipping.

“The EU must honour its promise of a level playing field and ensure that climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, the most progressive transport sector,” said Interferry CEO Mike Corrigan, stressing that the measure should remain on hold until road transport is incorporated into the system.

The ferry sector plays a critical role in European transport, with more than 50% of the world’s RoRo and passenger vessel fleet operating in European waters, carrying around 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units annually within the EU. According to Interferry, any increase in fares due to ETS costs risks pushing freight back onto roads, undermining Europe’s long-standing strategy of shifting transport from land to sea.

The association recalls that it accepted the inclusion of shipping in the ETS on the condition that revenues would be reinvested in decarbonising the sector and that road transport would soon follow. However, the recent decision by the Council to continue exempting road transport has raised serious concerns, as end users of maritime transport — including island communities — are being asked to shoulder the cost unilaterally.

“Excluding road transport creates an immediate and serious competitive disadvantage for ferries,” said Interferry Director of Regulatory Affairs Johan Rous. “The ETS, as applied today, encourages the transfer of passengers and freight back to roads, directly contradicting Europe’s long-standing policy of shifting transport from land to sea.”

At the same time, the International Maritime Organization’s decision in October 2025 to postpone the adoption of a global carbon pricing mechanism for at least 12 months leaves the sector without a clear international framework and without certainty over when — or if — a unified system will be implemented.

According to Interferry, the ETS currently imposes an annual burden of around €1 billion on intra-European ferry services, at a time when the sector requires support for the production of e-fuels and major investments in port electrification to serve electric-powered vessels. Instead, the organisation says, most of the revenues are being channelled into national budgets of member states.

“The current approach neither strengthens competitiveness nor cohesion and limits the sector’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies,” Rous said.

Interferry, which has more than 280 members in over 40 countries, is calling on European authorities to reassess the policy to ensure that the green transition in shipping is accompanied by equal competitive conditions and genuine reinvestment of resources in the sector’s decarbonisation.",https://money-tourism.gr/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/azamara-cruises.png,N,,2026-01-23 11:56:43.934796

“During this week’s IMO meeting, member states agreed on clear guidance on how we must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts during the proposed extension of the experience building phase.
At the two forthcoming MEPC meetings this year, we hope to pursue policy that will move beyond voluntary guidance”, said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy, a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition.
These developments increase the risks of air, water, and underwater noise pollution.
Many regions, such as in the Arctic and the Gulf of California in Mexico, share similar potential impacts from underwater noise, and both have seen low shipping traffic in the past.","As a meeting of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC 12) closes, the Clean Arctic Alliance welcomed the clear guidance on how the IMO must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts, and the recommendation of a two year extension of the three-year “experience building phase” (EBP).

During SDC 12, Member States finalized a list of key technical aspects for reducing underwater noise from shipping, which will inform future policy considerations by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) during the proposed two-year extension of the Experience Building Phase, and will be initially considered by MEPC 84 in April.

The Clean Arctic Alliance, made up of 24 not-for-profit organizations, is calling on member states to ensure the IMO continues to push for progress and action in reducing underwater noise from shipping, especially in Arctic waters where the levels of underwater noise are anticipated to nearly quadruple by 2030.

“During this week’s IMO meeting, member states agreed on clear guidance on how we must reduce underwater noise pollution and its impacts during the proposed extension of the experience building phase. At the two forthcoming MEPC meetings this year, we hope to pursue policy that will move beyond voluntary guidance”, said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy, a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition. “So far, this work has not kept pace relative to the growing threats faced by regions experiencing increased shipping traffic, such as the Arctic, underscoring the need for parallel policy advancement through the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee in the coming months.”

For many marine organisms sound is the most important means of communication. Under water vision is restricted and without good hearing ability, elementary functions such as navigating, finding prey and partners can be hampered. This is of particular importance for marine mammals, and also for fish and even invertebrates.

“Much of the Arctic has been free of anthropogenic (human-sourced) sound for a long time, but with increased human activity, Arctic waters are becoming more noisy every year”, said Bobbe. “An important source of noise is shipping, specifically from propellers and engines. Since shipping has increased substantially during recent decades, underwater noise is a growing problem, contributing to serious impact on the Arctic ecosystem.”

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF and presented during a lunchtime side event, SDC 12-INF.17 – Spatio-temporal information on Arctic whale migration routes for consideration in voyage planning and other measures to reduce the impacts of underwater radiated noise on marine life provides new maps that show, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean.

Marine mammal migratory corridors are specified in both the URN Guidelines and the Polar Code as areas of special concern because they contain high concentrations of animals sensitive to impacts of shipping. The maps provide mariners with new information on where they need to take measures in migratory months, which in the Arctic, are in spring and autumn. Operational measures, such as rerouting and restricting speed, can reduce impacts on migrating whales, and these measures go hand in hand with technical measures to quieten ships through new builds and modifications. WWF invites mariners to use the maps in voyage planning, and urges member states and the IMO to implement location-specific rules and recommendations to reduce impacts of underwater noise in migratory corridors.

“By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them”, said Melanie Lancaster, Senior Specialist, Arctic species conservation for WWF’s Global Arctic Program and member of the Clean Arctic Alliance. “From the maps, we see that whales migrate impressive distances between their summer and winter habitats, some swimming thousands of kilometers across national borders and even into the high seas of the Central Arctic Ocean. It will take international cooperation among states, ship operators, shipping companies and IMO to ensure their safe and quiet passage.”

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic that build on the practice within IMO to safeguard whales from the adverse impacts of shipping.

Mandatory ship reporting systems and recommendatory seasonal areas to be avoided have been adopted for North Atlantic right whales along the United States east coast and recommendatory speed restrictions have been adopted as an Associated Protective Measure (APM) for whales in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The paper provides the necessary information for similar preventative measures to be adopted to safeguard whales in the Arctic.

A paper submitted to SDC 12 by the Clean Shipping Coalition - SDC 12/8/3 and sent onto MEPC 84 for consideration, shares the findings of a study on the potential underwater radiated noise (URN) impacts of LNG development on marine mammals in the Gulf of California. The paper examines the potential effects of URN from LNG tanker traffic on migratory and resident whales, as well as related impacts on air quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The proposed LNG terminals and the resulting increase in LNG tanker traffic are expected to pose serious threats to the Gulf of California's unique biodiversity and conservation areas, including those designated as a UNESCO ""World Heritage Site"" and ""Important Marine Mammal Areas"". These developments increase the risks of air, water, and underwater noise pollution. Given the Gulf of California's critical ecological role—particularly as a habitat for resident and migratory marine megafauna—a precautionary approach to industrial development is essential. It is increasingly evident that the region's ecological integrity is incompatible with the scale and nature of heavy marine traffic associated with proposed LNG facilities.

Many regions, such as in the Arctic and the Gulf of California in Mexico, share similar potential impacts from underwater noise, and both have seen low shipping traffic in the past. Shipping traffic has been increasing in the last decade in the Arctic, while in the Gulf of California the developing LNG infrastructure will bring unprecedented vessel traffic to a marine area with enormous ecological value, in particular for marine mammals.

“Our recommendations to SDC 12, and to the forthcoming discussions at MEPC 84, for the Gulf of California are equally important for the Arctic as both regions could see devastating impacts from future increased shipping, especially from LNG tankers, for marine wildlife particularly sensitive to noise, like marine mammals”, said Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes - a member of both the Clean Arctic Alliance and the Clean Shipping Coalition. “The recommendations include: acknowledging the irreversible impacts of underwater noise caused by LNG tanker traffic on marine mammals' behaviors and habitat; promoting the development of ship design that takes into account the serious damage underwater noise causes to the marine habitat; and opposing LNG traffic in critical ecological marine areas because of, among others, the underwater noise pollution it causes, affecting marine mammals and other marine species. Both the Gulf of California and the Arctic are marine areas of incredible ecological, social and biodiversity importance for the planet, the impacts of increased noise would change the quality of the marine habitats irrevocably.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/underwater_noise_1.png,N,,2026-01-23 08:56:46.004758

Attachment Green Methanol Ships Market","Dublin, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Green Methanol Ships Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Green Methanol Ships Market is projected to expand from USD 5.21 Billion in 2025 to USD 12.67 Billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 15.96%.

These vessels utilize methanol derived from renewable feedstocks, such as biomass or captured carbon dioxide mixed with green hydrogen, offering a sustainable substitute for traditional heavy fuel oil. The market is primarily driven by strict international decarbonization mandates, including the International Maritime Organization's emission reduction targets, alongside the shipping industry's voluntary pursuit of net-zero operations. According to the Methanol Institute, in 2025, the global fleet of methanol-fueled vessels, including those on order, exceeded 360 units, highlighting the sector's rapid shift toward alternative propulsion technologies to comply with tightening environmental regulations.

Despite this growth, the market faces significant hurdles regarding the scalability of fuel production and supply infrastructure. A major obstacle hindering broader expansion is the high production cost and limited availability of green methanol compared to fossil-based alternatives, which creates economic uncertainty for fleet operators attempting to secure long-term supply contracts.

Market Drivers

The surge in newbuild orders for methanol-powered vessels acts as a primary catalyst for market growth, creating a guaranteed demand baseline that forces stakeholders to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels. This momentum is particularly strong in the container segment, where major carriers are aggressively renewing fleets to hedge against future regulatory costs and secure early-mover advantages. According to DNV's 'Alternative Fuels Insights' from January 2025, methanol gained substantial traction with 166 orders in 2024, accounting for 32% of the alternative fuel orderbook. This robust contracting activity is validated by the operational reality of the technology; the Global Maritime Forum's 'From Pilots to Practice' report in August 2025 noted that the sector has moved beyond testing, with more than 60 methanol-capable vessels already in operation demonstrating technical viability.

Parallel to fleet expansion, increasing investments in green methanol production capacity are critical in resolving fuel availability bottlenecks. Energy developers are scaling up renewable fuel projects globally to meet the shipping industry's demand signals, ensuring long-term supply security and price stability. According to the Methanol Institute's November 2025 'Renewable Methanol' database update, the global project pipeline has expanded to track 252 renewable methanol projects with a total anticipated capacity of 45.1 million metric tons by 2030. This infrastructure expansion is vital for ensuring that the growing number of dual-fuel vessels can operate on green methanol rather than conventional fuels, thereby enabling the industry to meet its decarbonization targets.

Market Challenges

The limited scalability of green methanol production and associated high costs present a substantial barrier to market progression. While the maritime industry is seeing a surge in vessel orders, the supply chain for the necessary renewable fuel remains underdeveloped and financially restrictive. This discrepancy creates a volatile economic environment where fleet operators face elevated operational expenditures compared to those relying on fossil-based alternatives. Consequently, the uncertainty surrounding the consistent availability of green methanol prevents shipping companies from securing viable long-term supply contracts, introducing significant financial risk to their decarbonization strategies.

This supply-demand imbalance acts as a direct brake on broader commercial adoption, as the infrastructure required to produce and bunker green methanol globally is not expanding fast enough to match growing fleet capacity. According to the Methanol Institute, in 2024, the project pipeline for renewable methanol exceeded 21 million metric tons of potential annual capacity, yet the actual volume available for immediate maritime use remained critically low due to delayed final investment decisions. This gap between planned capacity and deliverable fuel highlights the logistical constraints that currently hinder the market's ability to support a full-scale transition.

Market Trends

The Rising Dominance of Asian Shipyards in Methanol Vessel Construction is reshaping the market, as regional builders leverage immense capacity to secure the majority of dual-fuel contracts. This trend is driven by their ability to offer competitive pricing and rapid delivery slots for complex vessels, effectively centralizing the global supply chain in Asia. According to Seatrade Maritime's January 2025 report, Chinese shipyards booked 74% of all newbuilding orders in 2024, with green vessel orders specifically accounting for 78.5% of the global market share. As a result, this manufacturing monopoly is increasingly influencing global procurement strategies and technical standards for methanol-powered fleets.

Simultaneously, the Diversification of Vessel Types Beyond Container Ships is accelerating as regulatory pressure expands to broader maritime sectors. While container lines initially led adoption, bulk carriers and cruise vessels are now aggressively integrating methanol propulsion to meet strict carbon intensity ratings. According to Marine Link in April 2025, this shift was evident as methanol led activity with 12 new orders in a single month, expanding specifically into cruise and car carrier segments. This sectoral broadening reduces reliance on a single vessel class, indicating a maturing technology stack suitable for varied operational profiles.

On the newly published report,“Fuel demand aggregation”, the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping (MMMCZCS) has explored fuel demand aggregation to understand whether consolidating demand across multiple offtakers can help overcome the challenges faced by fuel producers and maritime end-users.

The work is based on previous studies and more than 40 interviews with MMMCZCS partners and other relevant stakeholders across the maritime value chain. As explained, producers need bankable offtake agreements to secure funding and financing for fuel production plants.

These agreements would enable the supply of low-emissions fuels at the volumes that are required to transform the sector.

However, the maritime sector is unaccustomed to such long-term offtake agreements and is a highly fragmented industry, with diverse vessel types, ownership structures, and operating models, which complicate coordinated action and investment.

This mismatch creates a stalemate: no investment from offtakers due to uncertain supply, and no supply because producers lack secured offtake.

Stakeholders must adopt innovative approaches to break this stalemate and enable investment that supports the broader deployment of low-emissions fuels in the mid- to long-term.

…the report highlights.

Fuel demand aggregation in the maritime sector

The maritime sector needs reliable access to low-emissions fuels to meet international decarbonization ambitions. Today, the sector’s access is limited and complex because the market for low-emissions fuels is immature and lacks liquidity.

At the same time, regulations and first-mover strategies are pushing for a faster shift away from fossil fuels. Current maritime access to low-emissions fuels faces volume-related challenges: small, geographically dispersed volumes that are likely to grow slowly without support.

This fragmentation makes it difficult for producers to commit to investment and for the sector to scale up. Funding and financing support are critical to accelerate adoption, a need confirmed through the Center’s work on green corridors.

MMMCZCS research, has identified fuel demand aggregation as a potential pathway to make low-emissions fuels more accessible for the maritime sector and to reduce obstacles across the value chain.

Aggregation as a pathway to maritime decarbonization

Aggregating fuel demand means pooling fragmented volumes from multiple offtakers until a producer’s minimum volume threshold (anchor volume) is reached. This unlocks viable and cost-effective fuel production and enables the maritime sector to transition collectively during the early years of low liquidity in the low-emissions fuels market.

More concise

What aggregation does – and doesn’t solve

While aggregating fuel demand helps address quantity challenges for the upstream players in the emerging low-emissions fuel market, it does not solve individual ability to pay. Participation still requires a viable business case.

Because procurement involves commercial agreements, any attempts to aggregate fuel demand must comply with applicable competition laws in the relevant jurisdictions and markets.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/shutterstock_501816130-e1654238440347.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 05:37:22.661341

This publication addresses a critical gap in maritime safety guidance by providing the industry’s first comprehensive resource dedicated specifically to deck operations. Together with the widely used Bridge Procedures Guide and Engine Room Procedures Guide, this new publication completes a trilogy of core resources designed to harmonise best practice across all shipboard departments.

While these three guides provide essential, department-specific procedures, they form part of ICS’s broader portfolio of safety publications that support shipowners and operators worldwide.

Covering the full spectrum of deck-side activities, the guide includes practical procedures for cargo operations, mooring and anchoring, bunkering, heavy weather preparations, and maintenance of core equipment across all ship types.

It also features guidance on compliance with the International Maritime Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMSBC) Code and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code, as well as an interactive risk assessment tool and adaptable checklists to support safe and efficient operations. One chapter addresses the emerging challenge of alternative fuel bunkering, including LNG, methanol, and ammonia, developed in collaboration with leading operators and reviewed by the Society for Gas as Marine Fuel (SGMF).

“Deck operations are fundamental to ship safety, and crews need clear, validated procedures for every scenario they face,” said John Stawpert, Principal Director – Marine at the International Chamber of Shipping.

“This guide delivers that comprehensive knowledge, from traditional practices to new considerations such as alternative fuels, helping crews operate confidently while maintaining the highest safety standards.”

The Deck Procedures Guide has been developed through a rigorous review process involving representatives from Swire Shipping, Anglo-Eastern Univan Group, Japanese Shipowners Association, MISC Group, Intercargo, and CLIA. It provides structured guidance for all key deck operations, supported by practical checklists and risk assessment tools that help identify and mitigate hazards before they occur. The content is designed to be adaptable, enabling organisations to tailor procedures to their specific operational needs while ensuring compliance with international codes.

The guide is designed as an invaluable tool for masters, chief officers, deck officers, bosuns and other members of deck crew, as well as engineering officers responsible for deck machinery and crew involved in bunkering operations. ICS recommends that a copy is carried on board every ship.

It also serves ship superintendents, technical superintendents, HSEQ managers, shipping company shoreside safety teams, training institutions, terminal operators, and organisations transitioning to alternative fuel operations.

“Every onboard department needs to work together to ensure the safety and security of the crew, ship, environment and cargo,” commented Emily Yates, Commercial Director at the International Chamber of Shipping.

“The Deck Procedures Guide complements the Bridge and Engine Room Procedures Guides, creating a harmonised set of resources that uphold best practice across ship operations. While aligned for consistency, each guide is tailored to its audience, ensuring masters, engineers, and deck crews receive guidance directly relevant to their responsibilities. These guides work together to improve operational coordination and inter-departmental communication throughout the vessel, alongside ICS’s broader portfolio of safety publications.”

The Deck Procedures Guide offers an international alternative to region-specific guidance, reducing deck deficiencies while enhancing safety standards and port state control confidence. The guide emphasises best practice approaches rather than regulatory mandates, providing practical guidance applicable to today’s diverse global fleet.

Baltic Exchange on Tuesday (13 January) released an article by Carly Fields discussing methanol as a marine fuel, availability of low-GHG methanol and challenges in the development of e-methanol:

In the race to re-fuel the shipping industry with environmental alternatives to heavy fuel oil, methanol has its staunch supporters. The greener, leaner fuel also has a firm foundation to build on.

Marius Leisner, senior principal consultant in the Environmental Advisory unit at DNV, said methanol boasts a “ten-year track record as a marine fuel”, which provides a level of comfort that other alternatives, such as ammonia or hydrogen, currently lack. This equates to a robust technological foundation, with ship designs and fuel-system integration strategies having matured significantly through the recent influx of methanol-capable vessels in the global order book.

One of the primary drivers behind the mounting interest in methanol is its relative ease of handling. In a world where gaseous fuels present significant logistical and safety hurdles, methanol’s liquid state is a distinct advantage, Leisner notes.

“Being a liquid, methanol is simpler and, I would say, safer to store, transport, and bunker than gaseous fuels such as LNG, ammonia, and hydrogen.”

Furthermore, its volumetric energy intensity compares favourably to other green alternatives, being “similar to ammonia and higher than hydrogen”.

Historically, the adoption of methanol has been driven by local environmental compliance rather than global carbon reduction. Early pioneers used it to meet stringent sulphur and nitrogen oxide standards. As Leisner explained: “Methanol is sulphur-free and fully complies with MARPOL Annex VI SOx standards”.

Low-GHG methanol drive

But while it burns cleanly, generating “very little soot or particulate matter,” it is not a silver bullet for greenhouse gases in its conventional form. When produced from fossil sources, methanol’s “total well-to-wake GHG intensity is generally worse than fuel oil, Leisner said. The true promise lies in the transition to bio-methanol and e-methanol, which “can be produced from non-fossil sources with near-zero well-to-wake emissions”. However, the current landscape reveals a significant gap between capability and practice. Leisner points out that “most vessels capable of using methanol today still operate on fuel oil or fossil methanol, with only limited uptake of low-GHG methanol”.

The availability of low-GHG methanol is currently the bottleneck of the movement. While the world’s production capacity for green methanol sits at approximately 2.2 million tonnes per year—98% of which is bio-methanol—the actual bunkering volumes reported since 2023 remain “far lower” than this capacity. This suggests that while the fuel exists, the market mechanisms to put it into tanks are lagging. There is, however, cause for optimism on the horizon. If current investment decisions hold, “production capacity could increase to around 14 million tonnes by 2030, mainly driven by projects in China”, Leisner said.

Infrastructure is one area where methanol benefits from a head start. It is already one of the most widely shipped chemical commodities on the planet, with storage capacity existing in “over 115 ports worldwide”. The logistical chain is further strengthening as “dedicated methanol bunkering vessels are also emerging, with 12 currently in operation and six more on order”, Leisner said. From this perspective, the physical infrastructure is largely ready; the challenge is the price tag.

“Fundamentally, it comes down to fuel cost,” he said.

The economic gulf between fossil fuels and green alternatives remains vast. In 2025, bio-methanol prices in Rotterdam were recorded at roughly “three times the cost of marine gas oil”.

While organisations like the Methanol Institute and IRENA project that prices could fall significantly by 2050 as technology scales, the immediate future requires more than just hope for lower costs.

e-Methanol hurdles

The development of e-methanol, which utilises renewable electricity and captured carbon, faces even steeper hurdles. Currently, e-methanol accounts for only about 2% of green methanol production because it is “difficult to compete on cost today”, Leisner said. The low energy efficiency in converting green electricity into fuel remains the fundamental technical conundrum for all e-fuels. Despite this, a large portion of the future production pipeline is dedicated to e-methanol, as its ability to “approach zero GHG intensity” may justify its premium price under stricter future regulations.

To bridge this economic divide, the industry is looking toward regulators to provide the necessary “carrot” or “stick.” DNV’s modelling suggests that without strong intervention, methanol-capable ships will simply continue to burn fossil fuels to protect their bottom lines.

Leisner states that scaling will require “stronger and more sustained demand signals, such as long-term offtake agreements with defined prices and volumes, to give producers confidence to invest”.

The regulatory landscape is currently made up of two key frameworks. The FuelEU Maritime initiative provides an “important but limited demand signal”, with projected methanol use rising to between five and twelve million tonnes by 2040. In contrast, the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework represents a much more aggressive path. Under this framework, uptake is much faster, reaching 20 to 50 million tonnes. However, the recent decision to postpone the implementation of the IMO framework has left many in the industry, including DNV, feeling frustrated. Leisner admits that “a decision providing certainty would have been very helpful”.

The future of methanol in shipping is essentially a race against time and policy. The technological readiness is “largely there”, Leisner said, with major engine manufacturers like Wärtsilä and MAN already having accumulated hundreds of thousands of running hours on methanol systems. The order book is healthy, with approximately 370 methanol-capable vessels set to join the global fleet.

What remains missing is the economic bridge that allows shipowners to choose the green option without compromising their commercial viability. As Leisner concludes, the transition depends on how much of the fleet’s capacity is “actually used for low-GHG methanol rather than fossil fuels”. Until the price of carbon or the incentives for green fuel reach a tipping point, methanol will remain a promising solution waiting for the market to catch up to its potential.

The EU Council recently decided to postpone the inclusion of road transport – raising significant concerns in the short sea shipping sector as to why end users of maritime transports, e.g.
“This exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an immediate, severe competitive disadvantage for RoRo and passenger ferries,” says Johan Roos, Director Regulatory Affairs of Interferry.","Interferry wants the surrendering obligation for maritime emissions frozen at the 70% level scheduled for 2025, halting the planned increase to 100% in 2026.

“This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonisation,” says Mike Corrigan (pictured), CEO of Interferry. “The EU must deliver on its promise of a level playing field and ensure its climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, its most forward-looking transport sector.”

Interferry points out that ferry services are critically important to Europe, with more than half of the world’s gross RoRo- and passenger ship tonnage operating in European waters, transporting 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units every year within the EU, significantly offloading the road network. Every euro of freight rate increase on ferries risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks.

Interferry supports decarbonisation of the maritime industry but says it accepted the EU ETS on the clear understanding that funds collected would actually be used for decarbonisation and that road transport would also soon be included. The EU Council recently decided to postpone the inclusion of road transport – raising significant concerns in the short sea shipping sector as to why end users of maritime transports, e.g. island communities, have to carry the full costs of ETS.

“This exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an immediate, severe competitive disadvantage for RoRo and passenger ferries,” says Johan Roos, Director Regulatory Affairs of Interferry.

“As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs. This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea.”

Furthermore, in October 2025 the IMO postponed the adoption of a global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pricing mechanism (as part of its Net Zero Framework) for at least 12 months – a framework that was intended to replace the EU ETS and would have set clear guidelines for the use of the funds collected. Meanwhile, Interferry points out that its members operating to and from EU ports are taxed for their CO2 emissions without a clear provision on how the money is reinvested to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and without certainty when a global IMO regulation will come into force – if at all.

“The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately one billion euros per year,” adds Roos, “while we need support for production of e-fuels and substantial investments in electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships. Instead, the vast majority of these revenues are being diverted to national Member State budgets. This approach neither promotes competitivity nor cohesion and hinders the industry’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies.”",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Project-13-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 00:56:57.030656

Sob a coordenação do Ministério de Portos e Aeroportos (MPor), os programas nacionais buscam atender às metas da Organização Marítima Internacional (IMO). Until 2050, a organização estabeleceu net zero emissions for the sector. Additionally, there are several leisure, a IMO avançou na cobrança de taxas por tonelada de CO₂ acima de limites definidos. In this way, eficiência ambiental e custo operacional passaram a caminhar juntos.

In practice, as iniciativas estimulam eletrificação portuária, providing energia limpa a navios atracados. parallel, promote reduction in the use of fossil fuels during operations. Consequently, os ganhos ambientais se combinam com maior previsibilidade regulatória.

Meanwhile, o Brasil aparece como parte da solução energética. In September 2025, durante eventos do Brazil Climate Summit, em Nova York, Boston Consulting Group destacou o potencial nacional. According to the study, a produção brasileira de biofuels pode suprir up to 15% of global demand do setor marítimo. Like this, o país reforça sua posição estratégica.

In this context, biodiesel de soja apresenta vantagem técnica relevante. According to the data, o combustível emite 48% menos CO₂ por megajoule quando comparado ao diesel tradicional. Therefore, a alternativa contribui para metas climáticas sem ruptura operacional.

Additionally, there are several leisure, Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) já mostrou resultados concretos. Durante a COP30, em 2025, embarcações usadas como hotéis flutuantes foram abastecidas com GNL. Thereby, there was redução entre 20% e 30% das emissões frente ao diesel. Logo, a tecnologia se consolidou como opção de transição.

In this scenario, a liderança empresarial também se manifesta. Thiago NascimentoCEO of Maritime Ship Service, stated that a sustentabilidade é essencial ao desenvolvimento responsável da cadeia logística marítima. According to him, a COP30 colocou o Brasil em evidência e acelerou ações práticas para minimize environmental impacts.

In addition, o arcabouço regulatório avançou. June 2025, o governo publicou a Política Marítima Nacionalthrough the Decree No. 12.481 / 2025, in the Official Gazette of the Union. The text prevê medidas para reduction of greenhouse gases, controle de resíduos e gestão sustentável dos recursos marinhos. Like this, a política integra ambiente, logística e desenvolvimento.

Still in 2025, o MPor lançou o Sustainability Pact. The initiative reconhece empresas portuárias e de navegação que adotam boas práticas socioambientais e de governança. Como incentivo, participantes podem receber selos ambientais, reforçando compromissos voluntários com a agenda ESG.",https://clickpetroleoegas.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mar_navio_1200px.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 11:36:51.408350

“We are not abandoning the EU position or the green transition targets – but we need to find a way out of the stalemate,” the source said.","The Greek government is working on a proposal with the United States and Saudi Arabia to curb CO2 emissions from shipping, bypassing EU coordination on the issue.

The proposal is under discussion at the London-based International Maritime Organization (IMO). Athens is abandoning a joint EU position on global shipping decarbonisation, which is currently frozen at the IMO.

“Greece and Saudi Arabia have agreed to cooperate, through their competent ministries – shipping and energy – with a view to submitting a joint proposal on this specific matter,” Greek Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou said on Thursday, following a meeting in Riyadh with his Saudi counterpart, Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud.

Athens is providing a “voice of realism” on energy issues in Europe, Papastavrou added.

The move is expected to raise eyebrows in Brussels. That’s because individual EU countries are expected to seek agreement with the remaining 26 rather than cooperate with third countries on a matter over which the European Commission holds exclusive competence.

It is already the second time Athens, home to much of the global shipping industry, has broken the bloc’s ranks after Greece, alongside Cyprus, abstained during an October vote in London on a global net-zero shipping deal.

At the centre of the debate is the Net-Zero Shipping Framework (NSF), which would force ship operators continuing to use the dirtiest – and cheapest – fuels to pay a gradually increasing carbon price, proportionate to their excess CO2 emissions.

In practice, the framework would prioritise low-carbon alternatives such as hydrogen and synthetic e-fuels derived from renewable energy, favouring countries such as Denmark and China, which have invested heavily in these technologies.

However, agreement on the proposal was postponed for a year last October following opposition from Washington and Riyadh. The US administration even threatened sanctions if the deal went ahead, as Washington supports liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transitional fuel.

The diplomatic row last October was widely seen as another instance of Europe being caught in a broader geopolitical tug-of-war between Washington and Beijing. Denmark, which opposed the US line, appears to have paid a price, having failed for the first time in late November to secure re-election to the IMO Council.

Breaking the bloc

Following the chaotic October meeting, the European Commission told Euractiv that it was open to renegotiating the net-zero shipping deal. Now Greece appears to have renegotiated the deal with Washington and Riyadh, not Brussels.

But Greece’s position could trigger an infringement procedure within the EU.

One EU diplomat noted that only the EU as a whole can table a common position at the IMO, and that in the event of internal disagreement, the bloc simply has no official position.

“Member states do not align themselves with third-country camps,” the diplomat added.

Following the publication of the article, a Greek government source told Euractiv that Athens intends to work with all relevant stakeholders to reach an agreement that serves both the US and Europe.

Cian Delaney, biofuels campaigner at T&E, said: “Soy biofuels are twice as bad for the planet as fossil diesel.

Biofuels have been widely promoted across the EU since the adoption of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) in 2009. In 2019, the introduction of the high ILUC Delegated Act confirmed a phase-out of palm biofuels by 2030. Soy will now be subjected to the same fate. While this does remove one of the most damaging feedstocks from Europe’s energy mix, growing EU demand for biofuels means that the scramble for feedstocks will still intensify.

More than 100 million tonnes of sugar cane is used in global biofuels production today. This is expected to grow by 50% by 2030. This includes problematic projects in regions like Papua, Indonesia, where clearance of natural forest is already underway to make space for sugarcane cultivation.

About PowerCell Group PowerCell Group is a Swedish specialist in PEM fuel cell systems, spun out of Volvo back in 2009.","Ever caught yourself daydreaming about a giant bulk carrier powered by something shinier than heavy fuel oil? Welcome to the GAMMA project—where a 60,000 DWT bulk carrier will run everything from lights and pumps to navigation electronics on a 1 MW hydrogen fuel cell system, with the H2 made onboard from clean ammonia and biomethanol.

This isn’t Europe’s first rodeo with hydrogen fuel cells on ferries and coastal runs, but GAMMA is by far the first deep-sea retrofit at this scale.

A Decade of R&D Meets Maritime Ambition

Launched in early 2024, GAMMA is a five-year Horizon Europe programme, bankrolled with €13 million of EU cash in a €17 million budget. It wraps up years of R&D on hydrogen production, storage, and reformer design—while simultaneously polishing fuel cell technology—all driven by the IMO’s net-zero-by-2050 goals. Sixteen partners—from Germany’s Fraunhofer to Norway’s SINTEF and Italy’s Politecnico di Milano—are teaming up to pull off this ambitious demo, marking a big step forward for Europe’s industrial decarbonization ambitions.

Real-World Demo on Deep-Sea Vessels

Coordinated by Iceland’s engineering consultancy Verkis, the retrofit happens on a vessel managed by Italy’s ANT Topic. Instead of clattering diesel generators below deck, the ship will sport a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system cranking out 1 MW to keep hotel loads, pumps, and electronics humming during long ocean passages.

“This at-sea demo gives us the hard data we need to de-risk hydrogen fuel cells for the shipping world,” says Richard Berkling, CEO of PowerCell Group. Born as a Volvo spin-off in 2009, PowerCell has spent years refining its fuel cell technology in cars and power grids—and now it’s setting its sights on the high seas.

Onboard Hydrogen from Clean Ammonia

Let’s be real: stashing pure hydrogen on a ship is a logistical headache—think heavy tanks, extreme cooling, or insane pressures. GAMMA’s workaround? Carrying clean ammonia and biomethanol—liquids that behave at ambient temps—and reforming them onboard into H2. It’s classic petrochemical know-how meets renewable feedstocks. The result? A steady flow of hydrogen into those PEM stacks, with water vapor as the only exhaust.

“By blending ammonia and biomethanol reforming, we give ship operators real fuel flexibility,” explains Freyr Ingolfsson, project coordinator at Verkis. “Ports vary wildly in bunkering options, so our system adapts to whatever’s on offer.”

Key Metrics and Performance Goals

The consortium is chasing over 50% fuel cell efficiency and sub-15-minute start-up times. Engineers will track stack degradation, reformer conversion rates, and system resilience under rolling seas. Safety checks—like ammonia slip sensors and rapid shutdown routines—are under the microscope for class societies and insurers.

Marine Engineering Meets Fuel Cell Integration

Hooking a PEM fuel cell into a ship’s power grid is no small feat. You need power management that juggles variable loads, syncs to backup generators and batteries, and flips over seamlessly if something trips. Control logic—often coded by Politecnico di Milano—coordinates reformers, stacks, and HVAC, while safety interlocks lock everything down if ammonia levels spike or pressures climb.

Industrial Decarbonization in Action

Here’s the big picture: deep-sea shipping belts out roughly 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, with auxiliary engines taking a hefty slice. Swapping fossil-fuel generators for zero-emission hydrogen fuel cells could cut hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon a year once scaled. GAMMA isn’t just a proof-of-concept; it’s charting a route for fresh regulations and port upgrades.

Consortium Collaboration and Governance

Verkis steers project management, keeping milestones aligned across all partners. Fraunhofer tackles systems safety analysis, SINTEF handles emissions monitoring, and Applus+ maps out the certification playbook. Europe-wide workshops keep everyone on the same page, and every deliverable goes through peer review—minimizing hiccups and sparking new ideas.

Business and Strategic Angle

Shipping is famously risk averse—fleets stick with what works. By showcasing a seamless retrofit, GAMMA lowers the bar for early adopters. For PowerCell Group, it’s a golden ticket to prove they can scale up from small demos. European makers of reformers, stacks, and control systems get a live proving ground to fine-tune products and drive down costs.

Europe’s racing to stand out in industrial decarbonization. A win here could unlock export markets for marine fuel cell technology—both on new builds and retrofits. Shipyards from Gothenburg to Genoa are already chatting with hydrogen and ammonia tech suppliers about green vessel contracts.

Supply Chain and Job Creation

The push toward maritime hydrogen will ripple across Europe’s industrial base. German component fabricators, Swedish reformer module makers, and Italian software integrators all stand to gain. GAMMA is already creating dozens of skilled roles in system assembly, commissioning, and remote diagnostics. Scale up to commercial fleets, and we’re talking hundreds more jobs along the value chain.

Challenges and Collateral Gains

Life at sea demands shock-resistant hardware, salt-tolerant materials, and space-efficient layouts. Upfront capital costs still loom large. But the benefits are compelling: real-world data on efficiency, maintenance intervals, and safety; a blueprint for classification societies; and confidence signals for investors and insurers. Local supply chains for hydrogen production and reforming modules get a boost, too, supporting more engineering and fabrication jobs.

Insurance firms and flag states will scrutinize the safety case, especially around clean ammonia. If GAMMA nails its risk mitigation, future projects could breeze through certification.

Regulatory Momentum and Standards

GAMMA’s technical dossier is primed to feed into the EU’s Fit for 55 debates and upcoming IMO guideline updates. As regulators push for transparent hydrogen infrastructure planning in emission control areas, demo projects become must-haves. Safe-handling protocols for clean ammonia will shape global standards, letting ports worldwide harmonize bunkering rules and certification pathways.

Implications for Maritime Infrastructure

Ports need to step up. Bunkering stations for clean ammonia, plus hydrogen hubs, could pop up along green shipping corridors. As ammonia producers, tank builders, and logistics experts collaborate, we may see a fresh hydrogen infrastructure network sprout in key hubs like Rotterdam and Singapore.

Next Steps and Sea Trials

Retrofitting is already underway, with factory tests lined up for next year, followed by dockside commissioning and live sea trials. The partners aim to deliver a full technical dossier—covering everything from hydrogen slip detection to life-cycle costs and emergency protocols. Those insights will feed into IMO discussions and emerging EU rules on zero-emission shipping.

Looking Ahead in the Blue Economy

GAMMA sits among a fleet of maritime decarbonization efforts—from wind-assisted sails to battery-hybrid ferries. Its success could tip the scales on which path the industry follows. For shipowners, charterers, and financiers, real-world proof beats simulations. Once the maiden voyages pay off, the blue economy could surge full speed toward a zero-emission future.

Green Shipping Corridors, formally launched at COP26 through the Clydebank Declaration, were designed to provide that delivery pathway.
More than four years on, the focus is increasingly shifting from policy frameworks to implementation, with short-sea Green Shipping Corridors widely recognized as the fastest and most viable way to move from commitment to delivery.

That is how Green Shipping Corridors move from policy commitment to operational delivery.”","Interferry has warned this week that ferry operators are facing rising costs under the EU Emissions Trading System faster than practical decarbonization solutions are being deployed.

The warning has renewed and intensified scrutiny of how maritime decarbonization commitments are being translated into action. This means emissions are being priced before the infrastructure needed to reduce them is in place, raising costs for operators without yet delivering equivalent emissions reductions.

Green Shipping Corridors, formally launched at COP26 through the Clydebank Declaration, were designed to provide that delivery pathway. More than four years on, the focus is increasingly shifting from policy frameworks to implementation, with short-sea Green Shipping Corridors widely recognized as the fastest and most viable way to move from commitment to delivery.

Against this backdrop, attention is turning to solutions that translate regulation and ambition into real emissions reductions, enabling ferry, short-sea cruise and RoRo operators to act in practice rather than absorb rising costs.

NatPower Marine says the concerns raised by the ferry industry further highlight a widening gap between regulation and the rollout of enabling infrastructure. Pricing emissions without rapidly giving operators the means to reduce them risks increasing costs, undermining route viability and pushing up ticket prices, without accelerating real-world decarbonization. In some cases, this may even weaken the role of ferries in shifting passengers and freight away from higher-emissions road transport.

Stefano D.M. Sommadossi, CEO of NatPower Marine UK, said the Interferry warning reflects a structural challenge facing maritime transport. “The ferry industry is signaling that obligations are rising faster than the infrastructure needed to meet them,” he said. “Climate policy only delivers results when operators can act on it in practice.”

While much of the regulatory debate continues to focus on long-term fuel pathways, NatPower Marine recognizes that short-sea ferry and RoPax routes present the most immediate opportunity to turn Green Shipping Corridors from commitments into operational reality. These services operate on fixed schedules, with frequent port calls and sufficient dwell time to fully benefit from port-side electrification.

Shore power and high-capacity e-ship charging enable vessels to eliminate emissions while at berth, delivering immediate reductions in carbon dioxide alongside significant cuts in nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides and particulate matter. In addition to improving compliance metrics such as the IMO’s Carbon Intensity Indicator, port-side power delivers tangible air-quality benefits for port cities and island communities that depend on ferry services.

Sommadossi said electrifying ports strengthens ferries as part of the climate solution rather than penalizing them. “If emissions pricing pushes freight and passengers away from ferries and back onto already congested road networks, overall emissions increase,” he said. “Port-side power does the opposite. It reinforces sea transport as the lowest-emissions corridor and supports long-standing objectives to shift traffic from road to sea.”

The company points to routes such as the 142 mile (123 nautical miles) Heysham–Belfast route as examples of how short-sea Green Shipping Corridors can move rapidly from policy ambition to delivery on the quayside. By installing shore power and e-ship charging infrastructure at the port, emissions can be cut immediately, giving operators the confidence to invest in electric and hybrid vessels.

The Heysham initiative represents a landmark step forward, with the potential to eliminate more than 10,000 tons of CO2 annually and sending a clear signal of commitment from all involved.

NatPower Marine’s route-based, fully funded infrastructure model removes the need for upfront capital investment by ferry operators, enabling decarbonization to scale without compromising connectivity, affordability, or competitiveness.

“The challenge facing maritime decarbonization is not a lack of ambition,” Sommadossi concluded. “Since the Clydebank Declaration, regulation has accelerated, from FuelEU Maritime to the EU ETS, while a global IMO framework remains uncertain. What has not kept pace is the rollout of enabling infrastructure. Short-sea corridors show that when port-side power is in place, emissions fall immediately and commercially. That is how Green Shipping Corridors move from policy commitment to operational delivery.”",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Stefano-Sommadossi-CEO-NatPower_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 14:57:42.953029

MSC sees hydrogen and biofuels as the future fuel mix for shipping, and it can provide a practical roadmap for procurement teams to align them with long-term decarbonization goals. The approach lets teams polegać on interoperable technologie, with early testing on key lanes delivering actionable data to guide scale-up.

Concrete data from trials show emissions reductions depend on the fuel and the supply chain. Green hydrogen produced from renewables can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 90% versus heavy fuel oil on selected routes, while biofuels such as ISCC-certified fats and oils or hydrotreated vegetable oil typically deliver 60-80% reductions, depending on feedstock and processing. To manage risk, start with a phased procurement plan and measure energy intensity as you scale.

Engaging cross-industry partners–ports, engine makers, fuel suppliers, insurers, and financiers–contributes to faster technology maturation. A conference this year will provide a platform to share data, which joins practical field insights there with policy signals to help operators plan investments and timelines.

To translate insights into action, build a procurement strategy that prioritizes long-term fuel guarantees, invest in bunkering infrastructure, and run pilot projects on flagship routes. Align with engine makers to ensure technologie are retrofitted and crews trained; monitor performance, fuel compatibility, and safety margins; keep track of costs and availability so supply chains remain reliable. This work will require cross-silo collaboration and clear governance.

There remains a path forward: as technologie become perfected, costs fall and supply chains mature. The entire industry benefits when pozyskiwanie levers are aligned with route planning, port calls, and vessel design; with ongoing engaging forums and cross-industry collaboration, ship operators can move toward a decarbonized future.

MSC Sees Hydrogen and Biofuels in Shipping’s Future Fuel Mix and Hydrogen Council Collaboration

Recommend launching a three-year mediterranean pilot program to test hydrogen and biofuel blends on scheduled routes, targeting a 20% hydrogen-in-fuel injection by 2030 and 50% by 2035, with six corridors and a marketplace-ready plan to demonstrate a revenue-neutral model that scales with demand.

Hydrogen Council collaboration should establish a unified fuel standard, actively facilitate cross-border sharing of fuel data, and create a joint marketplace for supply and logistics that reduces downtime and cost disruption for fleets.

MSC sees hydrogen and biofuels as the future fuel mix and positions them as an alternative to traditional bunker fuels. Related pilots show blended solutions can cut sulfur emissions and improve carbon intensity across mediterranean ports while maintaining reliability for the fleet.

To overcome infrastructure gaps, the plan coordinates public-private funding to provide anchor investments in ports, storage, bunkering, and injection points, while building supply chain visibility that can scale with demand.

Active collaboration across industry stakeholders will capture massive volume growth as more terminals and shipyards join. There is growing investor appetite for early-stage deployment, and the source of hydrogen from renewable electricity and biofuel supply chains is critical. The approach must be engaging for customers and port authorities alike, with transparent reporting and sharing of results.

Given the scale, MSC must facilitate ongoing data sharing, track performance, and report progress quarterly; the partnership contributes to a diversified energy mix and a resilient marketplace that accepts blended fuels across the mediterranean fleet.

Which biofuels are MSC piloting on core routes?

Pilot HVO blends on mediterranean core routes now and scale renewable methanol on select corridors within 12–18 months.

Which biofuels are MSC piloting on core routes? The current program centers on three fuels with proven compatibility and scalable supply chains:

Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) blended with MGO up to 30–50% on a portion of the fleet serving mediterranean and adjacent EU corridors, preserving engine performance while cutting lifecycle emissions.

FAME biodiesel blends (20–40%) on high-density container lanes and feeder services, with careful monitoring of storage, cold flow, and bunker compatibility.

Renewable methanol (bio-methanol) as an alternative on selected short-haul core routes, enabling a near-term decarbonisation pathway and aligning with portside bunkering density.

To accelerate deployment, MSC forms partnerships with fuel suppliers, ports, and companies, embedding a darr framework to track data and performance. The maritime network in the mediterranean is expanding, strengthening marketplace options and giving the fleet confidence to scale. This development approach prioritises blended fuels first and includes a perfected handling process to ensure seamless container ship operations and smooth bunkering. Further steps include extending pilots to additional core routes and refining supply chains. These steps help decarbonise maritime operations.

What hydrogen readiness steps are needed for MSC ships?

Begin with a term-based hydrogen readiness plan that decarbonise a subset of MSC shippings and push the broader fleet toward a measurable decarbonisation path, anchored by groups across member companies and external partners to guarantee a neutral, data-driven assessment of which technologies perform best.

Map routes and demand to determine the hydrogen source and the scale of on-board storage and injection needs. Evaluate options including high-pressure tanks, cryogenic LH2, and carrier-based approaches, and plan how injection will feed main engines or auxiliary power with clear safety interlocks and fuel-handling workflows, to capture learning for the next wave of upgrades.

Choose propulsion concepts MSC can retrofit: dual-fuel engines or hydrogen-only modules; outline the technical work, required certifications, and how systems will integrate with propulsion, power, and hull design.

Develop safety and compliance frameworks: standardised design rules, crew training, leak detection, bunkering procedures, and emergency response plans aligned with port authorities and flag states.

Build a massive bunkering and storage network in key ports to support a steady supply, plus on-shore generation or reliable hydrogen source injection; design a term-based sourcing approach with suppliers and ensure a neutral, traceable supply chain.

Set up governance across the groups: a cross-functional steering body, clear milestones, and a data-sharing term that measures fuel efficiency, emissions reductions, and operational risk, with feedback loops to scale the programme across the member fleet.

Which port and bunkering upgrades are planned to support hydrogen?

Implement a phased bunkering blueprint that pairs fixed hydrogen hubs with mobile units, using standardized 350/700 bar interfaces and dual-hose transfer. Equip berths with on-site electrolysis capacity of 10–20 MW where wind or solar is available, and store hydrogen in cryogenic tanks sized at 2 × 20,000 kg per berth. Ensure injection lines and shore connections meet ISO 19880-1 standards and include robust safety systems, leak detection, and pressure management. This configuration mainly targets reliable supply for large vessels while enabling rapid fueling, helping to overcome gaps during peak port calls. MSC says the approach centers on decarbonization and invites collaboration across groups including shippings, energy providers, and port authorities. The plan also contemplates both green hydrogen production and blue options that may rely on capture when CCS is deployed.

Given the need for scale, ports should align with conference-led industry work and standardization bodies to harmonize interfaces. Build partnerships with energy suppliers, equipment manufacturers, and shipping lines to share risk and investment, and establish a neutral governance model that prioritizes safety and interoperability. Define the source of hydrogen to ensure transparency, and prepare for injections and meters that support different hydrogen sources, including green electrolysis and blue hydrogen from low-emission reforming. Prioritize a phased rollout: start with a few berths per port, then expand as demand grows and maintenance schedules allow, while exploring alternative fuels integration where feasible.

Port Planned Upgrades Capacity/Timeline Partners/Notes Port of Rotterdam (Netherlands) Two fixed H2 bunkering berths at Maasvlakte; 350/700 bar delivery; on-site 10–20 MW electrolyzer; cryogenic storage for 2 × 20,000 kg; shore-to-ship injection lines; safety and monitoring 2025–2027 (phase 1), full rollout by 2028 Port Authority, major energy players, shipping lines; CCS pilot for blue H2 Singapur STS bunkering readiness; fixed 350 bar stations; on-site 5–10 MW electrolyzer; storage ~2 × 10,000 kg; pipeline tie-in to LNG hub; injection lines 2026–2028 MPA, local utilities, energy firms; emphasis on interoperable interfaces Los Angeles/Long Beach (USA) On-site green hydrogen production (5–15 MW); fixed berths; 350/700 bar; storage 2 × 15,000 kg; mobile bunkering support; injections and safety 2027–2029 Port Authorities, regional energy partners, shipping groups Busan (South Korea) Hydrogen bunkering readiness; fixed stations; 350/700 bar; on-site electrolyzer 5–10 MW; storage 2 × 8,000–12,000 kg; integration with national hydrogen grid 2026–2028 Busan Port Authority, energy companies, local shipowners

These upgrades create a practical, scalable hydrogen supply chain at key hubs, supporting collaborations across development work and cross-border partnerships. The focus remains on clean source diversification, safe injection practices, and continuous improvement as shippings adopt hydrogen as a core element of the decarbonization agenda.

What milestones does the Hydrogen Council collaboration target and when?

Target deployments by 2025 and scale to mainstream use by 2030–2035, with concrete steps to decarbonize the entire shipping sector. The plan focuses on biofuels and hydrogen as alternative fuels, designed to raise efficiency and reduce emissions. Yesterday’s pilots validated the approach and provided information that fuels further development, which informs timelines for scale and sharing across companies.

2025 – Pilot deployments across three cross-border corridors to test hydrogen and biofuels blends aboard merchant ships. Target cumulative volume of 0.2 million tonnes of low-carbon fuels; aim for 10–15% efficiency gains on pilot routes; actively share findings to accelerate learning and establish related safety and operation standards among participating companies.

2027 – Scale-up framework established: standardized bunkering procedures, procurement processes, and safety rules; port readiness in 10 hubs; retrofit or conversion of 15 vessels; aim to reduce lifecycle emissions on the test routes by 20–25%; information sharing broadened to industry groups to support rapid implementation.

2030 – Commercial viability demonstrated on 5–7 major sea routes; fuel mix includes hydrogen and biofuels on a growing share of vessels, with 5–8% of newbuilds adopting low-carbon propulsion; production capacity for low-carbon fuels reaches about 2 million tonnes per year; price parity targets advanced to enable broader scale adoption.

2035 – Mainstream adoption across mid-sized and large fleets: 20–25% of newbuilds powered by hydrogen or biofuels; bunkering networks expand to 30+ hubs; overall volume of low-carbon fuels in shipping increases substantially, supporting a measurable decarbonization of main trade lanes while maintaining efficiency improvements in operations.

2040 – Extended scale and sustained development: 40–60% of new ships use low-carbon fuels; decarbonization of the entire sector accelerates, driven by continued collaboration and sharing of information; biofuels and hydrogen supply chains mature to support ongoing growth, with related sectors such as ports and logistics benefiting from the pioneering approach.

How will transition costs, incentives, and financing be managed?

Establish a pioneering, multi-stakeholder council that leads blended financing and procurement for fuel switch, with term sheets and volume forecasts to reduce upfront costs for container groups and fleets.

Agree on a shared risk framework where upfront capex for engines, storage, and bunkering infra is financed via SPVs and green bonds, with long-term offtake commitments from groups of companies. By spreading risk across a portfolio, a company can reduce the annualized cost of transition and accelerate the massive uptake of hydrogen and blended fuels. This framework contributes to predictable budgeting for sponsors and shipowners.

Link incentives to emissions outcomes and volume milestones, using subsidies, tax credits, and concessional lending from public programs. A push from ports and governments to create dedicated blending hubs reduces supply risk, while a council can authorize sharing of ramp-up costs across routes, ensuring there’s enough capacity to meet demand. The council will produce monthly reports to track progress and reinforce accountability.

Theres a need to set up reserve funds to handle price swings and port readiness delays, minimizing disruption to the fleet.

Launch a mass procurement program for fuels across suppliers to capture volume discounts, with a rolling tender for blended fuels and hydrogen-ready solutions. A container-fleet-wide procurement hub reduces price volatility, and the specs that suppliers must meet across ports along major corridors ensure reliability.

The financing framework uses a term of 7-12 years for engine retrofits and bunkering upgrades, with performance-based payments tied to fleet emissions reductions and fuel savings. Engaging shipping lines in a consortium creates a clear push for scalable solutions, ensuring there’s capacity as volumes rise along key corridors. Early pilots in three ports produce data on cost per ton-km and capture benefits from hydrogen blends and biofuels.",https://blog.gettransport.com/wp-content/themes/main/img/favicon/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-22 08:37:00.655189

With the IMO NZF’s future unclear, its carbon levy delayed and global politics more fractious than ever, MEPC’s October 2025 extraordinary session, and its one-year adjournment, now form the starting point for any assessment of IMO’s environmental agenda in 2026.

Where does the NZF currently stand?

On a technical level, the basic architecture of the framework survived attacks from US President Trump and others in 2025.

The approved draft package that makes up NZF combines a greenhouse gas fuel-intensity trajectory with a market-based measure and is backed by states that had argued for a flat-rate carbon levy to be contained within MARPOL Annexes.

IMO described the framework as a new set of regulations built around a tighter fuel-intensity standard and a linked pricing scheme for non-compliance and reward scheme for compliance.

The October session did not dismantle this structure; it only deferred the political decision on adoption.

Before delegates met in London, the working assumption was that October 2025 would deliver the adoption of revised MARPOL Annex VI text and agreement on the market-based measure, with measures entering into force 16 months later under the tacit acceptance procedure. That timetable would have placed the first compliance period around 2027.

With a vote delayed, politics will continue to shape discussions on the NZF in 2026: US Secretaries Marco Rubio, Chris Wright and Sean Duffy warned that countries backing the framework could face port fees, sanctions, investigations and visa restrictions.

A letter published by the US administration described the proposal as “the first global carbon tax” and a “European-led neocolonial export of global climate regulations”.

Mr Trump then posted on X that he was “outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global carbon tax” and said the United States would not adhere to “this global green new scam tax on shipping”.

In session at the extraordinary meeting of MEPC in October 2025, US interventions and those from other petro-states helped shift support towards a procedural motion that delayed the vote for one year.

Against this background, guideline work continues but the scope for manoeuvre is constrained.

IMO’s intersessional working groups, including ISWG-GHG 20 in September 2025, have agreed to continue developing guidelines and recommended that MEPC consider options for resuming the extraordinary session in October 2026.

Among other tasks, MEPC in 2026 is expected to take up terms of reference for the Fifth IMO GHG Study.

What happens next?

Three broad pathways emerge: if the resumed extraordinary session in October 2026 adopts the framework with only limited changes, IMO procedural rules and norms would point to entry into force for the legislation around March 2028.

If disagreements over pricing, revenue use and transitional pathways force extensive revisions, 2026 may be dominated by further drafting.

If political resistance hardens, agreement could slip again and regional measures multiply.

For shipowners, charterers and financiers, 2026 will therefore be less a new beginning than a complex negotiation inevitably shaped by choices already made, and Mr Trump has made clear his preferred outcome.",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/177/Presideent_Trump_2_White_Housewebzhgfssswww_Main.png,N,,2026-01-21 06:57:16.985688

A meeting of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC 12) opened today, as reported by the Clean Arctic Alliance. The Alliance, a coalition of 24 not-for-profit organizations, is calling on IMO member states to ensure the organization continues to push for progress in reducing underwater noise from shipping, especially in Arctic waters where noise levels are anticipated to nearly quadruple by 2030.

""SDC 12 provides an opportunity for member states to ensure that shippers are getting clear technical guidance on the work they need to do in order to advance IMO policies that will assure the reduction of shipping noise"", said Sarah Bobbe, Senior Manager, Arctic Program at Ocean Conservancy. ""So far, this work remains insufficient relative to the growing threats faced by regions experiencing increased shipping traffic, such as the Arctic, underscoring the need for parallel policy advancement through the IMO's Marine Environmental Protection Committee in the coming months.""

Bobbe noted that much of the Arctic has been free of human-sourced sound for a long time, but with increased activity, its waters are becoming noisier every year. Shipping, specifically from propellers and engines, is an important source of this noise.

A key paper submitted to SDC 12 by WWF provides new maps showing, for the first time, the migratory corridors of Arctic whales across the Arctic Ocean. The maps are intended to help mariners know where to take measures during migratory months in spring and autumn. Operational measures like rerouting and speed restrictions can reduce impacts on whales, alongside technical measures to quieten ships.

""By putting migratory corridors on the map for these three whale species that we know to be especially sensitive to underwater noise, we hope to support the shipping community to take necessary measures to safeguard them"", said Melanie Lancaster of WWF's Global Arctic Programme. ""It will take international cooperation among states, ship operators, shipping companies and IMO to ensure their safe and quiet passage.""

The WWF paper outlines how IMO Member States should consider adopting shipping measures in the Arctic, similar to measures adopted elsewhere to safeguard whales. It provides information for similar preventative measures to be adopted in the Arctic.

Andrew Dumbrille, Co-Founder and Director of Equal Routes, linked the situation in the Arctic to concerns about proposed LNG terminals in the Gulf of California. ""Our recommendations to SDC 12 for the Gulf of California are equally important for the Arctic as both regions could see devastating impacts from future increased shipping, especially from LNG tankers, for marine wildlife particularly sensitive to noise, like marine mammals"", Dumbrille said.

Those recommendations include acknowledging irreversible noise impacts from LNG tankers, promoting ship design that considers noise damage, and opposing LNG traffic in critical ecological areas due to underwater noise pollution.",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/Default.webp,N,,2026-01-21 06:57:11.867959

… said Mike Corrigan, CEO of Interferry.

Ferry services are critically important to Europe, with more than half of the world’s gross RoRo- and passenger ship tonnage operating in European waters, transporting 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units every year within the EU, significantly offloading the road network. According to Interferry, every euro of freight rate increase on ferries risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks.

Interferry made clear that supports the decarbonization of maritime transport and accepted the EU ETS on the understanding that the funds collected would be reinvested in reducing emissions and that road transport would also be included. However, the EU Council recently postponed the inclusion of road transport, raising concerns that ferry end users, such as island communities, are bearing the full cost of the ETS.

As explained, this situation creates a competitive disadvantage for short-sea shipping, as higher ferry costs may push goods and passengers back onto congested road networks, contrary to the EU’s long-standing goal of shifting transport from road to sea.

As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs. This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea

… commented Johan Roos, Director Regulatory Affairs of Interferry.

The challenge is compounded by the International Maritime Organization’s decision in October 2025 to postpone the adoption of a global greenhouse gas pricing mechanism for at least 12 months. This mechanism was intended to replace the EU ETS and provide clear guidelines for reinvesting revenues in decarbonization. In the meantime, EU ferry operators are taxed for CO2 emissions without clarity on how the funds will support emissions reduction or certainty on when a global regulation will take effect.

Interferry highlights that the EU ETS currently imposes approximately €1 billion per year on intra-EU ferry transport, yet the majority of the funds are diverted to national budgets rather than supporting the production of e-fuels or the electrification of EU ports.

Clean fuels represent an important pathway to advancing sustainability while continuing to supply the energy required by the global economic system.

…said Roberto Bocca, Head of the Centre for Energy and Materials, World Economic Forum.

The role of clean fuels in energy’s future

Liquid and gaseous fuels are vital to the global economy, supplying 56% of global final energy use today1 (~250 exajoules, EJ)2,3 and attracting ~$1 trillion of investment each year. Global energy demand is expected to continue to rise, driven by growth in both economies and populations.

While electrification is central to most energy scenarios, some transport and industrial energy demands cannot be substituted effectively with electricity. Additionally, clean fuels can help reduce emissions near-term, by using existing assets and established value chains that currently rely on unabated fossil fuels.

Across most scenarios, liquid and gaseous fuels will remain a significant share of the world’s energy supply for decades, with 2050 estimates ranging from 175-285 EJ (40-55% of total supply), equal to roughly four to five times current US demand Clean fuels span multiple production pathways, representing different combinations of feedstocks, conversion technologies and end-product fuels.

These fuels are a critical tool to reduce emissions in fuel-reliant sectors such as transport and industry, where energy density, storability, chemical properties and infrastructure compatibility make molecules the most competitive or only option.

Molecules are particularly relevant for applications such as aviation, shipping, parts of road transport and certain industrial processes that require high heat or molecules as chemical feedstocks. Clean fuels also enable refineries to adapt to the shifting demand mix and sustain asset utilization by making use of existing energy infrastructure.

Scaling-up the market in the next decade calls for a dual focus. First, existing commercial pathways need expanding; second, greater innovation is required in early-stage pathways. Ramping up commercial fuels such as biogas, bioethanol and biodiesel – alongside measures that lower emissions from existing fossil fuels – can contribute to near-term emissions reductions, with the right incentives and safeguards.

…the report explains.

These fuels can be deployed with lower capital investment into established value chains as blend-in or drop-in solutions, serving as stepping stones to the future fuel mix.

However, rapid commercialization of new feedstocks and technologies is needed to ease supply constraints, reduce fuel emissions intensity and meet demand targets within the next 5-10 years. Despite the higher cost of clean fuels, blending strategies (virtual or physical) can limit the impacts on consumer pricing as markets mature and costs come down, while pursuing a portfolio of pathways.

Joint action to deploy proven solutions has untapped potential to accelerate the market.

Three insights emerge from success stories:

– Performance-based policies rewarding verified emissions reductions and other benefits have successfully embedded societal value in investment decisions. For example, in Brazil, tradeable credits, along with low-interest loans and tax incentives, have stimulated demand in support of energy security and industrial development. The success of such policies depends on interoperable standards and predictable market instruments to create revenue certainty where there is a credible path to competitiveness.

– Public-private mechanisms, such as double sided auctions or book-and-claim, pool risks and connect producers and customers where markets are sub-scale.

– Businesses partnering across the value chain can signal demand and potential supply, while rethinking how to contract, finance and allocate capital. This approach is proving successful in unlocking projects by bridging the gap between the market risks and infrastructure-type investment that characterizes clean fuel projects.

Over the last few years, the question among business leaders in the industry has evolved from should we invest, to how and when. We find that those who succeed generating value are rethinking how to approach projects focusing on customers, embracing flexibility and partnerships, and mitigating investment risk.

Two of these projects were awarded under the dedicated maritime topic, receiving more than €35 million to supply renewable hydrogen to maritime off-takers.

The auction operates under the domestic pillar of the European Hydrogen Bank, which aims to scale up European hydrogen production and strengthen market integration. It supports the replacement of natural gas, coal and oil in hard-to-decarbonise industries and transport sectors. The awarded funding will help these projects bridge the difference between their production costs and the price that industrial users are willing to pay for their product. This market-based design also aims to reduce risks for investors and lessen the administrative burden for applicants.

The hydrogen produced is renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and is expected to be used in key sectors like the chemical industry and mobility, mostly in helping decarbonise maritime and heavy-duty transport. Together, these projects are projected to produce around 500 kilotonnes of renewable hydrogen, cutting almost 3.4 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions over an operational period of 10 years.

The projects are located in Spain, Finland and Norway, and will install a total of 381.25 megawatts of electrolyser capacity. The individual grant values range from €135.5 million to €1.8 million for installations with a megawatt electric (MWe) capacity from 5 to 200 MWe. The awarded projects presented bids going from €0.33 to €1.88 per kilogram of RFNBO Hydrogen.

Meet the projects

The projects that have signed grant agreements:

** Calculated based on the 2021-2025 ETS benchmark of 6.84 tons CO2e/tH2, not taking into account additional carbon abatement due to substitution effects in the H2 end use application (i.e conservative estimate)

Auctions as a Service

In parallel, Spain, Lithuania, and Austria allocated €836 million in national funding for projects in their countries through the Innovation Fund’s ‘Auctions-as-a-service' feature. This allows Member States to identify and fund eligible projects in their territories that meet the qualification criteria but cannot be funded by the Innovation Fund due to budgetary limitations.

‘Auctions-as-a-Service' is open to all Member States, enabling them to benefit from the EU-level auction platform and award national funding to additional projects with a simplified procedure. Projects awarded by participating Member States will be announced by the respective national authorities.

Next Steps

The European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) will accompany the projects throughout the development phase, ensuring compliance with Innovation Fund requirements and supporting smooth progress toward financial close and construction.

The IF24 Auction will provide a fixed premium per kilogram of certified and verified renewable hydrogen (RFNBO) produced. Signed projects must reach financial close within two and a half years and start producing renewable hydrogen within five years. They will receive the fixed premium for up to ten years, based on certified and verified RFNBO hydrogen production.

The Hydrogen Bank is already working on the next cycle: the third Innovation Fund Hydrogen Auction was launched on 4 December 2025 with a budget of up to €1.3 billion. The deadline to submit proposals is 19 February, 17:00 CET via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal.

Background

The Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding programmes for the deployment of innovative net-zero technologies, with an estimated budget of €40 billion from the revenues of auctioning allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System between 2020 and 2030.

The European Hydrogen Bank is an initiative to facilitate the EU's domestic production and imports of renewable hydrogen. It aims to unlock private investment in the EU and in third countries by addressing investment challenges, closing the funding gap, and connecting a future renewable hydrogen supply to consumers.

Under the first renewable hydrogen auction (IF23 Auction), six projects signed their grant agreements in 2024 and five of them have now entered the implementation phase, producing renewable hydrogen used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport and fertilisers.

H2SITE Ammonia Cracking Solution

H2SITE is a Spanish scale-up company headquartered in Bilbao, where the core of its technology is designed and manufactured. From its industrial facility in Loiu (Bizkaia), H2SITE produces thousands of palladium-alloy membranes each year, which are integrated into membrane reactor systems enabling efficient conversion of hydrogen carriers back into hydrogen. In the case of ammonia, H2SITE has developed cracking systems capable of delivering high-purity hydrogen that can be supplied directly to fuel cells or blend in engines. This capability is particularly relevant for maritime and offshore applications, where operational reliability, system integration and fuel logistics are critical.

Norway represents a highly relevant environment for this technology. The country combines a strong maritime heritage with clear climate ambitions and a pragmatic, goal-oriented approach to innovation and first-of-a-kind projects. Norway is already assessing the use of ammonia onboard vessels in commercial operations. With a local presence, H2SITE aims to work directly with Norwegian shipowners, shipyards and technology partners to adapt its systems to real vessel profiles and operating conditions.

The decision to invest now is driven by risk management. H2SITE believes that the commercial and regulatory risks of delaying decarbonisation now outweigh the risks associated with adopting new technologies. Ammonia, when used as an energy carrier and combined with efficient conversion systems, offers a credible route towards zero-emissions vessels and long-term compliance rather than short-term mitigation.

H2SITE Norway AS has been established at a stage where the technology is already validated, and the focus has moved to product implementation. Since 2023, H2SITE has built and operated ammonia crackers for more than 6,000 hours, including extended continuous operation in relevant environments. Maritime-focused projects such as H2Ocean and APOLO have addressed integration with fuel cells and engines. In parallel, H2SITE is building MW-scale systems and has reached the manufacturing capacity required to support early commercial projects.

Achieving zero-emissions vessels across multiple segments remains challenging. Vessel types such as RoRo, bulk carriers, platform supply vessels and tankers face technical and operational barriers. While ammonia-to-power 4-stroke engines are approaching commercial readiness, challenges remain at low loads, including ammonia slip and the need for pilot fuel. Onboard cracking allows shipowners to benefit from liquid ammonia storage and established logistics while producing hydrogen that enhances combustion and enables the use of fuel cells for high-efficiency auxiliary power. Hybrid solutions, as well as full fuel-cell propulsion, provide practical pathways towards ammonia-fuelled zero-emissions vessels. Regulatory developments reinforce this direction. While global frameworks such as IMO regulations continue to evolve, FuelEU Maritime and the EU Emissions Trading System are already shaping investment decisions and will progressively tighten over time.

H2SITE Norway is positioned as a platform for collaboration. The next step is pilot and demonstration projects that allow systems to be integrated and operated under realistic conditions. “The technology is proven; the priority now is implementation of the product and operational learning,” said Tomás Crespo, Maritime Business Development Manager at H2SITE Norway. “We are looking to work with Norwegian shipowners and shipyards that want to take a measured, forward-looking approach to decarbonisation.”

Looking ahead, the coming year will be about projects and execution deploying systems in real operating environments, gathering operational data and refining solutions in close cooperation with the Norwegian maritime industry. This strategic initiative highlights H2SITE’s dedication to addressing one of the key challenges in maritime decarbonisation: enabling efficient and economically viable onboard hydrogen production. By making hydrogen available at sea for both propulsion and auxiliary power systems, we are actively supporting the transition toward a cleaner and more competitive future for the shipping industry.

The treaty covers marine genetic resources and benefit sharing. It introduces area-based management tools, including marine protected areas. It strengthens environmental impact assessments. It also supports capacity building and technology transfer.

IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez welcomed the milestone. He said countries had shown they can work together to manage the ocean sustainably. He added that IMO is ready to support implementation within its remit.

Shipping already operates under strict global rules. Environmental, safety, and security standards apply throughout a vessel’s voyage.

IMO has developed more than 50 binding treaties to support sustainable shipping. Flag, coastal, and port State control enforce these rules.

Key IMO instruments include MARPOL, the Ballast Water Management Convention, and the London Convention and Protocol. These measures help prevent pollution and the spread of invasive species.

IMO is also developing a new binding framework on ship biofouling. The goal is to further reduce the transfer of invasive aquatic species.

The organization has adopted additional protections. These include Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas, Special Areas, and Emission Control Areas. IMO has also issued guidance to reduce underwater ship noise.

The BBNJ Agreement follows its adoption in June 2023. More than 80 countries have ratified it to date.",https://container-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BBNJ-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 20:56:31.676122

More than 90 percent of global trade moves by sea, with shipping alone accounting for nearly 3 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the International Maritime Organization (IMO) setting a net-zero target for the shipping sector, maritime nations are reassessing how economic growth and sustainability can be pursued in tandem. For developing economies like India, which rely heavily on maritime trade, port networks, and coastal livelihoods, this transition is challenging.

Harit Sagar outlines the pathway for India’s major ports to enhance energy efficiency and climate resilience aligned to international standards.

Indian ports handle almost 95 percent of trade by volume and 70 percent by value, making them critical actors in climate action. India launched the Harit Sagar Green Port Guidelines in 2023 to make its blue economy sustainable, aligning port development with its Nationally Determined Contribution and the Panchamrit goals, which outline five climate commitments. As part of Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 and Maritime India Vision 2030, Harit Sagar outlines the pathway for India’s major ports to enhance energy efficiency and climate resilience aligned to international standards. It aims to integrate climate ambition with development and trade, offering a template for other developing economies.

Global Net-Zero Shipping and Emerging Economy Limits

IMO’s revised GHG Strategy (2023) sets milestones for cutting emissions from international shipping “by or around 2050,” signalling a net-zero transition by mid-century. It calls for at least a 20-percent reduction, aiming for 30 percent, by 2030, and at least a 70-percent reduction, aiming for 80 percent, by 2040, compared to 2008 levels. In response, Singapore’s Maritime and Port Authority is targeting a 60-percent reduction in its total port emissions by 2030, while introducing ammonia bunkering to scale alternative fuel use. Additionally, the Rotterdam-Singapore Green and Digital Shipping Corridor ensures that international partnerships cut emissions on the major trade route by 20-30 percent by 2030.

Emerging economies and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant constraints, including limited access to finance, structural issues, technological challenges, capacity gaps, and infrastructure readiness,

Unlike Singapore, however, emerging economies and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face significant constraints, including limited access to finance, structural issues, technological challenges, capacity gaps, and infrastructure readiness, which limit their ability to meet the IMO’s targets. In such countries, smaller ports are often overlooked in the pursuit of larger maritime objectives, while their older fleets risk becoming obsolete. Moreover, new rules on fuels and efficiency could impact the already strained trade routes. Despite their potential to adopt alternative fuels more rapidly than developed economies, the evolving regulatory ecosystem for safety and bunkering could inhibit their progress. Additionally, most green hydrogen and methanol projects, still at the pilot stage, may take longer to scale up.

India, with its national ambitions, its role on the IMO Council, and its focus on strengthening maritime presence, has an opportunity to offer solutions rooted in local realities through its green port framework. However, to achieve this, India’s Harit Sagar efforts will have to move beyond being mere guidelinesby ensuring investments in sustainable port practices, supporting coastal communities, and encouraging green innovation. Such a transformation will require accounting for local trade, population, and environmental needs, as well as overcoming the coordination challengesamong ministries, port authorities, state governments, and private operators, which can delay on-the-ground action.

Harit Sagar’s whole-of-port approach accounts for all activities that contribute to a port’s carbon footprint, including cargo handling and storage, ship operations, logistics services, and hinterland connectivity.

India’s Framework for Climate-Resilient Port Growth

Harit Sagar’s whole-of-port approach accounts for all activities that contribute to a port’s carbon footprint, including cargo handling and storage, ship operations, logistics services, and hinterland connectivity. The framework follows an ‘Eliminate, Reduce, and Control’ model, guiding ports in their everyday decisions towards carbon-neutral development without adversely impacting nearby marine ecosystems and coastal communities.

● Clean Energy Transition and Circular Economy

Harit Sagar encourages ports to adopt cleaner operations through solar and wind energy, equipment and vehicle retrofitting, electrification, and shore power for berthed ships. Ports must reduce carbon emissions by 30 percent per tonne of cargo by 2030 and 70 percent by 2047, while increasing renewable energy use. They are also expected to phase in shore-to-ship power, reuse all wastewater, and reduce freshwater use by over 20 percent by 2030. New Mangalore Port, which now operates entirely on solar power, is a strong example of these initiatives. The framework also focuses on efficient resource use by encouraging ports to streamline operations, reduce ‘idle’ time, and adopt energy-efficient technologies to lower carbon intensity. Additionally, the framework supports circular economy practices, such as efficient waste management, the reuse of dredged material, and waste-to-wealth initiatives, to help ports move towards zero waste while creating economic value.

● Scaling Renewable Energy Across Indian Ports

Harit Sagar prepares ports for future fuels, including green hydrogen, green ammonia, and green methanol, aligned with India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission. Ports are expected to increase renewable energy use to over 60 percent by 2030 and 90 percent by 2047. They must also upgrade infrastructure with specific targets to support offshore wind energy, LNG bunkering and EV charging, while promoting coastal shipping. For instance, Deendayal Port is planning 20 MW of solar and wind capacity; Visakhapatnam has 10 MW of solar; V.O.Chidambaranar Port (VOC) and New Mangalore are expanding their renewable installations. VOC has launched India’s first green hydrogen pilot for streetlights and EV charging, and is planning a green methanol bunkering facility. Ports are also implementing LED lighting upgrades, green building, electrified rail links, and plans for shore power to improve resource efficiency.

● Managing Water, Pollution, and Biodiversity at Ports

The framework considers ports as integral to the coastline and the nearby communities. It focuses on conserving shoreline and mangroves, mitigating air and noise pollution, using water efficiently, managing waste, bilge, and ballast water responsibly, and minimising the impact of dredging. It also considers recharging groundwater as a carbon sink, desalination, and rainwater harvesting. They set clear targets, including reducing freshwater use per tonne of cargo by over 20 percent by 2030, recycling or reusing all wastewater, and increasing green cover by more than 20 percent to strengthen biodiversity and coastal protection.

● Building Climate-Resilient Port Infrastructure

Harit Sagar emphasises the need for ports to prepare for climate risks by regularly assessing local vulnerabilities, strengthening infrastructure, and planning for challenges such as sea-level rise, cyclones, flooding, and coastal erosion. This approach acknowledges that ports must continue to function safely and reliably even as climate impacts increase, while aligning with international objectives. Mormugao Port in Goa, for instance, has been recognised as India’s first green port under Harit Shrey—a green incentive scheme for vessels. The port is listed on the global Environmental Ship Index as a model for promoting cleaner shipping and more sustainable practices across India’s port operations.

● Governance and Transparency in Green Port Systems

The parameters emphasise regular monitoring and reporting of port operations to prevent greenwashing and ensure compliance. Ports have to track progress under the Environment Management Guidelines and Environmental Performance Indicators, gradually adopting frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative, within 6 to 18 months. Impact assessments and annual audits guide ports toward achieving targeted environmental, economic, and social goals. Harit Sagar encourages earning carbon credits and proposes incentives, such as priority berthing or reduced port dues for ships that use cleaner fuels or shore power. They also recognise private operators, public-private partnerships, and truck fleets that use cleaner fuels or electric vehicles.

● Linking Green Ports with India’s Blue Economy

Despite their potential to generate jobs and income, the unchecked growth of shipping, ports, fisheries, and coastal tourism without accounting for local realities can harm ecosystems and adversely affect local and indigenous communities. Harit Sagar must connect environmental protection and climate resilience with local aspirations and on-ground dynamics. Linking port development to livelihoods, ecosystem health, and meaningful community participation promotes innovative, inclusive outcomes. For example, VOC has already begun mangrove restoration by effectively involving local communities.

Implementing India’s Green Port Transformation

India is a major maritime nation. Through Harit Sagar and its work at the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the country can demonstrate how ports and shipping can become greener while continuing to support development. The guidelines can also be gradually scaled up across ports nationwide. India could share its experiences with other emerging economies and SIDS, helping them adapt and implement green port transitions to diverse contexts. For international partners, financiers, and the IMO, Harit Sagar underscores the need for phased transitions, flexible approaches, and financing strategies adapted to varied capacities.

If implemented effectively, India’s green port journey can demonstrate globally that economic growth and sustainability can go hand in hand.

Realising Harit Sagar’s vision will require a careful, step-by-step approach involving all stakeholders. Monitoring must be more transparent and consistent, green finance must grow, and investments will be needed in skills and fuel infrastructure. These initiatives require engaginglocal communities at every stage. International platforms such as the IMO, G20, and BRICS can further support fair maritime climate policies. If implemented effectively, India’s green port journey can demonstrate globally that economic growth and sustainability can go hand in hand.

Green shipping technologies, including hydrogen fuel cells and alternative fuels like ammonia and methanol, provide practical pathways to reduce emissions while maintaining operational efficiency.","The shipping industry is taking a major step toward decarbonisation as PowerCell Group joins the European GAMMA initiative.

Funded with €17m through Horizon Europe, the project aims to demonstrate how hydrogen-based fuel cells and climate-neutral fuels can transform deep-sea shipping, enabling zero-emission operations for large ocean-going vessels.

The five-year initiative is led by Icelandic engineering company Verkís and includes a consortium of European innovators, such as ANT Topic, Fraunhofer, Aurelia, Sea Green Engineering, Energy Cluster Denmark, SINTEF, and Politecnico di Milano, among others.

Richard Berkling, CEO of PowerCell Group, commented: “This project represents exactly the type of industrial learning that the maritime sector needs right now.

“GAMMA allows us to move beyond theoretical studies and demonstrate how fuel cells, hydrogen carriers, and onboard reforming can work together in a commercial vessel. That operational experience is what will ultimately de-risk adoption and unlock large-scale deployment.”

A landmark project for maritime decarbonisation

The GAMMA project – short for Green Ammonia and Biomethanol fuel MAritime Vessels – brings together 16 European partners to retrofit a 60,000 DWT bulk carrier from TOPIC Fleet.

This retrofit will convert the vessel into a full-scale testbed for green shipping technologies, replacing traditional fossil fuel generators with hydrogen-powered fuel cell systems.

PowerCell Group will supply a 1 MW-class fuel cell power system to the project, allowing the ship to generate electricity on board using hydrogen derived from green methanol and ammonia.

By integrating this system into the vessel’s auxiliary power architecture, the project will validate real-world performance, safety, durability, and system integration under the demanding conditions of deep-sea navigation.

The potential of hydrogen fuel cells to transform shipping

While battery technology can support short-range maritime applications, it cannot meet the endurance and energy requirements of deep-sea shipping.

Fuel cells powered by hydrogen and hydrogen carriers such as methanol and ammonia provide a scalable solution for zero-emission auxiliary power – and eventually, main propulsion.

The GAMMA project will cultivate essential operational data on system efficiency, reliability, safety, maintenance, and integration.

This information will guide future regulatory frameworks and commercial investments, providing confidence to shipowners, yards, and regulators about the practical feasibility of green shipping solutions.

Operational insights from full-scale demonstrations

Demonstration projects like GAMMA are vital in an industry where vessels are expected to operate for decades.

Real-world testing allows stakeholders to move beyond theoretical studies and gain hands-on experience with fuel cell systems, onboard reforming, and hydrogen carriers.

These insights help de-risk technology adoption and accelerate broader implementation in the shipping sector.

The importance of decarbonising shipping

Shipping accounts for nearly 3% of global CO₂ emissions, a number projected to rise if the industry continues relying on fossil fuels.

Decarbonising shipping is crucial not only for achieving global climate targets but also for ensuring sustainable trade practices.

Green shipping technologies, including hydrogen fuel cells and alternative fuels like ammonia and methanol, provide practical pathways to reduce emissions while maintaining operational efficiency.

After centuries of dependence on fossil fuels, the shipping industry is beginning a transition to cleaner propulsion systems driven by tightening climate commitments and regulations. The International Maritime Organization has set a target for net-zero shipping emissions by around 2050, while the EU’s Fit for 55 package brings shipping into the Emissions Trading System, requiring full emissions coverage by 2027.

In response, technological advances and regulatory pressure are accelerating investment in electric and hybrid vessels, with the global electric ship market expected to grow from $4.85 billion in 2025 to $18.39 billion by 2032.

7 key factors by WEF for a sustainable maritime ecosystem

#1 Technology neutrality with clean propulsion portfolios

No single solution will decarbonize shipping. Scaling zero-emission shipping requires a diversified mix of battery-electric systems for short-sea and inland routes, alongside alternative fuels and fuel cells for deep-sea operations.

#2 Safe, high-performance energy storage systems

Advanced energy storage is central to electric shipping, determining vessel range, charging speed, reliability and overall operational viability. Systems must meet stringent maritime safety standards while delivering commercial-grade performance.

#3 Retrofittable decarbonization pathways

Newbuild vessels alone cannot deliver near-term emissions reductions. With long vessel lifetimes, retrofitting existing fleets with electric, hybrid and low-carbon technologies is essential to accelerate impact at scale.

#4 Scalable port-side charging and energy infrastructure

Electric shipping depends on reliable, standardized port-side charging or battery-swapping solutions. Without widespread infrastructure deployment, adoption remains constrained by operational risk and cost uncertainty.

#5 Clean energy supply across the value chain

Zero-emission shipping requires ports and charging infrastructure to be powered by clean electricity. Otherwise, emissions are shifted from sea to shore, undermining climate benefits and public trust.

#6 Public-private collaboration and regulatory alignment

Governments, ports, shipowners, technology providers and utilities must co-invest, align standards and share risk. Coordinated policy frameworks and joint infrastructure development are critical to achieving commercial viability.

#7 First-mover leadership and early deployment

Early adopters play a critical role in proving technologies, de-risking investments and establishing viable business models. While initial returns may be limited, early action is essential to unlock scale and long-term market transformation.

World leaders from government, business, civil society and academia will convene in Davos 19-23 January 2026, to engage in forward-looking discussions to address global issues and set priorities. The theme this year is “A Spirit of Dialogue”. More than 200 sessions will tackle a wide array of issues ranging from geopolitics and artificial intelligence to climate change.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/World-Economic-Forum-2026.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:57:02.838062

Interferry wants a pause on the further implementation of the EU ETS for the ferry sector, halting the planned increase from 70 per cent to 100 per cent in 2026.

Ferry services are critically important to Europe, transporting 400 million passengers and 200 million vehicles and freight units a year in the EU. According to Interferry, every Euro increase in the freight rate risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks. While Interferry supports decarbonisation of the maritime industry, it accepted the EU ETS on the clear understanding collected funds would be used for decarbonisation efforts.

Interferry’s demand follows the EU Council’s decision to continue exempting road transport from a parallel ETS scheme, along with what it calls “the lack of clear regulations”’ on the distribution of the funds collected. In October 2025 the International Maritime Organization postponed the adoption of a global Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pricing mechanism for at least 12 months. This framework was intended to replace the EU ETS and would have set clear guidelines for the use of the funds collected.

“This action must remain in place until road transport is also in an ETS and funds collected are actually ringfenced for maritime decarbonisation,” said Mike Corrigan, CEO of Interferry. “The EU must deliver on its promise of a level playing field and ensure its climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, its most forward-looking transport sector.”

Johan Roos, director regulatory affairs at Interferry, said the exemption of road transport from the EU ETS creates an “immediate, severe competitive disadvantage” for ro-ro and passenger ferries.

“As it stands now, ETS creates an adverse incentive, pushing goods and passengers back onto already congested road networks due to higher ferry costs,” he said. “This directly contradicts the long-standing EU policy of modal shift from road to sea. The EU ETS is taxing intra-EU ferry transport by approximately €1 billion ($1.17 billion) per year, while we need support for production of e-fuels and substantial investments in electrification of EU ports for the benefit of charging electric-propulsion ships. Instead, the vast majority of these revenues are being diverted to national Member State budgets. This approach neither promotes competitivity nor cohesion and hinders the industry’s ability to invest in cleaner technologies.”",https://www.cruiseandferry.net/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/16049/InterferryEUETS_web.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 09:57:33.621278
,International Maritime Organization,2026-01-20 14:10:27+00:00,KU News,"Cleaner ship fuel is reducing lightning in key shipping lanes, KU research shows | KU News",Not Available,,,,,https://news.ku.edu/news/article/cleaner-ship-fuel-is-reducing-lightning-in-key-shipping-lanes-ku-research-shows,"“The first is the shipping activity is so frequent that it releases a lot of sulfate aerosols, more than other oceanic regions.
“One is scattering solar radiation, causing a cooling effect on Earth’s climate,” Jin said.
“When we have more sulfate aerosols, or more cloud nuclei, the cloud droplets become smaller,” he said.
“This is an even bigger impact of changes in ship-emitted sulfate aerosols,” he said.
Our study in 2021 shows that starting around 2010, we observed a decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols and other aerosol species.","LAWRENCE — Cuts in sulfur emissions from oceangoing vessels have been tied to a reduction in lightning stroke density along heavily trafficked shipping routes in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea, according to new research from the University of Kansas.

Previous studies had found frequent lightning along shipping routes over the Bay of Bengal before a 2020 International Maritime Organization rule capped sulfur in fuel used by oceangoing ships, leading to a roughly 70% drop in sulfate emissions in the Bay of Bengal.

“I think there are two reasons for this,” said lead author Qinjian Jin, assistant teaching professor of geography & atmospheric science at KU. “The first is the shipping activity is so frequent that it releases a lot of sulfate aerosols, more than other oceanic regions. The second is that the Bay of Bengal is an area where we see lots of strong convection that is required for lightning to occur. I think both reasons contribute to the observed frequent lightning activity over this region.”

Jin said these two ocean regions best revealed the connection between shipping emissions and lightning. The KU researcher and his colleagues found lightning-stroke density — the number of individual lightning discharges, or “strokes,” per square kilometer — to be about 36% lower than before the 2020 IMO sulfur cap.

“The drop in sulfates from ships can cause fewer cloud condensation nuclei, larger cloud drops, weaker convection and storms, and thus fewer ice crystals and less frequent lightning,” Jin said.

The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Climate and Atmospheric Science. Jin’s co-authors were Jianping Huang of Lanzhou University in Lanzhou, China; Jiangfeng Wei of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in Nanjing, China; and Bing Pu, KU associate professor of geography & atmospheric science.

A similar drop in lightning strokes was detected along other busy shipping routes, according to their findings.

“There is another region very close to the Bay of Bengal, which is the South China Sea,” Jin said. “We see very similar enhanced lightning there. Another region is a very small area in the Red Sea. We see a very weak signal there, not as strong as in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea.”

The lightning data used come from a network called the World Wide Lightning Location Network, produced by the University of Washington.

“That network has been developed for more than a decade, starting in the early 2000s,” Jin said. “It provides very high-resolution lightning data. It is global data. Based on this dataset, the phenomenon of lightning decrease has been observed in those regions.”

According to Jin, sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, emitted naturally or from human activities, have two major climatic impacts.

“One is scattering solar radiation, causing a cooling effect on Earth’s climate,” Jin said. “The other is modifying cloud microphysical properties, such as cloud droplet size and cloud droplet number concentration. By changing clouds, they can also influence radiation.”

Jin explained that once sulfate aerosols are released into the atmosphere, they can act as cloud nuclei, which is the mechanism by which sulfates released in ship exhaust can boost lightning strokes.

“When we have more sulfate aerosols, or more cloud nuclei, the cloud droplets become smaller,” he said. “When they’re smaller, it’s harder for precipitation to occur. Clouds can last longer in the atmosphere. With a longer lifetime, they have a higher chance to develop into high clouds, where ice clouds form. When we have more ice clouds, we have a higher chance of lightning. That is how sulfate aerosols can be connected to lightning.”

While the 2020 regulations on shipping were intended to clean up the air, the reduction in lightning can be seen as a side benefit, as lightning can be dangerous to mariners and equipment, and can hinder visibility and normal operations at sea. Jin said another consequence of the shipping regulation might be warmer global temperatures.

“Due to the 2020 emission regulation imposed by the International Maritime Organization, we observed a decrease in sulfur emissions from ships after 2020,” he said. “With less sulfate aerosol emitted from ships, we observed darker clouds over the North Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Because clouds become darker, they absorb more solar radiation. Our previous studies imply that the decrease in shipping sulfate aerosols could be responsible for the record-breaking global warming temperatures in 2023 and 2024.”

Jin said his future research will aim to better understand this potential effect.

“This is an even bigger impact of changes in ship-emitted sulfate aerosols,” he said. “Most current studies use modeling simulations with global climate models. One drawback of global climate models is their coarse spatial resolution, which have limited ability to resolve boundary layer cloud processes in the atmosphere. That affects the accuracy of aerosol impacts on radiation and clouds. In the future, I plan to use regional climate models with high spatial resolutions. These can resolve cloud formation, especially stratocumulus clouds, which are low clouds and very reflective. With high-resolution regional climate models, we can have a better estimation of the impacts of the decrease in ship-emitted sulfate aerosols on global temperature increase.”

Further, Jin plans to study the effects of regulations by nations in Asia that cut sulfate emissions beginning about 15 years ago.

“Based on our results, we know that with less sulfate aerosol, we could have less lightning activity,” he said. “This is a very important conclusion. During the past decade, many Asian countries implemented clean air acts to improve air quality. Our study in 2021 shows that starting around 2010, we observed a decreasing trend in sulfate aerosols and other aerosol species. This could result in less lightning in Asian countries. We have a plan to look at the long-term trends in lightning in Asian countries.”",https://news-archive-assets.ku.edu/data/c1/91/01kf464kb81nk8s8kttvvb7wg0.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 09:57:37.827412

The EU must deliver on its promise of a level playing field and ensure its climate policy supports, rather than financially drains, its most forward-looking transport sector,” said Interferry chief executive Mike Corrigan.

More than half of the world’s gross roro- and passenger ship tonnage operates in European waters, transporting 400M passengers and 200M vehicles and freight units every year within the EU, stated Interferry, significantly offloading the road network. It added, “Every euro of freight rate increase on ferries risks pushing freight volumes back to the already congested European road networks.”

Interferry said it supports decarbonising the maritime industry and accepted the EU ETS on the “clear understanding that funds collected would actually be used for decarbonisation and that road transport would also soon be included”.

The statement added, “The EU Council recently decided to postpone the inclusion of road transport – raising significant concerns in the shortsea shipping sector as to why end users of maritime transports, eg island communities, have to carry the full costs of ETS.”

Two of these projects were awarded under the dedicated maritime topic, receiving more than €35 million to supply renewable hydrogen to maritime off-takers.

The auction operates under the domestic pillar of the European Hydrogen Bank, which aims to scale up European hydrogen production and strengthen market integration. It supports the replacement of natural gas, coal and oil in hard-to-decarbonise industries and transport sectors. The awarded funding will help these projects bridge the difference between their production costs and the price that industrial users are willing to pay for their product. This market-based design also aims to reduce risks for investors and lessen the administrative burden for applicants.

The hydrogen produced is renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and is expected to be used in key sectors like chemical industry and mobility, mostly in helping decarbonise maritime and heavy-duty transport. Together, these projects are projected to produce around 500 kilotonnes of renewable hydrogen, cutting almost 3.4 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions over an operational period of 10 years.

The projects are located in Spain, Finland, and Norway, and will install a total of 381.25 megawatts of electrolyser capacity. The individual grant values range from €135.5 million to €1.8 million for installations with a megawatt electric (MWe) capacity from 5 to 200 MWe. The awarded projects presented bids going from €0.33 to €1.88 per kilogram of RFNBO Hydrogen.

Meet the new projects

** Calculated based on the 2021-2025 ETS benchmark of 6.84 tons CO2e/tH2, not taking into account additional carbon abatement due to substitution effects in the H2 end use application (i.e., conservative estimate)

Auctions as a Service

In parallel, Spain, Lithuania, and Austria allocated up to €836 million in national funding for projects in their countries through the Innovation Fund’s ‘Auctions-as-a-service' feature. This allows Member States to identify and fund eligible projects in their territories that meet the qualification criteria but cannot be funded by the Innovation Fund due to budgetary limitations.

‘Auctions-as-a-Service' is open to all Member States, enabling them to benefit from the EU-level auction platform and award national funding to additional projects with a simplified procedure. Projects awarded by participating Member States will be announced by the respective national authorities.

Next Steps

The European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA) will accompany the projects throughout the development phase, ensuring compliance with Innovation Fund requirements and supporting smooth progress toward financial close and construction.

The IF24 Auction provides a fixed premium per kilogram of certified and verified renewable hydrogen (RFNBO) produced. Signed projects must reach financial close within two and a half years and start producing renewable hydrogen within five years. They will receive the fixed premium for up to ten years, based on certified and verified RFNBO hydrogen production.

The European Hydrogen Bank is already working on the next cycle: the third Innovation Fund Hydrogen Auction was launched on 4 December 2025 with a budget of up to €1.3 billion. The deadline to submit proposals is 19 February, 17:00 CET via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal.

Background

The Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest funding programmes for the deployment of innovative net-zero technologies, with an estimated budget of €40 billion from the revenues of auctioning allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System between 2020 and 2030.

The European Hydrogen Bank is an initiative to facilitate the EU's domestic production and imports of renewable hydrogen. It aims to unlock private investment in the EU and in third countries by addressing investment challenges, closing the funding gap, and connecting a future renewable hydrogen supply to consumers.

Under the first renewable hydrogen auction (IF23 Auction), six projects signed their grant agreements in 2024 and five of them have now entered the implementation phase, producing renewable hydrogen used in sectors such as steel, chemicals, maritime transport, and fertilisers.
