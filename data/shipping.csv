Meng Tan explained that sustainable fuels like bio-LNG may also not be readily available at every port.
To expand feedstock availability, he said that the GCMD is exploring crude algae oil, animal tallow-derived biodiesel and cashew nutshell liquid as promising third-generation biofuels.
Methanol is also in the picture, according to Meng Tan, who noted that the new Disney Adventure set to launch service from Singapore later this year will be methanol ready.
Fuel cells are currently limited in scale, making them suitable for auxiliary or hotel loads rather than main propulsion, Meng Tan said.","No single alternative fuel will be universally optimal (to meet emissions reduction targets) for global shipping, according to Wee Meng Tan, chief projects officer at the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonization (GCMD) in Singapore.

“The GCMD approaches the future with a tech- and fuel-agnostic stance, focusing on solutions with viable decarbonization pathways,” Meng Tan told Cruise Industry News.

“Fossil fuels are likely to remain in the mix in the near- to medium-term,” he added, “given the long asset lifespan of ships, and the time it will take for alternative fuels to ramp up.

“We also anticipate wider adoption of energy-efficient technologies and carbon capture and storage as it becomes increasingly essential to plan for fuel transition pathways rather than fuel end-states.”

Under the IMO’s net-zero framework, fossil LNG will only allow shipowners to avoid penalties until 2035, at the latest, according to Meng Tan, who said that bio-LNG may be the key to moving the needle on reducing emissions.

“It is also cheaper to produce than most biofuels but producing at scale for shipping would mean direct competition with powerplants using the same feedstock for greener grid electricity, creating a supply constraint,” he said.

Meng Tan explained that sustainable fuels like bio-LNG may also not be readily available at every port. To overcome this challenge, one solution being explored is the book-and-claim model, in which the physical LNG molecule is delivered to a vessel that does not have bio-LNG. Instead, the certified bio-LNG is injected into the wider gas grid or supply chain and issues certificates representing the green attributes of the fuel. A shipowner can thus purchase these certificates, he said, claiming their emission benefits and meet regulatory IMO targets without being restricted to the limited locations where bio-LNG is available for bunkering.

Meng Tan said that while biofuels are appealing for existing fleets as a drop-in fuels requiring minimal retrofitting, their adoption is limited by feedstock availability, which is further constrained by competing demand from other consumers.

To expand feedstock availability, he said that the GCMD is exploring crude algae oil, animal tallow-derived biodiesel and cashew nutshell liquid as promising third-generation biofuels.

Methanol is also in the picture, according to Meng Tan, who noted that the new Disney Adventure set to launch service from Singapore later this year will be methanol ready.

Fuel cells are currently limited in scale, making them suitable for auxiliary or hotel loads rather than main propulsion, Meng Tan said.

He pointed to what he called a lesser-known approach, combined gas turbine electric and steam (COGES) plants, similar to those used by national electric grids. However, COGES is hampered by its limited load flexibility as the fuel efficiency is low when the load is below 50 percent.

“In the end,” he said, “cruise lines must weigh fuel cost and availability, engine modification expenses, and the potential risk that the chosen fuel may offer a shorter period of viability than a ship’s operational lifespan.”",https://cruiseindustrynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/webweemengtan-chief-projects-officer.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 07:56:15.377120

“The North Sea stands at a crossroads, but our analysis shows a clear pathway balancing climate science with energy security,” said Gail Anderson, Research Director, North Sea Upstream at Wood Mackenzie.
This potentially exceeds the North Sea Transition Authority’s mid-range platform electrification scenario savings of 13.4 MtCO2e from 2030 to 2050.
Wood Mackenzie argues for a balanced approach encouraging hydrocarbons, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and wind from the North Sea.
“The government faces pressure to restrict North Sea production, but risks undermining both climate goals and energy security,” added Anderson.","The UK could boost North Sea oil and gas production while remaining within the strictest international climate pathways, according to new Wood Mackenzie analysis. The research comes as the government consults on the basin’s future amid mounting pressure over exploration licensing.

Wood Mackenzie’s research shows the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) production emissions outperform the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s net zero scope 1,2 & 3 emissions pathway by 25 to 50 MtCO2e per annum through to 2050.

This creates theoretical headroom for the UKCS to produce 2.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent by 2050. The surplus remains within climate science requirements whilst delivering substantial economic and environmental benefits.

“The North Sea stands at a crossroads, but our analysis shows a clear pathway balancing climate science with energy security,” said Gail Anderson, Research Director, North Sea Upstream at Wood Mackenzie. “Smart licensing policies targeting known discoveries could extend critical infrastructure life, whilst delivering substantial emissions and cost benefits over importing alternatives.”

The findings emerge as the government weighs whether to ban new exploration licences under its “science-aligned approach” to future UKCS production. Wood Mackenzie’s analysis reveals compelling advantages of maximising domestic production over imports. Every additional trillion cubic feet of UKCS gas saves 15 MtCO2e of scope 1&2 emissions when displacing US LNG imports.

“The more the UKCS produces, said Anderson, the less emissions will be released, and the less the UK will spend on imports. Such an approach will ensure production for decades to come and support the North Sea’s energy future.

Exploration activity collapses to historic low

North Sea exploration has plummeted to unprecedented lows. Due to recent fiscal turmoil, 2025 is set to become the first year since 1960 without a single wildcat well.

The Wood Mackenzie analysis advocates targeted licensing focused on existing discovered resources that could tie back to current infrastructure. A ban on all new licencing would ignore the strategic value of selective development. “Licence awards could be considered if they hold discovered resources or “old fields” which could be tied-back to host platforms” adds Anderson.

Wood Mackenzie identifies 2.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 7,634 open and relinquished blocks, with gas comprising over one-third. Only 34 blocks contain resources exceeding 20 million barrels of oil equivalent. However, these blocks total 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent and offer crucial tie-back opportunities to maintain host infrastructure viability.

Import dependency threatens emissions targets

The UK faces a stark energy transition challenge as import dependency grows. By 2035, the country will rely on US LNG for over 60% of its gas supply as Norwegian piped imports decline. This shift will triple the emissions intensity of UK gas supply from 3.7 to 11.3 gCO2e/MJ by 2035.

The emissions impact proves severe: 90% of scope 1&2 emissions from gas supply sources will come from US LNG by 2050. Wood Mackenzie’s analysis demonstrates that an additional 1 trillion cubic feet of UKCS gas production could deliver emissions savings of 14.6 MtCO2e. This potentially exceeds the North Sea Transition Authority’s mid-range platform electrification scenario savings of 13.4 MtCO2e from 2030 to 2050.

Economic benefits compound the environmental case. The short-run cost of UKCS gas supply runs at almost half that of US LNG, highlighting dual advantages of domestic production.

European integration maintains supply security

Critics argue that UKCS crude contributes little to energy security because most gets exported. The reality proves more nuanced. Whilst less than 20% of crude refined in the UK comes from the UKCS – down from over 40% in 2010 – the country remains central to integrated European markets.

Three-quarters of UKCS crude exports flow to the Netherlands (48%), Germany (11%), Poland (8%) and Sweden (8%). The UK imports refined products back from these countries in complex commodity flows. This integration secures supply for both the UK and its neighbours through sophisticated trading relationships.

Other European countries increasingly recognise domestic supply value. The Netherlands’ minister for climate and green growth recently agreed to maximise North Sea gas production to reduce import dependency and mitigate climate impacts.

Balanced transition approach recommended

UKCS emissions account for just 3% of net UK territorial emissions, yet the industry faces disproportionate pressure compared to other economic sectors. Wood Mackenzie argues for a balanced approach encouraging hydrocarbons, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and wind from the North Sea. Even under net zero scenarios, the UK will consume around 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and remain a net importer.

“The government faces pressure to restrict North Sea production, but risks undermining both climate goals and energy security,” added Anderson. “The UK needs all types of energy and should encourage more hydrocarbons, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and wind from the North Sea. This balanced approach would deliver the promised fair energy transition, support climate objectives and reduce UK energy costs whilst strengthening supply security.”",,N,,2025-10-07 07:56:31.590877

That much was apparent as only one of the five panellists, Semiramis Paliou, CEO at Diana Shipping, dissented from the majority panel view.
Out of the remaining 10% only 2.5-3% comes from shipping, “If you put that into perspective that’s one part per million,” said Hadjiyannis.
Hadjiyannis believes that shipowners have operated the most efficient ships for the last 70 years, improving them further in 1973 when the first oil shock sent prices soaring.
“The problem arises because our industry feels uncomfortable with a number of things where there is no clarity,” explained Paliou.","A panel of five shipowners tore into the IMO Net Zero Framework (NZF) arguing that the regulations are made without consulting industry and that the regulations if passed will only raise prices for consumers.

Who knew that owners were so concerned about the poor consumer? A bemused and a little amused Arsenio Dominguez Secretary General of the IMO, sat in the front row of the Cyprus Maritime Conference in Limassol, pointed out that the UN body has many opinions and these were not the only shipowner opinions.

That much was apparent as only one of the five panellists, Semiramis Paliou, CEO at Diana Shipping, dissented from the majority panel view.

The only woman on stage with four giants of Greek shipping, such as John Coustas of Danaos and Thanassis Martinos of Eastern Mediterranean, George Procopiou, chairman of Dynacom Tankers, and Andreas Hadjiyannis, CEO of Cyprus Sea Lines and Hellenic Tankers. Was it any wonder she admitted to “feeling a little intimidated.”

Procopiou had opened the panel discussion claiming that the IMO’s climate regulations were a kolotoumba, a Greek word meaning that they would achieve the opposite of the intended effect, raising costs and emissions. While in Hadjiyannis’s view man-made carbon emissions were just 10% of the CO2 in the atmosphere and the maritime industry’s contribution was so miniscule that it really doesn’t matter.

Politician’s, said Procopiou, offer the “desirable” solutions because they have a short time in office, whereas shipowners and business people look for the “doable”, shipowners added Procopiou always want to buy the most environmentally friendly ships, because the amount of fuel that you save is proportional to the amount of fuel you burn.

“It is the first time that shipowners and environmentalists are aligned, all of us want less pollution,” but Procopiou, added, no green fuels are available, “If there is a good quality fuel that makes less emissions, tell us where to buy it.”

According to Procopiou, the regulators are making shipping into “a tax collector,”, fleecing the industry with the false hope of decarbonisation.

“If a regulator makes regulations that cannot be implemented then they are being ridiculed, that happened to the previous gentleman that left the IMO, at that time we thought the new secretary general would make a difference, he would consult technical people, people with knowledge. No consultation. Nothing.”

Finishing his monologue Procopiou called for a pause in the regulations, “We don’t need Mr Trump to lead the way, we want to lead the way,” he said. Carbon capture technology, in solid rather than liquid form is the way forward because this technology exists, “The rest is Jules Verne ideas.”

Andreas Hadjiyannis, CEO of Cyprus Sea Lines and Hellenic Tankers, said “he couldn’t agree more,” with Procopiou.

He went on to say that scientists agree that carbon is present at 400 parts per million in the atmosphere, but that 90% of that is not through human activity, but that it is naturally occurring.

Out of the remaining 10% only 2.5-3% comes from shipping, “If you put that into perspective that’s one part per million,” said Hadjiyannis. However, he also acknowledged that the EU ETS “which incentivises people to use clean fuel,” had reduced emissions, but then added that only makes sense if there is a clean fuel, but when there is no alternative fuel the reductions are only through technical improvements.

Hadjiyannis believes that shipowners have operated the most efficient ships for the last 70 years, improving them further in 1973 when the first oil shock sent prices soaring.

“We try for the most economical way of transportation, which translates to less fuel. We’ve been doing that since the second world war,” he said adding there is “Nothing anyone can do to improve that.”

Regulations he said would simply mean very expensive fuels and the people must realise that these higher costs will be passed on to the consumer, making everyday goods very expensive.

Hadjiyannis believes that the costs of the regulations will be hundreds of billions of dollars, but that when that ‘tax’ is passed on it becomes magnified as with the oil companies that see the oil price rise 10%, but the price at the pumps rises by 100%.

“So, the consumer must wake up and react to all this taxation on shipping,” he concluded.

A more measured view was offered by Paliou, who pointed out that it is well known that decarbonisation is very expensive, “not only for shipping but for the world,” and that decarbonisation is not only focused on shipping.

The NZF is “designed to be a catalyst, by reducing the price gap between carbon fuels and alternative fuels, incentivising others to reduce their emissions so they are less penalised by emission charges.”

Income from the emission charging is supposed to be reinvested into the industry to support the research and development of new fuels, their scaling up and their infrastructure.

“The problem arises because our industry feels uncomfortable with a number of things where there is no clarity,” explained Paliou.

A clearer understanding is needed on how a regulatory body will now become a revenue collecting and investment body too, “This lack of clarity creates uncertainty in the shipping community,” explained Paliou.

Moreover, there is concern that these billions of dollars will not come back into the shipping community but will be lost to bureaucracy or invested in other industries.

“What is very important for me,” added Paliou, “Is that we maintain a global level playing field and a global regulation on decarbonisation, anything regional will be a disaster for shipping.”

Regional regulation will require more staff to monitor and maintain regulatory payments and compliance across a wide range of rules, “and worst of all you’ll have no idea where the more is going, it definitely will not go back into shipping.”

There may need to be adjustments to regulations along the way, but the industry must support the IMO to develop the systems and methodologies to make its own transition from a mere regulator to a regulator plus revenue collector and investor.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdcfe6aab5515629e/blt26d5a3b930db9a69/68e4d979a8e891007f5f667d/Maritime-Cyprus-panel.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-07 07:56:37.211720

Artémis in the news Artémis Group has been in the news for a broad review of costs following heavy investments in recent years that pushed up its debt load.","Hervé Gastinel, who's led Ponant Explorations Group the past 4.5 years, plans to step down as CEO, multiple sources told Seatrade Cruise News. An announcement is expected this week.

The company said it ""cannot comment on this matter."" A successor has not been named.

Gastinel took over from Jean-Emmanuel Sauvée, one of Ponant's co-founders, in March 2021, appointed by Artémis Group founder François Pinault. A businessman and yachtsman, Gastinel previously served as CEO of Beneteau Group, a leading sailboat and power boat builder.

He joined Ponant as the pandemic recovery was underway and the hybrid electric/LNG-powered icebreaker Le Commandant Charcot was about to be delivered. In the previous five years, Ponant had doubled its fleet.

New itineraries, acquisitions

Under Gastinel, Charcot debuted with a history-making North Pole expedition (the first French and LNG ship to reach the geographic North Pole), and more pioneering Itineraries followed including Canada's first winter cruise, in January this year, also operated by Charcot.

2025 opened with Ponant acquiring Aqua Expeditions with Artémis Group's backing, and Aqua will soon introduce a sixth vessel.

Most recently the Ponant Yachting brand was formed, following a new line of small luxury catamarans introduced in 2024. The newbuild Spirit of Ponant II was just ordered; it will make the 22nd ship in the fleet. Earlier plans by Ponant and Paspaley to convert the 30-passenger former Island Escape into a luxurious expedition ship called Paspaley Pearl by Ponant fell through.

Another significant move was integrating the Ponant and Paul Gauguin brands with certain functions and positions combined. Last spring the 330-passenger Paul Gauguin emerged from a seven-week dry dock with transformed spaces, enhanced amenities and sustainability upgrades.

In an especially ambitious undertaking, Ponant aims to deliver a ship designed for zero CO2 equivalent emissions by 2030. If realized, the daring Swap2Zero concept would come two decades before the IMO's commitment to net-zero carbon emissions from shipping by 2050.

FuelEU pooling isn’t a procurement exercise.
Pooling allows operators, especially smaller fleets or those without immediate access to alternative fuels, to aggregate carbon performance across vessels.
Pooling can be a powerful enabler of decarbonisation, but only if treated as a governance challenge, not a bargain hunt.
FuelEU pooling risks the same fate if the industry isn’t careful.","Compliance doesn’t come cheap when it comes to FuelEU Maritime, warns Philippos Ioulianou, the managing director of EmissionLink.

With the EU ETS reporting deadline passed and FuelEU Maritime enforcement fast approaching, ‘pooling’ has become the buzzword in compliance conversations. Unsurprisingly, most of the debate has been about cost: Who offers the cheapest pool? What’s the price of compliance?

In a sector where margins are thin, this fixation is understandable, but dangerously short-sighted. FuelEU pooling isn’t a procurement exercise. It’s a fundamental shift in regulatory responsibility. If shipowners treat it as just another line item in the budget, they risk stepping into the very pitfalls the regulation was designed to prevent.

Pooling allows operators, especially smaller fleets or those without immediate access to alternative fuels, to aggregate carbon performance across vessels. Done right, it smooths compliance and lowers costs. Done wrong, it creates liabilities the industry has never faced before.

Once in a pool, your vessel’s carbon intensity is no longer judged in isolation. You are directly exposed to the emissions decisions of every participant. If one party underperforms, or if the pool manager mismanages compliance, everyone pays the price. That raises urgent governance questions:

Who monitors carbon performance?

Who takes corrective action mid-year?

How are surpluses and penalties shared?

Who ultimately carries responsibility?

Right now, many pooling offers focus on price, using market indexes or spreads between fuel and alternatives as benchmarks. These references may guide cost, but they don’t account for governance, monitoring, or accountability. A cheap pool that hides risk is worse than no pool at all.

If this sounds familiar, it should. The same dynamic is now playing out at the IMO with its proposed Net-Zero Framework (NZF). Some of the industry’s biggest names have condemned the NZF for pushing steep decarbonisation timelines without a proper impact assessment. Their criticism is simple: regulators are setting targets that outpace fuel availability, infrastructure readiness, and technological maturity.

As Columbia Group CEO Mark O’Neil observed recently, the gap is most evident with alternative fuels. Their potential is clear, but the challenges of adoption and the pace at which the industry can transition must be carefully managed.

Whether it’s FuelEU pooling or the IMO’s NZF, the lesson is the same: decarbonisation frameworks without strong governance, a clear timeline and commitment from the industry don’t reduce risk, they redistribute it.

For shipowners, this means the old strategy of chasing the cheapest compliance option is over. The real value lies in resilience: choosing partners and structures that can withstand regulatory shocks, fuel market volatility, and underperformance.

At EmissionLink, we believe pooling only works when built on transparency, continuous monitoring and maritime expertise. Participants must know how performance is tracked continuously, not just at reporting deadlines, and someone must carry responsibility if things go wrong.

I would urge shipowners to ask tougher questions before signing into any pooling scheme. Who manages the data and reporting, and how accurate are they? What happens if performance dips? How are penalties and surpluses divided, and who will pay the bill if it’s not delivered? Finally, how do the different frameworks of FuelEU, EU ETS, and the IMO’s NZF align or conflict? These are not academic issues; they can determine whether compliance strategies deliver protection or risk exposure.

Pooling can be a powerful enabler of decarbonisation, but only if treated as a governance challenge, not a bargain hunt. The IMO’s Net-Zero debate shows what happens when ambition outpaces accountability. FuelEU pooling risks the same fate if the industry isn’t careful.

The takeaway is clear: Don’t be seduced by the cheapest pool. Look for experience, responsibility, and alignment with long-term strategies. In compliance, as in shipping, you get what you pay for.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Port-of-Rotterdam.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 07:57:22.787493

How does air lubrication work?
While generating the air bubbles uses energy, with the right hull design air lubrication can achieve an overall reduction in CO₂ emissions of up to 10-15%(link is external).
What impact could air lubrication have on the shipping industry?
What is the future of air lubrication?","If you were on a cruise and a fellow passenger informed you that the ship was sailing on a magic carpet of bubbles, you might understandably think they had inhaled too much sea air.

In fact, there would be a good chance they were correct. As the global shipping industry faces continued pressure to decarbonize, technologies that improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions are gaining increasing attention.

One solution is this carpet of bubbles — officially known as an air lubrication system (ALS) — which reduces a ship’s drag through the water and, in turn, its CO₂ emissions.

How does air lubrication work?

The principle behind an ALS is simple: it reduces the resistance a ship faces as it moves through the water by introducing a continuous layer of air bubbles along the bottom of the hull.

This acts like a cushion between the vessel and the sea, which decreases friction and allows it to glide more smoothly through the water — hence why the effect is sometimes referred to as a ‘magic carpet(link is external)’.

Because friction is reduced, the ship uses less fuel to maintain speed, resulting in fewer emissions and lower operational costs. While generating the air bubbles uses energy, with the right hull design air lubrication can achieve an overall reduction in CO₂ emissions of up to 10-15%(link is external).

Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, a part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) Group, was an early pioneer of the technology(link is external).

Its system — the Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System (MALS) — uses blowers to generate the high pressure and large amount of airflow needed for installation on bulk carriers, container ships, ferries and large passenger ships.

What impact could air lubrication have on the shipping industry?

The global maritime industry currently accounts for almost 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions(link is external) — a figure it is working to cut over the coming decades, but that could rise with the sector’s modest predicted growth(link is external).

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) recently approved regulations for global shipping(link is external) that, from 2027, will require the industry to reduce emissions from ships to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Ships that fail to do so could face financial penalties.

Because it can be fitted to new ships or retrofitted to existing ones, air lubrication can help as an immediately implementable method for large operators — improving efficiency and reducing environmental impact without having to wait for next-generation fuels or redesigned vessels.

What is the future of air lubrication?

Air lubrication systems are not new — MHI’s MALS was first used in the early 2010s and has since been fitted on ferries, cruise ships and more.

As attention to the environmental impact of shipping grows, the market is expanding. Some estimates suggest it will more than double(link is external), reaching $2.5 billion in less than a decade.

More and more companies, from start-ups to established players, are working on ALS technology and the number of both installations in the water(link is external) and orders for systems continues to rise.

One example of innovation can be found in a new strategic partnership between Mitsubishi Shipbuilding and Elomatic(link is external), a Finnish engineering firm. The agreement aims to draw on both companies’ expertise to enhance energy efficiency, speed up the adoption of alternative fuels and drive digital innovation in the maritime sector.

One of the first areas of focus for the collaboration will be air lubrication, with MALS being integrated into selected vessels as part of a plan to support the industry as it navigates a path to decarbonization.

How else can shipping cut emissions?

Air lubrication can have a big impact when used in combination with other energy-saving technologies, including ships with low propulsive resistance, high-efficiency propeller systems, and heat recovery from engine exhaust gases.

In the future, alternative fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia and carbon capture technologies will also play a big role.

So while ALS systems won’t magically transport shipping to net zero, they can certainly help smooth the journey.",https://spectra.mhi.com/sites/g/files/jwhtju2216/files/styles/crop_freeform/public/Smooth-sailing%3A-How-air-lubrication-can-cut-shipping-emissions.jpg?itok=U6-ML1KP,N,,2025-10-07 07:57:29.073358

There is also a less stringent base target; for 2028, this is a 4% reduction compared to 2008.
What happens next depends on which target the ship is able to meet: If the ship meets (or outperforms) the direct compliance target, there is no cost to the owner.
By improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, OptiSave™ helps shipowners comply with the IMO’s base and direct compliance targets.
Conclusion The new IMO MEPC83 GHG requirements will be considered for adoption as amendments to MARPOL Annex VI at an MEPC session in October 2025.","In April 2025, the 83rd session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee approved the IMO Net-Zero Framework, introducing new emission rules: As of 1 January 2028, all ships above 5,000 GT (except ships trading solely domestically and platforms including FPSOs, FSUs, and drilling rigs, and semi-submersible vessels) must report their GHG fuel intensity (GFI) – and if they do not meet the IMO targets, owners will face economic consequences. The decision is a big step towards lower GHG emissions from shipping.

What are the consequences?

Under the upcoming regulations, shipowners must submit emission reports once a year. The reported figures (calculated using a well-to-wake approach) are compared to targets defined by the IMO.

There are two targets. The most stringent one is the direct compliance target. As shown below, a vessel meets this target in 2028 if it has reduced emissions by 17% or better compared to a 2008 baseline. There is also a less stringent base target; for 2028, this is a 4% reduction compared to 2008.

What happens next depends on which target the ship is able to meet:

If the ship meets (or outperforms) the direct compliance target, there is no cost to the owner. In fact, the owner receives surplus units (SUs) which can offset the Tier 2 compliance deficit of other ships (see below) or be saved for use within the next two years.

If the ship does not meet the direct compliance target but meets the base target, the owner must purchase remedial units (RUs) from the IMO at USD 100 per ton of CO2 equivalents emitted by the ship. These Tier 1 RUs cannot be offset by using SUs from other vessels.

If the ship does not meet the base target, either, the owner must purchase Tier 1 RUs and Tier 2 RUs at a combined cost of USD 480 per ton of CO2 equivalents emitted by the ship. Instead of buying Tier 2 RUs, shipowners can offset the Tier 2 deficit by transferring SUs from other vessels, if any, but the owner must still buy Tier 1 RUs.

As the reduction levels for both direct compliance and base targets increase every year, ships must constantly reduce emissions to stay compliant – and the cost of purchasing RUs quickly adds up. A calculation example from ClassNK shows that a ship consuming around 4,000 tons of LNG annually will cost its owner USD 112,560 a year – even if it meets the base target.

Solution: reducing energy consumption

On almost any ship, it is possible to drive down fuel consumption and emissions by reducing onboard energy consumption. One efficient way of doing this is to operate pumps, engine room fans, compressors, and other equipment based on current requirements instead of design conditions (which are worst-case scenarios intended to prepare the ship for extreme conditions that rarely occur in actual operation).

DESMI calculations show that on a Panamax bulker with three main sea water pumps, for example, it is possible to save 79% of pump-related HFO consumption by adjusting pump speeds. Similar savings can be achieved on other ships, saving thousands of dollars, reducing CO2 emissions, and making it easier to comply with the base or direct compliance target.

DESMI solution facilitates compliance with GFI targets and other requirements

Based on sensor input, variable frequency drives, and decades of experience, the DESMI OptiSave™ solution enables this by automatically optimising equipment operation. It requires no major rebuilding or refitting, making it easy to retrofit and improve efficiency, and it is already operating successfully in more than 700 installations on more than 450 vessels globally.

By improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, OptiSave™ helps shipowners comply with the IMO’s base and direct compliance targets. It also helps them comply with regional emission regulations such as the emission trading system (ETS) used in the European Union. Finally, higher energy efficiency also helps improve the vessel’s CII rating so the owner does not have to develop a SEEMP Corrective Action Plan. Like the GFI targets, CII requirements become stricter year by year, and shipowners need to take action to stay compliant.

Conclusion

The new IMO MEPC83 GHG requirements will be considered for adoption as amendments to MARPOL Annex VI at an MEPC session in October 2025. Though many details are still unclear, it is evident that shipowners must increasingly take steps to reduce emissions or face economic consequences.",,N,,2025-10-07 07:57:45.688954

One of those adding his voice to the chorus of the concerned was Columbia Group chief executive and president, Mark O’Neil. As lead executive for one of the largest shipmanagers in the world, Mr O’Neil said: “[The] runway for widespread adoption of alternative fuels is much longer and much narrower than anyone anticipated,” and urged the industry to slow down. Columbia Group manages more than 400 vessels, has 20 crewing agencies and more than 20,000 employees.

While his firm is committed to maritime decarbonisation, Mr O’Neil called for a reality check in adopting alternative fuels at LISW 2025, echoing sentiments expressed by ABS chairman and chief executive, Chris Wiernicki, earlier in the week.

Adding fuel to the fire is the Trump Administration, which has made it clear that it will not “tolerate any action that increases costs” for Americans. As a follow up to the US walkout during MEPC 83, a joint statement was issued by administration officials in August, serving as a shot across the bow to any IMO member voting for the framework.

“If alternative fuel ships do come in, they will come more gradually”

“Whatever its stated goals, the proposed framework is effectively a global carbon tax on Americans levied by an unaccountable UN organisation. These fuel standards would conveniently benefit China by requiring the use of expensive fuels unavailable at global scale,” it said.

The statement, issued by secretary of state Marco Rubio, secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, secretary of energy Chris Wright, and secretary of transportation Sean Duffy, also noted the regulation would “preclude the use of proven technologies that fuel global shipping fleets, including lower emissions options where US industry leads such as liquified natural gas and biofuels.”

Concluded the joint statement: “Our fellow IMO members should be on notice that we will look for their support against this action and not hesitate to retaliate or explore remedies for our citizens should this endeavour fail.”

Meanwhile, while admitting the fleet of alternative fuel-capable vessels is growing, Mr O’Neil said it “doesn’t mean those vessels are ready to burn alternative fuels.”

And, furthermore, he said, there was a question as to whether “the world is ready to invest considerable sums of money” to provide shipping with alternative fuels, given the current geopolitical tensions and “huge financial constraints throughout Europe”.

He said his company is “realistically ready” for the uptake of alternative fuels. “We don’t need thousands of crews in our crewing pool with alternative-fuel training,” he said, adding that “if alternative-fuel ships do come in, they will come more gradually - and the majority of dual-fuel vessels or methanol- or ammonia-ready will probably never burn those alternative fuels.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/182/mark_oneil_columbia_groupwebzhgf1_Main.png,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:09.453897

Dr Teck Lim Chia, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, elaborated on the company’s diversification of its customer base, factors driving its biofuel sales to surge 154.7% year-on-year in 1H2025, plans on future marine fuels, and future investments:

MT: With sales volume increasing by almost 10%, which shipping industries have been most keen to work with CBL and why is this so?

The increase in sales volume was mainly driven by network expansion, new customer acquisitions, and expansion toward the non-container liner and biofuel segments.

CBL has been actively targeting new customers, including mid-tier shipowners and tankers.

This strategic effort has diversified our customer base beyond container liners to include bulk carriers and oil tankers.

We have been in the industry for long period of time and have weathered various market cycles alongside our clients, building mutual trust through shared experience.

We deliver professional one-stop services, including the bunkering of conventional fuels and biofuels, at reasonable pricing and excellent creditability. This is why we are expanding our customer base continuously, including container liners and non-container liners. Our customer concentration is also coming down continuously.

Shipping companies, which are biofuel early adopters, seeking to comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulations have favored us. The surge in our biofuel sales indicates strong uptake from environmentally conscious carriers subject to IMO and EU FuelEU Maritime regulations.

MT: What factors in the market allowed CBL to introduce a triple-digit growth to its biofuels operation while narrowing net loss by 40% in 1H 2025?

On biofuel:

The implementation of IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) regulations and EU FuelEU Maritime regulations (effective January 2025) has accelerated demand for sustainable marine fuels. These regulations compel shipping companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or face penalties, creating immediate market demand for biofuels.

CBL’s early certification (ISCC EU and ISCC Plus) positioned us as a early mover in the sustainable marine fuels space. The successful B24 biofuel deliveries in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and multiple ports in China, have demonstrated our ability to arrange for such services to meet the surging demand from our customers.

Leveraging its early move into sustainable fuels, CBL is expanding its biofuel supply chain and exploring LNG and methanol, positioning itself to capture growth while helping customers meet tightening decarbonization targets across Asia Pacific, Europe, and other key markets.

The carbon emission requirement is the key tune for shipping. As the FuelEU regulations have been implemented since 2025, we expect more ships will use renewable fuel. The marine fuel in the next five years will be very different from those we are using today. CBL is taking a leading approach to adopt the new fuel. The growth of the biofuel will continue, inline of the global demand. We will push CBL staying ahead of this.

On narrowing net loss:

The 38.8% improvement in our bottom line for the first half of 2025 reflects the results of the strategic efforts and resources we have invested over the past few years to expand our port network, grow our customer base, and develop our biofuel operations over the past years.

We are now beginning to reap the benefits of these investments. As a result, we achieved double-digit sales volume growth in both fiscal year 2024 and the first half of 2025. We successfully onboarded new customers and reduced our dependency on our top five clients. Notably, our biofuel segment has continued to deliver strong growth over the past 12 months.

In addition, in the first half of 2025, we streamlined our operations to enhance efficiency, resulting in a 17% reduction in operating expenses.

Going forward, we remain committed to identifying new investment opportunities to further expand our network, with a particular focus on the sustainable fuels segment. In fact, we have adopted a more strategic approach aimed at optimizing profitability.

MT: CBL newly shared an initiative to explore, and possibility include LNG and methanol in its marine fuels portfolio; why is the company doing this and what type of partners are CBL looking to cooperate with?

For us, the biofuel story is just the opening chapter. Right now, we’re deeply entrenched in scaling our biofuel operations.

We’ve got B24 rolling out successfully in key hubs like Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and China, and the demand is surging. We’re talking about 155% revenue growth in this segment, just in the first half of the year. But we see this is only the foundation.

So, how are we preparing for what’s next? It’s a three-part strategy.

First, we’re building on our biofuel foundation. We’re not just selling a product; we’re building a certified, compliant supply chain. Our ISCC certifications are like our passport into the future fuel,—they give us and our customers the trust, and verification needed, to navigate through, strict regulations like EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

Second, we’re actively exploring the next generation of fuels. Biofuels are a fantastic drop-in solution for today, but we know the market is looking at LNG, methanol, ammonia and more.

We’re already in the early stages of building partnerships, and understanding the supply chains for these fuels. We’re positioning ourselves, to be the partner, that can guide our customers, through this entire journey. From traditional fuel to biofuels, and eventually to whatever the next big thing might be.

Finally, and most importantly, we’re building trust and reliability. This transition isn’t just about having the right product; it’s about having the operational expertise, the digital systems for tracking and compliance, and the financial flexibility to make it all work.

Our expanding network of over 65 ports isn’t just for today’s business—it’s the physical backbone, that will allow us to distribute these new sustainable fuels, whenever and wherever, our customers need them tomorrow.

We are also regularly exploring investments opportunities, into vertical and horizontal supply chain integration.

So, in short, we’re in the process of building a business that is agile, certified, and customer-focused—ready to pivot and scale when the technology and regulations evolve. We’re not just preparing for today’s transition; we’re preparing for tomorrow.

MT: In addition to decarbonisation, the maritime industry has also been adopting digitalisation practises. How has CBL adopted digitalisation into its business operations and what the benefits of doing so?Yes, the bunker trading sector is rapidly embracing digitalisation to enhance efficiency, transparency, and compliance. Integrated platforms now offer end-to-end management of bunkering operations—from procurement and real-time pricing to emissions tracking and documentation. We have explored various software solutions available in the market, but none have been specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of the bunkering facilitation industry. As a result, we began developing our own proprietary system about a year ago.

To date, we have successfully built a management system that supports our daily operations. Looking ahead, we are committed to further enhancing this platform by integrating artificial intelligence — including machine learning — to empower our sales team and management with faster, more informed decision-making capabilities.

CBL’s Digital Transformation Initiatives to integrate with AI:

Real-Time Order Tracking & Analytics:Implement advanced systems for live monitoring of fuel deliveries, quality assurance, and automated reporting, reducing operational delays and enhancing customer trust.

IT tools for Risk Management:Optimize credit risk assessment, cashflow forecast, fraud detection, and supply-demand matching, lowering financial exposures and improving margin stability.

Back-End System Upgrades:Modernize CRM platforms to streamline workflows, automate invoicing/payment processes, and centralize data for faster decision-making.

CBL’s digital adoption strengthens its competitive edge through agility, accuracy, and alignment with industry-wide shifts toward data-driven bunkering.

Further digitalisation will help companies to increase their operating efficiency and we believe that this will be a key determinant in tomorrow’s competitive landscape.

We are also exploring digital tools that enable real-time carbon footprint tracking and compliance reporting for EU ETS/IMO CII, aligning biofuel sales with customer decarbonisation goals.

MT: With cash balance of USD 5.43 million, what are CBL’s plans for this sum of money to support growth?

The majority of capital will be allocated to working capital, ensuring operational stability and supporting increased sales volume without liquidity constraints. A portion will also scale our B24 biofuel operations and secure an ISCC-certified supplier network to capitalize on demand driven by EU ETS, IMO CII, and FuelEU Maritime regulations.

Supported by substantial banking facilities, we maintain a strong liquidity position to meet current obligations and fund future growth. Furthermore, as a Nasdaq-listed company, we have access to capital markets to finance strategic initiatives, including potential mergers and acquisitions for vertical or horizontal integration within the sustainable fuels supply chain.

This disciplined capital allocation strategy reinforces both our immediate operational resilience and long-term strategic objectives, ensuring CBL remains agile and competitive in a dynamic market.

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Constantinos Capetanakis, Chair of IBIA and Bunker Director at Star Bulk, gave bunkering publication Manifold Times an update on the organisation’s growth, industry objectives, and expectations for the upcoming convention.

MT: How has IBIA membership diversification grown since our last interview?

Since the start of my term in March 2024, IBIA has aimed to open membership to more stakeholders. Membership has grown by over 10%; new members include shipowners from many countries including Greece and there has been interest from governmental associations and institutes seeking IBIA’s technical knowledge and expertise regarding the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and other decision-making forums.

IBIA aims to represent everyone dealing directly or indirectly with maritime energy and fuels, as it is not an association for a specific sector like bunker suppliers or buyers.

MT: Which agendas and issues in bunkering will IBIA be trying to push for the last quarter of 2025 and for next year?

The primary focus for the last quarter of 2025 is IMO’s decision on the IMO Net-Zero Framework in October. IBIA’s main responsibility will be to make its full membership aware of the framework’s contents, both in theory and practice, by explaining what each party needs to do. We fully support IMO’s role and proposals.

This is crucial as it is a complicated issue as highlighted by IBIA’s Dr Edmund Hughes, former Head of Air Pollution and Energy Efficiency at the IMO, at a recent members’ meeting analysing the implications.

The second major event is the Hong Kong Convention, a significant event within the larger Hong Kong Maritime Week, which we aim for it to be very successful following previous successful IBIA conventions.

MT: IBIA has a plan to expand its influence beyond global regulator IMO; how is the progress on this agenda?

IBIA has established official relationships with world-renowned associations such as BIMCO, GCMD, MPA, Intertanko, and Intercargo, and these relationships are increasing.

Additionally, a European Regional Board has been established with the main objective of participating in discussions and being heard by port authorities in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) region, the European Union, and wherever decisions are being made.

The organisation is also expanding its impact in the Americas and Africa. In Asia, its impact in Singapore is growing, and there is a strategic focus on opening into China, which is why the convention is being held in Hong Kong.

MT: What can delegates attending the upcoming IBIA Annual Convention in Hong Kong expect to take away?

Delegates can expect a very high level of speakers, presentations, panels, and marine energy industry related issues to be discussed within the panels. The event will provide significant networking opportunities, fostering an increase in their network, in a professional environment. It will also allow for interaction with other events and people participating in the Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Note: Constantinos Capetanakis will be moderating ‘Session one: Leadership Discussion​’ where he will be in conversation with one of the industry’s most prominent shipowners. This one-on-one interview will explore strategic perspectives on the future of bunkering and shipping, insights into the evolving energy landscape, and reflections on the critical role of collaboration and leadership. The session offers a rare opportunity to hear directly from two influential voices shaping the direction of the maritime fuel sector.

Join the Conversation

With over 300 delegates expected, the IBIA Annual Convention 2025 is set to be a defining moment for the marine fuels industry. Registration is now open via the IBIA Annual Convention website.

The Singapore-flagged Golden Antares, a 7,999 dwt IMO type 2 methanol bunker tanker owned and operated by Singapore bunker supplier Golden Island Pte Ltd, arrived in Singapore Port on 7 August, learned Manifold Times.

The vessel on 23 July completed loading 5,000 metric tonnes (mt) of ISCC EU-certified green methanol from Tianjin Vopak’s storage facility at Tianjin Port before embarking towards Singapore. The Hong Kong and China Gas Company Limited (Towngas) was the supplier, while Mitsubishi Corporation was the trader for the cargo.

“Our bunker tanker will first undergo port formalities and have its mass flow meter (MFM) unit commissioned in Singapore,” Tomohiro Yamano, General Manager of the Marine Fuel Department at Golden Island, told the bunkering publication.

“After the above is done, it will discharge green methanol to the Stolthaven Terminal in Singapore port on 15 August while keeping a portion onboard for the acceptance test of our Mass Flow Meter (MFM) system to ensure it meets the requirements set by Technical Reference for Methanol Bunkering (TR129).”

As part of efforts to get the vessel to comply to TR129 in order to carry out methanol bunkering operations in Singapore, Mr Yamano also noted that Golden Island has installed safety equipment such as fixed gas detectors from Gastron and fixed thermal cameras from HIKvision on board Golden Antares.

TR129 was launched by the Maritime and Port of Singapore (MPA) and Enterprise Singapore, through the Singapore Standards Council, in March 2025 to provide a comprehensive framework for the safe and efficient use of methanol as an alternative fuel for bunkering operations. It sets out requirements for the safe handling, transfer, and measurement of methanol in bunkering operations.

The development signifies a milestone for Golden Island and the company’s commitment towards sustainability and improved safety arrangement.

All crew members have also successfully completed the Basic and Advanced Training for Handling of Methanol as Fuel for Maritime Personnel courses. The courses were taught by the Singapore Maritime Academy at Singapore Polytechnic, as part of the Maritime Energy Training Facility established by MPA in 2024 to train the maritime workforce to handle and operate vessels using clean marine fuels.

Since 2023, Golden Island has already been designing a methanol bunker tanker for use in Singapore waters.

“We have always believed that for short-term to mid-term decarbonisation targets, green methanol has always been one of the best options available for the shipping industry,” explained Mr Yamano.

“Methanol is liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, thus making it easier to handle and store compared to gaseous fuels. The material is biodegradable in water and has the potential to be a carbon-neutral marine fuel.

“We want to be ready and prepared, overcome potential obstacles and share our experiences and knowledge with all stakeholders. Hopefully, we can help to grow the green methanol ecosystem in Singapore, positioning Singapore as the leading green methanol bunkering hub.”

Towngas

Towngas is the first enterprise on the Chinese mainland to produce ISCC EU and ISCC PLUS-certified green methanol. The successful delivery to Golden Island demonstrates Towngas’s capability to meet the commitments with precision and reliability, noted a spokesperson.

“This achievement underscores the effectiveness of Towngas’s strategic investment in green methanol production,” he said.

“Towngas recognises the growing momentum of the green methanol market across the region and remains dedicated to developing low-carbon solutions that support the shipping industry’s decarbonisation objectives.”

Mitsubishi Corporation

Mitsubishi Corporation, the principal partner of Golden Island in Singapore, acted as a conventional and low carbon methanol supplier, logistic service provider and coordinator of supply chain for the project.

“Mitsubishi views this transaction and partnership as an important step in its methanol initiative to support the global decarbonization of the maritime sector,” stated a spokesman.

Stolthaven Terminal

“Receiving this parcel of green methanol into Stolthaven Singapore through the Golden Antares marks a significant milestone in our efforts to support the decarbonisation of marine fuels,” expressed Guy Bessant, President Stolthaven Terminals.

“As a global storage provider and key logistics partner, we are proud to provide the infrastructure and operational capabilities necessary to handle green methanol safely and efficiently. This delivery not only demonstrates our readiness to support growing demand, but also reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting the future of sustainable shipping in Singapore and beyond.”

Chris Chatterton, Maritime Advisor of Global Centre for Green Fuels (GCGF), believes ethanol should have a seat at the alternative bunker fuel table and he shares with Singapore-based bunkering publication Manifold Times why it deserves to be part of the conversation:

MT: Tell us a little about GCGF, when it started and its mission.

The Global Centre for Green Fuels, or GCGF, is a non-profit global think tank headquartered in Singapore. We were established in 2024 to accelerate the adoption of sustainable fuels across maritime, aviation, and land transport. Our work focuses on enabling real-world deployment of low-carbon solutions through data-driven policy, technical validation, and strategic industry collaboration. We help stakeholders – from regulators to shipowners – navigate decarbonisation challenges with practical, scalable fuel strategies.

MT: As its maritime advisor, why do you think ethanol should be considered as an additional maritime fuel?

Ethanol presents a pragmatic pathway to decarbonise shipping. It’s widely available globally, competitively priced, and can be used with existing methanol dual-fuel engine platforms – often with minor re-calibration. Importantly, ethanol offers very low lifecycle emissions, whether derived from crops, waste or lignocellulosic biomass. Ethanol’s clean combustion profile also helps reduce local air pollutants like SOx and PM (particulate matter). Given the urgency of the IMO’s 2030 and 2050 decarbonisation targets, ethanol stands out as an immediate, scalable, and practical solution.

MT: What’s the current status of the push on ethanol following the document submission, highlighting the use of ethanol as a marine fuel, from Brazil and IBIA at IMO MEPC 83?

That submission was a critical milestone. It called for three main actions: a) inclusion of ethanol in the GESAMP LCA Working Group for lifecycle assessment, b) a request for ISO to develop a marine fuel standard for ethanol, and c) updates to the IGF Code to reflect ethanol-specific safety and operational differences from methanol. The submission was well received and is now being processed through relevant sub-committees like CCC and MSC. GCGF is supporting this by coordinating technical input and promoting pilot demonstrations and engine testing.

MT: With lots of focus on LNG, methanol, ammonia and hydrogen as part of the future marine fuel mix, why do you think there hasn’t been much talk on ethanol and what do you think needs to be done to ensure it is part of the alternative fuel pool?

The ethanol story in shipping is just now being told. Other fuels have had strong industry backing and early movers, whereas ethanol’s benefits – such as its wide availability and infrastructure compatibility – haven’t been highlighted enough for maritime use. What’s needed is greater awareness, technical standardisation, and real-world demonstrations. Ethanol can be bunkered through the same terminals and handled with very similar safety protocols as methanol. Singapore, being a global maritime hub, can play a pivotal role in advancing ethanol’s case through bunkering, pilots and green corridors.

What are the challenges to achieve widespread adoption of ethanol as a marine fuel in terms of production, fuel availability, safety, and long-term viability and how can they be overcome?

Global ethanol supply is already robust – almost 100M mtpa currently – mainly from the U.S., Brazil, Europe, and a growing number of producers in Asia. That’s enough to support near-term maritime demand. Safety-wise, ethanol is classified as a low-flashpoint fuel, similar to methanol, and requires careful handling – something the industry is already accustomed to. Long-term viability depends on sustainability certification, cost competitiveness, and standardisation – all areas GCGF is working to address. The potential is there – it just needs the right regulatory and commercial framework.

MT: As the IMO’s IGF Code already includes methyl/ethyl alcohols as marine fuel, are there specific advantages in using ethanol vs methanol? What are the specific risks of ethanol, compared with methanol?

While it’s true that ethanol has a low flashpoint similar to methanol and as addressed in the IMO IGF Code, it’s important to note that methanol’s flash point, already in use as a marine fuel, is slightly lower. So low flashpoint alone isn’t a disqualifier, it’s a characteristic that must be managed through proper standards and safety protocols. Importantly, ethanol has a significantly lower toxicity risk than methanol, making it safer for crew handling, spill and salvage scenarios.

Ethanol has lower energy density than fuel oil, but higher than methanol, which makes it slightly more efficient too. Therefore, what is needed is a robust, ethanol specific ISO standard that accounts for its unique properties such as water miscibility, energy content, and ignition characteristics. Importantly, ethanol also carries significantly lower toxicity risks than methanol, making it safer for crew handling and spill scenarios.

Interim IMO guidelines already acknowledge ethanol alongside methanol, and class societies have started aligning with these. But we still require marine-specific test protocols, safe handling/safety training, and OEM validation to close the gap and highlight the slight differences between methanol and ethanol as ship fuels. This is a key agenda item for us at GCGF in 2025–2026.

MT: Do engines and tanks on ships need to be modified to use ethanol? How easy or difficult is it to adopt ethanol as a marine fuel?

It’s surprisingly straightforward. Modern dual-fuel engines designed for methanol and electronically controlled – like the Wärtsilä W25, W32, the Everllence (MAN) LGI series and several WindGD models – can be re-calibrated to ethanol with minimal hardware changes. It’s mainly a software calibration and minimal adjustments in the fuel supply system. Several leading OEMs have confirmed this compatibility, and we’re now working with engine OEMs to initiate formal testing and trials. The real opportunity lies in making ships “alcohol-ready,” giving owners flexibility between methanol and ethanol based on cost, supply, and route-specific decarbonisation goals.

Additionally, technology is driving the ability to equalise energy storage on board with the inclusion of Sandwich Structured Cofferdams, enabling lower energy density fuels such as methyl/ethyl alcohols to be bunkered on a Fuel Oil energy-equivalent basis.

MT: With growing interest in cleaner fuels, what are the sustainable advantages of the production of ethanol?

Ethanol supports both climate and energy security goals. Today’s production combines regenerative and precision agriculture with advanced biorefining technologies, resulting in exceptionally low carbon intensity ethanol, on par with or better than many synthetic fuels. It’s also a liquid fuel, meaning it can readily leverage existing bunkering and storage infrastructure. On a macro level, ethanol production supports rural economies, energy security by reducing fossil fuel dependence, and creates a unified supply chain for land, sea, and air transport – as we’re already seeing in places like Brazil, India, and potentially Japan.

As informed, these ships, equipped with dual-fuel gas engines, mark a major step in the company’s decarbonisation plans. Baleària has procured 132 GWh of bio-LNG, enough to keep the three vessels sailing emissions-free until December 2025, representing about 13% of the LNG consumed by its entire gas-powered fleet in 2024.

The bio-LNG is derived from biomethane produced from livestock waste, which captures methane that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and converts it into renewable energy. The biomethane is then transformed into bio-LNG through Enagás’ regasification plants in Huelva, Barcelona, and Cartagena, using a pioneering conversion process that achieves greenhouse gas savings of more than 200% compared to fossil fuels.

It is expected, by most IMO observers, that the two thirds majority vote necessary to pass the NZF will be achieved.
Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at University College London, believes that these pronouncements by both Ørbeck-Nilssen and Wiernicki are “highly cynical”.
They did the same when the IMO introduced low sulphur fuel, it is part of the lobbying process, and it reflects the powerful shipowners’ lobby at the IMO,” added Smith.","The EU presents a united face at the IMO, but the façade may be dropping as the reality of the Net Zero Framework draws closer and the fear mounts for some countries that they may not be able to exploit energy reserves.

EU member states have been considered key drivers of the NZF driving change at IMO and garnering support from other states concerned about climate change to move shipping’s transition at pace, when compared to much of the IMO regulatory moves. These changes have been made possible by what was thought to be a rock-solid support from across the EU 27.

Speaking at the Cypriot press conference at last month’s London International Shipping Week the Deputy Shipping Minister, Marina Hadjimanolis, flanked by the Permanent Secretary Dr Stelios Himonas and Cyprus’s IMO representative Christos Atalianis, cast doubt on the country’s support for the NZF.

In a move that is expected to anger other member states Hadjimanolis suggested that Cyprus could be swayed by arguments that seek to ease the limitations on LNG, with Himonas suggesting, “We have large reserves of LNG,” indicating this would be economically beneficial for the Mediterranean island state.

One source, who is a representative at the IMO, was scathing about the Cypriot view saying pointing out that any “amendments to the MARPOL agreement were discussed at MEPC 83 in April, that was their opportunity to make changes, any substantive change to now would be going against both Brussels and IMO’s procedure”.

A second source, close to one of the delegations backed that view, adding that, “the details will be discussed at the upcoming Extraordinary meeting, [scheduled to start on 14 October] any changes to the level of ambition should have taken place at the April meeting.”

With detailed discussions already under way and the process now at a watershed moment the stakes could not be higher, with the US already seen as a disruptor, having reportedly approached the Dutch delegation in the hope of breaking the EU consensus, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that other delegations have been or will be approached.

Though Hadjimanolis denies any approach to the Cypriot delegation to date.

It is expected, by most IMO observers, that the two thirds majority vote necessary to pass the NZF will be achieved. That, however, is not the end of the road, the regulations must then be ratified by the nation states in the following ten months, and that requires approval by states whose registries represent at least 50% of global tonnage.

According to one senior figure that could be as little as four flag states, including Panama, Marshall Islands, Liberia and Hong Kong registries alone would secure the necessary 50%.

Moreover, senior industry figures such as Chris Wiernicki CEO at ABS and DNV’s maritime CEO Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen have called for a change of course with Wiernicki stating, “LNG and biofuels are mission critical to any success [of the NZF] and should not be overlooked, over penalized or discarded in the Net Zero regulation. Quite frankly, achieving net zero for shipping by 2050 looks like a wildcard.”

While Ørbeck-Nilssen believes that LNG is a transitional fuel, that with the production of bio-LNG and e-LNG this could lead to the maritime industry “Beginning to swing towards using LNG as an alternative fuel”.

Tristan Smith, professor of energy and transport at University College London, believes that these pronouncements by both Ørbeck-Nilssen and Wiernicki are “highly cynical”.

Johan Pijpers, ONE’s Manager for Inland Operations Procurement (Europe & Africa) said: “Decarbonisation cannot be achieved in isolation; it demands collaboration and innovation across the supply chain.
ONE and QTKR have proven that smart, trustworthy collaboration is essential to successfully reducing CO2 emission across the supply chain”.
The partners are now preparing for the next phase of their collaboration, which will see the introduction of a dedicated fleet of electric trucks (e-trucks) for port operations.","QTerminals Kramer Rotterdam (QTKR) and Ocean Network Express (Europe) (ONE) have reduced emissions by as much as 500 tonnes of CO₂ in just six months by implementing a biofuel scheme using HVO100, a sustainable biofuel made from renewable raw materials for port shunting operations.

HVO100, already proven in heavy-duty transport, can cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 90% compared with standard diesel. It also produces far lower levels of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide.

This joint initiative marks a significant step forward in QTKR and ONE’s partnership to decarbonise port logistics. It shows how readily available alternatives can deliver immediate results while longer-term solutions, including electrification, are developed. By targeting emissions in port operations, a critical link in the container supply chain, both companies are demonstrating how practical change at a local level can accelerate progress towards global decarbonisation.

Johan Pijpers, ONE’s Manager for Inland Operations Procurement (Europe & Africa) said: “Decarbonisation cannot be achieved in isolation; it demands collaboration and innovation across the supply chain. Our work with QTKR shows that practical solutions like biofuels can deliver meaningful results today, while laying the foundation for more ambitious steps in the future.”

Fred Groenendijk CCO QTKR adds: “At QTerminals Kramer Rotterdam, we are proud to collaborate with Ocean Network Express (ONE) in a partnership that goes beyond logistics. Together, we are taking concrete steps towards reducing CO2 emissions by aligning our strategies, sharing expertise, and driving a sustainable way of working across the transport chain. ONE and QTKR have proven that smart, trustworthy collaboration is essential to successfully reducing CO2 emission across the supply chain”.

The partners are now preparing for the next phase of their collaboration, which will see the introduction of a dedicated fleet of electric trucks (e-trucks) for port operations. These e-trucks will serve alongside the HVO100 trucks, handling container movements across terminals, further cutting emissions to establish a long-term platform for zero-carbon logistics.

QTKR and ONE view the combination of immediate, scalable measures, achieved by switching to biofuels, along with longer-term investments in electrification, as central to the maritime sector’s transition. The partnership also reflects a growing recognition that decarbonisation requires close cooperation between carriers, logistics providers and port operators if industry-wide goals are to be achieved.",,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:38.231427

To show the impact of shipping on the climate, statistics such as “cargo ships transport 90% of everything” have become commonplace.
Unfortunately, this narrative about maritime transport focuses on the highly unequal levels of consumption around the world, enabled by international shipping.
A policy action grounded on uncritical appraisal of shipping “transporting 90% of everything” could lead to simplistic climate solutions.
These include campaigns to shift to local production and consumption, which might not necessarily curb shipping emissions.","Next week, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is expected to vote on its long-discussed Net-Zero Framework on greenhouse gas emissions. If approved by a two-thirds majority of IMO member states, the framework will create a roadmap for maritime decarbonization. In fact, the regulations will set precedent globally, being the first to combine mandatory emissions limits and a GHG pricing mechanism across an entire industry sector.

But even as this critical decision awaits confirmation, two sustainability researchers are demanding for a more nuanced discussion on why international shipping must be regulated.

Depending on who you ask, there are different justifications to subject shipping to environmental regulations. One of the most common reasons is that maritime industry plays an enormous role in the world economy, hence an important pressure point for global climate policy. To show the impact of shipping on the climate, statistics such as “cargo ships transport 90% of everything” have become commonplace. Based on this fact, some campaigners have recommended people to consume less, or even buy local, as it helps to bring down shipping demand, thus reducing GHG emissions.

Unfortunately, this narrative about maritime transport focuses on the highly unequal levels of consumption around the world, enabled by international shipping. In a new research paper for the journal Global Sustainability, Dr. Christiaan De Beukelaer (University of Melbourne) and Prof. Philip Steinberg (Durhan University), queries the commonly accepted numbers about maritime transport, which are often used to guide environmental campaigns.

“It’s often claimed that 90% of everything is transported by sea, but the reality is far more nuanced,” said Beukelaer. “While ships do indeed carry some 80-90 percent of international trade by weight, they only transport a bit over 10% of the global economy’s 100 billion tons of material footprint every year, as per International Resource Panel (IRP).”

The authors suggest that when dealing with environmental processes and impacts, relying on just the size and scale of systems could be problematic as starting points for policy arguments. The same applies to maritime transport. A policy action grounded on uncritical appraisal of shipping “transporting 90% of everything” could lead to simplistic climate solutions. These include campaigns to shift to local production and consumption, which might not necessarily curb shipping emissions. Before a commodity is shipped internationally, a significant material footprint is usually incurred at the local level.

Globally, shipping contributes to 3% of greenhouse gas emissions. But despite being a large and important industry, most of the global economy’s annual material footprint is not traded internationally - by ship or other means.

“As part of the transition away from fossil fuels, oceans and waterways will need to be safe and reliable conduits for global trade, whether we think of shipping as representing 90% or 10.8% of everything,” the authors concluded.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Union-Pacific-coal-train-Wyoming-Wuzel007-CC-BY-SA-30.9d95ba.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 07:56:44.948195
