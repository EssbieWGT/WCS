This Guide offers a strategic and practical framework for shipping companies to transition to net-zero emissions.","The maritime industry is at the beginning of a major trans- formation. Driven by a continuously evolving regulatory environment, intensifying commercial pressure, and a gen- eral global shift towards reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the transition to net zero is taking shape.

In this context, the Net-Zero Guide (the Guide) provides a structured, practical framework to support shipowners, operators, and managers in developing cost-effective com- pliance strategies while maintaining long-term resilience. The Guide focuses on actionable measures to align fleet operations, investments, and value-chain partnerships with evolving regulatory and market expectations.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and regional bodies such as the European Union (EU) have introduced ambitious decarbonization targets, including net-zero emissions by 2050. This is being underpinned by regulatory frameworks, which are reshaping the industry’s strategic pri- orities. This is currently most prominent in the EU, where the Emissions Trading System (ETS) was extended to shipping in 2024, and the FuelEU Maritime regulation implemented in 2025, promoting the use of low-GHG fuels.

The IMO is attempting to introduce similar legislation on a global scale through the Net-Zero Framework (NZF). While this was approved by members in April 2025, an extraordi- nary session of the IMO’s MEPC in October 2025 decided to delay its adoption by adjourning the meeting for one year. As a result, the earliest potential entry into force is now 1 March 2028.

Maritime decarbonization is being propelled by other influential forces, including pressure from financial institu- tions, expectations from cargo owners, and the growing importance of corporate ESG commitments. While these forces work in different ways, they all make environmental performance a critical determinant for securing access to capital, maintaining competitiveness, and ensuring long- term commercial viability.

Given the ongoing fragmentation and rapid evolution of regulatory and commercial frameworks, compliance require- ments are becoming increasingly complex and costly. This

is particularly challenging for small and medium-sized en- terprises (SMEs), which must navigate overlapping require- ments across jurisdictions and develop holistic strategies that integrate technology adaptation, value-chain transfor- mation, and responsiveness to shifting market dynamics.

As these demands intensify, shipping companies must shift from reactive compliance to proactive transformation. This means developing strategies where regulatory alignment, strategic innovation, and operational performance advance in parallel.

A phased approach to fleet decarbonization is essen- tial, and shipping companies should develop a strategic approach across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons. The Guide recommends a three-step framework to help shipping companies translate decarbonization objectives into executable actions across their fleets:

1.Assessment

•Conduct a detailed evaluation of the fleet’s current emissions profile, benchmarking vessel performance against applicable decarbonization frameworks.

•Identify exposure to regulatory requirements across short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons.

•Determine technical and operational gaps, assessing where efficiency upgrades, fuel transitions, or process improvements are required.

2.Strategic planning

•Develop a fleet-wide decarbonization roadmap that integrates operational measures and technical upgrades within a unified planning horizon.

•Prioritize operational measures such as speed optimization, weather routing, and trim and ballast management to deliver near-term efficiency gains.

•Plan technical upgrades – including energy-saving devices, hull coatings, engine retrofits, and alternative-fuel readiness – through a structured cost-benefit assessment.

•Align fleet renewal and retrofit plans with technology readiness, shipyard availability, and regulatory milestones to avoid stranded assets.

3.Implementation and monitoring

•Execute identified measures through a phased programme supported by clear timelines, key performance indicators, and governance structures.

•Employ digital tools and fleet performance monitoring systems to track fuel consumption, emissions, and compliance status in real time.

•Institutionalize a continuous feedback process to refine strategies as regulations and technologies evolve.

The assessment stage establishes a factual baseline and en- ables companies to prioritize resources effectively, ensuring regulatory compliance and informed decisions. Translating this to a robust strategic plan positions companies to meet compliance milestones while preserving commercial flexi- bility and investment efficiency. Once these strategies are executed, embedding data-driven monitoring and adaptive governance enables shipping companies to maintain align- ment with dynamic regulatory environments while building internal capability and resilience.

But decarbonization extends beyond technology, and organizational transformation across the value chain is equally important for the implementation of new technolo- gies and systems.

To manage this transition in an optimal way, maintain safety, and ensure readiness for emerging regulatory frameworks, a structural approach incorporating effective change man- agement and capacity building is key, allowing companies to balance short-term operational efficiency with long-term decarbonization readiness. Marrying this with an effective operational strategy ensures compliance, enhances prof- itability, and prepares companies for future low- and zero- carbon operations.

The Guide proposes an organizational roadmap, in three key domains, which can incorporate all of these elements, ensuring long-term compliance and competitiveness:

1.Fleet renewal and retrofit strategy

•Pursue a dual-pathway approach that combines newbuild programmes incorporating zero- and near-zero (ZNZ) fuel systems with targeted retrofits to extend the operational life of existing assets.

•Engage early with shipyards, designers, and technology suppliers to ensure vessel designs are fuel-ready, accommodating methanol, ammonia or hydrogen systems as infrastructure matures.

•Implement retrofitting programmes to upgrade propulsion systems, install energy-saving devices, and integrate digital monitoring capabilities.

•Coordinate fleet renewal with regulatory checkpoints (2030–2040–2050) and evolving market signals to optimize capital deployment and minimize stranded- asset risk.

2.Fleet operational strategy to net zero

•Optimize vessel operations across the fleet through data- driven voyage planning, fuel management, and emissions monitoring.

•Deploy operational optimization techniques – such as slow steaming, weather routing, port call optimization, and trim and draft optimization – to deliver measurable efficiency gains.

•Adopt phased fuel transition strategies, beginning with drop-in biofuels and progressing to ZNZ fuels such

as green methanol, ammonia, or hydrogen, based on infrastructure readiness.

•Leverage digital platforms for real-time performance tracking and integration of environmental metrics into commercial decisions.

3.Manage change to overcome implementation challenges

•Apply structured Management of Change (MoC) frameworks to address the organizational, technical, and safety implications of adopting new fuels and technologies.

•Strengthen cross-departmental coordination between technical, commercial, and operational teams to ensure consistent implementation of decarbonization measures.

•Invest in crew and shore-based competence development, particularly in fuel handling, safety, and digital systems operation.

•Embed digitalization and cybersecurity as core enablers of compliance, ensuring data integrity and transparency across reporting and performance systems.

To complement internal efforts, external facing practices are equally essential. This should include alignment with external stakeholders across regulatory bodies, commercial partners, and the broader value chain, helping stakeholders to scale decarbonization efforts and unlock commercial value.

Shipping executives should focus on the following strategic priorities, integrating technical, operational, and commer- cial perspectives:

•Embed decarbonization into core business strategy, linking compliance objectives with fleet investment, financing, and chartering models.

•Adopt a lifecycle perspective on fleet management, balancing renewal, retrofit, and operational optimization within a unified investment framework.

•Leverage partnerships across the value chain – including fuel suppliers, ports, financiers, and technology providers – to accelerate innovation and manage risk.

•Invest in digitalization and data governance to enhance performance transparency, ensure regulatory compliance, and unlock long-term operational efficiency.

•Build organizational capability through structured competence development and robust change management processes that support sustainable growth.

With the regulatory and market environment evolving rapidly, shipping companies must adopt a dynamic, iterative approach to strategic planning. Advances in fuels, propul- sion systems, energy-efficiency technologies, and digitalization continue to unlock new opportunities for emissions

reduction and operational performance. To stay aligned with shifting conditions, structured review cycles, supported by robust data frameworks and performance indicators, are essential for validating strategy effectiveness. Ongoing engagement in policy development and industry forums will help ensure companies remain responsive to future regulatory thresholds and market expectations.

Strategic navigation toward net zero

The decarbonization of global shipping is both a regulatory necessity and a strategic opportunity. Companies that act early – combining robust compliance frameworks with innovation, operational excellence, and collaborative value-chain engagement – will not only meet emerging net-zero requirements but also secure long-term competitiveness in a rapidly transforming maritime economy.

This Guide offers a strategic and practical framework for shipping companies to transition to net-zero emissions. By integrating internal best practices with external part- nerships and continuous review, companies can build resilience, unlock commercial opportunities, and lead the maritime sector’s green transformation.

The journey to net zero will be more than a regulatory obligation – it is a strategic opportunity to redefine maritime operations for a sustainable future.",,N,,2025-12-28 17:57:06.430603

The research draws on contributions from national institutions such as the Agence Nationale des Ports, Tanger Med Special Agency, the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (Masen), and the Research Institute for Solar Energy and New Energies (IRESEN), alongside international partners including PROBLUE and the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility. Together, these actors explore how Morocco’s ports can evolve from traditional trade gateways into engines of a new clean-energy economy.

Why Shipping and Hydrogen Are Changing Everything

International shipping is under growing pressure to cut emissions. Responsible for nearly three percent of global greenhouse gases, the sector is now subject to firm climate rules set by the International Maritime Organization, which aims for net-zero emissions by or around 2050. In parallel, the European Union has extended its carbon market to shipping and introduced fuel rules that favor low-carbon alternatives. These policies are expected to make fossil fuels steadily more expensive while pushing shipowners toward new fuels. Green hydrogen, converted into ammonia or methanol, is widely seen as one of the few viable options to decarbonize long-distance shipping, as well as other hard-to-abate sectors such as fertilizers, steel, and aviation.

Morocco’s Natural Advantage in Green Hydrogen

The report argues that Morocco is exceptionally well placed to benefit from this shift. Its strong solar and wind resources allow it to produce renewable electricity at very low cost, which is the main driver of green hydrogen prices. Morocco is also close to Europe, which is expected to become the world’s largest importer of green hydrogen, and it has a long coastline with multiple ports open to global trade. These factors together give Morocco a structural advantage over many competitors. However, the study stresses that cheap production alone is not enough. The success of green hydrogen depends on the full value chain, including storage, transport, port handling, and reliable demand from ships and industry.

Four Ports, Four Different Strengths

To understand how this value chain could work in practice, the report assesses four port locations. Tanger Med, at the Strait of Gibraltar, stands out as Morocco’s main bunkering hub. Its position on major shipping routes means it can supply green fuels not only to ships calling at the port, but also to vessels passing through the Mediterranean and Atlantic corridors. However, limited space makes large-scale hydrogen production there difficult. Mohammedia, near Casablanca, has a different advantage: nearby salt caverns that could be used for low-cost hydrogen storage, helping stabilize supply across the system. Jorf Lasfar, Morocco’s largest industrial port, already handles large volumes of ammonia and is closely linked to fertilizer and steel production, making it ideal for domestic hydrogen use. Tan-Tan, in southern Morocco, emerges as the most promising production site thanks to excellent renewable resources and available land, even though it would require major new investments and skills development.

A Connected System and the Role of Policy

Rather than developing each port in isolation, the report proposes an integrated “Lighthouse Scenario.” In this vision, green hydrogen would be produced at scale near Tan-Tan, transported by pipeline to Mohammedia for storage, distributed to Jorf Lasfar for industry, and supplied to Tanger Med for ship bunkering and exports. This coordinated approach could significantly reduce costs compared to fragmented development. Still, green fuels remain much more expensive than fossil fuels today. Closing this gap will require strong policy support, including international carbon pricing, clear national safety rules, shared infrastructure, concessional finance, and early pilot projects such as a green bunkering trial at Tanger Med.

Gateway to Green Energy presents Morocco’s ports as more than logistical assets. With the right coordination and regulation, they could become strategic hubs linking renewable energy, global trade, and industrial transformation, allowing Morocco to turn climate action into long-term economic opportunity.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/24_12_2025_10_03_33_5222196.png?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-12-28 00:12:09.950381
