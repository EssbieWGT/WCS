Borup highlighted growing opportunities within the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, with players already selling carbon credits at over €300 per tonne to global buyers such as Microsoft.

While the IMO delay may appear as a hurdle, Borup suggested it could also be beneficial, stating, “It could be in our favour,” provided Quadrise can scale adoption quickly. He emphasised the importance of a level playing field for shipowners across jurisdictions.

Proactive: Peter, very good to speak with you. The International Maritime Organization's delayed adopting its net zero framework for another year. What's your reaction to that decision and what does it mean for the pace of shipping's decarbonisation?

Peter Borup: There's no doubt it is adding uncertainty to the path forward — not just the exact fuel that shipping will focus on in the future, but also the whole decision-making process. That being said, the three major alternatives for shipping fuel in the future have been methanol, ammonia, and people have also talked about nuclear — all three fuels that are not readily distributable now. They all come with a certain question mark. So it's not an imminent fix.

I think overall, it's a little bit hard to tell whether this is good or bad for a company like Quadrise. But the uncertainty suggests that shipowners need to find a way of taking agency themselves. There are a number of technologies out there that they can look to — everything from rotor sails to blowing bubbles along the hull, to changing the paint used on the hull — that can easily offer 7% or 8% fuel savings. Or they can use our products — the Quadrise family of MSAR and bioMSAR — which also offer significant reductions in emissions and cost savings.

For me, the thing is that we may not have the perfect fuel yet, but if you're combining some of these technologies, the effect is cumulative. You can actually go pretty far and save money at the same time. So there's more confusion now, yes, but I do think that shipowners can still do a lot themselves while regulators figure things out.

Proactive: I wanted to ask about your fuels, Peter, because with no global carbon pricing mechanism in place until at least 2027, how does that uncertainty affect the commercial rollout of cleaner fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR?

Peter Borup: It's hard to say. I think it's more of a sentiment shift, if anything, that could affect it. Fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR offer cost savings compared to regular fuels and reduce emissions. So from that perspective, they are on fairly safe ground. I don't think it should be affected much.

There are already operational regulations in place — the EU is probably the most well known. Traditionally, many of the fuels have been appealing mostly to liner companies, or ships on a regular service, where you can build up distribution. But some of the content in the EU rules — the EU Emissions Trading Scheme — actually offers a tertiary market to asset players, traders, and operators.

They would take positions in physical markets and freight derivatives, and now they can also participate in the ETS. There are already players selling credits on the biofuels they’re using, having saved CO2 emissions compared to regular operations — selling them at more than €300 per tonne to big players like Microsoft.

So that market is there, and that still means many of these technologies remain very attractive to a wider audience.

Proactive: Do you think the delay could actually play in your favour? Some in the industry worry it could slow investment in new fuels. Does that create more short-term opportunities for transitional solutions like yours?

Peter Borup: I'm not sure. It really depends on how the shipping world reacts. I don't see it as a risk. I don't think this is clearly bad for us. It could be in our favour. But it also depends on how quickly we can have the fuels adopted. That is probably more important. I'm aware there's a window here — I think it's fairly broad — but the earlier we have adoption, the more good we can do.

Proactive: Your sense from attending that IMO meeting — how important is regulatory clarity for your customers and partners when deciding whether to switch from conventional heavy fuel oil to your lower emission alternatives?

Peter Borup: I didn't actually participate in it, but I followed it closely. What's really important for our clients — shipowners — is that there is a level playing field. That's also why the EU introduced their rules. Initially, it wasn't necessarily because they wanted to regulate, but because there was an absence of global regulation through the IMO.

That's one of the biggest fears of shipowners — having to comply with different regulatory frameworks depending on where they are in the world, and knowing there may be competitors who don’t have to comply with stricter rules. That could be in the EU or somewhere else. So the need for a level playing field remains — and probably only the IMO can provide that.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzEwXC8yMDIxLTExLTI2LTA4LTE0LTA2LWUxMmY0MDNkMDRiMjdhZjU1MGVmMzM2ODZlZjU0MmNiLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-11-01 13:00:11.534114

Hanwha Systems","Four Hanwha Group companies — Hanwha Power Systems, Hanwha Ocean, Hanwha Aerospace, and Hanwha Systems — signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with global integrated logistics and shipping company HMM and leading classification society Korean Register (KR) to jointly develop and demonstrate next-generation carbon-free ship propulsion systems.

The collaboration brings together the capabilities of companies from the maritime, shipbuilding, and clean technology sectors to accelerate the demonstration and commercialization of carbon-free ship solutions.

Under the collaboration, the partners will jointly conduct concept design for next-generation propulsion systems — including an integrated solution combining an ammonia-based gas turbine and fuel cells for 7,000–8,000 TEU-class container vessels, and a hybrid system combining fuel cell and battery technologies for 2,000 TEU-class feeder vessels — while evaluating their commercial feasibility and developing new vessel concepts optimized for these solutions.

“The integrated propulsion system that combines fuel cells and ammonia gas turbines will set a new standard for maritime decarbonization,” said Hyoung-seog Kim, Head of maritime solutions business division at Hanwha Power Systems. “We will continue to expand collaboration with shipowners, shipyards, and classification societies to apply our technology to actual vessels as soon as possible and advance toward commercial operations.”

“This collaboration represents a strategic partnership to respond to the global shift toward decarbonization,” added Min-kang Kim, Head of maritime office at HMM. “Through demonstration and commercialization, we will accelerate the transition to a future eco-friendly fleet.”

“This project is an exemplary cooperation model in which the shipping, shipbuilding, and classification sectors establish safety and regulatory standards together from the early research stage,” said Kyu-jin Yeon, Senior vice president of KR. “It will contribute to establishing an international eco-friendly certification system.”

The collaboration builds on Hanwha Power Systems’ recent Approval in Principle (AiP) from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) for the retrofit of 174K LNG carriers with ammonia gas turbine propulsion systems. The MOU is expected to further accelerate the commercialization of a fully carbon-free propulsion system combining fuel cells and ammonia gas turbines.

The MOU serves as a collaborative model that combines Hanwha Group’s technological strength, HMM’s expertise in vessel operation, and KR’s technical verification framework to create synergy across the shipbuilding and shipping industries. Each company will contribute according to its area of expertise. Hanwha Group will lead integrated propulsion development. HMM will support performance validation using operational data. KR will carry out early-stage risk and safety assessments, provide AiP consulting, review regulatory and certification requirements, and conduct economic analyses.

The collaboration aims to disseminate zero-carbon propulsion technologies that align with the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s 2050 carbon neutrality goal. Hanwha Group, HMM, and KR plan to continue their partnership based on demonstration outcomes, working to expand zero-carbon propulsion solutions and strengthen the global competitiveness of the shipping and shipbuilding industries.

Rising dependence on fossil fuels due to increased power demand from artificial intelligence and to geopolitical tensions have led to 2050 net zero goals becoming unattainable, Wood Mackenzie said in its Energy Transition Outlook report.

The report comes ahead of the COP30 meeting in Brazil next month where countries are due to present updated national climate commitments and assess progress on renewable energy targets.

Demand for liquid hydrocarbons is expected to peak at 108 million barrels per day in 2032 with natural gas demand remaining resilient well into the 2040s, the report said.

In China, oil demand stood at 16 million bpd in 2025, but rising electric vehicle adoption could lead to demand falling by 35% by 2060, the report said. However, India, Southeast Asia and Africa remain key drivers of oil demand growth.

A Wood Mackenzie analysis suggests that limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius would require $4.3 trillion in annual investment between 2025-2060 – an increase of 30% from current levels – to reach net zero emissions by around 2060.

Energy sector investment would therefore need to grow from 2.5% of global GDP today to 3.35% within the next decade.

“Fossil fuels are no longer uncontested; they are being squeezed into narrower roles, but their decline is proving more gradual than expected,” the Wood Mackenzie report said.

The feasibility study, produced in collaboration with a consortium created in 2023 (which includes Anglo American, CMB.TECH, Freeport Saldanha, VUKA Marine, and ENGIE), said the corridor linking Saldanha Bay in the Western Cape to the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands would be one of the first Global South-to-North green shipping routes.

Saldanha Bay, home to South Africa’s primary iron-ore export terminal, is already planning the development of ammonia production, alongside port upgrades to handle bunkering operations.

In the green corridor’s initial years, ammonia-fueled vessels would likely bunker in Rotterdam, which is one of the most mature ports in terms of its ammonia bunkering and safety frameworks. Meanwhile, Saldanha Bay will have the opportunity to build the infrastructure to become the long-term green ammonia production and bunkering hub for the corridor.

By 2035, the port could supply bunkering services to all corridor vessels locally, creating a dual-purpose facility that continues mineral exports while serving international shipping.

“This phased approach gives shipowners and fuel producers a clear timeline to work toward, and we now need coordinated action from policymakers and industry to make this a reality by 2029,” said Shanon Neumann, Associate: Investment Facilitation at Freeport Saldanha. “However, to help Saldanha Bay transition quickly, blending public and private funding can unlock investment in infrastructure and reduce the risks of early projects.”

Why it matters for South Africa

The World Bank and World Economic Forum have both previously identified South Africa as a prospective key player in fueling shipping’s decarbonisation. The green corridor could contribute towards turning this notion into a reality.

Announced green hydrogen projects near the ports of Boegoebaai, Saldanha, and Walvis Bay could meet the corridor’s fuel needs, including its high-demand scenario of 22 bulk carriers per annum by 2035. The possibility of such strong demand levels could mean a stronger business case for green hydrogen producers looking to secure enough offtake volumes to finalise investment decisions and accelerate new projects.

Add in the necessary financing, potential tax incentives, and port tariff discounts for fuel production and bunkering build-out at Freeport Saldanha, and South Africa could gain a competitive edge as an international bunker supplier. The country’s hydrogen sector may be able to contribute 3.6% to the country’s GDP by 2030, with shipping and steel well-positioned to become early offtakers of the gas and its derivatives.

This green shipping corridor offers the opportunity to strengthen South Africa’s export competitiveness, future-proof a strategic port, and support the country’s Just Energy Transition through local value chains, skills development, and community benefits.

Policy alignment equals a strong business case

Regional and global regulations could materially improve the business case for the corridor. Europe’s FuelEU Maritime greenhouse-gas intensity targets and Emissions Trading System levy, the latter to be fully phased in by 2026, narrow the cost gap between green ammonia and conventional fuels by more than 60% in modelled scenarios.

The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF), now set to be revisited in 2026 following the decision earlier this month to delay adoption, would further strengthen the case, with fuel standards, emissions targets, and market-based incentives that reward zero-emission fuels.

“With binding global regulations delayed for now, there remains a business case to be made for green ammonia on this corridor,” says Marieke Beckmann, Global Maritime Forum deputy director of decarbonisation. “The role of national and local governments becomes increasingly important in incentivising the adoption of scalable zero-emission fuels. This, combined with EU measures, will help position South Africa as a competitive supplier of clean maritime fuel,” she said.

Next step: Implementation

The Global Maritime Forum study provides a roadmap to making the corridor operational by 2029, including:

• Creating an enabling contracting environment to optimally and fairly allocate risks and rewards across the value chain.

• Engaging with South African government bodies and industry stakeholders to raise awareness of the corridor opportunity and the need for an enabling policy environment, and build momentum around it.

• Mobilising funding and incentives for corridor infrastructure that will contribute to Saldanha’s hydrogen hub and port development.

California: CARB postpones rulemaking for SBs 253 and 261, but not the reporting deadlines. The California Air Resources Board (CARB announced on October 14 that it will postpone its initial Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for California’s landmark climate disclosure laws, SB 253 and SB 261, to Q1 2026. Of note: the delay does not change the initial reporting deadlines required under both measures. Disclosures under SB 261, Climate-Related Financial Risk, are still due on January 1, 2026. Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting under SB 253, the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, still must draw on FY 2025 data. CARB stated that the delays in issuing the rulemaking arise from the “large volume of public comments” it received during its August workshop for stakeholders and that is also working to refine the Preliminary List of Reporting/Covered Entities released in September, which set out specific companies that may be subject to SB 261 and SB 253. Also on October 14, CARB released a more simplified draft reporting template for Scope 1 and 2 emissions reporting under SB 253. For the first reporting cycle, use of the template will be voluntary.

EU: Omnibus I in the news. The EU continues to work through Omnibus I, the set of proposed simplification measures that will streamline key reporting and compliance requirements of the bloc’s Green Deal: the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), EU Green Taxonomy, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Here are the latest developments:

On September 29, the European Council formally adopted simplifying changes to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) that had been overwhelmingly approved by the European Parliament on September 10. As we reported last month, chief among the amendments is a new de minimis threshold under which imports of up to 50 metric tons per importer per year will not be subject to CBAM rules. This change effectively exempts 90 percent of importers from CBAM’s rules. Notably, the overarching climate ambition behind the mechanism remains unchanged: 99 percent of total CO2 emissions from imports of iron, steel, aluminum, cement, and fertilizers will still be covered by the CBAM.

Last month, we reported that the European Commission was considering another 12-month postponement of the due diligence obligations in the EUDR. On October 21, the Commission released its proposed amendments to the EUDR which, notably, preserve the current due date, December 30, 2025, for large and medium-sized enterprises. The Commission is also proposing to allow such enterprises a six-month grace period. The proposed amendments include several other key changes. Upstream entities – those introducing a commodity into the bloc’s market – would still need to provide due diligence reports, but downstream entities – which leverage commodities already on the EU market – would not. To further lighten overall reporting requirements, micro and small primary operators from low-risk countries – which, the Commission stated, include most of the bloc’s foresters and farmers – would each need to submit just one simple declaration in the EUDR Information System. And micro and small operators would have until December 30, 2026 to comply, rather than the current due date of June 30, 2026. Next, before the amendments can be formally adopted, the European Parliament and Council must consider them. The Commission called for the amendments to be adopted by December 30, 2025.

On October 22, the European Parliament rejected proposed amendments to due diligence and sustainability disclosure rules in the CSRD, CSDDD, and the EU Green Taxonomy. The rejected proposal was a compromise measure submitted to Parliament on October 13 by the EU’s Legal Affairs Committee (also called the JURI Committee) that would deeply slash the number of in-scope companies required to report. JURI’s proposal was defeated narrowly, 318 to 309, with 34 abstentions. Next, the Omnibus I initiative goes back to Parliament for renewed negotiations; a parliamentary vote on any new proposals is slated for November 13. Negotiations among the Commission, Parliament, and Council can only take place after Parliament finalizes its position.

Going forward, in Q4 we may expect additional omnibus initiatives, not least a planned Environmental Omnibus which would affect the Waste Framework Directive, Net Zero Industry Act, and extended producer responsibility (EPR) rules.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Qatari Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi have sent a joint letter to the leaders of EU member states to express their “deep concern” about the impact of the CSDDD – in particular, “its unintended consequences for LNG [liquified natural gas] export competitiveness and the availability of reliable, affordable energy for EU consumers.” In the undated letter, Wright and Al-Kaabi state, “We have consistently and transparently communicated how the CSDDD, as it is worded today, poses a significant risk to the affordability and reliability of critical energy supplies for households and businesses across Europe and an existential threat to the future growth, competitiveness, and resilience of the EU’s industrial economy.” None of the proposed revisions to the CSDDD currently under consideration, they continue, has properly addressed their concerns. Wright and Al-Kaabi’s letter concludes with a call for EU leaders to “take immediate decisive action by reopening substantive dialogue with your global partners, including the United States and Qatar and the wider international business community.”

PwC Global Sustainability Reporting Survey: Pressure is rising to report on sustainability, but reporting brings value, too. A study from multinational accounting firm PwC concludes that, despite political uncertainties around climate-related due diligence, sustainability is increasingly important to a company’s performance. The inaugural Global Sustainability Reporting Survey asked 496 companies about their approach to reporting under such regimes as the CSRD or the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB). First, PwC found, despite likely postponements coming in the EU under the Omnibus I simplification initiative, 40 percent of respondents said they plan to hold to the original CSRD reporting schedule, even if the EU alters its compliance requirements. More largely, many reported to PwC that pressure from investors, governments, and the marketplace is prompting them to accelerate their disclosures of sustainability risks and opportunities. Furthermore, about 70 percent of respondents said that sustainability reporting brings their company moderate to significant benefits that extend beyond compliance, helping inform their strategic moves in such areas as risk management, the supply chain, and investments. The study concludes, “Changes of direction this year by regulators have, without a doubt, slowed the momentum towards statutory sustainability reporting. But the overall trend to increase reporting remains unchanged.” Read PwC’s Global Sustainability Reporting Survey here.

Greenwashing

District court approves Rust-Oleum greenwashing settlement. The US District Court for the Northern District of California finally approved a $1.5 million settlement to a class of Rust-Oleum consumers who charged that the company’s ""non-toxic"" and ""Earth Friendly"" claims for its Krud Kutter cleaning products over an approximately 10-year period were false and misleading. The court’s order, issued on October 2, requires Rust-Oleum to remove “non-toxic” claims from its products’ labels and “add an asterisk to the 'Earth Friendly' representation on the products' front labels to direct consumers to the back label where it will state: 'Contains no inorganic phosphates, hazardous solvents, or environmentally harmful surfactants,' or similar qualifying language.” In addition to the payment to the class, the court also awarded class counsel $500,000 in fees and over $280,000 in costs. The case, brought in 2020, alleged that Rust-Oleum’s stain remover and degreaser products included potentially harmful chemicals like alcohol ethoxylates and sodium metasilicate and asserted violations of California consumer protection statutes, such as false advertising statutes, as well as the Consumer Legal Remedies Act. The parties reached the settlement after the court denied Rust-Oleum’s motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. With the settlement, Rust-Oleum does not admit liability or wrongdoing.

Company charges that a competitor is greenwashing a product line. Moldex-Metric, a manufacturer of respiratory and hearing protection products, has sued competitor Protective Industrial Products, charging that Protective’s claims about the environmental benefits of its BioSoft earplugs are “a calculated ‘greenwashing’ scheme to capture market share” via “unqualified environmental benefit claims.” In its complaint, Moldex lists a number of Protective’s marketing statements about the products, among them that they are eco-friendly, “decompose 76% in 180 days,” and are the world’s first sustainable bio-based ear plug. Moldex next stated that, in seeking to confirm Protective’s claims, its numerous requests – first, that Protective substantiate its marketing and, subsequently, that it correct its inaccurate statements – changed nothing. Protective, the complaint states, “has failed to timely remove or correct its false and misleading environmental claims, instead choosing to continue deliberately deceiving consumers.” Moldex is calling on the court to rule that Protective has competed unfairly under the Lanham Act and the California Business and Professions Code, to enjoin Protective from any further act of unfair competition, and to require the company to issue corrective advertising. The suit, still in its earliest stages, was brought in the District Court for the Central District of California.

France: historic ruling in TotalEnergies écoblanchiment case. On October 23, in a highly anticipated ruling, the Tribunal Judiciaire de Paris found that TotalEnergies SE and TotalEnergies Électricité et Gaz France misled consumers in a 2021 ad campaign claiming TotalEnergies could become carbon neutral by 2050. Specifically, TotalEnergies claimed that it put “climate at the heart of its strategy, with the aim of providing cleaner, safer and more affordable energy to as many people as possible” and that it had set the ambition to achieve “net zero” by 2050. The tribunal ordered the company to remove claims on the TotalEnergies SE website stating that sustainable development is at the heart of its business strategy and that, in line with United Nations development goals, it contributes to the well-being of populations. Écoblanchiment – greenwashing – is not explicitly addressed in French law, so charges were brought under French laws governing “pratiques commerciales trompeuses” – misleading social practices. This is the first time these French laws have been brought against a fossil fuel company, and the first time that any court in the world has held a fossil fuel company responsible for greenwashing. Notwithstanding this landmark ruling, the tribunal notably dismissed most of the claims that had been brought against TotalEnergies, including those related to its advertising campaign around its name change and generally promoting natural gas and biofuels as not sufficiently connected to the sale of products to consumers and thus outside the scope of consumer law. The company has a month from the date of the ruling to remove the implicated statements and post the tribunal’s ruling on the TotalEnergies SE website; it remains to be seen whether the ruling has a knock-on effect on other fossil fuel marketing campaigns across Europe. In September 2024, South Africa’s Advertising Regulatory Board ruled that a TotalEnergies social media campaign, #FuelYourExperience, was misleading, marking that country’s first decision on corporate greenwashing.

German court orders shoe retailer to withdraw sustainability claims. A German regional court has ruled that Germany-based Deichmann, the leading European footwear retailer, is guilty of making false advertising claims about the sustainability of some of its products. This case was brought by Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), an environmental and consumer protection organization, which charged that the retailer had advertised hundreds of its shoes as sustainable, using the slogan “Sustainability: Yes,” without providing any verifiable evidence to substantiate that claim. During the trial, Deichmann compared the shoes in question to similar products from competitors to demonstrate that the advertised shoes offered no environmental benefits. In a binding ruling issued on October 7, the Landgericht (regional court) of Bochum agreed with DUH, ordering the company to withdraw its sustainability claims and “cease its misleading advertising.”

Manx FCA issues guidance on greenwashing. The Isle of Man’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued guidance notes on greenwashing and consumer protection to help regulated entities understand and manage the implications of their sustainability-based claims. The guidance affirms that the FCA’s existing authority and current Isle of Man law “apply equally to greenwashing as to other forms of misleading or false advertising.” It sets out, then explains, five principles to help avoid making greenwashing claims, among them that claims should be correct and capable of being substantiated and entity-level claims should align with corporate strategy. The guidance is directed at entities registered under the Financial Services Act 2008, Insurance Act 2008, Retirement Benefits Schemes Act 2000, and Collective Investment Schemes Act 2008. While the guidance does not have the force of law, the FCA states, “it is persuasive.” The Isle of Man is a self-governing British Crown Dependency known for its business-friendly milieu.

Singapore rolls out Guide on Quality-Related Claims. Singapore’s Ministry of Trade and Industry’s Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCS) has issued the Guide on Quality-Related Claims, created, CCS states, to help businesses make clear and accurate product claims and avoid engaging in unfair trade practices. The guide sets out five key principles for companies regarding product claims under the country’s Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act 2003. CCS developed the guide in response to concerns raised by companies about potential greenwashing following a number of recent CCS enforcement actions. See the CCS infographic about the guide here, and download the guide here.

Sustainability: Regulatory

EPA reverses course on coke emissions standards. In a reversal on October 3, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin signed a final rule that reinstates the original compliance deadline for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coke Ovens. Coke is a key component in steelmaking. The tighter standards governing emissions from coke plants were originally slated to go into effect in July 2025, but, that month, the agency extended their compliance deadline by two years, stating that the industry could not feasibly implement them. The final rule signed by Zeldin on October 3 reinstates the original effective date. The rule establishes stricter emissions limits for emissions of such substances as mercury and requires plants that manufacture coke to install fenceline monitoring systems for releases of benzene. Also in July, the EPA extended the compliance deadline for a separate rule, Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, by two years. At this writing, it is unclear whether that postponement too will be reversed.

Deadline approaches for comments on proposed changes to Chemical Risk Evaluation Process under the TSCA. November 7 is the deadline to submit comments to the EPA on a proposed rule that would change the way the agency evaluates the risks of chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The EPA states that the proposed rule, pursuant to Executive Order 14219, “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's ‘Department Of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative,” and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative, would streamline such evaluations while increasing transparency and providing a more predictable regulatory process for chemical manufacturers. The current procedural framework for evaluating the risk of chemicals is set out in a 2017 rule that was revised in 2024 to require a single, comprehensive risk determination for each chemical across all conditions of use (COUs). The proposed rule would revert to separate evaluations for each COU. Among other key changes in the proposed rule: the EPA would be allowed to take into account occupational exposure controls, such as personal protective equipment, in risk determinations and chemical risk evaluations; would use the definition of “weight of scientific evidence” set out in Executive Order 14303, “Restoring Gold Standard Science”; would eliminate “overburdened communities” from the list of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations” that must be considered in evaluations; and would require less information from manufacturers submitting requests for risk evaluations. See the proposed rule here.

CalRecycle: Updates on progress of EPR law. California’s Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act Advisory Board met on October 17 to discuss the implementation of SB 54, California’s EPR legislation. At the meeting, the California Department of Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) stated that it is currently focusing on rulemaking efforts, reviewing public comments, and preparing its responses. Additionally, CalRecycle stated that interim technical reports on collection, processing, and end markets; source reduction and material design; and consumer education and access will be released soon. The Circular Action Alliance (CAA) also provided an update at the meeting, reporting that it is working with several agencies to develop plans for stakeholder engagement in the EPR program. CAA urged producers to submit their 2023 data by November 15, 2025 to enable more accurate 2027 fee rate ranges and source reduction planning. Additionally, CAA noted that de minimis clarity for certain types of plastic is still pending.

CAA discusses RecycleOn Colorado EPR strategy. In an October 9 webinar, CAA laid out its “RecycleOn Colorado” education and outreach strategy under the state’s EPR law, HB 22-1355, the Producer Responsibility Program for Statewide Recycling Act. Speakers from CAA and the agencies working on the marketing campaign explained that, starting in spring 2026, RecycleOn Colorado will work to expand public awareness of the EPR program through a broad outreach program that helps residents understand and take part in the new recycling system. Among the marketing campaign’s overall goals are increasing Colorado’s recycling rate to 47 to 60 percent by 2035 and expanding curbside recycling to 500,000 new households, particularly focusing on rural areas in which recycling programs currently may not exist and residents may be skeptical. July 31 was the initial reporting deadline for covered entities under HB 22-1355, which in January 2026 will begin paying responsibility fees that will be used to establish free recycling programs for Colorado residents. The longer-term plan is to bring small businesses into the recycling program by 2030. For more information, see our latest state EPR law roundup.

Quebec’s Bill 29, addressing planned obsolescence in consumer goods, is now in effect. Quebec’s new durable goods law, the Act to protect consumers from planned obsolescence and to promote the durability, repairability and maintenance of goods (Bill 29), became effective on October 5. Bill 29 introduces a right to durability, requiring manufacturers to provide a legal warranty of good working order for certain new goods, such as refrigerators, stoves, laptops, and cell phones. It also enhances the right to repairability, requiring manufacturers and merchants to warranty the availability of replacement parts and repair services for goods requiring maintenance and specifying that they must provide information about maintaining and repairing such goods. Further, the installation of replacement parts must be possible using “commonly available tools.” Find out more about Bill 29 in our alert.

IMO postpones vote on net zero framework and global pricing mechanism for ships’ carbon emissions. Global members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed on October 17 to table for one year their vote on draft regulations amending the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships’ Annex VI. The amendments – designed over years with input from all major countries – would have put in place a legally binding timetable to reduce maritime shipping emissions: a 20- to 30-percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, a 70-percent reduction by 2040, and net zero “by or around” 2050. Vessels not in compliance would be required to pay fees with gradually increasing carbon-intensity targets. This framework has been broadly supported by the shipping industry because it sets out global standards that are consistent and clear.

At an IMO meeting in April, a majority of the world’s countries endorsed the amendments. The next step was for IMO members to vote on adopting the amendments during this month’s extraordinary session of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee in London. However, in August, the US formally rejected the agreement. On October 16, it reiterated its warnings to IMO member nations that, if the net zero framework were voted in, the US would consider remedies. Ultimately, on October 17, Singapore’s motion to table the vote on the measure, put forward by Saudi Arabia and supported by Russia and the US, passed narrowly, pushing a vote on adoption to October 2026. Given the delay, the IMO is now reportedly working to revise the timelines set out in the agreement, which would have gone into effect in 2028. The IMO is the United Nations agency that regulates international shipping.

Sustainability: Litigation

Several lawsuits filed over rescission of Solar for All grants. A coalition of 22 US states and the District of Columbia have filed suit in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington charging that the EPA and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin illegally revoked $7 billion in clean energy funds that had been awarded to local governments. The suit, brought on October 16, concerns the Solar for All program, created to bring low-cost distributed solar energy to more than 900,000 households in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country. Funding was appropriated by Congress for the program in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act.

This is just one of several cases filed this month over the Solar for All termination. On October 15, a coalition of 24 Solar for All grant recipients, led by the Maryland Clean Energy Center, state of Arizona, and California Public Utilities Commission, brought a breach of contract action in the US Court of Federal Claims over the EPA’s decision to unilaterally terminate competitive grants they had been awarded under Solar for All. On October 13, Harris County, Texas filed its own suit against the EPA, Zeldin, and EPA Award Official Devon Brown in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, charging that no act of Congress authorized the decision to cancel Solar for All and that the cancellation violates the Constitution. Finally, a separate lawsuit filed on October 6 in the US District Court for the District of Rhode Island alleges that the termination of Solar for All was unconstitutional and caused the plaintiffs harm. That suit differs from the others in that its plaintiffs are “intended beneficiaries” of Solar for All – a group of nonprofits, solar installation companies, a trade union, and a homeowner. They argue that the Executive Branch did not have the statutory authority to rescind Solar for All’s funding because, although Congress repealed large swathes of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund in the summer, it has not repealed the Solar for All program retroactively.

All these cases are in the earliest stages.

Iowa counties petition Supreme Court over proposed carbon sequestration pipeline. On October 3, the Iowa counties of Story and Shelby petitioned the US Supreme Court seeking to overturn a ruling by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that blocked them from enforcing local setback ordinances against carbon sequestration pipelines. This is the latest development in the ongoing saga of Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed $9 billion Midwest Express carbon capture pipeline, which would collect captured CO2 from ethanol plants across the Midwest and sequester it in underground rock formations in North Dakota. Earlier this year, in a setback for the company, South Dakota banned the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines, effectively blocking that portion of the planned route. In June, the Eighth Circuit agreed with Summit’s contention that the counties’ regulations requiring “hazardous liquid pipelines” to meet setback rules around schools, churches, and other buildings are preempted by the federal Pipeline Safety Act. The company’s struggle to obtain permits for its multistate project is continuing across other fronts. Also this month, it argued in Iowa’s Polk County District Court that, before a lawsuit brought by the Sierra Club against the permit itself moves forward, the company’s proposed changes to its Iowa Utilities Commission permit allowing the Iowa portion of the pipeline should be decided on. Should the pipeline be built, it would become one of the world's largest carbon capture projects, moving up to 12 million metric tons of CO2 a year to storage. The company said last year that it had already obtained voluntary easement agreements from 75 percent of the Iowa landowners along the route. A response to the counties’ petition will be announced by the Supreme Court November 6.

Montana district court dismisses youth-led climate lawsuit. On October 15, the US District Court for the District of Montana dismissed Lighthiser v. Trump, a youth-led lawsuit charging that three of the President’s energy-related Executive Orders (EOs) will accelerate climate change, causing “irreversible harm” to the plaintiffs and violating their constitutional rights to life and liberty. They asked the court to invalidate the EOs and order the President, as well as 11 federal agencies also named as defendants, not to enforce or implement them. The court found that, while the activists had shown they would be harmed by these policies, their injuries could not be redressed by the court: “This court would be required to monitor an untold number of federal agency actions to determine whether they contravene its injunction. This is, quite simply, an unworkable request for which plaintiffs provide no precedent.” The ruling continued, “With this understanding in mind, the Court reluctantly concludes...that it cannot grant Plaintiffs the relief they seek.” Following the ruling, the lead lawyer for the 22 plaintiffs announced their intent to appeal. See our earlier coverage of this litigation here and here.

Supply chain integrity

Rare earths update. On October 9, in the latest move in the ongoing trade dispute between the US and China, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) announced tighter restrictions on exports of products containing five more rare earths – bismuth, indium, molybdenum, tungsten, and tellurium. Rare earths, among them lithium, copper, and cobalt, are essential to modern technologies ranging from laptops and phones to electric vehicles. The addition of the five minerals to the restricted list tightens supply chain concerns for companies worldwide that are already seeking replacements for the other rare earths affected by Chinese restrictions imposed in early April.

The US currently imports the majority of its critical minerals, and the federal government is striving to change that. On October 20, President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a United States–Australia policy framework to secure and diversify critical minerals and rare earths supply chains spanning mining, separation, and processing. (Find out more about the framework in our alert.) In addition, in recent weeks the federal government has been working to develop domestic rare earths capacity. On October 6, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced that the federal government intends to purchase a 10-percent share in Canadian rare earths developer Trilogy Metals (NYSE:TMQ), with warrants to purchase an additional 7.5 percent to accelerate the company’s exploration in Alaska’s remote, mineral-rich Ambler Mining District. Also on October 6, the White House announced it will allow the construction of the 211-mile Ambler Road, and President Trump directed that permits for the project be issued promptly. On October 1, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced a significant investment in British-Columbia-based Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC), which plans to develop the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, the world’s largest known measured lithium resource and reserve. And in July, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder in Las Vegas-based MP Materials (NYSE:MP), owner of the Mountain Pass mine, the only rare earth mine and processing facility currently operating in the US.

Supply chains in focus: Lessons from a recent enforcement action. Recent increases in trade barriers have led some companies to reconsider and reshape their supply chains to minimize risk and costs. A series of enforcement actions against a Dominican manufacturer of aluminum extrusions, culminating this September when a court vacated a forced labor finding, highlight how companies must look beyond tariff risk to fully account for the multi-dimensional risks associated with regulatory compliance and enforcement in their supply chains. Our alert tells you more.

Energy and natural resources

Trump Administration’s plan to revive coal industry moves forward. On September 29, the Trump Administration announced the next steps in its sweeping plan to revive the mining and use of coal in the US. The Department of the Interior announced it will open 13.1 million acres of federal land to coal mining, lowering royalty rates and streamlining approvals. A press release from the Interior Department states that such lease sales are already underway for sites in Alabama, Montana, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. At DOE, Secretary Chris Wright announced in late September that the Administration will continue using emergency authority “to stop the closure of coal plants.” On September 30, the DOE announced a major funding opportunity, “Restoring Reliability: Coal Recommissioning and Modernization,” offering a total of $625 million in awards to address two “topic areas,” Coal Recommissioning, Retrofit, and Modernization Projects and Rural Capacity and Energy Affordability. On October 15, the media outlet NOTUS reported that the majority of those funds, $525 million, were originally appropriated by Congress under the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act. Though the funds were intended for carbon capture programs and rural energy projects, the DOE funding notice states that coal projects may be eligible for awards from the funds originally allocated for carbon capture projects even if they do not immediately include carbon capture utilization and storage components. The Administration’s initiative to revive the coal industry is in accordance with two Executive Orders, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” and “Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United States Electric Grid.”

Nuclear reactor update. DOE has added four more companies to the Fuel Line Pilot Program, created to help establish a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain for testing new reactors and to fast-track the commercial licensing of reactors. Newly selected by DOE for the program are Oklo Inc., whose small-scale advanced Aurora reactors can be fueled by recycled nuclear waste; Terrestrial Energy Inc., developer of the Integral Molten Salt Reactor powered by molten salt fission technology; TRISO-X LLC, which is developing tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel for the commercial market; and Valar Atomics, which is developing high-temperature gas reactors that use TRISO fuel. The federal government is supporting the development of SMRs under two Executive Orders, “Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy” and “Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security.”

The US military will be among the beneficiaries of this move to build new reactors. On October 15, the US Army announced Project Janus, which aims to build and bring online small modular reactors (SMRs) on nine Army bases as soon as 2027. The program, a partnership with the Defense Innovation Unit, seeks “to provide clean, reliable energy for federal installations and other critical infrastructure.” The reactors will be commercially owned and operated. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the government is already working with private companies that are developing SMRs small enough to be transported on airplanes or trucks and even forward deployed. The US Navy’s submarine fleet is already fully powered by reactors, and the Navy is currently developing the next generation of naval nuclear propulsion infrastructure. In July this year, the Department of the Air Force (DAF) issued Oklo a Notice of Intent to Award for an SMR to be sited at Eielson Air Force Base in Fairbanks, Alaska.

SEC signals potentially significant changes to Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal process. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Paul Atkins has suggested that the agency may be amenable to arguments from Delaware-incorporated companies seeking to exclude precatory shareholder proposals from company proxy materials. His statements and the SEC’s planned regulatory agenda may denote significant changes to the shareholder proposal process for the 2026 proxy season. See our Market Edge blog.

UN SSE releases Model Guidance on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures. The United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchange Initiative (UN SSE), in partnership with the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures, has released Model Guidance on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures, designed to support issuers and listed companies in understanding and disclosing nature-related issues. Climate change, UN SEE commented during the guide’s October 1 release, poses material risks to businesses, investors, financial institutions, and markets. The guidance sets out information that is clear, consistent, and science-based to help entities identify, assess, disclose, and respond to their impacts on nature, which “in turn strengthens risk management, improves transparency, drives accountability, and helps direct capital towards nature-positive outcomes, building resilience and long-term value.” UN SSE also announced that, via its SSE Academy, it will soon launch a new training program for market participants worldwide on nature-related financial disclosures.

Federal banking regulators withdraw climate risk guidance for large banks. The federal banking agencies have withdrawn the Principles for Climate-related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions, a framework created to help large financial institutions – those with $100 billion or more in total assets – address climate-related financial risks. In a joint press release, the agencies stated that the principles are not necessary because supervised institutions already must comply with existing safety and soundness standards and already “should be resilient to a range of risks, including emerging risks.” As we reported in the spring, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency withdrew its participation in the interagency principles on March 31. On October 16, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also withdrew. The principles, the press release stated, have been rescinded “effective immediately.”

European Commission urged to exclude fossil fuel developers from SFDR’s “sustainable” investment categories. In an open letter sent on September 30, more than 120 signatories – among them financial institutions, think tanks, environmental nonprofits, and prominent academics – called on the European Commission to exclude fossil fuel developers from financial investments that are labeled sustainable. The Commission is currently considering revisions to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), legislation put in place in 2019 which sets out how financial market participants must communicate sustainability information. The SFDR allows three different categories to describe the sustainability of financial products: one for funds with a sustainable investment objective; another for funds that meet lower ESG criteria; and a third to be used by funds that meet none of the ESG standards. The letter states that “developing new fossil fuel projects – a long-term investment incompatible with global climate goals – is a clear indication” that a company has no plans to transition to net zero. It concludes: “We advocate strongly for a strict exclusion of companies developing new fossil fuel projects to serve as reference for all future SFDR categories.” Read the letter here.

Sustainability in the marketplace

Indonesia reopens international carbon trading. With the overarching goal of generating new foreign investment and achieving net zero, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has signed a decree ending the country’s four-year moratorium on international carbon trading. The Indonesian government, which had become one of the world’s leading sources of carbon credits, stopped such sales to international buyers in 2021, stating that it preferred to focus on meeting domestic emissions goals. Over the last couple of years, however, it has worked to more closely collaborate with global certification registries, signing mutual recognition agreements with such entities as Gold Standard, the Joint Crediting Mechanism, and Verra; it also introduced its own domestic carbon exchange, starting to offer credits to international buyers earlier this year. President Subianto’s decree requires that traded carbon units be verified either under recognized international standards such as those of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change or Indonesia’s national standards. Aiming to ensure transparency and accuracy while avoiding double counting, Indonesia has also established a decentralized registry to record carbon units in real time.

Industrial, manufacturing, and tech companies report on their readiness for extreme weather events. A report from insurance company FM of 800 risk decision-makers at global industrial, manufacturing, and technology companies finds that 62 percent of respondents have experienced severe business disruptions from extreme weather events over the past three years – but those respondents still report significant gaps between perceived and actual preparedness for future weather disasters. Four in ten companies, FM noted, report that their boards regularly discuss extreme weather risks, and 80 percent of the study’s respondents told FM that their employees are increasingly concerned about their company’s exposure to weather risks. Furthermore, compared to five years ago, the report found that corporate boards have a far more nuanced understanding of these risks – an understanding that extends to the vulnerability of entire supply chains and business ecosystems. However, the respondents also said that significant gaps remain between perceived and actual preparedness: their current insurance, most reported, would cover about half of potential weather-related impacts. Respondents also reported that their companies are under-adopting risk mitigation measures that could harden their facilities against weather disasters.

After firm expansion in 2024, seaborne trade growth is projected to slow to just 0.5% in 2025, signaling a near standstill. Long-distance rerouting caused by geopolitical tensions led to a record 6% increase in ton-miles in 2024, but at the cost of operational efficiency and stability.

Diverging Markets and Supply Constraints

Drewry highlights several structural and geopolitical factors behind the disconnect between freight and charter markets:

Tight Vessel Availability: Major carriers such as MSC and CMA CGM have absorbed large volumes of second-hand tonnage, reducing the pool available to non-operating owners (NOOs). Liner-owned fleets now account for 64% of the global total, up from 54% in 2019, limiting supply and pushing up charter rates

Geopolitical Disruptions: Ongoing insecurity in the Red Sea and diversions around the Cape of Good Hope have extended voyage times, reduced vessel availability, and inflated charter demand

Strategic Carrier Behavior: Carriers, prioritizing service reliability and alliance commitments, are securing long-term charters as a hedge against volatility

Regulatory Pressures: Emissions regulations under the IMO and EU ETS have intensified demand for dual-fuel and eco-efficient ships, creating a “scarcity premium” for compliant vessels.

A Global Trade System in Flux

UNCTAD warns that political tensions, new tariffs, and shifting shipping routes are redefining global trade geography. The United States and several partners have introduced new trade measures, including tariffs and port fees targeting foreign-built or foreign-operated vessels, which could raise costs further. These shifts have led to more rerouting, skipped port calls, and higher overall transport costs, MBN reports.

Meanwhile, energy shipping patterns are also shifting: coal and oil volumes are declining amid decarbonization efforts, while gas trade continues to grow.

Environmental and Digital Transitions at the Core

The IMO’s upcoming Net-Zero Framework, which will introduce a global greenhouse gas pricing mechanism by 2028, demands unprecedented investment in clean fuels and port infrastructure. Yet only 8% of the global fleet is equipped for alternative fuels, highlighting the scale of modernization required.

Digitalization is also reshaping port strategies, as operators accelerate efforts to improve efficiency, reduce emissions, and adapt to new trade realities.

Outlook

Drewry expects the freight–charter rate gap to persist through most of 2026, with average charter rates continuing to edge upward while global freight rates could decline by around 16%. Eventually, the combination of slowing demand, squeezed carrier margins, newbuild vessel deliveries, and the reopening of the Suez Canal route is expected to trigger a correction.

In parallel, UNCTAD emphasizes that sustainable growth will depend on how effectively the shipping industry manages its twin transitions environmental and digital, while navigating geopolitical and regulatory turbulence.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-10/CargoVessel.jpg?h=38fc0f45&itok=aPPRwvhw,N,,2025-10-31 19:00:45.542853

On October 8, 2025, the European Commission released its Guidelines for Reporting and Verification of Actual Methane Slip Factors. For the first time, shipowners can replace conservative default methane values with measured data, verified in accordance with IMO Resolution MEPC.402(83).

The current FuelEU default tables cover CO₂ only. They do not include methane slip (CH₄) or nitrous oxide (N₂O) factors for most new, or renewable fuels, such as:

Bio- and e-methanol

Ammonia

Hydrogen and other RFNBOs

Dual-fuel engines (where N₂O formation can be significant)

This means that without measured data, these fuels are not yet fully creditable or verifiable under FuelEU or ETS. In practice, this could lead to under- or over-reporting of GHG intensity and exposure to higher emissions costs.

However, there is a solution, as the IMO MEPC.402(83) defines how to measure both methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) onboard, whilst the EU Guidelines (Oct 2025) define how to report verified CH₄factors under FuelEU, with N₂O procedures expected soon. The technology to continuously measure and verify, CH4, CO2 and N2O, already exists. VPS Emsys can undertake these tasks and correlate these gaseous emissions with engine load, automatically building a verifier-ready Methane File.

It is so important for shipowners and operators to act now as from 2025, voyages which will fall under theEU ETS 2026 cycle, will see all combustion-related GHGs, (CH4, CO2 and N2O), priced and verified. At present FuelEU does not provide any default methane or nitrous oxide factors for new fuels, yet only measured values can truly provide accurate GHG accounting and lower ETS exposure.

If adopted, the global carbon tax could increase global shipping costs by 10% or more, advantage Chinese shipyards, and constrain already-strained global supply chains while directly hitting American consumers.
President Trump took decisive action to counter this illegal global tax, and the IMO folded, postponing their vote for one year.
The United Nations doesn’t get to reach into Americans’ pockets or cripple our energy industry with a backdoor carbon tax.
America answers to her citizens, not to unelected global bureaucrats in Geneva,” said RSC HEAT Vice Chairman Randy Weber (TX-14).","Earlier this month, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN body that oversees international shipping, was scheduled to vote to adopt a “net zero framework” for the shipping industry - a de facto global carbon tax on emissions.

President Trump took decisive action to counter this illegal global tax, and the IMO folded, postponing their vote for one year. Congressional action is needed to provide certainty as the IMO undertakes active discussions to expand the scope of the framework.

The UNtaxed Act provides that certainty. The newly introduced legislation would reassert the right of the United States Senate to consent to any UN-imposed tax prior to it taking effect in the United States, and prohibits the United States government from making any financial contributions to a UN agency or body that attempts to unilaterally impose a tax on the American people. The legislation ensures that international bureaucrats are never again able to illegally impose a tax on our country, and restores U.S. sovereignty.

The RSC HEAT team and concerned stakeholders echoed President Trump's opposition and demanded that the U.S. stop funding UN bodies that impose or enforce such taxes, arguing that the UN possesses no legal authority to levy them:

""The United Nations has no legal authority to impose taxes on American citizens or companies—and this attempted global carbon tax through the IMO is a flagrant overstep that violates international law,"" said RSC Chairman August Pfluger (TX-11). ""My legislation is an extension of President Trump’s leadership to stop unelected international bureaucrats from dictating the terms for American commerce. It would kill their global carbon tax scheme permanently by depriving all U.S. funding to any UN agency that attempts to impose a tax on the American people and ensuring Congress has a say in all taxes, fees, and penalties on American citizens or companies.”

“A global carbon tax would punish American workers, consumers, and energy producers while undermining American sovereignty. The UNtaxed Act ensures that no foreign entity can impose harmful international taxes on the American people and protects the pro-growth agenda of President Trump and Republicans in Congress,” said RSC HEAT Chairman Troy Balderson (OH-12).

“The UNtaxed Act draws a line in the sand. The United Nations doesn’t get to reach into Americans’ pockets or cripple our energy industry with a backdoor carbon tax. America answers to her citizens, not to unelected global bureaucrats in Geneva,” said RSC HEAT Vice Chairman Randy Weber (TX-14).

""Iowans shouldn’t be forced to pay for a UN climate scheme that punishes our farmers, shippers, and families. I’m proud to stand with President Trump and fight back against foreign mandates by delivering Iowa-first energy solutions that grow our economy and create jobs in the heart of the heartland,” said RSC National Security Task Force Chairman Zach Nunn (IA-03).

“This insidious tax would disproportionately harm low- and middle-income Americans, particularly those in our most distressed communities. The UN possesses no legal authority to impose taxes on American industry, yet they are trying to use this tax to ‘get the camel’s nose under the tent’ for a broader scheme of unauthorized global taxing and spending. President Trump has been able to thwart this particular action, but legislation is needed to ensure that the UN never again seeks to impose illegal taxes on the American people. The UNtaxed Act clarifies that taxes imposed by the UN have no legal effect in the United States, and eliminates US funding to any UN agency that attempts to impose and/or enforce a tax on the American people,” said Center for Urban Renewal and Education President Donald T. Eason. “We commend the leadership of Congressmen Pfluger, Weber and Balderson, and urge every Member of Congress to support this vital legislation.”

“A tax on international shipping is a tax on all Americans. The IMO has no authority to issue this tax, and if adopted, the tax would be detrimental to the United States’ economy and supply chains,” said Center for Transportation Advancement Executive Director David Ozgo. “I want to thank RSC Chairman August Pfluger and House Republicans who share this sentiment for championing the UNtaxed Act to provide our industry much-needed certainty.”

""The carbon tax imposed by the United Nations is another ploy to subvert our national sovereignty. Hard working Americans should not be unfairly taxed nor lose their jobs due to the whims of a political climate change agenda. We ask Congress to stand with President Trump in opposing the UN's actions by passing Congressman Pfluger's UNtaxed Act,"" said Eagle Forum President Kris Ullman.

""NTU is proud to support the UNtaxed Act and commends Rep. Pfluger for his leadership in introducing this important legislation. This safeguard for American taxpayers ensures that international organizations can never impose taxes on the American people without congressional approval,"" said National Taxpayers Union Executive Vice President Brandon Arnold.",https://republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/AP-PRESSER_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 18:02:09.261850

Earlier this month, the U.S. threatened to use visa restrictions and sanctions to retaliate against nations that would vote in favor of a plan put forward by the United Nations shipping agency, the International Maritime Organization, to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from ocean shipping.

Those tactics led a majority of countries at the IMO to vote to postpone by a year a decision on a global carbon price on international shipping.

The White House official said President Donald Trump has already made his administration's views on multilateral climate action clear in his speech at last month's United Nations General Assembly, where he called climate change the world's ""greatest con job"" and chided countries for setting climate policies that he said ""have cost their countries fortunes.""

""The President is directly engaging with leaders around the world on energy issues, which you can see from the historic trade deals and peace deals that all have a significant focus on energy partnerships,"" the White House official told Reuters in an email.

The Trump administration has pursued bilateral energy deals in its trade negotiations to boost U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports with countries like South Korea and the European Union.

On Friday, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said there is ""room for great energy trade between China and the United States"" given China's need for natural gas as the two economic giants negotiate over tariffs.

Trump announced on his first day in office that the U.S. would exit the 10-year old Paris climate agreement, taking effect in January 2026 and the State Department has been reviewing the U.S.' engagement in multilateral environmental agreements.

Earlier this year, the U.S. also pressured countries negotiating a global treaty to reduce plastic pollution not to back an agreement that would set plastic production caps.

The White House official told Reuters that ""the tide is turning"" on prioritizing climate change, pointing to a memo circulated this week by billionaire and long-time climate philanthropist and investor Bill Gates, who said it is time to pivot away from focusing on meeting global temperature goals and that climate change will ""not lead to humanity’s demise.""

Tallink Grupp, a ferry operator in the northern Baltic Sea region, on Thursday (30 October) said it has begun the transition to bio-LNG fuel on our shuttle vessels.

From the company’s partnership with Elenger, Tallink’s newest vessel MyStar has already completed six successful bio-LNG bunkering operations in recent months.

“This renewable fuel significantly cuts emissions and reduces the environmental footprint of maritime transport in the Baltic Sea region,” the company said in a social media post.

“Our cooperation with Elenger has been smooth, and we are able to gradually increase the use of bio-LNG depending on its availability and price. Our goal is to fully replace the LNG needs of both MyStar and Megastar with bio-LNG within the next year,” said Paavo Nõgene, CEO of AS Tallink Grupp.

“Tallink is setting an example for other operators in the Baltic Sea. The company was one of the first to invest in new technology and began using LNG as early as 2017. Now they’re taking the next step toward bio-LNG, and Elenger has supported them throughout this journey,” said Margus Kaasik, CEO of Elenger Group.

According to Wattlab CEO Bo Salet, the system was designed for “speed, space efficiency, and ease of use.” Crew feedback has been positive, with minimal maintenance required and no salt crust issues due to self-draining panels.

TNO, the Dutch research institute, has validated the system’s CO₂ reduction and return on investment (ROI), with results to be published soon. The project was co-financed by the EU’s Just Transition Fund (JTF) and has been nominated for two IBJ Awards: Environmental Protection and Bulk Ship of the Year (with Vertom).

Framework provisions and industry response The Net Zero Framework would require ship owners to use increasingly cleaner fuels from 2028 or face financial penalties.
Revenue from these penalties would flow into an IMO Net Zero Fund intended to support clean fuel adoption and assist developing countries with the transition.
According to the IMO, shipping currently accounts for 3% of global emissions, with 90% of all goods transported by sea.
The shipping industry broadly supports the framework as it provides consistent global standards for investment planning.","An agreement aimed at decarbonising the global shipping sector is delayed for at least a year following a decision by the International Maritime Organisation to postpone adoption of its Net Zero Framework.

This follows the votes of delegates from more than a hundred countries at the Marine Environment Protection Committee's extraordinary session in London on 17 October 2025.

The motion to adjourn succeeded by a narrow margin, with 57 delegates voting in favour, 49 against and 21 abstaining entirely.

This result may represent a setback for what is to be the world's first internationally mandated emissions reduction targets for the maritime industry.

The framework, which was initially agreed in principle in April following a decade of negotiations, includes measures designed to encourage sustainable shipping practices.

It includes financial penalties for companies that do not begin using low-carbon fuels by 2028.

Delegations from developing countries report what they describe as ""bullying"" and pressure from Washington, with threats of sanctions alongside tariff warnings.

Even some island nations – which face particular threat from rising sea levels – abstained from voting.

The Bahamas and Antigua & Barbuda, both of which agreed to the deal's terms in April, are two countries that abstained.

A delegate from the island states group subsequently told the BBC that these nations particularly rely on the US for trade and have been leaned on heavily by the Trump administration to change their position.

Saudi Arabia's last-minute intervention

Saudi Arabia brought the motion to adjourn to a vote on the final day of talks, when countries were scheduled to make a final decision on the framework.

The chairman of the negotiations confirmed that this means the agreement is not approved, as key timelines for the treaty require revision.

Ralph Regenvanu, Minister for Climate Change for the Republic of Vanuatu, said that Saudi Arabia's motion was ""unacceptable given the urgency we face in light of accelerating climate change"".

He has been a vocal advocate for climate justice in recent years and explained he saw the bill as imperfect but far better than a future without a framework.

""We came to London in reluctant support of the IMO's Net Zero Framework,"" he explained. ""While it lacks the ambition that climate science demands, it does mark a significant step.""

China, which had initially supported the deal in April, also agreed to the delay.

Framework provisions and industry response

The Net Zero Framework would require ship owners to use increasingly cleaner fuels from 2028 or face financial penalties.

The mechanism would apply to vessels over 5,000 gross tonnes, establishing a market-based system of credits and penalties.

Ships exceeding emission limits would need to purchase remedial units, whilst low-emission vessels can earn and trade surplus credits.

Revenue from these penalties would flow into an IMO Net Zero Fund intended to support clean fuel adoption and assist developing countries with the transition.

According to the IMO, shipping currently accounts for 3% of global emissions, with 90% of all goods transported by sea.

Without intervention, the organisation estimates emissions can grow between 10% and 150% by 2050.

The pilot reflects the commitment of both companies to explore innovative solutions for reducing methane emissions from shipping.

Methane slip, the unburned methane released from dual-fuel marine engines, remains a key challenge for LNG-fuelled vessels. Addressing this challenge is essential to unlock the full potential of LNG as a lower-emission marine fuel. Daphne Technology’s SlipPure™ system, designed to abate methane directly from exhaust gases, was retrofitted on board the vessel to test the feasibility of this approach under real operating conditions.

During the trial, Daphne Technology achieved reductions of up to 4 ± 2 g/kWh methane slip, demonstrating that plasma-catalytic-based abatement is possible on board an LNG carrier. These results represent a first step in validating the technology at sea and provide critical insights for the next phase of development.

By taking part in this pioneering initiative, the Angelicoussis Group has demonstrated its role as an early adopter willing to support the testing of first-generation technologies and decarbonise the maritime industry. Allowing the installation and operation of a first-of-a-kind (FOAK) technology on a vessel in commercial service required a clear commitment to advancing solutions that benefit the wider industry.

Ivan Raleff, Managing Director of Daphne Technology in Switzerland, said: “This was the first time SilpPure™ Plasma-Catalytic system has been deployed on a ship. It represented a bold step into uncharted territory, and the opportunity to conduct the trial has given us invaluable insights into how methane abatement systems behave in real-life maritime environments. These learnings are fundamental to the next phase of product development, and we are deeply grateful to the Angelicoussis Group for their openness, trust and support in enabling this milestone pilot.”

Andreas Spertos, Technical Director at Maran Gas Maritime Inc., commented: “Methane slip reduction is an inherent challenge for engines running on gas. When combined with the adversities of the marine environment, the challenge becomes exponentially more difficult. The successful demonstration onboard Maran Gas Chios is a landmark methane abatement technology trial. Together with Daphne, we successfully performed the test, verified the potentials, and identified improvements that will support the continuous development of this promising technology.”

The collaboration underlines the importance of partnership in tackling methane emissions. Both companies highlight the value of the insights generated, which will guide further innovation and help reduce risks for future deployments.

The pilot project also illustrates the broader role of early adopters in the energy transition. By taking on risk and providing operational platforms for emerging solutions, companies like the Angelicoussis Group accelerate the development of technologies that may become critical in reducing emissions from hard-to-abate sectors such as shipping.

Signing Ceremony Held During India Maritime Week 2025-

Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, announced that it signed a memorandum of understanding with Shipping Corporation of India on October 27, under which the companies will collaborate on the tugboat business in India. The signing ceremony took place during the international maritime event “India Maritime Week 2025,” held in Mumbai over five days starting October 27.

India’s economic growth is expected to drive an annual increase of 6%-8% in container cargo and 3%-5% in energy cargo over the next decade, with major ports in the country anticipating a rise in the number of vessel calls. In response to these developments, additional tugboats will be required to support the safe berthing and unberthing of vessels, underscoring the critical importance of stable tugboat services. Under the Indian government-backed Green Tug Transition Program, a plan is underway to gradually transition all tugboats operating at major ports to environmentally friendly “Green Tugs” by 2040, marking a significant turning point for the tugboat industry.

MOL has operated its tugboat business in Japan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam, to support the safe berthing and unberthing of vessels in those areas. Moving forward, it will leverage SCI’s network within India, along with its own accumulated expertise and technology in safe operations and alternative fuel-powered vessels, to expand its tugboat services in this vital region, while reducing GHG emissions from ports.

Proactive: Peter, very good to speak with you.
Peter Borup: It's hard to say.
Peter Borup: I'm not sure.
Peter Borup: I didn't actually participate in it, but I followed it closely.","Quadrise PLC (AIM:QED) CEO Peter Borup talked with Proactive about how the recent delay by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to finalise its net-zero framework is impacting the global shipping industry and the commercial prospects of Quadrise’s cleaner fuel alternatives, MSAR and BioMSAR.

Borup said the delay has introduced more uncertainty for shipowners and regulators alike but stressed that it also opens space for independent action.

“You can actually go pretty far and you can save some money at the same time,” he noted, pointing to immediate solutions including hull paint, rotor sails, and Quadrise’s own products that reduce both emissions and costs.

He also addressed the impact of lacking a global carbon pricing mechanism until 2027, saying that cleaner fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR still offer a compelling value proposition due to their economic and emissions advantages.

Borup highlighted growing opportunities within the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, with players already selling carbon credits at over €300 per tonne to global buyers such as Microsoft.

While the IMO delay may appear as a hurdle, Borup suggested it could also be beneficial, stating, “It could be in our favour,” provided Quadrise can scale adoption quickly. He emphasised the importance of a level playing field for shipowners across jurisdictions.

Proactive: Peter, very good to speak with you. The International Maritime Organization's delayed adopting its net zero framework for another year. What's your reaction to that decision and what does it mean for the pace of shipping's decarbonisation?

Peter Borup: There's no doubt it is adding uncertainty to the path forward — not just the exact fuel that shipping will focus on in the future, but also the whole decision-making process. That being said, the three major alternatives for shipping fuel in the future have been methanol, ammonia, and people have also talked about nuclear — all three fuels that are not readily distributable now. They all come with a certain question mark. So it's not an imminent fix.

I think overall, it's a little bit hard to tell whether this is good or bad for a company like Quadrise. But the uncertainty suggests that shipowners need to find a way of taking agency themselves. There are a number of technologies out there that they can look to — everything from rotor sails to blowing bubbles along the hull, to changing the paint used on the hull — that can easily offer 7% or 8% fuel savings. Or they can use our products — the Quadrise family of MSAR and bioMSAR — which also offer significant reductions in emissions and cost savings.

For me, the thing is that we may not have the perfect fuel yet, but if you're combining some of these technologies, the effect is cumulative. You can actually go pretty far and save money at the same time. So there's more confusion now, yes, but I do think that shipowners can still do a lot themselves while regulators figure things out.

Proactive: I wanted to ask about your fuels, Peter, because with no global carbon pricing mechanism in place until at least 2027, how does that uncertainty affect the commercial rollout of cleaner fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR?

Peter Borup: It's hard to say. I think it's more of a sentiment shift, if anything, that could affect it. Fuels like MSAR and BioMSAR offer cost savings compared to regular fuels and reduce emissions. So from that perspective, they are on fairly safe ground. I don't think it should be affected much.

There are already operational regulations in place — the EU is probably the most well known. Traditionally, many of the fuels have been appealing mostly to liner companies, or ships on a regular service, where you can build up distribution. But some of the content in the EU rules — the EU Emissions Trading Scheme — actually offers a tertiary market to asset players, traders, and operators.

They would take positions in physical markets and freight derivatives, and now they can also participate in the ETS. There are already players selling credits on the biofuels they’re using, having saved CO2 emissions compared to regular operations — selling them at more than €300 per tonne to big players like Microsoft.

So that market is there, and that still means many of these technologies remain very attractive to a wider audience.

Proactive: Do you think the delay could actually play in your favour? Some in the industry worry it could slow investment in new fuels. Does that create more short-term opportunities for transitional solutions like yours?

Peter Borup: I'm not sure. It really depends on how the shipping world reacts. I don't see it as a risk. I don't think this is clearly bad for us. It could be in our favour. But it also depends on how quickly we can have the fuels adopted. That is probably more important. I'm aware there's a window here — I think it's fairly broad — but the earlier we have adoption, the more good we can do.

Proactive: Your sense from attending that IMO meeting — how important is regulatory clarity for your customers and partners when deciding whether to switch from conventional heavy fuel oil to your lower emission alternatives?

Peter Borup: I didn't actually participate in it, but I followed it closely. What's really important for our clients — shipowners — is that there is a level playing field. That's also why the EU introduced their rules. Initially, it wasn't necessarily because they wanted to regulate, but because there was an absence of global regulation through the IMO.

That's one of the biggest fears of shipowners — having to comply with different regulatory frameworks depending on where they are in the world, and knowing there may be competitors who don’t have to comply with stricter rules. That could be in the EU or somewhere else. So the need for a level playing field remains — and probably only the IMO can provide that.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzEwXC8yMDIxLTExLTI2LTA4LTE0LTA2LWUxMmY0MDNkMDRiMjdhZjU1MGVmMzM2ODZlZjU0MmNiLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-10-31 12:00:39.448772

Yet we hold just 28 days of diesel reserves — while controlling 56% of global iron ore exports. On 17 October, we discovered which dependency truly matters when maritime nations voted on shipping emissions in London.

The International Maritime Organisation’s extraordinary session ended earlier this month with a narrow but consequential vote: 57 countries backed a one-year delay to the Net Zero Framework for global shipping, while 49 — including Australia — voted to proceed. The postponement came after President Trump posted to Truth Social calling the framework a “Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping”, with the US State Department threatening tariffs against any nation supporting the measure.

For an island nation handling $650 billion in exports annually, this should be alarming. We’re watching others write the rules that will govern the ships carrying our exports – while positioning ourselves as a future supplier of the very fuels those ships will need.

The strategic asset we’re not using

The real story lies in one commodity: iron ore. Australia controls 56% of global iron ore exports through just six strategic ports. More than half the world’s iron ore flows from Western Australia to steelmakers in China, Japan and South Korea. These are our routes. Our cargo. Our potential leverage.

Here’s the mechanism most analyses miss: port authorities can set environmental standards for vessels as conditions of access. Ships collecting Australian iron ore must meet whatever fuel availability and emissions reporting requirements we establish. If Australia mandated green fuel availability at our six major ore terminals — aligned with Japan and South Korea — the market would respond.

The precedent exists. The EU’s FuelEU Maritime regulation sets greenhouse gas intensity limits for ships calling at European ports. California’s port authorities have driven vessel speed reductions through similar mechanisms. Australia could establish equivalent standards, creating a de facto Asian maritime corridor framework.

The economic logic extends beyond protecting our $137 billion annual iron ore trade. Australia is investing heavily to become a green hydrogen and ammonia exporter – precisely the fuels international shipping needs. Setting maritime fuel standards now creates guaranteed demand for Australian exports.

Legitimate concerns deserve engagement

Several concerns warrant examination. First, China dependency: aggressive Australian standard-setting risks China accelerating alternative suppliers in West Africa or Brazil. However, this risk exists regardless – climate disruption already incentivises supply chain diversification. The question is whether Australia uses its current advantage to shape the transition.

Second, capital costs for shipping companies represent a genuine burden. This is precisely why they want regulatory certainty. The International Chamber of Shipping supported the IMO framework because fragmented regional standards cost more than unified global rules.

Third, regulatory arbitrage: ships could register in jurisdictions without green fuel requirements. This misunderstands the constraint. Ships calling at Australian ports must comply with our requirements regardless of flag state – just as they comply with Australian biosecurity and customs regulations.

What Australia must do

The Albanese Government has built foundations: the South Korea Green Shipping Corridor Memorandum, the Australia-Singapore Low Emissions Maritime Initiative, and $30 million for shipping innovation. Transport Minister Catherine King’s draft Maritime Emissions Reduction National Action Plan awaits release. These need immediate activation.

First, release MERNAP without delay with two concrete actions: establish measurement and reporting systems interlocking with EU standards and legislate domestic biofuel sustainability safeguards.

Second, accelerate green corridor partnerships with Japan, South Korea and Singapore into binding agreements within six months. These three nations represent our largest iron ore customers and share our interest in orderly maritime transition. Joint standards create de facto rules for Asia-Pacific shipping without waiting for IMO consensus.

The window is narrowing

The IMO postponement highlights a broader reality: the global maritime transition will be fragmented and contested. China is already investing heavily in green shipping technology. If Australia waits for global co-ordination that may never arrive, the early opportunities vanish.

The ships need to decarbonise regardless of what the IMO does. They’ll buy green fuels from someone. We can watch other nations capture the maritime fuel transition, or recognise that real transformation lies in becoming the fuel supplier for the ships that carry our exports. The next 12 months will determine whether we shape an orderly regional transition or bear the costs of a chaotic global one.

This global carbon tax would have increased shipping costs by up to 10%. More than 80% of global trade moves by sea, including critical items such as food, fuel, medicine, and industrial goods, and these costs would ripple through our entire economy. This framework would significantly burden commerce, harm consumers, and erase the historic economic improvements President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have secured to ease runaway inflation from the Biden-Harris era.

The framework would have also handed China a massive competitive advantage. China’s shipbuilding industry dwarfs the United States’s in both military and commercial sectors. A single Chinese shipyard can outproduce every American shipyard combined. We have not produced more commercial shipping tonnage than China in a single year since World War II, a gap driven by higher labor costs, diminished shipyard capacity, and mounting federal regulations. By creating unprecedented demand for new vessels, this framework would have channeled billions to Chinese shipyards while further weakening American shipbuilding.

Taxes and fees collected under this framework would flow to the IMO Net-Zero Fund, controlled by a governing board with no accountability to American taxpayers. These funds would subsidize low-emission ships, drive more business to China, bankroll initiatives in developing countries, and support the IMO’s radical Greenhouse Gas Strategy, which mandates at least 40% reductions in emissions from international shipping by 2030. American dollars would disappear into this fund with no tangible benefit to our nation.

This costly and burdensome carbon tax would also disrupt supply chains and consumer access to vital goods. Every corner of the globe experienced disruptions in the production and delivery of goods during the pandemic, and this framework would guarantee that those problems become permanent fixtures of global commerce.

Trump and his administration, led by Cabinet Secretaries Marco Rubio, Chris Wright, and Sean Duffy, took decisive action to counter this radical agenda, including by providing possible supporting nations a menu of retaliatory options: visa restrictions, financial penalties, port fees, investigations, regulations, and sanction evaluations. The president’s immediate, no-holds-barred response made clear that the U.S. will not be unduly or unfairly burdened by IMO overreach.

Thankfully, the IMO heeded warnings from the Trump administration and postponed the vote to adopt the global carbon tax by one year. While this decision provided immediate relief to the industry, there is an urgent need for congressional action to provide permanent clarity and ensure the tax is never resurrected. Time is of the essence, as the IMO is already undertaking active discussions to expand the scope of the framework to smaller oceangoing ships.

I am introducing the UNtaxed Act to block permanently the implementation of the tax. The legislation takes three critical steps.

First, it affirms that Senate approval is required before the U.N. or any of its affiliated bodies can impose penalties or taxes on U.S. citizens or companies. Americans did not vote to elect the IMO’s assembly or its council and have no means to hold its members accountable.

Second, it prohibits funding for contributions to the U.N. or any affiliated body seeking to impose a global carbon tax. As the largest U.N. contributor, the U.S. should never bankroll organizations that undermine American commerce and taxpayers.

Third, it permanently defunds U.S. implementation and enforcement of a global carbon tax. If the net-zero framework is ever adopted, its enforcement is the responsibility of the member states, in their capacity as flag, port, or coastal states. This legislation would prevent taxpayer dollars from being used to comply with this ludicrous ruling, a vital backstop.

BUSINESS REPORTS GIVE THE LIE TO CLIMATE ALARMISM

The people have spoken clearly: They want transformative change that restores American dominance on the world stage and unleashes economic potential. This ill-conceived global carbon tax represents a blatant abuse of power that would have severely damaged American commerce had Trump and his administration not intervened.

The UNtaxed Act is an extension of Trump’s leadership in stopping unelected international bureaucrats from dictating the terms of American commerce. Congressional intervention is not only justified. It is long overdue.

Modi took to social media platform Linkedin to show his country’s progress in maritime, stating that total capacity has almost doubled to 2762 million metric tonnes in 11 years.

He also showed that vessel turnaround times in Indian ports had fallen sharply while the number of Indian seafarers has boomed to over 300,000, making up over 12% of the global mariner workforce.

Modi is also keen to attract international investment into India’s maritime industry, he said: “I can say with confidence that India offers the perfect harbour for investments.”

He’s also scrapped so-called “colonial” laws regarding shipping whilst at the same time reinforcing the sector using the public purse.

India does face a number of challenges though. It has to modernise its infrastructure, creating deepwater ports to cope with the expected increase in maritime traffic. But Modi has proved a past master of creating attractive propositions for overseas investors and seems to have done so again in a maritime context, allowing 100% foreign ownership of Indian projects. A refreshing lack of protectionism in today’s tense geopolitical environment.

Modi’s reforms look to be bearing fruit already, with the UAE’s DP World announcing $5 billion of investment in India’s maritime infrastructure and Maersk’s APM Terminals looking at a $2 billion investment in an Indian port.

The aim?

India has announced an initiative dubbed Maritime India 2030 and its goal is to make the country a global maritime power. On paper, this goal doesn’t look too far-fetched. The country has over 11,000 km of coastline, natural deep ports and a young working population, what could possibly go wrong?

Modi has been trying to boost his country’s production of steel as currently it relies on a host of countries including China and South Korea for its import of this all-important commodity. Given the political brinkmanship currently being deployed by superpowers the world over, if those two countries fear India could achieve its goal of being a key maritime hub, especially in the field of shipbuilding, it might not be overly difficult to scupper its plans.

Finally, in today’s maritime world, the focus is on sustainability and reducing emissions. While the country has made some progress with renewable fuels, it still ranks low in biodiversity and habitat protection and has a dependence on fossil fuels that some investors may deem unpalatable. But with Modi the political will is there.

The International Maritime Organization convened this October 2025 to vote on a framework that could reshape global shipping and redefine climate justice. The IMO Net-Zero Framework, agreed upon this past April at MEPC 83 – The Marine Environmental Protection Committee, represents the first legally binding global regulation to decarbonize international shipping, a sector responsible for emissions equivalent to major economies like Japan or Germany. Yet as this historic moment approaches, a critical question hangs in the balance: Will this framework deliver both the ambitious emissions reductions and the equitable transition that our planet and its most vulnerable communities desperately need?

The answer depends entirely on decisions to be made in the coming weeks and months.

The Framework

The IMO Net-Zero Framework introduces an innovative two-tier system that sets increasingly stringent greenhouse gas intensity limits for ships while creating economic incentives through a carbon pricing mechanism. Ships that fail to meet targets will pay penalties: $100 per ton for moderate non-compliance and a steep $380 per ton for those falling furthest behind. These fees will generate an estimated $10-12 billion annually, flowing into a novel IMO Net-Zero Fund designed to support the transition.

On paper, this is groundbreaking. The framework will drive shipping toward zero-emission fuels, with modeling from University College London and UMass indicating that e-fuels (particularly green ammonia) will become the dominant solution by the mid-2040s. Yet here lies the framework’s central tension: while it will eventually drive the right technological outcomes, it may arrive too late for a smooth transition and risk leaving the world’s most vulnerable countries to bear disproportionate costs along the way.

The IMO’s own 2023 greenhouse gas strategy established two equally important objectives: reaching net-zero emissions by or around 2050 and achieving this through a “just and equitable transition.” UN Trade and Development analysis reveals ship transport costs may increase by 80%, with the broader maritime logistics costs (which would affect imports) potentially rising by 30%. For Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), already bearing the brunt of climate impacts they did little to cause, these increases threaten food security, economic development, and basic quality of life.

The framework’s projected revenue of $10-12 billion annually, while significant compared to other climate finance mechanisms, pales against the estimated trillion dollars of additional investment needed by 2050. Every dollar must work extraordinarily hard to serve both decarbonization and equity.

Why This Matters Beyond Shipping

The IMO framework is more than a shipping policy; it’s a test case for global climate governance in sectors operating beyond national boundaries. International shipping accounts for roughly 90% of global trade; how we decarbonize it will shape economic development pathways for decades.

Moreover, shipping’s transition challenge mirrors that of other transport sectors but with unique complications. A ship’s route is more than often unpredictable, following wherever cargo demands and therefore requiring fuel infrastructure in numerous global locations. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem: ship owners won’t invest in new fuel technologies without infrastructure, and infrastructure won’t materialize without demand.

The solution requires parallel progress on supply and demand. Countries with potential for renewable energy production (including many in Africa) could become major green fuel producers, but they face higher costs of capital and infrastructure deficits. Strategic deployment of Net-Zero Fund resources could help build this infrastructure while creating economic opportunities in regions that have historically been excluded from energy transition benefits.

What Adoption Must Deliver

When IMO member states gather in October, they must adopt a framework that explicitly commits to resolving these tensions. The adoption process should:

Affirm the dual mandate. Clearly restate that just and equitable transition is co-equal with emissions reduction, not subordinate to it.

Establish guardrails for guidelines. Provide clear direction that reward mechanisms must preserve adequate resources for vulnerable country support, that distribution boundaries must be interpreted to address shipping’s full climate impact, and that credit trading must include safeguards against perpetuating inequity.

Commit to transparent, inclusive guideline development. The negotiations beginning immediately after adoption must meaningfully include voices from SIDS, LDCs, and civil society organizations representing vulnerable communities, not just industry and major maritime nations.

Set review mechanisms that maintain ambition. Ensure that the 2032 revision of targets for 2036-2040 incorporates both updated climate science and assessments of just transition progress.

A Closing Reflection

The transition away from fossil fuels in shipping is inevitable. The only question is whether it will be orderly or chaotic, equitable or exploitative, a model for climate cooperation or another instance of the powerful protecting their interests while externalizing costs onto the vulnerable. The close of the extraordinary session of the MEPC proved that the IMO has sadly become vulnerable to political capture. The Net-Zero Framework, which had been approved by 64 countries in April with only 16 opposed, was deferred for one year despite having clear majority support. The process was reportedly bent to the will of certain influential actors through threats and intimidation, rather than genuine consensus-building.

The IMO Net-Zero Framework has been described as a “momentous achievement,” and in many ways it is. But achievements are measured by outcomes, not intentions. Without clear regulatory signals, the industry will continue to procrastinate on investments in zero-emission technologies. The deferral creates regulatory uncertainty that could delay the transition by years, making it even harder to meet 2030 and 2040 targets.

The deadline for submission of concrete proposals for such a regulation is December 5th, in order to be accepted to the thirteenth session of an IMO technical committee in February 2026, which addresses pollution prevention and response (PPR13).

“Black carbon is a climate superpollutant produced when fossil fuels are burned”, continued Prior. She further noted that it has a disproportionate impact because it both heats the atmosphere – and when released from ship exhausts near to the Arctic settles onto snow and ice, speeding up the melting and exposing darker land and sea beneath, which in turn absorbs more heat.

“This loss of the planet’s reflectivity – or albedo – is contributing to the fast pace of warming seen in the Arctic”, Prior commented.

Black carbon emissions from ships burning oil-based fuels have more than doubled in the last decade, yet a simple and easy solution is to require shipping to use widely available distillate fuels with lower black carbon emissions and new zero-emission fuels when operating in and near to the Arctic.

With advancements in battery technologies, power management systems, and automation, the all-electric ship concept is no longer futuristic but an evolving reality in global shipping and naval operations.

The growing emphasis on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from marine transport has been a major driver behind the increasing investment in all-electric ships. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions from ships by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. This has encouraged shipbuilders, operators, and technology providers to focus on electric propulsion, renewable energy integration, and energy storage solutions. Additionally, the reduction in maintenance costs and noise pollution makes electric ships highly desirable for both commercial and defense applications.

While aircraft emissions have long been in the ‘green consciousness’, maritime emissions have taken a back seat.
As Rory Stewart – co-presenter for podcast The Rest is Politics – says: “[Maritime emissions are] currently on track to grow very significantly because ships are powered off the very filthiest diesel.
“We applaud those driving efforts to strengthen the IMO framework and set more ambitious targets.
The IMO framework, once adopted, helps provide that confidence.","Ten years of net-zero negotiations have been sent spiralling. All thanks to Trump and his endless quest to diminish climate change.

While the maritime world had pretty much come together to adopt the International Maritime Organisation’s net-zero framework (enabling the shipping industry to work together on a clear pathway to a coherent future), one threatening post from Trump and it’s over for another 12 months.

IMO’s marine environment protection committee decided to push back on formally adopting its planned framework. About 63 IMO members who had voted ‘yes’ in April were expected to maintain their support for curbs on emissions, and others were expected to formally approve the framework. But on 17 October, IMO issued a statement (see it in full online) outlining its delaying position, after Trump’s post derailed what he called the ‘Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping’.

Key elements of the IMO Net-Zero Framework require ships to comply with a global fuel standard (reducing their annual greenhouse gas fuel intensity over time) and / or acquire remedial units to balance deficit emissions.

Trump’s view appears to centre around the pricing mechanism for non-compliant ships functioning as a ‘carbon tax’ and thus raising shipping costs by more than 10 per cent. His post was followed by threats to impose sanctions on countries that supported the agreement.

But, while countries may have crumbled under the US tactics, companies are vowing to push forward.

“It’s a political setback, but not a technical one,” says Neel Shah, CEO of Purifire Energy (which transforms wastewater into green hydrogen and bio-methanol). “Science and humanity’s needs don’t alter due to one person’s opinion.”

He says his company will continue to build because it believes the transition is both inevitable and necessary. “Every delay increases the risk of fragmentation and missed opportunities, but it also sharpens the focus of those committed to making this work.”

Why net-zero matters for the maritime sector

The Net Zero Framework had already been approved by members of the London-based IMO, a United Nations body, in April. It matters because around 80-90 per cent of global trade goes by sea. Shipping emissions account or about three per cent of global emissions. And the public’s waking up to it.

While aircraft emissions have long been in the ‘green consciousness’, maritime emissions have taken a back seat. But now they’re being thrust into the limelight and even being dissected on general interest shows.

As Rory Stewart – co-presenter for podcast The Rest is Politics – says: “[Maritime emissions are] currently on track to grow very significantly because ships are powered off the very filthiest diesel. All the good stuff is extracted for other things and all the filthiest stuff that’s left over goes into the ships.”

The industry – driven by the private sector – has been pushing for a long time for clarity (the framework) on what the future rules will be, so it can invest in the right ships, Stewart explains. A lot of things follow from this. As examples, he cites investments in engine design and fuel design, and infrastructure for where fuel is stored. A framework would help supply chains to be established.

“And what they really wanted, they said above all, was predictability so that they could make these investments . . . and not be left with stranded assets, not be left with ships that they’d bought that suddenly they weren’t allowed to sail around,” Stewart continues.

The proposed solution was a “classic industry-led model” with around 100 countries spending about ten years negotiating a process for phasing out polluting vessels. After a certain date, polluting vessels would pay into a fund, which would then be used to help smaller developing nations.

“And if you modernised and got your emissions down, all’s well and good.”

Trump’s post that changed everything

The decision to delay the framework’s adoption came a day after Trump posted: “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax.

“The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping.”

Washington later threatened to impose sanctions, visa restrictions, and port levies on countries that supported the deal.

“It was a real example of Trump’s arbitrary power, because what really swung it was not the US, Saudi and Russia . . . but the fact that he put pressure on small island states,” says Stewart.

“And we suddenly had Caribbean states saying, ‘I’m really sorry, but the US is a 400 pound gorilla and we can’t afford to defy them on this’.”

Industry reaction: frustration but resolve

A delay in regulation doesn’t mean a delay in action, notes Argent Energy, a UK producer of waste-based biodiesel with operations in the UK and Netherlands.

“The IMO’s efforts remain vital, but regulatory delays should not deter shipping companies from acting now. Solutions exist now. Companies can act now.

“The climate crisis isn’t waiting, and neither should we. No single country or interest group should hold back global progress.”

Industry needs to lead, not wait

Posnett advocates for momentum to continue and urges the industry to act in parallel.

“We applaud those driving efforts to strengthen the IMO framework and set more ambitious targets. In the meantime, we’ll keep providing fuel for shipping companies who want to lead, not wait.”

Fuel innovation continues despite politics

Shah and Posnett are not the only industry voices speaking out about moving forward.

“We are disappointed that member states have not been able to agree a way forward at this meeting,” says Thomas Kazakos, International Chamber of Shipping secretary general. “Industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonise the maritime sector, in line with the goals set out in the IMO GHG strategy.

“As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry.”

Maritime innovation to continue pushing towards net-zero

While, Shah is disappointed with the delay, he’s confident innovation will continue.

He believes that the timelines may move again, but says: “The world doesn’t need a framework to know the mission brief. We are seeing a growing demand for sustainable fuels and government backing, especially in the UK and Europe. The best way to prevent further delay is to demonstrate that the solutions we need already exist, work, and are ready to be scaled.

“The more evidence we provide, the harder it becomes to justify inaction.

“Those who have been around the longest and possess extensive legacy infrastructure and revenue streams may see this as breathing space. Still, most will recognise that clarity, rather than delay, provides the confidence businesses need to invest.

Decisive policies will surge ahead with investment frameworks

“The companies leading the transition are already moving quickly. They understand that being off the hook today could mean becoming irrelevant tomorrow, as regions like Europe and Asia push ahead with more decisive policies and investment frameworks.”

The biggest issue for company’s like Shah’s is not technical; it’s about balancing scale with trust. “We know how to convert wastewater into methanol and hydrogen.

“However, building the infrastructure to do so at scale relies on more than just engineering; it depends on gaining confidence from partners, investors, and regulators that this is a viable path. The IMO framework, once adopted, helps provide that confidence. It establishes a shared direction that the entire sector can rally around.

“The main challenges are uncertainty and inconsistency in funding. Technologies are advancing, and interest is there. However, without clear and consistent signals, both regulatory and commercial, it’s hard to justify scaled-up investment. You can’t simply fix this with regulation. We need to fund innovation projects, demonstrate alternative fuel pathways, and ensure the data is independently verified. That’s the work we’re concentrating on at the moment.

“The current political uncertainty is just one obstacle in a larger transition; the shift towards alternative fuels is unavoidable, and we will continue to strive for that outcome, regardless of short-term political changes. ”

Calls for clarity from global shipping bodies

A UN spokesperson says that secretary-general António Guterres views the outcome as “a missed opportunity for member states to place the shipping sector on a clear, credible path towards net-zero emissions.”

He stresses that decarbonising the maritime sector – responsible for about 80 per cent of global trade – “is critical.”

Marco Rubio, US secretary of state, told media that the delay was a great triumph for American diplomacy. But Stewart disagrees.

“It’s a triumph for American brute force.

“You could argue that’s a triumph for diplomacy, if you want, but I think it’s the brute force that we should be pretty worried about.”

Despite the odious setback, companies such as Argent Energy and Purifire Energy continue investing in cleaner fuels and propulsion technologies. As Dickon Posnett puts it: “The climate crisis isn’t waiting, and neither should we.” Whether or not the IMO framework moves forward in 2026, industry leaders seem determined to chart their own course toward net-zero.",https://marineindustrynews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Panama-Canal-shipping.png,N,,2025-10-31 12:01:25.699252

Amid the uncertainties surrounding the net zero framework of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the fate of developing maritime nations, the Alumni of Maritime Academy of Nigeria, Oron (AMANO), has dedicated its upcoming 2025 Convention to addressing issues in green shipping and sustainability.

The President of AMANO, Mr. Emmanuel Maiguwa, disclosed this while addressing journalists in Lagos on Wednesday on the upcoming convention slated for November 11th to 13th at the Maritime Academy in Oron, Akwa Ibom State.

Recall that the IMO postponed the formal adoption of its Net Zero Framework by one year after a close vote in October 2025, pushing the decision to 2026.

Themed “Greening the National Blue Economy: Collaboration Towards Sustainable Sea, Shipping, and Maritime Education,” the three-day AMANO 2025 Convention will gather maritime stakeholders, policymakers, professionals, and academics to drive dialogue on sustainability and green growth within Nigeria’s maritime ecosystem.

According to Maiguwa, the convention goes beyond being a reunion to becoming a platform for policy alignment and innovation, reflecting AMANO’s commitment to sustainable maritime development. He said the theme aligns with the IMO’s 2025 global agenda and reinforces AMANO’s support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Nigeria’s Blue Economy initiatives.

He emphasized that this year’s focus highlights environmental stewardship, technological modernization, and collaboration as vital pillars for a resilient maritime industry capable of balancing economic growth with ecological preservation. The forum, he added, will explore modern shipping practices, decarbonization, and capacity-building strategies for a low-emission maritime future.

Commending the Maritime Academy of Nigeria for its “massive infrastructural and technological transformation,” Maiguwa noted that MAN Oron now ranks among the most advanced maritime training centers in West and Central Africa. He said the convention will provide an avenue to review the Academy’s milestones and foster stronger partnerships that link education with industry needs.

Meanwhile, the Chairman of the 2025 AMANO Convention Planning Committee, Mr. Agassi Jonathan Peter, said the event will feature keynote presentations, technical sessions, exhibitions, and networking opportunities.

He said a major highlight will be the joint session with the graduation ceremony of the Academy’s 2025 cadet class – a first-of-its-kind collaboration aimed at bridging academia and industry.

“This engagement will connect cadets directly with potential employers, ensuring that maritime training aligns with evolving global standards,” he said, adding that the forum is open to shipowners, operators, terminal managers, logistics firms, regulators, and other maritime stakeholders.",https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG-20251031-WA0003.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 03:56:08.975332

There is also the need to comply with increasingly stringent safety regulations on both conventional and alternative marine fuels.","Marine fuels testing company VPS on Thursday (30 October) released a statement on how the recent MEPC decision may impact the drive towards regional regulations, with the EU ETS poised to potentially become the leading model of an emissions trading scheme:

The decision made during the MEPC meeting in October 2025 to delay the IMO’s Net Zero Framework, by one year, has caused waves across the shipping industry, generating opinions and comments from many industry stakeholders. As a consequence of this decision, it is ever more likely that it will give rise to more regional legislation and Emission Trading Schemes (ETS), which may come to the fore as a substitute for the delayed global IMO Net Zero Framework.

With this in mind, the EU ETS, which was originally deemed a transitional legislation, may now become much more relevant as a leading example of an ETS, for other regions to follow.

Whilst so much focus has been placed on the latest MEPC decision and what impact it may have upon global shipping’s decarbonization efforts, it seems many may have missed further important developments within the EU, under FuelEU and ETS.

On 8 October 2025, the European Commission released its Guidelines for Reporting and Verification of Actual Methane Slip Factors. For the first time, shipowners can replace conservative default methane values with measured data, verified in accordance with IMO Resolution MEPC.402(83).

The current FuelEU default tables cover CO₂ only. They do not include methane slip (CH₄) or nitrous oxide (N₂O) factors for most new, or renewable fuels, such as:

Bio- and e-methanol

Ammonia

Hydrogen and other RFNBOs

Dual-fuel engines (where N₂O formation can be significant)

This means that without measured data, these fuels are not yet fully creditable or verifiable under FuelEU or ETS. In practice, this could lead to under- or over-reporting of GHG intensity and exposure to higher emissions costs.

However, there is a solution, as the IMO MEPC.402(83) defines how to measure both methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) onboard, whilst the EU Guidelines (Oct 2025) define how to report verified CH₄ factors under FuelEU, with N₂O procedures expected soon. The technology to continuously measure and verify, CH4, CO2 and N2O, already exists. VPS Emsys can undertake these tasks and correlate these gaseous emissions with engine load, automatically building a verifier-ready Methane File.

It is so important for shipowners and operators to act now as from 2025, voyages which will fall under the EU ETS 2026 cycle, will see all combustion-related GHGs, (CH4, CO2 and N2O), priced and verified. At present FuelEU does not provide any default methane or nitrous oxide factors for new fuels, yet only measured values can truly provide accurate GHG accounting and lower ETS exposure.

VPS EMSYS provides the measurement framework today, fully aligned with IMO 402(83) and future- proofed for upcoming FuelEU verification. The framework is here. The tools exist. What remains is to measure now.

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Choong Sheen Mao, Chief Operating Officer, Equatorial Marine Fuel Management Services (Equatorial), speaks to bunkering publication Manifold Times about the challenges of a post IMO 2020 bunker supplier.

MT: How does Equatorial continue to offer customer assurance and maintenance of marine fuel quality to ISO8217 standards despite increasing complexity of bunker fuel blends?

We maintain our focus to provide compliant, quality and competitively priced products to our customers. There is no shortcut. We source our products from a wide range of cargo producers and suppliers. We continue to be strict and vigilant with our testing programme for our products before delivering them to our customers. Equatorial has deepened our engagement with the wider industry to have a better and up-to-date understanding of the existing and new marine fuels.

MT: Can you share the evolution of commercial marine fuel procurement, blending and trading strategies on the back of increasing fuel types (pre/post IMO 2020)?

Pre IMO 2020, the main types of marine fuel procured and consumed by vessels were high-sulphur fuel oil, marine diesel oil and marine gas oil. Trading strategies were therefore closely linked to that within the oil industry.

However, many of the new fuel types are from other industries. For example, biofuels, methanol and ammonia are mainly products from the chemical and agriculture industries. There are marked differences between these industries and the energy industry (in particular, the marine fuels industry). LNG is from the gas industry which is distinct from the oil industry.

Without an existing liquid paper market for many of these commodities (especially as a marine fuel), the price risk management is less straightforward. Furthermore, commodity prices are no longer the sole consideration for price itself. The price of compliance must be considered. This could range from guaranteeing the origin of the marine fuel, its sulphur properties as well as its carbon intensity. The list goes on.

MT: Operational wise, what are the changing role and responsibilities of a bunker supplier to date, compared to before IMO 2020?

The role and responsibility of a bunker supplier have evolved. Fundamentally, it has been about providing quality marine fuels at competitive prices. Quantity assurance has been a critical concern which led to the mandatory implementation of the mass flow meter system for bunkering in the Port of Singapore. Interestingly, due to the nature of credit terms in the bunker industry, bunker suppliers also performed the role of “bankers” by extending favourable credit terms to shipowners and charterers.

These days, post IMO 2020, things have become even more complicated. Today, a bunker supplier retains the abovementioned roles and responsibilities, and much more – it has to ensure compliance with a plethora of rules and regulations. Compliance not only with sulphur cap requirements, but with international and regional sanctions and restrictions unrelated to the quality of the marine fuel itself. In fact, especially with alternative low- and zero-carbon marine fuels, this means compliance with standards, rules and regulations on sustainability such as the European Renewable Energy Directive and/or International Sustainability and Carbon Certification. There is also the need to comply with increasingly stringent safety regulations on both conventional and alternative marine fuels.

In addition to the above, a post IMO 2020 bunker supplier is still expected to supply compliant and quality fuel at competitive prices.

MT: Equatorial is Singapore’s largest local-born supplier; what is the next big thing for the company?

Equatorial continues to adapt and improve with the times, while maintaining its core values – Integrity, Teamwork, Commitment, Proficiency and Quality, and Safety and Environment. The bunker industry is a highly competitive one, and it is our intention to keep our competitive edge and remain relevant. This means that we have had to step out of our comfort zone and embrace the two mega trends of our time – digitalisation and decarbonisation.

We have been early adopters and developers of the electronic bunkering note as part of our own digital bunkering efforts. We have diversified our product offering to include low carbon marine fuels and are proud to be one of the pioneers for bunkering B100 biofuels earlier this year. This was made possible by the arrival of our IMO Type II chemical and oil bunker tankers. These same bunker tankers are also capable for carrying and delivering methanol. Equatorial has invested in an LNG bunkering vessel (LBV) newbuilding that is set to be delivered in Q3 2027. We are also involved in a study to develop low- or zero-carbon ammonia bunkering in Singapore.

These are exciting times.

In addition to the above, a post IMO 2020 bunker supplier is still expected to supply compliant and quality fuel at competitive prices.

MT: Equatorial is Singapore’s largest local-born supplier; what is the next big thing for the company?

Equatorial continues to adapt and improve with the times, while maintaining its core values – Integrity, Teamwork, Commitment, Proficiency and Quality, and Safety and Environment. The bunker industry is a highly competitive one, and it is our intention to keep our competitive edge and remain relevant. This means that we have had to step out of our comfort zone and embrace the two mega trends of our time – digitalisation and decarbonisation.

We have been early adopters and developers of the electronic bunkering note as part of our own digital bunkering efforts. We have diversified our product offering to include low carbon marine fuels and are proud to be one of the pioneers for bunkering B100 biofuels earlier this year. This was made possible by the arrival of our IMO Type II chemical and oil bunker tankers. These same bunker tankers are also capable for carrying and delivering methanol. Equatorial has invested in an LNG bunkering vessel (LBV) newbuilding that is set to be delivered in Q3 2027. We are also involved in a study to develop low- or zero-carbon ammonia bunkering in Singapore.

These are exciting times.

Dr Lim Kang Hui, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of CRecTech, shared with Singapore-based bunkering publication Manifold Times its progress since winning second place in PIER71 Smart Port Challenge 2023 and its drive to solving the low supply and high price tag of renewable methanol:

MT: Could you introduce to our readers the brains behind CRecTech and what they aspire to achieve in the maritime industry?

CRecTech was co-founded by me, as CEO, and Dr. Haw Kok Giap, as CTO. Both of us come from strong backgrounds in material science, catalysis, and chemical engineering research at the National University of Singapore. What unites us is a shared belief that the research we do should directly serve society. At CRecTech, we turn waste into worth, transforming agricultural and industrial biogas into renewable methanol that can power ships sustainably. Our aspiration is to make green fuels affordable and scalable, so the maritime industry can achieve its decarbonisation targets without compromising on cost or reliability.

MT: What is the CRecREF catalyst and how is it different from anything in the market to produce methanol?

The CRecREFTM catalyst is at the heart of our technology. Traditional biogas-to-methanol processes usually involve four separate steps, requiring high temperatures, complex equipment, and significant energy input. Our catalyst streamlines this into just two steps, directly converting two greenhouse gases, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), from waste biogas into methanol in a more efficient way. This breakthrough simplifies plant design, cuts production costs by up to 50%, making renewable methanol affordable. To our knowledge, no other catalyst system in the market achieves this degree of process intensification with such versatility and stability.

MT: How will the CRecREF catalyst help in solving one of maritime industry’s predicaments: limited supply of green methanol and making it more affordable? Do you think the technology will be the key to wide scale use of green methanol in the maritime industry?

By leveraging our catalytic technology, we can deploy decentralised, containerised units directly at waste biomass and biogas sources, whether it is at agricultural sites, landfills or animal farms, etc. Our units are expected to operate at relatively small scales that are nevertheless profitable with our process, whereas conventional methods would only be viable at much larger, centralised scales to capture economies of scale. As such, our technology eliminates costly feedstock transport, expands supply, and crucially unlocks waste streams that were previously uneconomical or technically impossible to convert into methanol, thereby opening up entirely new sources of affordable green methanol for the maritime industry.

MT: Since receiving a grant from Breakthrough Energy Fellows – a programme that rewards up to USD 500,000 in R&D funding in 2023, what has been the progress on the company’s methanol initiative and what are the company’s plans for the rest of the year and next year?

The Breakthrough Energy Fellows – Southeast Asia programme, which we joined in 2024, has enabled us to scale our technology more than 1,000 times beyond lab systems while de-risking the scale-up process. It has also positioned us to engage strategic partners, including regional biomass players and shipping companies such as Hudson Shipping Lines, to advance green methanol adoption. For the rest of this year, we are focused on finalising engineering designs and preparing for our first pilot deployment in Malaysia or Indonesia with local waste biomass/biogas producer. Looking ahead to next year, our goal is to commission a containerised pilot demonstration unit capable of producing up to 1,000 metric tonnes (mt) per year, paving the way for commercial adoption by 2028.

MT: How has PIER71TM support CRecTech?

PIER71TM has been one of our earliest and strongest champions. Through the Smart Port Challenge in 2023, we gained access to maritime mentors, veterans, and shipping companies, which was invaluable for refining our business model and testing our assumptions against real market needs. PIER71TM, and MPA, also gave us visibility within Singapore’s maritime innovation ecosystem and connections to corporates and regulators critical for scaling green fuel solutions. As a Smart Port Challenge finalist, we continue to benefit from incubation support, co-working space, and close interactions with fellow innovators driving maritime decarbonisation.

The International Bunkering Industry Association (IBIA) will be hosting its flagship Annual Convention in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Convention Exhibition & Convention Centre between 18 to 20 November 2025, as part of Hong Kong Maritime Week.

Captain Rahul Choudhuri, IBIA Board Member & IBIA Asia Regional Board Chair, and President of Strategic Partnerships at VPS, sat down with bunkering publication Manifold Times to offer his take on future challenges of the marine fuels sector.

MT: Heading into IMO 2030, what are the challenges of maintaining bunker fuel quality for safety despite an increasing array of alternative marine fuels? Is the ISO 8217 marine fuel standard enough for end users?

The shipping industry, with 20% of users still on the outdated & withdrawn ISO 8217:2005 edition, is certainly ‘change-averse’. Bunker buyers want a cheaper product [e.g. ISO 8217:2005] but they also need to be aware this is a poorer quality product line.

This slow adoption means the benefits of the new and much improved ISO 8217:2024, which also addresses biofuels for the first time, are not being realised. It’s like a dilemma and a curse and if every new version of an ISO 8217 standard, which is supposed to improve quality and safety, is not really going to be used ultimately the shipping industry will have to pay the price.

And the worst nightmare is when the ship faces engine damage, loses propulsion, stops in midocean and is drifting for several days. This is still happening today and poses a very high safety of life risk.

Another part of ISO 8217 development is that because of the way it is conducted, there are many countries representation involved with necessary compromises when the standard is finally completed.

For example, the latest ISO 8217:2024 standard does not consider biofuel issues such as microbial activity, cold flow, stability, chemical contamination etc.

In contrast, the new Biofuels Standard in Singapore TR140 launched early this year is more comprehensive & covers Biofuels quality more holistically, including future new feedstocks.

To address risks not covered by standard tests, VPS launched the Additional Protection Service for Biofuels testing(APS-BIO) three years ago. This service provides additional protection by testing for a wider range of issues in biofuels, aiming to provide a comprehensive quality control of biofuels that are used for shipping.

MT: Have marine fuel testing labs been able to catch up with risk management of bunker consumption in relation to the evolution of changing bio feedstocks?

Acknowledging the slow adoption of latest ISO 8217 marine fuel standards, VPS has developed a risk management plan for shipowners consuming biofuel bunkers by testing for additional parameters covering Energy Content, Renewable Content, Stability, Cold-Flow Properties, Corrosivity, Microbial Activity & Chemical Contamination. This is part of the APS-BIO package mentioned earlier.

There’s a lot of work that VPS has done in understanding new types of bio feed stock. For example, Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL) is now a ‘hot topic’ in certain regions, and we know this is a sustainable feedstock which in principle can benefit the circular economy.

Based on our experience, some CNSL blends have been used without any issues while others have caused engine damage problems, like fuel sludging, injector failure, filter clogging, etc.

So, there is a need for risk management here in how you use such biofuels. What is important is to take proactive measures and do the necessary tests including by blending them into small portions while submitting samples to the lab. More advanced tests like the Fuel Combustion Analyser can be a useful tool as well.

Interestingly, certain blends of CNSL show better ignition & combustion characteristics when blended with Marine Gas Oil (MGO) and Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) when compared to Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). This is an example of the benefit by employing risk management and understanding the types of biofuels consumed.

MT: Has the role and challenges of the bunker surveyor changed in the era of MFM, digitalisation and zero carbon/green fuels?

When we look at bunker survey, it is essentially a subset of marine surveying that has been there since the advent of shipping. The primary role of a surveyor is really based on ‘trust but verify’ and that concept is what the surveyor is doing whether it is in bunkering or marine surveying or cargo inspection – so that is here to stay.

But in the context of MFM, the role is changing and for example the surveyor needs to now ensure compliance to ISO 22192 [Bunkering of marine fuel using the Coriolis MFM system] so there is a technologist direction that surveyors need to adopt as well.

The role of the bunker surveyor will be even more important with future alternative marine fuels (such as Methanol) where the level of safety is higher. The types of measurement & sampling are different so in a way the surveyor is moving up the value chain and that must be managed in the industry with proper training etc., and I think those that succeed will be at the forefront of future surveying.

For example, about two years ago there was a methanol bunker delivery in Singapore. VPS was appointed by not only the shipowner but also the product owner. One must be aware that when you do complex fuels like methanol, other parties who operate on a different mindset want to be involved and are interested in this type of product surveying control.

MT: Moving forward, can you forecast the changing role of bunker fuel testing labs past (pre-IMO 2020) and present leading into IMO 2030?

There are several formal studies done which shows the best-case scenario up to 2050 still includes about 50% fossil fuel for global consumption with the rest being taken up with renewable and green fuels. That’s the best case.

I think fossil fuels are here to stay for some time and managing these will continue to be key work for laboratories and testing agencies. Issues such as high Al+Si (Catfines) are not only going away but increasing, and this means better operational control of purification systems onboard vessels.

From a lab point of view, future fuels offer an opportunity to value add at a different level as they are a much more complex and high-end type of products. Those laboratories who are willing to invest and take up positions in these new future marine fuels really will be the winners of tomorrow.

Published: 8 October 2025

In an exclusive interview with Singapore-based bunkering publication Manifold Times, marine fuel logistics firm Banle Group recently shared insights on the recent 1H 2025 interim financial results of listing vehicle CBL International Limited (Nasdaq: BANL).

Dr Teck Lim Chia, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, elaborated on the company’s diversification of its customer base, factors driving its biofuel sales to surge 154.7% year-on-year in 1H2025, plans on future marine fuels, and future investments:

MT: With sales volume increasing by almost 10%, which shipping industries have been most keen to work with CBL and why is this so?

The increase in sales volume was mainly driven by network expansion, new customer acquisitions, and expansion toward the non-container liner and biofuel segments.

CBL has been actively targeting new customers, including mid-tier shipowners and tankers.

This strategic effort has diversified our customer base beyond container liners to include bulk carriers and oil tankers.

We have been in the industry for long period of time and have weathered various market cycles alongside our clients, building mutual trust through shared experience.

We deliver professional one-stop services, including the bunkering of conventional fuels and biofuels, at reasonable pricing and excellent creditability. This is why we are expanding our customer base continuously, including container liners and non-container liners. Our customer concentration is also coming down continuously.

Shipping companies, which are biofuel early adopters, seeking to comply with increasingly stringent environmental regulations have favored us. The surge in our biofuel sales indicates strong uptake from environmentally conscious carriers subject to IMO and EU FuelEU Maritime regulations.

MT: What factors in the market allowed CBL to introduce a triple-digit growth to its biofuels operation while narrowing net loss by 40% in 1H 2025?

On biofuel:

The implementation of IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) regulations and EU FuelEU Maritime regulations (effective January 2025) has accelerated demand for sustainable marine fuels. These regulations compel shipping companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or face penalties, creating immediate market demand for biofuels.

CBL’s early certification (ISCC EU and ISCC Plus) positioned us as a early mover in the sustainable marine fuels space. The successful B24 biofuel deliveries in Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and multiple ports in China, have demonstrated our ability to arrange for such services to meet the surging demand from our customers.

Leveraging its early move into sustainable fuels, CBL is expanding its biofuel supply chain and exploring LNG and methanol, positioning itself to capture growth while helping customers meet tightening decarbonization targets across Asia Pacific, Europe, and other key markets.

The carbon emission requirement is the key tune for shipping. As the FuelEU regulations have been implemented since 2025, we expect more ships will use renewable fuel. The marine fuel in the next five years will be very different from those we are using today. CBL is taking a leading approach to adopt the new fuel. The growth of the biofuel will continue, inline of the global demand. We will push CBL staying ahead of this.

On narrowing net loss:

The 38.8% improvement in our bottom line for the first half of 2025 reflects the results of the strategic efforts and resources we have invested over the past few years to expand our port network, grow our customer base, and develop our biofuel operations over the past years.

We are now beginning to reap the benefits of these investments. As a result, we achieved double-digit sales volume growth in both fiscal year 2024 and the first half of 2025. We successfully onboarded new customers and reduced our dependency on our top five clients. Notably, our biofuel segment has continued to deliver strong growth over the past 12 months.

In addition, in the first half of 2025, we streamlined our operations to enhance efficiency, resulting in a 17% reduction in operating expenses.

Going forward, we remain committed to identifying new investment opportunities to further expand our network, with a particular focus on the sustainable fuels segment. In fact, we have adopted a more strategic approach aimed at optimizing profitability.

MT: CBL newly shared an initiative to explore, and possibility include LNG and methanol in its marine fuels portfolio; why is the company doing this and what type of partners are CBL looking to cooperate with?

For us, the biofuel story is just the opening chapter. Right now, we’re deeply entrenched in scaling our biofuel operations.

We’ve got B24 rolling out successfully in key hubs like Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and China, and the demand is surging. We’re talking about 155% revenue growth in this segment, just in the first half of the year. But we see this is only the foundation.

So, how are we preparing for what’s next? It’s a three-part strategy.

First, we’re building on our biofuel foundation. We’re not just selling a product; we’re building a certified, compliant supply chain. Our ISCC certifications are like our passport into the future fuel,—they give us and our customers the trust, and verification needed, to navigate through, strict regulations like EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime.

Second, we’re actively exploring the next generation of fuels. Biofuels are a fantastic drop-in solution for today, but we know the market is looking at LNG, methanol, ammonia and more.

We’re already in the early stages of building partnerships, and understanding the supply chains for these fuels. We’re positioning ourselves, to be the partner, that can guide our customers, through this entire journey. From traditional fuel to biofuels, and eventually to whatever the next big thing might be.

Finally, and most importantly, we’re building trust and reliability. This transition isn’t just about having the right product; it’s about having the operational expertise, the digital systems for tracking and compliance, and the financial flexibility to make it all work.

Our expanding network of over 65 ports isn’t just for today’s business—it’s the physical backbone, that will allow us to distribute these new sustainable fuels, whenever and wherever, our customers need them tomorrow.

We are also regularly exploring investments opportunities, into vertical and horizontal supply chain integration.

So, in short, we’re in the process of building a business that is agile, certified, and customer-focused—ready to pivot and scale when the technology and regulations evolve. We’re not just preparing for today’s transition; we’re preparing for tomorrow.

MT: In addition to decarbonisation, the maritime industry has also been adopting digitalisation practises. How has CBL adopted digitalisation into its business operations and what the benefits of doing so?Yes, the bunker trading sector is rapidly embracing digitalisation to enhance efficiency, transparency, and compliance. Integrated platforms now offer end-to-end management of bunkering operations—from procurement and real-time pricing to emissions tracking and documentation. We have explored various software solutions available in the market, but none have been specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of the bunkering facilitation industry. As a result, we began developing our own proprietary system about a year ago.

To date, we have successfully built a management system that supports our daily operations. Looking ahead, we are committed to further enhancing this platform by integrating artificial intelligence — including machine learning — to empower our sales team and management with faster, more informed decision-making capabilities.

CBL’s Digital Transformation Initiatives to integrate with AI:

Real-Time Order Tracking & Analytics:Implement advanced systems for live monitoring of fuel deliveries, quality assurance, and automated reporting, reducing operational delays and enhancing customer trust.

IT tools for Risk Management:Optimize credit risk assessment, cashflow forecast, fraud detection, and supply-demand matching, lowering financial exposures and improving margin stability.

Back-End System Upgrades:Modernize CRM platforms to streamline workflows, automate invoicing/payment processes, and centralize data for faster decision-making.

CBL’s digital adoption strengthens its competitive edge through agility, accuracy, and alignment with industry-wide shifts toward data-driven bunkering.

Further digitalisation will help companies to increase their operating efficiency and we believe that this will be a key determinant in tomorrow’s competitive landscape.

We are also exploring digital tools that enable real-time carbon footprint tracking and compliance reporting for EU ETS/IMO CII, aligning biofuel sales with customer decarbonisation goals.

MT: With cash balance of USD 5.43 million, what are CBL’s plans for this sum of money to support growth?

The majority of capital will be allocated to working capital, ensuring operational stability and supporting increased sales volume without liquidity constraints. A portion will also scale our B24 biofuel operations and secure an ISCC-certified supplier network to capitalize on demand driven by EU ETS, IMO CII, and FuelEU Maritime regulations.

Supported by substantial banking facilities, we maintain a strong liquidity position to meet current obligations and fund future growth. Furthermore, as a Nasdaq-listed company, we have access to capital markets to finance strategic initiatives, including potential mergers and acquisitions for vertical or horizontal integration within the sustainable fuels supply chain.

This disciplined capital allocation strategy reinforces both our immediate operational resilience and long-term strategic objectives, ensuring CBL remains agile and competitive in a dynamic market.

We fully support the IMO’s goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. But ambition must match reality. A successful transition must be globally enforceable, operationally practical, and economically fair, not fragmented across regions or policies.

Recent delays in the IMO’s Net Zero Framework timeline should not be seen as a setback. They create space for solutions that cut emissions now while strengthening business performance. Speed optimisation, data harmonisation, and smarter voyage management already deliver proven environmental and commercial results. These are not interim measures; they are strategic steps forward.

BIMCO represents two-thirds of the world’s deadweight tonnage, spanning every shipping segment. We will continue to provide technical and operational expertise to governments and regulators, and to help our members understand and apply new rules.

We act quickly where trade and regulation intersect. In response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese-built ships, we issued a USTR clause to clarify risk and responsibility in charter parties. We are now drafting a similar clause addressing new Chinese port fees for U.S. vessels. Our goal: keep global trade moving with clarity and confidence.

Shipping faces growing geopolitical and regulatory pressure, but the path forward is clear. By staying united, disciplined, and pragmatic, we can build a competitive, resilient, and sustainable maritime future.

Let us now jump to another subject: EU sanctions against Russia.
The first three sanctions packages were enacted back in February 2022 while the last one, the 19th sanction package, was enacted by the EU in September 2025.
19packages in 44 months – that is a sanction package every two months with no sign of these sanctions having any effect on Russia.
Now why deal with this failed attempt to agree on a strongly EU-flavoured NZF and these inefficient sanction packages in the same column?","Pierre Aury on how little the world listens to Brussels.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) just postponed by one year its vote on the final version of the rules to deal with the decarbonisation of shipping, rules referred to as the Net Zero Framework (NZF).

Although we are flabbergasted that this postponement was obtained through, among other things, threats of sanctions against countries voting in favour as well as threats to their representatives as individuals, we can not be happy about the postponement itself. There are no technologies nor zero carbon fuels deployable at scale quickly enough to achieve shipping decarbonisation so de facto this proposed NZF is in fact just a tax on shipping. Sorry, but Donald Trump is right on that point.

Moreover, some of the proposed fuels are either extremely dangerous, like ammonia at even a very low concentration in the air or highly corrosive, like methanol. A recent trial saw the need to change injectors two or three times more often with methanol than with HFO with a very high pilot fuel consumption, especially at low engine loads.

According to a recent Lloyd’s Register report, nuclear, if a theoretically viable option, is facing too many hurdles like public acceptance, the creation of a new worldwide legal framework or how to deal with waste disposal to have any chance to be deployed on time to help meet the NZF targets.

Let us not forget the scale of the task ahead of us to decarbonise shipping: 100,000 ships carrying 12bn tons of cargoes a year. Such a task cannot be efficiently dealt with by a knee-jerk reaction like the one of an IMO being under pressure from the European Union to deliver a very strict plan to decarbonise shipping and do so quickly and do so using the same highly complex approach, which requires a PhD in mathematics to start to vaguely understand how it is supposed to work.

Let us now jump to another subject: EU sanctions against Russia. The first three sanctions packages were enacted back in February 2022 while the last one, the 19th sanction package, was enacted by the EU in September 2025. 19 packages and counting. 19packages in 44 months – that is a sanction package every two months with no sign of these sanctions having any effect on Russia.

Yes, Donald Trump pledged to end the war within his first 24 hours in office. He moved into office on January 20 this year, so nine months into his second term, the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv is still grinding on with no sign of being near an end. But it seems that the EU and the US are less and less aligned, with the US even contemplating opening a tunnel between Siberia and Alaska, while clearly the EU is spending a lot of money to prepare for war with Russia within the coming five years.

Now why deal with this failed attempt to agree on a strongly EU-flavoured NZF and these inefficient sanction packages in the same column? Because we think that these two subjects are just the two sides of the same coin. That same coin is that the world doesn’t care about the EU anymore.

For once, we will end our column on a constructive note: given the urgency, why doesn’t the IMO replace this impossible-to-understand NZF with a simple CO2 tax payable at the time of bunkering, with the proceeds to be used to fund research on new technologies to suppress shipping CO2 emissions?",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Levy.jpeg,N,,2025-10-31 03:56:57.187296

The technology promises to revolutionize maritime transport and accelerate the energy transition.

According to ESG News portal and official statement from Japan Engine Corporation, Japan achieved a historic milestone in the search for decarbonisation global: the first worldwide test of a marine engine hydrogen in land.

The operation, conducted by a consortium formed by the companies Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Yanmar Power Solutions e Japan Engine Corporation, validated the stable operation of hydrogen-powered marine engines in a land-based environment — something unprecedented in the world.

Initial results from testing in Japan

The project aims to accelerate the sector's transition to naval transport towards cleaner energy sources, aligning with Japan's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

During the demonstration, the consortium used a system of liquid hydrogen supply developed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, capable of supplying fuel at different pressures for multiple engine types.

The test was conducted at the facilities of Japan Engine Corporation, where four-stroke marine engines operated stably and safely using only hydrogen, proving the technical viability of the system.

In addition, the project uses configuration. dual-fuel, which means the engine can switch between hydrogen e marine dieselThis solution is strategic because it allows the adoption of the new fuel without compromising the operational reliability of ships, something essential for safety in ocean transport.

According to data from the report released by the consortium, the operation was completed without incident, confirming that the Marine hydrogen engine on land It's ready for the next stage: use on real ships.

Why is hydrogen crucial for marine decarbonization?

Maritime transport is responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

This percentage may seem small, but it represents approximately 1 billion tons of CO₂ per year, issued by more than 50 vessels that cross the oceans, transporting 80% of world trade.

With increasing pressure from the IMO to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the sector is seeking alternatives to diesel and bunker fuel—highly polluting fuels. In this scenario, the hydrogen It emerges as one of the most promising solutions, mainly because it does not emit carbon dioxide during combustion and offers high energy density when compressed or liquefied.

The success of the Japanese test proves that The technology is mature enough to enter the practical application phase., serving as a model for other countries that wish to decarbonize their commercial fleets.

The strategic role of the Japanese government in innovation.

The project is part of the initiatives supported by Green Innovation Fund, managed by New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and supervised by Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI).

This fund has approximately 2 trillion pounds (US$13 billion) intended for technologies of decarbonisation and energy transition — including fuel cells, green ammonia, and hydrogen engines.

O JapanBrazil, historically dependent on energy imports, sees hydrogen as a long-term strategic solution to ensure energy security and industrial leadership.

Investing in applied research, such as this Testing a hydrogen-powered marine engine on land.This reinforces the country's commitment to a sustainable and competitive future, especially in the naval sector, where it is already recognized for its advanced engineering.

Technical challenges and next steps for the Japan project.

Despite the success, the road to commercial adoption is still long. The main technical challenges involve... safe storage of liquid hydrogen, port supply infrastructure and adaptation of existing vessels to operate with the new fuel.

Marine engines require thermal control and high pressures to maintain efficiency. Furthermore, Handling hydrogen requires cryogenic materials and complex ventilation and safety systems.Even so, the Japanese consortium plans to carry out the first onboard test in the coming years, equipping an experimental vessel with the land-based dual-fuel engine.

This will be the real game-changer for hydrogen-powered naval transport.This will demonstrate the technology's performance under real-world operating conditions — temperature, vibration, load, and sea air — which are key factors for international certification.

Global impacts on shipping and the maritime industry

The development of Marine hydrogen engine on land In Japan, it goes far beyond technological innovation: it represents a structural change in the sector of naval transport.

The decision came in response to threats of sanctions from the United States, which warned of tariffs, visa restrictions, and port levies against countries supporting the measure.

The IMO has been laying the foundation for climate action in shipping for years. In 2023, it adopted a revised Greenhouse Gas Strategy, setting a goal to reduce net emissions from international shipping by 20 percent by 2030, and to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by around 2050. Building on this, in April 2025, the IMO approved draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, introducing a new Chapter 5 that would establish the Net Zero Framework (NZF).

During the October extraordinary session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee, member states were expected to vote on formally adopting the NZF. However, President Trump publicly urged members to reject the proposal, threatening punitive measures against supporting nations. In response, Saudi Arabia moved to adjourn the session until October 2026, and several countries that previously backed the framework either abstained or reversed their positions. Notably, Greece and Cyprus, both EU members with major shipping fleets, abstained. China, the world’s largest shipbuilder, shifted from supporting the framework in April to voting for the delay.

If adopted, the NZF would have marked a historic milestone by introducing the first global carbon pricing system for maritime transport. It proposed a tiered fee structure based on greenhouse gas emissions: ships failing to meet the baseline target would incur a higher fee of $380 per metric ton of CO₂-equivalent, while those exceeding the compliance threshold would pay a reduced fee of $100 per metric tonne.

Vessels adopting cleaner technologies and fuels would be eligible for financial incentives, encouraging innovation and early adoption.

The market size, which was valued at USD 6.34 billion in 2024, is anticipated to reach USD 9.08 billion by 2032. This growth represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2032.

This expansion is being navigated in a complex environment where increasing shipping volumes are balanced by a market pivot towards higher-value, technologically advanced lubricants. The transition to low-sulfur fuels mandated by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the industry's nascent journey towards decarbonization with alternative fuels like LNG, methanol, and ammonia are compelling a wave of innovation. This is transforming lubricants from a simple commodity into a critical component of engine performance, compliance, and reliability in the modern shipping industry.

Market Overview

The Marine Lubricants Market comprises the production, supply, and sale of specialized oils and greases designed to operate in the demanding conditions of marine engines and onboard machinery. These lubricants are the lifeblood of a ship, performing essential functions such as reducing friction and wear in engine components, preventing corrosion from saltwater and acidic combustion byproducts, cleaning engine parts by carrying away contaminants, and helping to dissipate heat. The market is intrinsically linked to the health of the global shipping industry, which is responsible for transporting approximately 90% of world trade.

The market's product portfolio is highly specialized, primarily centered on large two-stroke and four-stroke diesel engines. Key products include cylinder oils, which lubricate the pistons and liners of large two-stroke crosshead engines, and system oils, which lubricate the crankshaft and other moving parts. Trunk piston engine oils (TPEO) are used in smaller four-stroke engines where one oil must lubricate all engine components. Beyond the main engines, a wide range of other lubricants are required for auxiliary machinery, including compressors, gears, hydraulics, and stern tubes.

The market's projected growth to USD 9.08 billion by 2032 is a story of value more than sheer volume. While the expanding global fleet provides a foundational increase in demand, the real value driver is the technological shift. The IMO 2020 regulation, which capped the sulfur content in marine fuels, was a watershed moment. It forced a move to Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) or the use of exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) with traditional high-sulfur fuel. This necessitated the development of a new generation of cylinder lubricants with different base numbers (BN) to match the new fuel chemistries. As the industry now looks ahead to carbon-neutral fuels, another, even more complex, wave of lubricant innovation is required, further pushing the market towards premium, high-performance formulations.

Key Growth Determinants

Stringent Environmental Regulations (IMO 2020 & Beyond): The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations are the most powerful force shaping the market. The IMO 2020 sulfur cap forced a rapid reformulation of lubricants to work with low-sulfur fuels. Now, upcoming regulations targeting greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, methane) and other pollutants (NOx, particulate matter) are driving the industry's transition to alternative fuels like LNG, methanol, and ammonia. Each new fuel requires a completely new and highly specialized lubricant, driving immense R&D and creating a continuous demand for higher-value, compliant products.

Sustained Growth in Global Seaborne Trade: The fundamental demand for marine lubricants is directly proportional to the activity of the global shipping fleet. As globalization continues and economies grow, the volume of seaborne trade—from container goods and bulk commodities to oil and gas—is steadily increasing. This leads to more ships sailing for longer distances, which translates directly into higher consumption of fuel and lubricants. The expansion of the global merchant fleet to meet this demand provides a stable, underlying volume growth for the entire market.

Advancements in Marine Engine Technology and Efficiency: Modern marine engines are marvels of engineering, designed to maximize fuel efficiency and minimize emissions. They operate under extremely high temperatures and pressures, placing immense stress on lubricating oils. This necessitates the development of sophisticated, high-performance lubricants with advanced additive packages that can protect these multi-million dollar assets from wear and corrosion. The trend towards dual-fuel engines that can operate on different fuel types also requires versatile, high-specification lubricants, further driving the market towards more advanced and valuable products.

Key Growth Barriers

High Volatility in Crude Oil and Raw Material Prices: The primary raw material for the vast majority of marine lubricants is mineral oil base stock, which is a direct derivative of crude oil. The price of crude oil is notoriously volatile, subject to geopolitical events, OPEC decisions, and global economic shifts. This volatility directly impacts lubricant production costs, making it difficult for suppliers to maintain stable pricing and predictable profit margins. These fluctuating costs are often passed on to ship operators, which can lead to price sensitivity and affect purchasing patterns.

Significant Technical Challenges of Alternative Fuels: The transition to zero-carbon fuels like ammonia and hydrogen presents formidable technical challenges for lubricant manufacturers. These fuels have completely different combustion properties compared to traditional hydrocarbons. For example, ammonia can be highly corrosive, while hydrogen combustion can pose unique wear challenges. Developing lubricants that can effectively protect engines running on these future fuels requires massive R&D investment, extensive testing with engine OEMs, and a long development timeline, all while the final ""winning"" fuel of the future remains uncertain.

Trend Towards Increased Efficiency and Extended Drain Intervals: While beneficial for ship operators, lubricant and engine technology advancements are leading to greater efficiency in lubricant consumption. Modern, high-performance lubricants are designed to last longer before needing replacement. Furthermore, the increasing use of advanced onboard oil analysis allows engineers to safely extend oil drain intervals based on the actual condition of the oil, rather than a fixed schedule. This trend of ""doing more with less"" means that the volume of lubricant consumed per vessel over time may decrease, which can partially moderate overall market volume growth.

Key Market Trends

The Rise of Environmentally Acceptable Lubricants (EALs): A significant and legally mandated trend is the growing use of Environmentally Acceptable Lubricants (EALs). Regulations in certain regions, most notably the U.S. EPA's Vessel General Permit (VGP), require the use of EALs in all oil-to-sea interfaces for ships operating in their waters. EALs are biodegradable, non-bioaccumulative, and minimally toxic. This is driving a rapid shift from traditional mineral oils to higher-priced synthetic ester or PAO-based products for applications like stern tubes, thrusters, and stabilizers, creating a high-value, regulation-driven market segment.

Digitalization and Condition-Based Monitoring: The marine industry is embracing digitalization, and lubricant management is a key part of this. Ship operators are adopting sophisticated digital platforms, sensor technologies, and onboard oil analysis tools to monitor lubricant condition in real-time. This enables a shift from time-based maintenance to condition-based maintenance, optimizing lubricant usage and predicting potential machinery failures. Lubricant suppliers are responding by offering digital services and expert analytics platforms as part of a comprehensive solutions package, moving beyond just selling oil.

Development of Lubricants for Dual-Fuel Engines: To navigate the uncertain fuel landscape, many newbuild vessels are equipped with dual-fuel engines that can operate on both a conventional fuel (like marine gas oil) and a new fuel (like LNG or methanol). A major R&D trend is the formulation of a single lubricant that can provide optimal performance regardless of which fuel is in use. This simplifies onboard logistics and inventory for the ship operator. Creating these highly versatile lubricants that can handle the vastly different combustion environments is a key area of innovation.

Key Opportunities

Leading the Lubricant Development for Future Fuels: The shipping industry's decarbonization journey towards net-zero emissions is the single greatest opportunity for the market. The widespread adoption of future fuels like ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen is inevitable. Each of these will require a completely new generation of specialized lubricants. Companies that invest heavily in R&D now to collaborate with engine OEMs and pioneer these next-generation lubricant solutions will secure a commanding market position for decades to come as the global fleet transitions.

Expanding Value-Added Technical Services: In an increasingly complex operational environment, ship operators need more than just a drum of oil; they need a technical partner. This creates a significant opportunity for lubricant suppliers to offer a suite of value-added services. This can include expert oil analysis and interpretation, remote monitoring, onboard crew training on lubricant management, and comprehensive fleet lubrication surveys. By becoming indispensable solution providers that help clients enhance reliability and reduce operational costs, companies can build deep customer loyalty.

Strengthening Supply and Service Networks in Asia Pacific: The Asia Pacific region is the epicenter of global maritime activity. It is home to the world's busiest shipping lanes, the largest shipbuilding nations (China, South Korea), and the biggest bunkering and transshipment hubs (Singapore, Shanghai). As intra-Asia trade continues to boom and the regional fleet grows, the demand for lubricant supply and technical services will be immense. Investing in robust, reliable supply chains, local blending facilities, and skilled technical teams across key ports in this region is crucial for capturing future growth.

“If that expands with the UK, Australia, Canada, others adding to it, a pathway to climate safety begins to emerge,” he said.
Ahead of the IMO vote on a net-zero framework for maritime traffic, the Trump administration threatened to sanction not just states, but the very officials that would have signed that agreement.
The IMO debacle provided a clear lesson for Europe and its climate allies, the senator said: they should learn to “stick to their guns”.
You have to be willing to fight and attack rhetorically to put them on their back foot.” (rh)","If the actions of the Trump administration are threatening to sink global climate action, then a European tariff based on the carbon footprint of imported goods is the “last lifeboat” that could save it, the senator for the US state of Rhode Island, Sheldon Whitehouse, told reporters on Thursday.

“We have to protect it at all costs,” he said.

The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is a levy on a range of products – cement, aluminium, fertilisers, iron and steel, hydrogen and electricity – whose production entails huge emissions of carbon dioxide. It adds a carbon price similar to that already paid by European manufacturers.

“It’s a very sensible, proper balancing mechanism so that foreign competitors don’t get cost advantaged by cheating on carbon emissions,” Whitehouse said. “If that expands with the UK, Australia, Canada, others adding to it, a pathway to climate safety begins to emerge,” he said.

If it were to be scrapped, that pathway would be closed, he said.

Gangster diplomacy

Senator Whitehouse warned that the recent “thuggish approach” used to wreck an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) deal on greener shipping earlier this month could now be used to target the European tariff with “another Al Capone-style attack”.

Ahead of the IMO vote on a net-zero framework for maritime traffic, the Trump administration threatened to sanction not just states, but the very officials that would have signed that agreement. A fractious meeting ended with the vote being postponed and the deal shelved for a year.

“It was like a bunch of gangsters coming into the neighbourhood and smashing windows and threatening shop owners and saying, if you don’t dump this, we’re done,” Whitehouse said.

The IMO debacle provided a clear lesson for Europe and its climate allies, the senator said: they should learn to “stick to their guns”.

Resistance

The EU has already promised the US “additional flexibilities in the CBAM implementation” when agreeing a trade deal to avoid harsher tariffs from Washington this summer.

“I think if you allow yourself to be intimidated by this administration, they will seize all the ground that you cede them and then come back for more,” Whitehouse said. “It’s only when you stop and fight and push back that you have a chance.”

The senator for Rhode Island is a long-standing and vocal critic of an administration he says is controlled by “the most extreme elements of the fossil fuel industry”.

“So there is no such thing as negotiating with these people,” he warned. “You have to be willing to resist. You have to be willing to litigate. You have to be willing to fight and attack rhetorically to put them on their back foot.”

Amongst other anticipated developments, the UK ETS Authority is currently planning to expand the scheme to maritime emissions from 1 July 2026 for vessels over 5,000 GT.","On 14 to 17 October 2025, the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) met for its second extraordinary session in person at IMO headquarters in London.

The discussions were focused on issues relating to the Net-Zero Framework (NZF), which comprises a new set of regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from ships. In particular, the MEPC was expected to consider, with a view to adopting, draft amendments to MARPOL Annex VI, including the NZF, as approved at the MEPC meeting in April 2025 (MEPC 83).

Instead, however, the MEPC voted by a majority to adjourn a decision on the adoption of the NZF by one year. The market response to this development has comprised both positive and negative views alike. In this article, we consider the context and significance of this postponement.

Net-Zero Framework

The NZF is an IMO initiative forming part of its 2023 GHG Strategy, which revised the Initial GHG Strategy laid down in 2018. Specifically, the GHG Strategy envisages a reduction in carbon intensity of international shipping by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 2008.

The revised GHG Strategy also includes new targets for the uptake of zero or near-zero GHG emission technologies, fuels and/or energy sources which are to represent at least 5%, striving for 10% of the energy used by international shipping by 2030.

The NZF applies to all ocean-going ships over 5,000 GT. It introduces:

A global fuel standard that requires ships to gradually reduce their annual GHG fuel intensity (GFI). This is based on how much GHG is emitted for each unit of energy used, across a fuel’s life cycle. And

A pricing mechanism with set prices for emissions exceeding the GFI threshold, aimed at encouraging the industry to lower emissions to comply with the global fuel standard.

In essence, ships can earn surplus units where their consumption is lower than the thresholds. Ships that emit above the set thresholds can balance their emissions deficit by: (i) transferring surplus units from other ships; (ii) using surplus units they have already banked; and (iii) using remedial units acquired through contributions to the IMO Net-Zero Fund.

The IMO Net-Zero Fund will be established to collect pricing contributions from emissions. These revenues will then be disbursed, among other things, to reward low emission ships, support innovation and transition initiatives in developing countries and mitigate negative impacts on vulnerable states.

So far, so good.

Approval/adoption

The IMO Net-Zero Framework was approved at MEPC 83 in April 2025 after many years of negotiation. The draft legal text was then shared with Member States for review, aiming for formal adoption at a special MEPC session in October 2025. Those discussions have now, however, been adjourned until 2026.

It was intended that detailed implementation guidelines would be approved at MEPC 84 in Spring 2026. Query whether that approval will now also be adjourned, notwithstanding that work on implementation measures is said to be continuing pending adoption.

To become legally binding, the amendments to MARPOL must go through the IMO’s tacit acceptance procedure. Under the tacit acceptance procedure, once an amendment has been adopted, it is deemed accepted at the end of a minimum period of 10 months, unless within that period objections are made by no less than one third of the State Parties or by State Parties with a combined merchant fleet tonnage of not less than 50% of world tonnage. If neither condition is triggered, the amendment is considered accepted.

Once adopted, the amendments would be expected to enter into force 16 months later (six months after the end of the 10 months deemed acceptance period). At that stage, Member State governments will be responsible for enforcing them. Therefore, realistically, the NZF will not now come into force until sometime in 2028 at the earliest.

What happened?

It was generally believed that the new measures having been approved at MEPC 83, the adoption of the NZF in October 2025 would be a formality. The hard work had been done and the battle won.

The US

However, the US had objected to the measures at MEPC 83 and withdrawn from the meeting. In August 2025, the US suggested that it could impose trade, port and other restrictions on Member States that voted in favour of the measures. This threat of retaliatory measures was followed by a White House statement on 10 October 2025, describing the NZF as an “unsanctioned global tax regime” that would unfairly burden international shipping.

The EU

The EU nonetheless issued a statement, reiterating its support for the measures and urging adoption. This notwithstanding that both the FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) make express provision with regard to the IMO’s adoption of the NZF. The EU ETS has applied to maritime emissions since January 2024.

The relevant provisions require the European Commission to report to the European Council and Parliament within 18 months of adoption on how the NZF aligns with and/or conflicts with the EU’s climate change regulations and whether amendments/revisions may be required to Fuel EU Maritime and/or the EU ETS.

A House Divided

At the MEPC meeting, the US was joined by Saudi Arabia and Russia (major fossil fuel producing countries) in objecting to the NZF adoption. Ultimately, it was Saudi Arabia that proposed a vote to adjourn adoption by one year. The motion passed with 57 votes in favour, 49 against and 21 abstaining. Among those objecting were the UAE, Liberia and Singapore. Greece and Cyprus abstained. Most EU Member States and the UK were among those voting in favour of adoption.

While some industry stakeholders have described this development as disappointing, others have expressed the view that it allows for further dialogue and time to bridge differing positions among IMO Member States in order to achieve consensus. Ultimately Member States appeared keen to avoid adopting the measures on the basis of a narrow majority, preferring to aim for true global agreement.

The objections

The key concern is stated to be the lack of a sufficient supply of clean fuels that would comply with the GFI. There will also be significant compliance challenges in the immediate term for some countries due to the high costs of producing compliant fuels. Additionally, the pricing mechanism is expected to adversely and disproportionately impact developing nations. A further concern was whether there would be any inconsistency between the NZF and the EU ETS.

Looking ahead

While consensus building continues among IMO Member States, global shipping continues to grapple with different emissions regulatory regimes and multiple regulatory and reporting systems.

Amongst other anticipated developments, the UK ETS Authority is currently planning to expand the scheme to maritime emissions from 1 July 2026 for vessels over 5,000 GT.

In the EU, the FuelEU Maritime Regulation is scheduled for review in December 2027. It may be that the maritime dimension of EU ETS may also be up for review in 2027 on the basis of the required three years of implementation data for such review.

It also remains to be seen how much input and influence the US will have in amendments to and modifications of the NZF text going forward. Will there be a watering down or a shoring up?",https://www.hilldickinson.com/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph_image/public/2023-11/Ship_green_sustainability.jpg?h=19f14c2c&itok=33umCp5e,N,,2025-10-30 14:02:43.527561

As a consequence of this decision, it is ever more likely that it will give rise to more regional legislation and Emission Trading Schemes, which may come to the fore as a substitute for the delayed global IMO Net Zero Framework.

With this in mind, the EU ETS, which was originally deemed a transitional legislation, may now become much more relevant as a leading example of an ETS, for other regions to follow.

Whilst so much focus has been placed on the latest MEPC decision and what impact it may have upon global shipping's decarbonization efforts, it seems many may have missed further important developments within the EU, under FuelEU and ETS.

On 8 October 2025, the European Commission released its Guidelines for Reporting and Verification of Actual Methane Slip Factors. For the first time, shipowners can replace conservative default methane values with measured data, verified in accordance with IMO Resolution MEPC.402(83).

The current FuelEU default tables cover CO2 only. They do not include methane slip (CH4) or nitrous

oxide (N2O) factors for most new, or renewable fuels, such as:

Bio- and e-methanol

Ammonia

Hydrogen and other RFNBOs

Dual-fuel engines (where N2O formation can be significant)

This means that without measured data, these fuels are not yet fully creditable or verifiable under FuelEU or ETS. In practice, this could lead to under- or over-reporting of GHG intensity and exposure to higher emissions costs.

However, there is a solution, as the IMO MEPC.402(83) defines how to measure both methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) onboard, whilst the EU Guidelines (Oct 2025) define how to report verified CH4 factors under FuelEU, with N2O procedures expected soon. The technology to continuously measure and verify, CH4, CO2 and N2O, already exists.

VPS Emsys can undertake these tasks and correlate these gaseous emissions with engine load, automatically building a verifier-ready Methane File.

It is so important for shipowners and operators to act now as from 2025, voyages which will fall under the EU ETS 2026 cycle, will see all combustion-related GHGs, (CH4, CO2 and N2O), priced and verified. At present FuelEU does not provide any default methane or nitrous oxide factors for new fuels, yet only measured values can truly provide accurate GHG accounting and lower ETS exposure.

VPS EMSYS provides the measurement framework today, fully aligned with IMO 402(83) and future-proofed for upcoming FuelEU verification.

30 October 2025 - 19:00

Maritime nations met at the UN's International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London to enact a tax on shipping emissions that was rejected by the US and others, reported the Associated Press.

The proposed rules would introduce the first global tax on greenhouse gas emissions from ships, setting a marine fuel standard that tightens over time. Most vessels currently run on heavy fuel oil, a major source of carbon dioxide and pollutants.

US President Donald Trump urged countries to reject the plan, calling it a 'global green new scam tax on shipping.' Saudi Arabia, Russia and other nations also oppose the framework in its current form.

The Net-Zero Framework, agreed in principle in April, aims to cut shipping emissions to net-zero by around 2050. It includes incentives for using fuels with zero or near-zero emissions and imposes fees for exceeding emission limits.

Climate advocates say the framework is a historic opportunity. Emma Fenton of Opportunity Green called attempts to delay adoption 'an affront to multilateralism.' John Maggs of the Clean Shipping Coalition said failure to adopt the framework risks years of stagnation.

Shipping emissions now account for roughly three per cent of global totals. Observers say the outcome of the IMO meeting remains uncertain.

“That is not reluctance; it is realism,” Mr Ioulianou added.
Once promoted as a bridging fuel, LNG is now under scrutiny for methane leakage and lifecycle emissions.

The IMO’s decision to delay the Net Zero Framework by a year has exposed deep divisions across the maritime industry and highlighted a growing disconnect between ambition and practical progress, according to Philippos Ioulianou, Managing Director of EmissionLink.

Mr Ioulianou argues that shipping’s route to decarbonisation has been hindered by over-promised targets and under-delivered infrastructure.

“What should have been a co-ordinated global effort toward decarbonisation has resulted in paralysis at the very moment the industry needs clarity and unity,” he said. “The truth is that we are years away from having the global supply chains, bunkering networks, and safety systems needed to support alternative fuels at scale.”

As a result, many shipowners are exercising caution, slowing newbuild orders, delaying investment in future fuels, and extending the life of existing tonnage. “That is not reluctance; it is realism,” Mr Ioulianou added. “Why commit billions to technology that might change next year?”

Industry voices are echoing the call for caution. The CEO of ABS recently urged the energy transition be made “solid and bulletproof” before accelerating further, a message that resonates with shipowners navigating uncertainty around fuel pathways and regulatory timelines.

The debate over LNG underscores that complexity. Once promoted as a bridging fuel, LNG is now under scrutiny for methane leakage and lifecycle emissions. However, as Mr Ioulianou notes, “LNG will remain part of the energy mix for the next 30 or 40 years simply because the infrastructure exists and alternatives are not yet viable.”

Meanwhile, China has emerged as a leader in methanol and ammonia production and shipbuilding, positioning itself at the forefront of future-fuel capability while most other markets remain unprepared to follow at the same pace.

“What we’re seeing isn’t failure, it’s the industry finding its balance,” Mr Ioulianou says. “Net zero by 2050 remains essential, but the path will be slower, costlier, and more complex than policymakers want to admit.”

According to EmissionLink, the next few years should focus less on rapid transition and more on measured, data-driven preparation, developing adaptable fuel strategies, efficient retrofit options, and clear compliance planning.

“Realism, not rhetoric, will move us forward,” Mr Ioulianou concludes. “Between ambition and action lies a vast sea of uncertainty, and it’s in navigating that space that the maritime industry will ultimately find its course.”",https://cyprusshippingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EmissionLink-empowers-shipowners-to-minimise-FuelEU-impact-through-accurate-emissions-data-and-predictive-insights.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 19:56:13.057577

Name Withheld (Product tanker, Malta)

The incident: The duty crew onboard the drifting tanker spotted a skiff approaching and alerted the Master. The crew mustered in the citadel as a precaution. The skiff came alongside the tanker, prompting the Master to contact the Owners and the Togo Navy for assistance. A Togo Navy patrol boat arrived, boarded the tanker, and ensured the safety of all crewmembers. The tanker, with no material damage, proceeded to Lome port anchorage for further investigation by the Togo Authorities.

Response: Ghana PRC relayed the message to MRCC Ghana, Ghana Navy & Togo Navy. (IMBKL)

HK Tug 8/LKH 2882 (Tug, Singapore)

The incident: While the tug boat towing a barge loaded with scrap metal was underway, 10 perpetrators in nine sampans came alongside the barge and removed some scrap metal from the deck of the barge. The crew was not injured. At the time of the incident, HK Tug 8 was towing barge LKH 2882 loaded with scrap metal from Singapore to Phu My, Vietnam.

Response: The master reported the incident to Singapore Vessel Traffic Information System (VTIS) East.

Location: Approximately 3 nm off Pulau Nongsa (Indonesia), in the eastbound lane of the TSS Indonesia 01° 14.18′ N 104° 02.30′ E

Georgitsi (Bulk carrier, Marshall Islands)

The incident: While underway, three unarmed perpetrators were sighted in the engine room. The ship’s general alarm was activated and the crew mustered. The perpetrators escaped upon being discovered. A security search was conducted, with no perpetrators found onboard and nothing was stolen. All crew members were accounted for, with no injury reported.

US and China have agreed on a major agricultural purchase framework. The US imposed sanctions on Russian oil, disrupting global energy markets. The IMO delays its Net-Zero shipping framework, while Russia expands grain exports to Southeast Asia.

Major US–China Agri Purchase Framework Agreed

The US and China have moved closer to stabilising their strained trade relationship, with officials announcing a “substantial framework” agreement that includes a major agricultural purchase plan. The development comes ahead of a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, where the two leaders are expected to finalise the details of the deal.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who met with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and other senior officials in Kuala Lumpur, said Beijing has agreed to make “significant” new purchases of US soybeans and other farm commodities. The commitment, if confirmed by China’s commerce ministry, would mark a big shift after months of reduced buying and escalating tariff threats that rattled global grain markets.

Source: GACC

For US farmers, the announcement offers a welcome signal of improving export demand at a time when farm incomes are high, storage capacity is tight, and farm debt is poised to hit record highs.

While Chinese crushers have already built sizable inventories from South America, high premiums for Brazilian soybeans in recent weeks have narrowed their price advantage – prompting some Chinese buyers to reconsider US cargoes for December and January shipments. That pricing dynamic, combined with easing trade tensions, appears to have opened a window for renewed US sales heading into 2026.

Cost of Tariffs Reaches USD 35 Billion

The easing tensions between the US and China come amid a broader sense of stability in global trade. After months of volatility, companies are beginning to adapt to the tariff environment, with many rerouting supply chains or shifting production to offset higher costs. Global firms have already absorbed more than USD 35 billion in US tariffs, but analysts say the impact is starting to moderate.

According to the IMF, one reason the global economy has held up better than expected is that most countries have chosen not to retaliate against US tariffs. That restraint has helped avoid a damaging escalation in trade barriers. The organisation now estimates that the effective US tariff rate has fallen to around 9–10%, lower than originally projected, as new trade deals with Europe and Asia ease the overall burden.

For agriculture, this calmer backdrop offers some relief. Fewer retaliatory measures and a more predictable tariff outlook reduce input cost pressures and support the gradual recovery in US export demand.

US Imposes Sanctions on Russian Oil Producers

The US has intensified its economic pressure on Moscow, imposing sweeping sanctions on Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia’s two largest oil producers, in an effort to cut off funding for the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. Announced on October 23, the move marks President Trump’s most forceful use of energy sanctions yet and immediately roiled global markets.

Within hours of the announcement, Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) both surged, reflecting fears of tighter global supply. However, prices have since retreated as markets stabilised following a three-day decline amid shifting inventory data and easing geopolitical tensions.

The sanctions effectively bar companies purchasing Russian oil from using the US dollar-based financial system, restricting access to Western banks, insurers and shipping services. This poses a major challenge for China and India, which together account for more than 80% of Russia’s crude exports since 2022. Reports suggest some refiners in both countries paused new purchases last week amid uncertainty over compliance risks.

The EU also faces renewed pressure to phase out remaining Russian LNG imports, despite progress in reducing pipeline gas dependence. Analysts say the measures could strip millions of barrels per day from legitimate trade, tightening supply and keeping energy costs elevated. Still, Russia is expected to continue exports through “shadow tankers” and non-dollar transactions, softening the sanctions’ full effect.

Russia Seeks New Grains Markets in SE Asia

As Western sanctions tighten around Russia’s oil exports, Moscow is stepping up efforts to expand its agricultural trade, particularly across Asian markets.

Among Russia’s key targets is Indonesia, where exports include wheat, corn, soybeans and barley. Wheat shipments to Indonesia resumed in October after a nine-month pause, following Jakarta’s approval of updated safety certificates for Russian grain.

The Russian Union of Grain Exporters and Producers is also seeking to diversify its offerings, introducing wheat with 12.5% protein content to Indonesia. Trial deliveries were reportedly well received, and discussions during a recent trade mission to Jakarta—led by Union CEO Ksenia Bolomatova—focused on expanding cooperation and increasing export volumes.

Indonesia, one of the world’s largest wheat importers, purchased 12.5 million tonnes of grain in the 2024/25 season and is forecast to raise that to 14 million tonnes next year amid rising consumption.

Russia has already supplied more than 2 million tonnes of wheat to Indonesia over the past two years, solidifying its position among the country’s top suppliers.

IMO Delays Net Zero Shipping Framework

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has postponed the adoption of its Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by a year, creating uncertainty over the global shipping industry’s decarbonization timeline. The framework aims to reduce emissions through a system of Surplus Units (SUs) for compliant vessels and Remedial Units (RUs) for non-compliant ones, combined with a Net-Zero Fund to support clean shipping initiatives.

Research by Rystad Energy highlights structural gaps in the NZF, including a projected mismatch between clean-fuel availability and demand, as well as a shortage of Tier II offset units. These imbalances could push trading prices for compliance units close to the Tier II penalty ceiling, limiting financial incentives for early adoption of zero-emission technologies.

Rystad’s analysis estimates that total annual penalty payments under the SU trading system could escalate sharply over the coming decades—rising from around USD 17.3 billion in 2030 to nearly USD 78.7 billion by 2050, underscoring the growing financial risk for non-compliant vessels as emission targets tighten.

The analysis also notes infrastructure constraints, technology readiness, and global energy system interconnections as key barriers. While the framework is intended to drive emission reductions, these practical challenges may slow progress and complicate implementation, especially in the early years.

EU Considers Ban on Ethanol-Based Products: The EU is considering restricting or phasing out ethanol-based products, including fuel additives, industrial solvents and personal care items, following the European Chemicals Agency’s assessment that long-term ethanol exposure may pose cancer risks, partly due to by-products like acetaldehyde and formaldehyde.

This has raised concerns among ethanol producers, particularly in India, where a potential ban could disrupt exports and challenge progress toward the country’s E20 fuel-blending target. Experts note, however, that routine use of ethanol remains safe, viable alternatives are available, and ethanol-blended fuels continue to reduce certain harmful emissions—suggesting that demand is likely to persist even amid tighter regulatory scrutiny.

Almost immediately after taking office in late-January, President Donald Trump sent a clear signal to the world that transitioning to green energy was not going to be a priority under his administration.
Environmental advocacy group E2 estimates that, in February and March alone, 13 investments in U.S. clean energy manufacturing projects worth a combined $5 billion were canceled or downsized.
According to data from Wellesley College researchers, 26 other clean energy projects totaling $27.6 billion in capital were paused or canceled between January and the end of July.
In recent years, those partnerships have included the state's Clean Energy Fund, which offers grants and low-cost financing to clean energy projects for small businesses, as well as the Pacific Northwest Center of Excellence for Clean Energy, which brings together the state government, industry associations and research labs to partner on scaling up emerging low-carbon technologies.","Over the last 10 months, the Trump administration’s sweeping rollbacks of critical green energy programs have stalled momentum toward decarbonization, leaving both U.S. industries and international partners scrambling to keep climate goals on track.

""In the energy transition world, it’s been a sea change from the prior administration to the new administration,"" said Holland & Knight international energy project attorney George Humphrey, during an October 21 panel discussion at 2025's One Ocean Week conference in Seattle, Washington.

Almost immediately after taking office in late-January, President Donald Trump sent a clear signal to the world that transitioning to green energy was not going to be a priority under his administration. On January 20, Trump signed an order to begin withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, made it so federal waters couldn't be used for offshore wind leasing, and paused all permitting for wind projects. In the ensuing weeks, his administration proceeded to dismantle core climate programs at home, delay efficiency standards for appliances, roll back vehicle emissions rules, and launch reviews to repeal greenhouse gas limits on power plants.

Then in October, Trump's Department of Energy announced that it would also be canceling more than $7.5 billion in Biden-era grants for hundreds of state-level green energy projects, including a $1 billion initiative in Washington state that would have built out robust supply chain infrastructure supporting hydrogen-powered trucks, factories, ships and power plants. As a result, states and regions face a ""patchwork of regulatory uncertainty,"" said Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance treasurer Selena Elmer at One Ocean Week, as coalitions have had to search for new sources of funding for projects viewed as critical to meeting ambitious climate goals.

That uncertainty has rippled through every corner of the clean-energy sector, from ports that have been forced to shelve infrastructure upgrades supporting offshore wind projects, to manufacturers of hydrogen, solar and battery technologies who have slowed or suspended new factory plans over fears that shifting federal policies could undermine long-term returns on clean-energy investments. Environmental advocacy group E2 estimates that, in February and March alone, 13 investments in U.S. clean energy manufacturing projects worth a combined $5 billion were canceled or downsized. According to data from Wellesley College researchers, 26 other clean energy projects totaling $27.6 billion in capital were paused or canceled between January and the end of July.

The impacts of the Trump administration's energy policies have extended well past U.S. borders as well, with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voting on October 17 to postpone passing its framework for taxing global shipping emissions to 2026, after Trump threatened to impose sanctions against any nations that supported the plan. Without that plan in place, environmental advocates have warned that the delay could jeopardize the IMO's ability to achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, and hinder progress toward benchmark goals in 2030 and 2040.

Despite those obstacles though, speakers at One Ocean Week remained optimistic that local and state-level collaborations featuring a diverse array of public and private stakeholders could still help bridge funding gaps for green initiatives, led by climate-forward states like Washington.

""Long after the current president has moved on, Washington state will still be leading the fight against climate change, and we're going to do that with or without the federal government,"" said Washington state lawmaker Joe Fitzgibbon.

Others emphasized how regional initiatives like Washington state’s clean-energy partnerships have already kept decarbonization projects moving forward, even as national policies have shifted or stalled. In recent years, those partnerships have included the state's Clean Energy Fund, which offers grants and low-cost financing to clean energy projects for small businesses, as well as the Pacific Northwest Center of Excellence for Clean Energy, which brings together the state government, industry associations and research labs to partner on scaling up emerging low-carbon technologies.

Those local initiatives also underscore a broader view shared by One Ocean Week panelists, that even as federal policy pulls back, the work of building a cleaner, low-carbon future is continuing in states and communities determined to make progress on their own terms.

The usually low-profile IMO (International Maritime Organization) was scheduled to make an unusually high-profile decision on October 17th. The question at hand was whether or not to adopt a “greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism” for shipping under their Net-Zero Framework (NZF).

However, on that same date, the member nations voted “to postpone for one year the adoption,” with 57 for, 49 against, and 29 abstaining. The U.S., Singapore, and Saudi Arabia led the way for a delay. Supposedly, “many developing countries” described this as “undiplomatic.”

When it comes to so-called ‘climate action,’ the UN has a strong track record of not giving up. The IMO will probably wait and see which way the political winds blow over the next twelve months before once again pursuing their carbon tax on international shipping.

IMO asserts that the NZF pricing mechanism “has been widely mischaracterized as a global carbon tax.” The Trump administration is thankfully not buying what the IMO is selling, nor are many conservative media commentators and think tanks, whether Trump-friendly or not.

In a joint statement on October 10th by U.S. Secretaries Rubio, Wright, and Duffy: “The Administration unequivocally rejects … the UN’s First Global Carbon Tax … an unsanctioned global tax regime.”

All that is bad enough, but IMO is also at odds with President Trump’s 47 executive orders on Unleashing American Energy, Restoring Gold Standard Science, and Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance.

High-profile economist Stephen Moore penned, “The resolution is intended to advance the very ‘net zero’ carbon emissions standard…American voters have rejected.” And, “Since when are American businesses subject to international taxes imposed by the UN?”

The Wall Street Journal editorial board opined: “This is the first instance…of the UN claiming the ability to levy a tax — the revenues from which will be paid directly into a UN-controlled fund. For the UN system, as a whole, roughly 90% of revenue comes from governments.”

A report by Shuting Pomerleau of the American Action Forum outlined much of the details, like: “a two-tiered tax rate mechanism … two-tiered fuel standard divides vessels into three levels of tax liability … three ways in which shipping companies can pay[.]”

American Enterprise Institute’s Brett Schaefer also pointed out: “Over 90% of the current global fleet uses conventional fuels and cannot utilize greener alternatives. Consequently, fuel costs are projected to rise by 350% … and consumers will bear the brunt of the price.”

IMO’s scheme fits the Tax Foundation’s definition of tax, “a mandatory payment or charge collected by … governments from … businesses to cover the costs of general government … activities,” and carbon tax, “a price on [GHG] emissions to encourage … businesses … to produce less of them.”

And the IMO has not just ‘gone green’ and ‘climate alarmist’ in recent years. They have been moving in the latter direction for years, and in the former direction for decades.

IMO was established between 1948 and 1958 with “a focus on safety,” which it was until 1967. Their focus then shifted to “protecting the marine environment” from 1973 to 1978, and then since 2011 to 2015 to “tackling the climate crisis.”

In 2011, “the first set of international mandatory measures to improve ships’ energy efficiency were adopted” by the IMO, followed by their commitment in 2015 “to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts … to cut GHG emissions which cause global warming.”

IMO explicitly started to equate, or conflate, “energy efficiency” with “cut GHG emissions” in the “Initial IMO GHG Strategy” of 2018. It “envisages … a [total annual] reduction … at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 [as well as] pursuing efforts towards phasing them out entirely.”

The “Revised IMO GHG Strategy” of 2023 “includes indicative check-points for international shipping to reach net-zero GHG emissions for 2030 (by at least 20%, striving for 30%) and 2040 (by at least 70%, striving for 80%) compared to 2008.”

The 2023 strategy “emphasizes capacity building, technical cooperation, and research and development.” But the 2025 framework “refers to a new set of international regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions from ships [of a] global fuel standard [and] pricing mechanism.”

A “comprehensive impact assessment” (CIA) was also considered in 2024. However, this did not include any risk analysis (RA) nor any cost-benefit assessment (CBA), unlike what is required, for example, in a Formal Safety Assessment (FSA) for use in the IMO rule-making process.

Sound CBA, that includes proper RA, is the ‘gold standard’ in economics to properly judge any proposed new tax or regulation. This is best done by using a ‘red teaming’ approach in order to try to counter the ‘bootleggers and Baptists’ within the IMO and without.

The 2024 CIA did include some elasticity analysis, but “one primary gap arises from the need for robust historical or empirical evidence within the shipping domain … the varied elasticities observed across different countries, commodities, types of vessels, and travel distances.”

As even a pro-carbon tax researcher reminds, “the reaction of producers [like international shippers] and consumers to changing prices depends on price elasticities of supply and demand … furthermore determines the incidence of carbon taxes on [them].”

IMO has been ‘captured’ by energy ‘bootleggers’ and climate ‘Baptists’ and is now part of the globalist ‘deep state.’ They have slightly delayed, but will not abandon, their grandiose climate vision for 2050.

Thus, the one-year pause on a global shipping carbon tax, to quote Rick and Morty, “just sounds like slavery with extra steps.” Therefore, one way or another, “hey ho, IMO has gotta go!”

IMO Net Zero in Limbo

Shipping is an important and often overlooked component of the global struggle to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. Mitigation will have to continue to be our best, first approach as we can’t rely on future peoples and technologies to solve the problems that we’re currently creating. Every megaton of CO2 matters and the shipping aspect of the global economy (90% of global trade is conducted at sea) contributes 3% of global GHG emissions. To address this, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a target to be Net-Zero by 2050. How will we do this?

With difficulty, without American support. The current administration has pushed back at the IMO’s target of Net-Zero, threatening members who support this measure with tariffs and visa restrictions. The State Department’s statement calls the target a carbon tax that will adversely affect the American consumer, levied by an unaccountable UN organization. They fear the regulation would benefit China at American expense by precluding the use of proven fuels like liquified natural gas (LNG) and biofuels where America is currently a leader. The State Department overlooks a fuel source in which America is already the global leader.

Nuclear Powered Civilian Shipping

Even though the Department of Energy funded research into nuclear powered Liquid Natural Gas transport (LNG) ships in 2022, it seems the US will want to preserve its sovereignty on the emissions issue and act in its own time as it sees fit. While we can continue to use LNG to power cargo ships presently, we could save some of this LNG for sale or for strategic reserve by using cheaper and cleaner fuels; excitingly, this is yet another space for nuclear power to facilitate American dominance. As of December 2024, the US Navy has sailed 177 million miles on nuclear power safely; that’s 7,600 reactor years of operation. If ever there was a reason for us to feel patriotism without veering into jingoism, to feel confident in an American institution’s ability to handle a challenge, it’s with the unparalleled program that Admiral Hyman Rickover, an immigrant, designed.

If anyone were to doubt the viability of American Nuclear Shipping, they’d do well to remember that the American Navy currently has 97 reactors in operation, and that nearly half of our combatant ships are nuclear powered: 11 aircraft carriers, 48 attack submarines, 14 ballistic missile submarines, and 4 guided-missile submarines. The training for sailors to work on these systems as either mechanics, electricians, or reactor operators is up to 3 6-month schools in Goose Creek, South Carolina. The program is such that it has a suicide rate of twice the national average, and this is directly due to the academic rigor and seriousness with which the job is treated. Even those who don’t continue with the program can’t doubt the quality of the material presented, and the efficient way in which it’s done. This program is the most academically intense in the military, and those with the highest ASVAB scores either join this program or the SEALS. These two programs get the highest enlistment bonuses for good reason: it’s really hard to finish these schools.

Chernobyl was made worse by reactor operator error; this story serves as a cautionary tale for Nuke Students.

The UK Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan, published on Wednesday, was largely welcomed by business and sustainable investor groups as recognising that climate action and competitiveness can go hand in hand.

The plan — which covers energy, transport, homes and agriculture under a single framework — is the government’s third attempt to set out how Britain will meet its legally binding carbon budgets, after the High Court of England and Wales found previous attempts to be unlawful under the UK Climate Change Act.

The budget commits the UK to reduce carbon emissions by 78 per cent by 2035, compared with 1990 levels. However, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said his government intends to go further, targeting an 81 per cent cut in emissions within the next 10 years.

Energy security and affordability are central pillars of the plan, with the government saying energy volatility has left the industrial sector “vulnerable and uncompetitive”.

“Business leaders across the UK know that delivering on our climate goals is also an opportunity to drive innovation, unlock investment and build resilience in the face of volatile global energy prices,” said UK Corporate Leaders Group director Beverley Cornaby. “It simply makes good business sense.”

The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change said the plan shows “how the government intends to translate political commitments into delivery on the ground, supporting long-term investment in the UK economy and the transition to net zero”.

Business leaders across the UK know that delivering on our climate goals is also an opportunity to drive innovation, unlock investment and build resilience in the face of volatile global energy prices

Beverley Cornaby, CLG UK

The group described the “explicit focus on growth” as “an important new development” that “rightly recognises the need to capture the real and growing economic opportunities presented by the transition”.

It reiterated previous research showing growth of the UK’s net zero segments continues to outpace the wider economy, generating £83.1bn in gross value added.

The plan’s focus “on pursuing growth and net zero in tandem is crucial to maintaining the UK’s position as a leading hub for green finance”, added the IIGCC.

High-impact investment

The package includes an investor prospectus, outlining where and how investors can support the UK’s net zero transition through policy-backed, high-impact investment opportunities.

This indicates the government “is thinking seriously about making decarbonisation a growth opportunity”, said Investment Association chief executive Chris Cummings.

Rachel Solomon Williams, executive director of the non-profit business group Aldersgate, agreed the plan would increase certainty, but underlined the “persistently high price of electricity” as a continuing problem.

“Investor confidence will be further strengthened as more details on delivery emerge, including the upcoming Warm Homes Plan and Industrial Decarbonisation [Strategy],” said Solomon.

She urged the government to prioritise action on power prices in the forthcoming budget.

Nigel Topping, chair of the Climate Change Committee, a government advisory committee, said its “number one recommendation remains to make electricity cheaper. This means taking policy costs off electricity bills. This is vital for ensuring the required scale-up of heat pump installations in the plan”.

The government is set to publish a future homes standard in the coming months, which will require new homes to have low-carbon heating such as heat pumps, and to meet higher energy-efficiency rules, with solar panels as a default for some new builds.

Josie Murdoch, analyst at energy think-tank Ember, said the government had “missed a trick” by failing to show greater ambition on heat pumps and electric vehicles in its revised plan.

With the IMO failing to deliver a net zero plan, the UK can’t sit on the sidelines. This is the moment to become a world leader by bringing in a clean fuel mandate and greenhouse gas standard for international shipping without delay

Anna Krajinska, T&E

“While China and other major economies rapidly ditch fossil-based tech, the UK could be left behind,” she said. “We need rapid delivery supported by robust targets to get the benefits of an electrified economy quicker.”

The package also included a Methane Action Plan, focused on reducing domestic methane emissions from agriculture, waste and fuel supply, and on actions to “encourage and support other nations” to reduce their emissions.

Clean Air Task Force director of UK policy Rebecca Tremain said the plan now needed “regulatory teeth — turning pledges into enforceable action that cuts waste, strengthens UK competitiveness, and slows the rate of warming in our lifetimes”.

Transport troubles

Campaigners were less enthusiastic about the government’s plans for transport, in particular aviation and shipping,

Anna Krajinska, UK director of non-profit Transport & Environment, said the government’s continued commitment to sustainable aviation fuels is welcome. But she described its reliance on the Corsia carbon offsetting scheme as “disappointing”, saying it is “a weak global scheme that fails to drive real emissions cuts”.

If the government had included long-haul flights in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme, it could have delivered an extra £1bn last year. “This would finally put a fair price on a sector that is shockingly undertaxed,” Krajinska added.

Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit head of transport Colin Walker said the government was “pinning its hopes for cutting aviation emissions on [SAF] and technological innovations that are still very much in their infancy, and failing to encourage ultra-frequent flyers from making more sustainable choices”.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/afe2f723-41af-41be-89c4-9d7488e880b3.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 08:17:15.014268

Like with anything in shipping, it’s the long-term view that matters most.","THE colour green fell out of fashion for big business a while ago now.

Trump’s re-election, higher interest rates and inflation, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and weaker-than-expected government efforts all combined to snuff out the ESG fervour of 2021 for the Shells and BlackRocks of the world.

For a while though, it seemed like shipping could be an exception.

Global regulation through the International Maritime Organization, the industry’s support for a carbon levy, and the majority support for the resulting Net-Zero Framework in April were a cause for hope.

But the IMO’s failure to adopt the NZF in October (see Lloyd’s List’s passim ad nauseam) puts it more into line with the global trend.

To be sure, US bullying could be the main reason the NZF is now on life support for a year, with a grim prognosis. But it wasn’t the only reason.

There was plenty of unease about the plan even among supporters, and about the economic and practical flaws of fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia in the months before the Big Vote That Wasn’t.

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, fresh from his break with Brussels over the NZF, recently wrote that Europe could not afford to stay on its green path.

“We cannot allocate money based on vibes,” he wrote in the FT, adding: “If we must accept some emissions for a bit longer to save our industries or to maintain social cohesion, so be it.”

Mitsotakis’ comments reflect Greek shipowners’ views, which in turn reflect their business interests. But they are also right; politics exist, for better or worse. We must work within the bounds of what is possible.

Shipowners who have always viewed decarbonisation as fanciful will get to say they told you so.

Green tech firms are putting on a brave face, but some of them will doubtless be worried about their futures.

But as with the broader energy transition, popping hype bubbles may have its upsides.

Just look to the huge growth in solar, batteries and EVs despite the Trumpian greenlash. The direction is greener over time; it is just slower and quieter.

Instead of yet more “which future fuel will it be?”, companies could work on aligning different links in their maritime supply chain toward slower steaming and just-in-time arrival, among other goals.

Standards for data gathering and reporting across the industry would help a whole range of areas, from misdeclared cargo to route planning.

Tech firms that manage to cut fuel use meaningfully will find buyers for their widgets without IMO regulation. The booze and buzzwords will still flow at Posidonia next year. The work will go on.

Like with anything in shipping, it’s the long-term view that matters most.

Triskelion will be the first project to deploy Topsoe’s SOEC for e-methanol production. The produced e-methanol will be used in the production of chemicals, like e.g. glue and resins.

Final investment decision (FID) for the Triskelion project remains on course for Q2 2026, with commencement of operations planned for 2028.

Topsoe’s end-to-end technology platform, combining high-efficiency SOEC electrolysis with its e-methanol synthesis loop was a key factor in enhancing the project’s financial viability.

Topsoe, a leading global provider of advanced technology and solutions for the energy transition, has signed an offtake agreement to provide its state-of-the-art SOEC technology for Forestal’s Triskelion e-methanol plant in Galicia, Spain. The SOEC’s will be delivered from Topsoe’s manufacturing facility in Herning, Denmark, which is nearing the final stage of readiness for industrial-scale production.

The agreement, which includes a 10-year service warranty program, builds on Topsoe’s existing agreement with Forestal, announced in December 2024, to provide its e-methanol synthesis technology, catalysts and engineering for highly efficient e-methanol production.

By providing a single, integrated hydrogen-to-methanol pathway, the solution minimizes interface risk, improves overall efficiency by up to 30 % compared to conventional electrolysis systems and removes the need for intermediate hydrogen storage. This ensures stable operations even during renewable power fluctuations, a crucial requirement for Forestal when assessing project risks.

Sundus Cordelia Ramli, CCO Power-to-X, at Topsoe, said:​

“We are thrilled to announce this next step in our collaboration with Forestal and to secure an additional order for our SOEC electrolyzers. Our integrated SOEC and e-methanol technology will enable Forestal to decarbonize its chemical production value chain. This project further demonstrates how combining electrolysis and synthesis technologies in a bankable, end-to-end solution can help decarbonize energy-intensive industries. We’re proud to be providing an advanced, deeply integrated solution to one of Europe’s trailblazing e-methanol plants.”

Andrés Fuentes, General Manager at Forestal, said:

“The strategic alliance with Topsoe and the incorporation of their SOEC technology places the Triskelion project in a leading competitive position within the e-methanol sector. This collaboration allows us to optimize operational efficiency, strengthening our ability to compete in the international renewable fuels market. At Forestal del Atlántico, we are committed to innovative solutions that set us apart and enable us to advance towards a more sustainable and resilient industry. Thanks to this technology, the project not only meets the highest environmental standards but also becomes a benchmark of competitiveness for Galicia and all of Europe.”

About the Triskelion project

The Triskelion project is among Europe’s most advanced e-methanol projects. Owned by the Spanish shipping and chemicals company Forestal, it was a recipient of a EUR 49m grant from the European Innovation Fund in 2023. The plant has a design capacity of 156 metric tons per day (MTPD) of e-methanol.

The e-methanol produced is intended for applications in the shipping industry and in the chemicals industry for formaldehyde, glue and more. An example is Forestal’s productions of glue for MDF boards, which from 2028 can be made from e-methanol instead of grey methanol.

Maritime Business Lead, Nick Heeren, explains: ""Despite the delay, the competitive dynamics driving today’s maritime transformation haven't changed.
Major shippers are already requiring real-time cargo tracking and verified emissions data, regardless of IMO schedules.","Antwerp, Belgium - October 29th, 2025

The maritime industry faced an unexpected setback last week when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted to postpone adoption of its Net-Zero Framework (NZF) by one year during the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) 2nd extraordinary session.

Even though industry reactions have been mixed ever since, the delay comes with a strategic opportunity for maritime business leaders.

In this article, our Maritime Business Leads Nick Heren explains how the extra year could help maritime business innovate with purpose.

First things first: context.

As a result of the vote to postpone adoption of the NZF - a vote that was expected to be a relatively easy session in favor of adoption - delegates will continue to work towards consensus on the IMO Net-Zero Framework for at least the next 12 months. The meeting will, therefore, continue in October 2026, which means the possible entry into force will be on 1 March 2028 at the earliest.

The postponed framework would have introduced mandatory greenhouse gases (GHG) fuel intensity targets and penalty mechanisms for ships exceeding emission thresholds.

Industry reactions to the delayed adoption have been mixed so far.

Thomas Kazakos, Secretary General of the International Chamber of Shipping, expressed concern that ""industry needs clarity to be able to make the investments needed to decarbonize the maritime sector.""

Others, like Intercargo’s Kostas Gkonis, characterized the delay as ""an opportunity for further dialogue”, while Odjfell’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Øistein Jensen, expressed his disappointment in a recent LinkedIn post “not only because the framework was postponed, but because of how it was postponed”.

The IMO's decision to postpone the Net-Zero Framework by one year understandably creates uncertainty for maritime operators who've been preparing for 2027 implementation. However, this delay also presents a strategic opportunity.

Maritime Business Lead, Nick Heeren, explains:

""Despite the delay, the competitive dynamics driving today’s maritime transformation haven't changed. Fuel still represents a significant amount of vessel operating costs. Customers still demand increased visibility in sustainability performance. And Maritime organizations leveraging data opportunities to optimize operations, reduce costs, and demonstrate measurable environmental improvements are still the ones that are most likely to capture additional market share going forward.""

Heeren emphasizes that while regulatory timelines may shift, the fundamental drivers of maritime transformation continue to accelerate:

""Customer expectations aren't retreating. Major shippers are already requiring real-time cargo tracking and verified emissions data, regardless of IMO schedules. Regional regulations like the EU's emissions trading system and FuelEU Maritime continue advancing on their own timelines. And operational efficiency remains the fastest path to emissions reduction, as recently noted at the London International Shipping Week where a large fleet operator explained how they achieved 10-15% emissions reductions simply by measuring performance and acting on data-driven insights.""

At Made, we look at the event from an innovation standpoint. Therefore, what this extra year provides is breathing room for organizations that haven't yet built the infrastructure for the much needed digital transformation, regardless of specific regulatory timelines.

“The winners in 2027, 2028, or whenever final regulations arrive, will be the companies that spent this time mastering their data rather than waiting for regulatory clarity”, Heeren explains. “ In addition, the extra year is also a chance to prepare for a far more complex fuel landscape. As regional regulations like FuelEU Maritime and ETS evolve, operators will need to navigate different carbon pricing systems, fuel availability, and compliance costs on a trade-by-trade basis. In this context, data mastery becomes the foundation for smarter fuel and pooling strategies.”

“By connecting operational data with fuel performance, cost, and emissions data, operators can model future fuel scenarios with greater precision, understanding which combination of fuels, voyages, and partners will deliver the lowest total cost of compliance. This same data-driven insight underpins effective pooling strategies, where fleets combine their performance profiles to balance high- and low-emission assets and collectively reduce penalties.”

""The IMO may have given the maritime industry an extra year,"" Heeren concludes. ""How you use it will determine whether your organization leads the (data driven) transformation or struggles to catch up. The question is not whether you'll eventually need robust data management infrastructure. The question is whether you'll build it proactively during this window or reactively when regulatory deadlines arrive.""

The maritime organizations gaining market share today are those that recognize data mastery as a strategic imperative rather than a compliance exercise. The delay doesn't change the destination.

“What was on the table two weeks ago was probably skewed to a particular sector within the industry,” he said.
We’ve overdone it.” Fiori also warned that the conversation has drifted too far from the physical realities of the oil trade.
We’re the most efficient transport mode.” Fiori agreed that shipping suffers from “a perception problem more than a reality problem.","If there was one word that dominated discussion at the tanker panel during this year’s Maritime CEO Forum at the Monaco Yacht Club, it was uncertainty — from the IMO’s fractured net-zero process to the unintended consequences of Western sanctions and the rise of the shadow fleet.

Moderator Tim Wilkins, managing director of INTERTANKO, set the tone from the outset. “We’ll talk about regulatory certainty and then political certainty — if we can find any,” he said, only half-jokingly. “Whether we can get regulatory certainty, I’m not sure. But that’s the challenge we’re all living through.”

The forum brought together senior figures from across the tanker spectrum — from VLCC operators to product carriers — for what became a strikingly frank exchange on the state of global regulation, market alignment and enforcement.

The IMO’s failed attempt earlier this month to finalise its Net Zero Framework was the natural starting point. The collapse of consensus, driven in part by a US rejection of carbon levies, loomed over every conversation.

Svein Moxnes Harfjeld, president and CEO of DHT Holdings, said bluntly that the proposals on the table “didn’t really look at the industry” as it exists today.“We all tend to talk about maritime as a homogeneous industry — and it’s not,” he said. “There are lots of different ships, trades, cargos, short haul, long haul, scheduled and tramp. The proposal didn’t reflect that.”

Harfjeld noted that Washington’s opposition underscored who ultimately bears the cost of decarbonisation. “The US has the world’s biggest economy, the world’s biggest oil company, huge agriculture. They said they didn’t want to tax their consumers. And that’s their argument — they don’t want to pay for what others want to do.”

Wilkins agreed that smaller owners had been underrepresented in the IMO debate. “What was on the table two weeks ago was probably skewed to a particular sector within the industry,” he said. “The IMO now needs to open its doors again to the wider voice — the practical realities of the tanker sector.”

Marco Fiori, CEO of Premuda, spoke passionately about the contradictions in global policy. “Everybody talks a great game and then plays a very poor one,” he said. “Governments say they want decarbonisation but then load bureaucracy and taxation on us. We’ve overdone it.”

Fiori also warned that the conversation has drifted too far from the physical realities of the oil trade. “We’ve been hearing for years that we’ve reached peak oil. Every time, there’s a new peak oil. We’re very far from peak oil. Conventional fuels will be with us for a long time — probably unfortunately.”

He added that inflation and rising costs make it nearly impossible to forecast newbuilding deliveries. “How can you predict what will deliver in 2028 or 2029 when inflation is unpredictable? We’re still facing the same shortage of shipyard capacity.”

Alexia Inglessis, director of Alberta Shipmanagement, steered the debate toward practical steps.“With alternative fuels still unavailable, we must focus on efficiency — which also makes business sense,” she said. “Over 40% of the world fleet already has energy-saving devices installed. But 70% of the fleet is still of average age or older.”

She cautioned that shipping will compete with food production for fuels like ammonia. “Eighty percent of ammonia today is used to fertilize crops. The growing population over the next 40 years will need more food than in the past 8,000 years. Shipping will have to compete for these resources.”

Inglessis reminded delegates that shipping’s emissions are modest compared to other sectors. “Shipping contributes about 2.4% of global CO₂ emissions — less than 2% of greenhouse gases. Compare that with steel or concrete, which each account for 8–9%. We’re the most efficient transport mode.”

Fiori agreed that shipping suffers from “a perception problem more than a reality problem. People see smoke from a funnel, so they assume we’re the worst offenders.”

Mikael Skov, CEO of Hafnia, described the IMO’s process as “driven more by feelings than by reason”.

“At the Global Maritime Forum I sensed real frustration,” he said. “People support the goal — we know it’s the right direction — but the process has felt imposed. Shipping isn’t one industry. Yet the framework was pushing everyone in the same direction, even those without alternatives.”He argued that the decarbonisation debate has drifted toward punishment over pragmatism. “Our clients won’t pay for dual-fuel ships. There’s no renewable alternative yet. But the framework still says: if you can’t comply, you pay a penalty. That penalty then goes to people developing renewables — while we’re left footing the bill.”

Skov nevertheless insisted that the IMO remains essential. “We need a global voice to regulate the industry. The problem isn’t a lack of regulation — it’s a lack of enforcement.”

That theme — enforcement — quickly turned to the proliferation of the shadow fleet.

Skov was blunt: “It’s a massive problem that flag states supporting the dark fleet are sitting at the IMO table making decisions about future regulation.”

Wilkins called for a clearer line between compliant operators and the murky world of sanctioned tonnage. “There are maybe 500 to 600 sanctioned vessels,” he said. “But if you listen to the numbers, there are 1,300 ships in the shadow fleet. What about those 800 grey-area tankers? They slip in and out of commercial trade. We need to draw a line.”

Fiori added that once sanctions lift, the industry faces another problem: “What do we do with those ships? They can’t be scrapped easily because yards have their own KYC requirements. We can’t just dump them somewhere.”

Harfjeld highlighted how lax oversight enables shadow trading. “Malaysia produces half a million barrels a day but exports one and a half million. Figure that out,” he said, drawing laughs. “Oil gets new birth certificates — Venezuelan crude sold as ‘Benin Heavy’, which doesn’t exist.”

Inglessis pointed out that legality depends on geography. “What’s illegal for the US, EU, or G7 might be entirely legal for China. We’re playing with two different sets of rules — and maritime centres are shifting east as a result.”As discussion deepened, panelists agreed that unilateral sanctions have unintentionally reshaped tanker trading.

“Let’s not forget it was the US that introduced sanctions,” said Harfjeld. “They wanted to keep oil flowing and prices stable. Strong economic interests were at play.”

Fiori called it “a game of equilibrium, but an increasingly unbalanced one.” He recalled how, at the start of Russian sanctions, “the US Treasury was quietly telling traders not to stop importing Russian oil, because it would crash supply and spike prices. It’s always politics first.”

Inglessis offered data showing that despite sanctions, exports are rising. “The three sanctioned producers are exporting more than before,” she said.

Looking ahead, Harfjeld forecasted a return of contango — the storage-driven market structure last seen in 2020. “Oil companies expect contango later this year,” he said. “China is already building inventories. It’s partly price-driven but also about energy security.”He expects the build-up to last well into next year, which “will be positive for tankers — though we might face a hangover once stocks unwind.”

By the end of the 50-minute session, the tanker leaders had circled back to Wilkins’s opening theme: a fragmented industry struggling for coherence.“We’re not one industry. There are several pathways to net zero, and the framework two weeks ago was tailored for just one,” Wilkins said.If there was consensus on anything, it was that tankers — pragmatic by nature — crave realism over rhetoric. “Focus on what’s doable,” said Harfjeld.",https://splash247.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Monaco-CEO-Tankers-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 05:00:35.372575

Announced green ammonia projects have potential to locally and competitively supply the corridor’s fuel needs, and Saldanha could become the corridor’s long-term bunkering hub

Global and regional regulations may help create a business case for this corridor, although uncertainties around the development of regulations remain

Additional action is needed by private and public stakeholders to address the remaining risks and gaps to launch the corridor on time

30 October 2025, Johannesburg – Ammonia-fueled bulk carriers could feasibly be deployed on the South Africa-Europe iron ore trade route as soon as 2029 and scale toward full decarbonisation by 2035, according to the Global Maritime Forum.

The feasibility study, produced in collaboration with a consortium created in 2023 (which includes Anglo American, CMB.TECH, Freeport Saldanha, VUKA Marine, and ENGIE), said the corridor linking Saldanha Bay in the Western Cape to the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands would be one of the first Global South-to-North green shipping routes.

Saldanha Bay, home to South Africa’s primary iron-ore export terminal, is already planning the development of ammonia production, alongside port upgrades to handle bunkering operations.

In the green corridor’s initial years, ammonia-fueled vessels would likely bunker in Rotterdam, which is one of the most mature ports in terms of its ammonia bunkering and safety frameworks. Meanwhile, Saldanha Bay will have the opportunity to build the infrastructure to become the long-term green ammonia production and bunkering hub for the corridor.

By 2035, the port could supply bunkering services to all corridor vessels locally, creating a dual-purpose facility that continues mineral exports while serving international shipping.

“This phased approach gives shipowners and fuel producers a clear timeline to work toward, and we now need coordinated action from policymakers and industry to make this a reality by 2029,” said Shanon Neumann, Associate: Investment Facilitation at Freeport Saldanha. “However, to help Saldanha Bay transition quickly, blending public and private funding can unlock investment in infrastructure and reduce the risks of early projects.”

Why it matters for South Africa

The World Bank and World Economic Forum have both previously identified South Africa as a prospective key player in fueling shipping’s decarbonisation. The green corridor could contribute towards turning this notion into a reality.

Announced green hydrogen projects near the ports of Boegoebaai, Saldanha, and Walvis Bay could meet the corridor’s fuel needs, including its high-demand scenario of 22 bulk carriers per annum by 2035. The possibility of such strong demand levels could mean a stronger business case for green hydrogen producers looking to secure enough offtake volumes to finalise investment decisions and accelerate new projects.

Add in the necessary financing, potential tax incentives, and port tariff discounts for fuel production and bunkering build-out at Freeport Saldanha, and South Africa could gain a competitive edge as an international bunker supplier. The country’s hydrogen sector may be able to contribute 3.6% to the country’s GDP by 2030, with shipping and steel well-positioned to become early offtakers of the gas and its derivatives.

This green shipping corridor offers the opportunity to strengthen South Africa’s export competitiveness, future-proof a strategic port, and support the country’s Just Energy Transition through local value chains, skills development, and community benefits.

Policy alignment equals a strong business case

Regional and global regulations could materially improve the business case for the corridor. Europe’s FuelEU Maritime greenhouse-gas intensity targets and Emissions Trading System levy, the latter to be fully phased in by 2026, narrow the cost gap between green ammonia and conventional fuels by more than 60% in modelled scenarios.

The International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) Net-Zero Framework (NZF), now set to be revisited in 2026 following the decision earlier this month to delay adoption, would further strengthen the case, with fuel standards, emissions targets, and market-based incentives that reward zero-emission fuels.

“With binding global regulations delayed for now, there remains a business case to be made for green ammonia on this corridor,” says Marieke Beckmann, Global Maritime Forum deputy director of decarbonisation. ""The role of national and local governments becomes increasingly important in incentivising the adoption of scalable zero emission fuels. This, combined with EU measures, will help position South Africa as a competitive supplier of clean maritime fuel.""

Next step: implementation

The Global Maritime Forum study provides a roadmap to making the corridor operational by 2029, including:

Creating an enabling contracting environment to optimally and fairly allocate risks and rewards across the value chain.

Engaging with South African government bodies and industry stakeholders to raise awareness of the corridor opportunity and the need for an enabling policy environment, and build momentum around it.

Mobilising funding and incentives for corridor infrastructure that will contribute to Saldanha’s hydrogen hub and port development.

If implemented, the South Africa–Europe Iron Ore Green Corridor could become a model for an equitable, commercially viable zero-emission shipping corridor and a catalyst for South Africa’s hydrogen economy to unlock large-scale investment.

This report has been authored by the Global Maritime Forum and is based on a feasibility analysis conducted by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) with input and validation from the consortium members.

Low greenhouse gas (GHG) fuels such as biodiesel and bio-liquefied natural gas (LNG) generate fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels.
“Biofuels can range from only about a 50 percent reduction in well-to-wake emissions to close to net-zero emissions.
Challenges include minimizing additional energy consumption to achieve CO2 capture and ensuring the purity of the captured and liquefied CO2.
We have seen significant technical development and large-scale tests that could prove the CO2 reduction technology,” he said.","The global maritime transportation paradigm is shifting toward more eco-friendly methods that harness cleaner fuels and generate fewer carbon emissions. However, slow progress in fuel supply chains and the development of technologies for future ships is delaying this big-picture transition, according to an expert from a Norwegian industrial risk management provider.

Eirik Ovrum, principal consultant at DNV, said that although the testing of technologies to implement these fuels and deploy ships is not advancing at the necessary pace, the tests themselves are showing positive signs and the industry is on the right track.

One major upcoming category of future ships in the pipeline is those using biofuels. Low greenhouse gas (GHG) fuels such as biodiesel and bio-liquefied natural gas (LNG) generate fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels. These fuels are currently in high demand worldwide, but their global supply remains limited, according to Ovrum, author of “Maritime Forecast to 2050,” a report published by DNV.

“Biofuels can range from only about a 50 percent reduction in well-to-wake emissions to close to net-zero emissions. The same is true for bio-LNG. So shipowners with access to the right kinds of biodiesel or bio-LNG can reach net-zero and avoid paying any carbon dioxide (CO2) price to the International Maritime Organization (IMO). We, however, see a lack of supply to meet demand. The production of low-GHG fuels has to be increased in order for shipping to meet the IMO goals in 2030, 2040 and net-zero by 2050,” he said in an interview with The Korea Times.

“We don’t know how far this will go. We aren’t certain about additional costs of collecting new types of biowaste. Both the speed at which production is expanding and possible increases in production costs are impacting our assessment of the future. And perhaps the most important aspect is what demand will be like from sectors other than shipping. And it seems unlikely that we will see a reduction in biodiesel use over the next 10 years.”

Onboard carbon capture systems (CCS), another anticipated technology, also remain in testing before full-scale deployment, according to Ovrum. Challenges include minimizing additional energy consumption to achieve CO2 capture and ensuring the purity of the captured and liquefied CO2.

“The level of impurities in the CO2 stream is a significant question in the wider CCS value chain,” he said.

Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS), which do not require low-GHG fuels or CO2 capture, also need further development to determine a basis for practical use, Ovrum said. “We are working on verifying savings (of energy) for ships with the system installed, but the results are highly individual, and one ship’s savings are not necessarily applicable to another ship.”

Despite these challenges, Ovrum said that human ingenuity is overcoming hurdles through testing and proposals to current IMO regulations. For example, with the implementation of more flexible chain-of-custody models, like book-and-claim, access to biodiesel and bio-LNG will be easier and faster.

Ovrum also noted that dozens of full-scale CCS pilot projects are being tested on merchant ships in operation. Norwegian shipowner Solvang’s chemical tanker Clipper Eris has been testing an onboard CCS for more than six months. A similar system from the Shanghai Marine Diesel Engine Research Institute has been in operation since 2024 on the container vessel Ever Top.

“The results are encouraging. We have seen significant technical development and large-scale tests that could prove the CO2 reduction technology,” he said. “DNV is active in development of the wider CCS value chain, including shipping, and is currently running more than 10 joint industry projects addressing key industry challenges in capture, transportation, storage, dispersion and metering.”

As for WAPS, Ovrum said there are currently 50 ships with the “advanced sails” and another 100 coming up. He said WAPS “could be the most promising development.”",https://newsimg.koreatimes.co.kr/2025/10/29/9353816b-b396-4662-9dcc-d228fec490f3.jpeg,N,,2025-10-30 02:00:52.493808

Navigating Change with Care, Compliance and Collaboration

The recent IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting in London was a reminder of just how complex the global energy transition can be. The decision to delay the implementation of the Net-Zero Framework reflects the scale of differing national priorities, but it also underscores why collaboration and consistency matter more than ever.

At AET, our direction remains unchanged. We continue to strengthen our operations and advance our decarbonisation journey through a tiered, practical approach grounded in proven steps. We operate one of the youngest and most efficient fleets in the industry, we are growing our dual-fuel capabilities, and our retrofit programme is advancing to ensure our vessels remain competitive and compliant. These are tangible actions that support our customers’ ambitions and strengthen our long-term resilience.

Over the past two months, our teams have been active across the industry, contributing to key forums such as OCIMF, INTERTANKO, APPEC 2025, the Argus Sustainable Marine Fuels Conference, and Marine Fuels 360. These forums highlighted that there is no single route to decarbonisation. The transition will be powered by multiple fuel pathways including LNG, biofuels, ammonia, hydrogen, and underpinned by strong partnerships and readiness.

We recently received Approval in Principle (AiP) from Bureau Veritas (BV) for our strategic Joint Development Project with MISC, and Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI). The project integrates Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) technology with an ammonia cracking system. This milestone reflects our determination to turn innovation into practical progress, advancing new technologies that bring us closer to our net zero-emission goals. Our role is to help our customers navigate the energy transition safely, efficiently and with confidence.

Safety, as always, is the foundation of everything we do. At the recent Care & Comply Partners’ Summit 2025, hosted by MISC Group, I joined peers and partners in reaffirming that safety is not a target but a shared culture – one built on leadership, accountability and care. It also means creating an environment where people feel safe to speak up, learn and improve. This commitment to psychological safety is essential to sustaining performance and trust across our global operations. I continue to visit our ships globally and hear first hand where we can improve further.

That same belief in continuous learning shapes how we invest in people and the future of our industry. Through initiatives like the AET-MaritimeONE scholarships and our partnerships with universities and organisations globally, we are helping to develop the next generation of maritime professionals – equipping them with the skills and perspective to lead our industry forward.

As we move forward, we’ll continue to focus on what has always defined AET: caring for our people, delivering for our customers, and upholding the highest standards of safety and integrity.

My thanks to our customers, partners and colleagues whose support and commitment continue to drive our progress.

Charting the Future of Tanker Shipping: AET at APPEC 2025

Smriti Sharma, our Global Director of Strategy, Sustainability and ERM, spoke on a panel – “Charting tanker shipping’s next phase” at APPEC’s Shipping and Bunker Conference in Singapore on 10 September 2025.

Together with her fellow panellists and moderator from Gibson Shipbrokers, Prudent Shipping Investment and S&P Global Commodity Insights, they delved into topics such as assessing freight outlooks against the background of trade flows being affected by global conflicts, evaluating net-zero targets and implications for tanker pools, as well as fleet renewal trends across global tanker markets.

Smriti explained that while LNG remains the most viable option for the near term, AET is also preparing for ammonia as a future fuel and recognises that biofuels will play a growing role. In her view, shipping’s path to net zero will be shaped by multiple fuel solutions, supported by collaboration across the value chain to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.

She also noted that the energy transition is a “one-way street” — that while the pace may differ, the direction is set. For shipowners like us, early investment in sustainable solutions can provide meaningful differentiation and long-term value.

Safety First in Fuel Transitions: AET at the Argus Sustainable Marine Fuels Conference

What role could ammonia and hydrogen play in powering North America’s fleet? That was the question that anchored the panel “Fleet First: How Shipowners are Balancing Risk, Regulation, and ROI in a Sustainable Marine Fuels Industry” at the Argus Media Sustainable Marine Fuels Conference in Houston on 12 September 2025.

Santiago Yanez, AET’s Head of Business Development (New Energy) & Technology, joined industry peers from Sumitomo Corporation of Americas, Argus, and Navigator Gas to unpack the opportunity and challenges ahead.

Together, the panellists addressed the pace of ammonia production on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the challenge of aligning supply and demand, and the potential impact of upcoming IMO regulations.

Sharing AET’s perspective, Santiago highlighted the importance of safety, regulation, and readiness in enabling the energy transition. “If regulations provide support, the rest of the ecosystem will follow,” he noted. He added, “We’ve been working with industry peers and authorities to develop and validate training for our seafarers. Safety will always remain our top priority.”

While the panel agreed there is no one-fuel solution, they highlighted the importance of preparing now, especially as the training market for ammonia begins to grow.

At AET, we see the energy transition as a journey that requires strong collaboration across the industry – from safety training to knowledge-sharing – to ensure readiness for the next generation of fuels. We remain committed to contributing to that collective effort.

Scaling Ammonia Adoption: Building the Pathway to Future Fuels

At Marine Fuels 360 2025 in Singapore on 8 October 2025, AET joined industry peers from NYK Bulkship Asia, Fleet Management and ITOCHU Corporation to discuss how the maritime sector can accelerate the adoption of ammonia as a marine fuel.

The session examined the practical building blocks for scaling ammonia bunkering in Asia: infrastructure and port readiness, regulatory frameworks, commercial incentives and the upskilling of seafarers to handle new fuels safely.

Representing AET, Head of Decarbonisation Sobhith Hariharan shared how shipowners are preparing for this shift. He outlined AET’s approach to balancing investment and readiness, guided by long-term emissions reduction goals, charterer partnerships and evolving regulations. Drawing from AET’s early experience in developing the world’s first ammonia dual-fuel Aframax tankers, he reinforced the importance of shared responsibility in advancing future fuel adoption.

The discussion reflected a collective drive to move from intent to impact. Across the panel there was consensus that scaling new fuels will depend on deep collaboration across the value chain and a shared commitment to safety, regulation and practical implementation. Panellists also agreed that incentives for greener fuels and a decline in ammonia prices could be the twin catalysts needed to make large-scale deployment viable by the early 2030s.

Empowering Future Maritime Leaders: AET Awards 2025 MaritimeONE Scholarships and Hosts MaritimeONE Scholars

Supporting young maritime talent has always been one of AET’s priorities. This year, we awarded the first batch of AET-MaritimeONE scholarships as part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed with the Singapore Maritime Foundation (SMF) last December. The scholars will be pursuing their studies at the Singapore Maritime Academy@Singapore Polytechnic majoring in Maritime Business or Marine Engineering. As part of their scholarship programme, they will also complete a six-month internship with AET, gaining real-world experience in areas such as commercial operations, sustainability, and HSSE.

To give the wider cohort of MaritimeONE scholars a closer look at life inside AET, we were delighted to host 35 students at our Singapore office on 18 August 2025. The visit offered them a first-hand introduction to AET’s global operations and the diverse career pathways within the maritime industry. At AET, we believe that investing in people is investing in the future of shipping. Our partnership with SMF is one of many initiatives aimed at equipping future maritime professionals with the knowledge, skills and networks they need to succeed.

#AETcares: Small Actions, Big Impact

At AET, caring for communities and environments means taking action — and recent initiatives across our offices show how small steps can create meaningful change.

In Houston, a group of colleagues recently spent a day volunteering at the Galveston Bay Foundation’s aquatic nursery, preparing ponds that nurture over 2,500 native wetland plants. Their work involved tending to about 200 plants over 17 volunteer hours. These efforts help protect coastal ecosystems, strengthen shorelines, and create vital habitats for wildlife. It’s a reminder that real impact often begins with simple, hands-on efforts.

The same spirit of purpose was evident in Singapore, where AET and MISC colleagues — together with their families — took part in Walk for Our Children 2025, organised by the Singapore Children’s Society. This year’s theme, “Creating Safe Space, One Connection at a Time”, highlighted the power of everyday relationships within families and communities in helping young people thrive. The event raised vital funds to sustain the Society’s programmes and services, turning every step into support for children and families in need.

Back at our Singapore office, Project Heartbeat, a meaningful fundraiser held on 16 September 2025, brought colleagues together to raise funds through food stalls, games, and handcrafted items. Thanks to the generosity and collective effort of all involved, the event raised nearly 5000USD which will be matched by AET. But beyond the amount collected, the day was a celebration of unity in action and a testament to how much more we can achieve when we unite for a common cause.

From restoring wetlands and supporting children to fundraising for those in need, these efforts reflect what #AETcares is all about: showing up, standing together, and turning compassion into action. Every step, big or small, helps build a more sustainable and connected future.

In their efforts to devise solutions, drive innovation, and attract financing, these leaders are reshaping global climate action. As part of that process, they are increasingly recognising that decarbonising shipping – an industry that generates nearly three per cent of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions – could be a powerful catalyst for Africa’s green industrialisation.

African governments have already emerged as key players in negotiations over reductions in shipping emissions. Earlier this year, they helped secure the approval of the Net-Zero Framework at the International Maritime Organisation, the United Nations’ maritime regulator. Included in the framework is the world’s first binding pricing mechanism on GHG emissions from ships. This measure, which the IMO is expected to adopt formally at its upcoming October session, represents an important victory for multilateral climate action and signals the beginning of the end of shipping’s dependence on fossil fuels.

But the real test will be how this pivotal policy is designed and implemented over the next few years. For African governments, the biggest question is how the revenues generated from the IMO’s pricing mechanism, projected to be $10-15 billion per year by 2030, will be used.

If distributed equitably, these funds could help Africa close its huge energy gap, upgrade its port infrastructure and fleets, and invest in transmission networks and grids that could unlock our vast renewable-energy potential, especially in geothermal, wind, and solar. A resilient grid is also essential for the production of renewable hydrogen and other green e-fuels – the most promising long-term clean-energy solution for the shipping industry. This would likely provide a boost to Africa’s existing green-hydrogen projects and spur new ones, in the process accelerating industrialisation, boosting GDP, and positioning the continent as a global energy exporter.

Until now, Africa has faced challenges in developing its abundant renewable resources largely because of the high cost of capital. African economies remain weighed down by unsustainable debt burdens and low credit ratings, which make it prohibitively expensive to invest in clean energy. Given the perceived risks, the continent currently receives only around 2 per cent of global investment in renewables. But the revenues raised from the IMO’s new carbon-pricing mechanism could be used to lower initial costs, de-risk clean-energy investments, and pave the way for Africa to power global shipping.

Crucially, the IMO must support this drive to harness Africa’s renewable resources by creating strong incentives for e-fuels. Otherwise, cheaper options such as liquefied natural gas, which is far more destructive to the planet, and crop-based biofuels, which increase pressure on food systems, risk undercutting green hydrogen and impeding African countries’ efforts to achieve sustainable growth and development.

The increased use of biofuels would be particularly catastrophic for African countries. In my country, Nigeria, where millions of people already face acute hunger, diverting crops to create fuel for ships – often carrying goods and supplies bound for wealthy countries – would be both immoral and economically reckless. Generating biofuels would likely worsen food insecurity and increase deforestation, GHG emissions, and land degradation – in some cases, to a greater extent than fossil-fuel production.

Like many other African countries, Nigeria has everything it takes to become a leader in sustainable shipping fuels, including abundant sun and wind, and a young workforce. Now it just needs the right investments. If designed properly the IMO’s framework could help provide the funds that Africa needs to ramp up its renewable-energy capacity. Failure to create an ambitious, equitable policy risks limiting Africa’s prospects.

As the IMO gathers in London this month to adopt its Net-Zero Framework, African countries must show the same leadership and determination as they did at the Second Africa Climate Summit. Ensuring that the continent reaps the benefits of the IMO’s new mechanism would be a remarkable example of international cooperation. A climate-resilient future is within reach, so long as African voices are heard, and taken seriously, on the global stage.
