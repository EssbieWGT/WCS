The four parties aim to establish the first commercial-scale ship-to-ship*2 methanol bunkering operations in the U.S. In the global maritime industry, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a target of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and practical solutions are increasingly required. Low-carbon methanol produced from renewable or bio-based sources is gaining attention as a next-generation marine fuel due to its easy handling as a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, as well as its potential to reduce GHG emissions.

ENEOS will explore the procurement and supply of low-carbon methanol, including green methanol to be produced by C2X, a company in which ENEOS holds an equity stake, through the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy project in Louisiana*3.

NYK Line will leverage its experience in developing LNG bunkering infrastructure and provide technical expertise for preparing methanol bunkering vessels.

SEACOR will contribute its expertise as a long-term Jones Act qualified owner and operator of diversified assets across the U.S. coastwise and inland waterways, in addition to its design, engineering and construction capabilities.

These risks include potential tariff-related escalation; other protectionism-driven tensions such as port fees; the possible resumption of Red Sea transits; a potential conflict in Venezuela; and increasing competition for control of shipping value chains.

We expect container-shipping performance to weaken in 2026, according to Global Shipping Outlook 2026, as lower freight rates resulting from a weakened supply-demand balance will lead to lower profits, alongside the risk to freight rates from a potential resumption of Red Sea transits. We expect regional variations, with container trade to North America remaining particularly weak compared with other regions.

The container order book, at about 30% of the existing fleet, is at its highest level in more than 10 years. This reflects continuing new orders to replace ageing fleets and to upgrade vessels to multi‑fuel capability to meet emissions‑reduction targets, as well as capacity growth. As a result, we expect supply to exceed demand; however, we also expect partial mitigation through increased fleet idling (from about 1% currently), blank sailings, scrapping and slow steaming.

Tankers should continue to perform well, particularly crude tankers, due to growth in end demand and tonne-miles. Seaborne oil trade grew in 2025 due to higher production by OPEC+ and non-OPEC+ producers, leading to about a 3% supply increase, with the same expected in 2026. The rise in tonne-miles related to oil exports from Russia, and Red Sea disruption has kept overall demand for tankers high.

We expect weak performance in the dry-bulk segment but volumes should be stable year on year. Order books remain healthy, at close to 11% and 16% of the existing fleet for dry bulk and tankers, respectively, which are needed to replace the ageing fleets. Further significant growth is limited by the shortage of yard slots for new orders over the next three years.

We expect performance across other segments, such as liquefied natural gas shipping and car carriers, to remain broadly stable.

A further increase in trade protectionism could also alter trade flows and limit demand for certain high-margin or critical products in the medium term. Some new trade lanes could strengthen to offset those more affected by tariffs, but we believe protectionism is overall negative for the shipping industry.

Emissions regulations have developed further and there is better visibility over the International Maritime Organisation’s longer-term plan through the Net-Zero framework, although it is yet to be approved. These regulatory developments are likely to put pressure on shipping companies’ margins in the medium term, and the extent of pass-through is not yet known.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Global_Shipping_and_Demand.png,N,,2025-12-12 23:31:04.567637

What do we need from the next ten years to complete the job?

Not enough, but far better

That global emissions are still edging up hides half the story. Emissions are growing far more slowly than in the decade before Paris and China’s emissions have been flat or declining since 2024. Clean energy investment is at record levels and now outpaces fossil fuel investment by roughly two to one after reaching parity six years ago. Electrotech is driving growth in major economies and with renewable energy the cheapest and fastest energy source to deploy, non‑fossil sources already provide over 41% of the global energy mix. In 2015, we all predicted this scale of change would take until the mid‑2030s.

The world economy is shifting, and the political and legal clarity that the Paris Agreement consensus provided is at the root of this transformation. The latest round of national climate plans, the crux of the Paris Agreement architecture, still adds up to a pathway of 2.3-2.5 degrees of warming, but they do represent plans that will see emissions drop by at least 12% on 2019 levels by 2035. Countries just agreed in Belém that they should continue ramping up that ambition and – critically – develop implementation and investment plans to make sure it’s delivered. But the overwhelming message from commentators and analysts in response to the Belem COP30 result was “failure”.

Is there a future in which the shaky ground of multilateral cooperation can get us onto that 1.5C warming limit pathway? And are COPs the “least-worst system”, as the UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband put it, to get there?

Politics in a “down phase”, trajectory still up

Politically, the last decade has been anything but linear. There have been high points – the adoption of the Paris rulebook, the net zero pledging bonanza of COP26, the first mention of fossil fuels in a globally agreed climate decision, the tripling‑renewables and doubling‑efficiency goals, and the launch of loss and damage funding arrangements. There have also been very visible setbacks, including major emitters backtracking, growing climate polarisation and heavily contested COP outcomes. This ebb and flow is one we have become accustomed to.

But the trajectory of climate action has remained upwards. Since 2015, climate framework laws have more than tripled, climate policy instruments have increased roughly seven‑fold and around three‑quarters of global GDP (rising to just over four‑fifths including sub‑national pledges) remains covered by some form of net‑zero target, even after the retreat of the US federal goal.

Our political “down” phase today is complicated by a more difficult and different geopolitical environment. Climate diplomacy now unfolds amid wars, deepening strategic rivalry, reshoring of supply chains, and intensified competition over critical minerals and industrial policy. International cooperation is shifting away from multilateral frameworks towards a more explicitly bilateral and transactional model, centred on packages of energy, infrastructure and security deals. This direction is reflected in ACS2 outcomes, the EU’s revamped Global Gateway strategy (and, in its extreme version, the latest US national security strategy.). While this can leave space for mutual interest, investment and agency for partner countries, it also risks shortening political time horizons, fragmenting standards and weakening incentives to invest in governance and social safeguards.

The future of the COP space

Against this backdrop, frustration with the COP process is understandable. The system is overloaded. The expectations are enormous. And we are still far from where science – and people on the frontline of climate impacts – say we need to be. Fossil fuel subsidies remain pervasive while adaptation and loss –and damage support lag, deepening existing inequalities, with disproportionate burdens on low-income households, marginalised communities and workers in carbon-intensive sectors.

We are right to question whether COPs are the right place to address this crisis. But COPs are not sentient actors that “fail” or “succeed” on their own. They are (precious) political and institutional spaces that deliver only what governments, institutions and societies choose to invest in them – in terms of ambition, negotiating capital and implementation capacity.

Big results like the Paris Agreement demand a huge diplomatic lift and just the right convergence of political conditions, that are clearly not in place now (as the latest IMO talks on shipping emissions showed). Fortunately, we don’t need another Paris Agreement moment. We have a permanent global architecture with five yearly cycles of countries sharing their nationally determined climate plans followed by collective global stocktakes and an ‘Action Agenda’ for driving the action of non-state actors like businesses and city governments.

The climate ambitious are already evolving how they use the COP space, adapting to the new mission for implementation. Recent years have seen coalitions of the willing on issues such as grids, storage and methane effectively compel Presidencies to create room for outcome documents, roadmaps and Presidency‑led initiatives that go beyond the minimum consensus text. The fossil fuel transition roadmap and pledges launched alongside the formal COP30 decisions follow this trend. This model could become a disciplined tool for implementation, if it can transform layers of pledges into actual policy frameworks.

Designing the next phase of climate governance in a new world order

The bigger test is whether these new COP tools can stand up to our evolving geopolitical landscape. This will require addressing the material constraints facing most of the world, above all debt and access to capital. For many emerging and developing economies, climate ambition is constrained not by lack of plans or ambition but by high borrowing costs, limited fiscal space and inadequate volumes of concessional and grant finance. It will also depend on finding ways to integrate trade, industrial and climate governance. A fossil fuel transition roadmap, for example, would need to convince states that they will have routes to prosperity outside their fossil fuel extraction models: clearly addressing the risks and providing economic feasible alternatives backed by international financial tools to enable them. A big ask in a geopolitical maelstrom.

Nonetheless, the entry into force of the UN High Seas Treaty in 2025 shows that states can still agree ambitious rules for protecting global commons even in a period of heightened international tension. Currently, major countries from the Global South are openly pushing back against anti-multilateral approaches to climate and energy, arguing instead for an international order based on shared rules rather than bilateral power-plays. Indonesian President Probowo’s UN General Assembly speech rallied a defense of multilateralism in stark contrast to US President Trump’s tirade. At April’s IEA Energy Security Conference, the US’ push to resurrect the fossil economy was met with defiance from energy transition allies. The evolving geopolitical order is not yet doomed to a fortress world.

The biggest strategic question for the next ten years is thus whether climate cooperation can become a structuring element of a new global order, rather than a casualty of its disorder. Can west, east and south define a shared floor of responsibility and support, even as they compete on technology and industrial capacity?",https://eccoclimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54908710444_2ba9a0ed18_c.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 17:56:42.191315

Animal welfare and crew wellbeing issues According to the organisations, the absence of targeted regulation results in predictable animal welfare problems.
Request for an international livestock carrier code The letter urges the IMO to develop an international Code for the Carriage of Livestock.","On 5 December, a coalition of animal welfare organizations issued a letter to the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), asking for an improved regulatory framework on livestock carriers.

The signatories call for urgent action to address safety, welfare and environmental risks linked to the global livestock carrier fleet. They note that vessels in this sector average 40 years of age, far beyond typical safe operating life. Many ships are conversions of older vessels, vulnerable to corrosion from constant exposure to effluent, and linked to a long record of casualties involving both seafarers and animals.

Recent tragedies, including losses such as Gulf Livestock 1, Haidar and Queen Hind, are cited in the letter as evidence of systemic failings.

Concerns over weak oversight and regulatory gaps

The letter highlights recurring problems with ships operating under black and grey-listed flags, often associated with poor enforcement of MARPOL requirements, substandard safety equipment and inadequate working conditions.

Since existing IMO conventions do not address livestock-specific risks, issues such as ventilation, waste and carcass management, structural integrity and animal welfare remain largely unregulated.

The signatories report that untreated waste and dead animals are routinely discharged at sea, creating environmental and public health risks in Special Areas including the Mediterranean and Red Seas.

Animal welfare and crew wellbeing issues

According to the organisations, the absence of targeted regulation results in predictable animal welfare problems. These include heat stress, overcrowding, disease and prolonged exposure to waste during voyages lasting several weeks.

Crew members face heightened risks from unsafe working environments, close interactions with large animals, exposure to pathogens and the collapse of corroded decks.

Insurers and the International Transport Workers’ Federation report chronic financial instability across the sector, along with a disproportionate number of abandoned crews and high rates of port detentions.

Shift toward alternatives and call for action

The signatories point out that several exporting countries, including New Zealand, India, Australia and the United Kingdom, have adopted or announced bans or phaseouts of live animal exports.

These developments reflect increasing recognition of the risks associated with the trade. Despite this, about 110 livestock carriers remain active, many nearing the end of their usable lifespan, raising concerns about future incidents without coordinated international intervention.

Request for an international livestock carrier code

The letter urges the IMO to develop an international Code for the Carriage of Livestock. The signatories note that other high-risk cargo sectors are governed by specialized IMO codes. By contrast, the transport of millions of live animals each year is covered only by general shipping provisions that were not designed for this purpose.

As noted by the organizations, a dedicated code is necessary to protect seafarers, safeguard the marine environment and improve the welfare of animals transported by sea.",https://safety4sea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2446795825-e1765532543863.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 23:10:08.049157

Di Gilpin, whose company has trialed wing sails and digital performance models, argued wind should not be shoe-horned into a narrow “energy efficiency” box.
If you talk about primary energy transition, it’s more attractive to investors … Di Gilpin noted.
“One of the big problems in the wind propulsion market is overpromising on the impact and savings,” the panel heard.
Bottom line The MarRI-UK webinar underlined that wind propulsion is no longer a fringe idea.","Wind propulsion is moving from novelty to considered climate solution, but its wider adoption hinges on clearer rules, trusted performance data, and joined-up commercial models, industry leaders told a MarRI-UK webinar on “Wind Propulsion Technology & the Maritime Market.”

Hosted by MarRI-UK and chaired by John Hudson, the session brought together Diane (Di) Gilpin, founder and CEO of Smart Green Shipping (SGS), Frank Hendrikse, Manager, Tanker department, Norway, Hagland Shipbrokers, and Camille Bourgeon of the IMO’s environment division. The conversation ranged from the practical, crew reaction and retrofit challenges, to regulatory and financing obstacles, and returned repeatedly to the need for robust, standardized performance measurement.

Regulatory uncertainty and the NZF pause

Speakers agreed that the recent delay to the IMO’s Net Zero Framework (NZF) have added uncertainty that complicates investment decisions across the sector.

The extraordinary session of the marine environment protection committee was adjourned for a period of one year in October. Work continues in the meantime, but the market has uncertainty

… Bourgeon stressed, but acknowledged the impact of the adjournment.

Panelists warned that fragmented regional rules could damage the global market unless a global IMO framework resumes. Frank Hendrikse argued that worldwide regulation remains “critically important for an international industry” and urged a return to global consensus so that owners and financiers can plan with confidence.

The MEPC outcome is unfortunate, and the worst-case scenario is that regional markets and countries start having their own rules and restrictions. World shipping is a global business, so IMO regulations are very important. We sincerely hope this is only a short delay and that we can continue our work.

… said Frank Hendrikse.

Where wind fits in the metrics debate

One focal point was how wind propulsion should be treated within the IMO’s emerging greenhouse gas metrics, especially the Global Fuel Indicator (GFI) being developed under the NZF.

Bourgeon said the GFI workstream is “the right vehicle” to accommodate wind technologies, but that technical discussions are still needed to ensure the metric is technology-neutral and properly reflects wind’s contribution.

Di Gilpin, whose company has trialed wing sails and digital performance models, argued wind should not be shoe-horned into a narrow “energy efficiency” box. “Wind is an energy source in its own right,” she said, noting that classifying it only as efficiency can reduce investor appetite.

If you talk about energy efficiency, there’s a lower level of appetite. If you talk about primary energy transition, it’s more attractive to investors

… Di Gilpin noted.

Panelists also encouraged technical work on life-cycle assessment (LCA) and urged industry stakeholders to engage in the ongoing GFI and LCA guideline development so wind solutions are measured consistently and credibly.

Data, validation and the trust barrier

A recurring theme was the need for independent, standardized validation to counter past over-claiming about fuel savings. “One of the big problems in the wind propulsion market is overpromising on the impact and savings,” the panel heard.

Di Gilpin described SGS’s approach: developing digital twins and using ITTC-aligned sea trials to validate predictive models. “We can guarantee fuel-saving performance through our prediction tools,” she said, adding that validated models make it possible to underwrite leases and performance guarantees, a commercial arrangement SGS favors because it transfers lifetime risk away from shipowners.

Bourgeon noted IMO work to improve measurement guidance and called for more “exchange of experience” and willingness to share granular performance data so regulators, owners, and charterers can build confidence.

Segments, retrofits and crew acceptance

Speakers said wind technologies are being trialed across many sectors, but that uptake varies by segment and vessel design. Hendrikse suggested tankers and smaller dry cargo ships, where deck space and cargo operations are more flexible, may be early candidates, while large containerships pose tougher packaging challenges. “Container ships are more challenging,” he said, though feeder vessels and kites have been trialed.

The panel also contrasted retrofit versus newbuild approaches. Retrofitting is constrained by existing ship geometries and stability limits, Hendrikse observed, whereas newbuild designs can optimize hull form, superstructure, and engine sizing around sails or rotors, potentially lowering the incremental cost of wind systems.

On human factors, the webinar found skepticism often gives way to enthusiasm once crews see the systems in action. Gilpin recounted trials aboard a chartered ship, the Pacific Gribb, where initial reluctance turned to engagement within an hour of raising a wing.

Speakers recommended integrating wind-system scenarios into bridge simulators and flagging the forthcoming STCW training review as an opportunity to fold wind-propulsion competence into seafarer standards.

Financing, business models and standardization

Panelists stressed that policy and finance levers can accelerate adoption. Participants pointed to several enablers: a clear, internationally harmonized regulatory framework, standardized performance metrics (an IMO priority), and financing structures that align costs and benefits across owners, charterers, and cargo buyers.

Gilpin and Hendrikse both emphasized the importance of champions, offtakers, or investors willing to underwrite early projects, and practical contracting solutions that allocate risk and reward. Di described SGS’s leasing model, which keeps lifetime and maintenance risk off owners’ balance sheets, helping bridge the gap between early prototypes and commercial maturity.

Bourgeon highlighted IMO’s ongoing work on performance standardization for wind propulsion technologies and encouraged stakeholders to engage in technical discussions to ensure new tools and metrics reflect operational realities.

Bottom line

The MarRI-UK webinar underlined that wind propulsion is no longer a fringe idea. A growing pipeline of pilots, validated modeling tools, and engaged cargo owners is shifting wind into the realistic innovation category.

But panelists were clear that progress requires aligned metrics, transparent validation, and financing mechanisms that share risk across the value chain.

Can the US live with net zero? Shipping awaits an IMO deal it can believe in

The delay at IMO has left shipping publicly confident but privately pausing alternative-fuel investments

Aligning the framework with US LNG interests may be the price of a deal, or the path to one.

But can the industry really decarbonise the molecule over time? Bio- and e-LNG supply chains have yet to materialise at scale

Analysis

Can the IMO craft a climate deal that satisfies US energy interests without sacrificing real emissions cuts?

Understanding the distinction between greenhouse gas intensity rules and energy efficiency requirements has become increasingly important.
Energy efficiency continues to provide the most immediate opportunities for meaningful emissions reduction.
This creates a more complete and accessible resource for shipowners facing tightening expectations and evolving compliance requirements.
Conclusion Shipping’s decarbonisation journey will benefit greatly from global alignment, yet the path to that alignment may take time.","THE recent failure to secure agreement on the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework has created renewed uncertainty for shipowners at a moment when long-term clarity is needed. A global path was expected to guide investment decisions and support consistent planning. Without it, there is a heightened risk that shipowners may face rising costs as they attempt to comply with a complicated and still developing mix of national and regional measures.

In the absence of a unified approach, regions are pressing ahead with their own initiatives, each designed to address emissions in ways that reflect local priorities. Europe is already far advanced with EU ETS and FuelEU Maritime, while regulatory ideas are gaining momentum in Asia and Africa.

Although these initiatives share the intention of reducing emissions, they differ in scope, data requirements and cost structures. Shipowners trading across multiple areas must therefore prepare for obligations that may vary depending on where their vessels operate.

Understanding the distinction between greenhouse gas intensity rules and energy efficiency requirements has become increasingly important. The introduction of European measures highlighted how easily unplanned exposure can arise. Operators that call at European ports for only part of the year found that even short visits carried consequences they had not anticipated. With other regions exploring their own approaches, the challenge of forecasting how operational patterns influence compliance costs is becoming a central concern for owners.

Alongside regulatory questions, owners must assess which technological paths offer practical progress. LNG continues to be the preferred option for many newbuildings due to its maturity and established infrastructure. Methanol is attracting attention for retrofits, offering a more straightforward transition from traditional liquid fuels. Ammonia is also being explored, particularly for merchant vessels, although handling and safety considerations remain significant factors.

Energy efficiency continues to provide the most immediate opportunities for meaningful emissions reduction. Improvements in hydrodynamic design, propulsion systems and energy utilisation are already delivering measurable gains. Waste heat recovery, once mainly associated with newbuildings, is now being applied more widely to existing vessels. Battery systems and shore power connections are also becoming more common, providing options for reducing consumption without depending on future fuel availability.

A stronger partnership offering shipowners more than the sum of its parts

The passenger and cruise sectors have been early adopters of many energy efficiency and retrofit solutions. These ships present unique engineering challenges because of their dense machinery layouts and significant hotel loads. Foreship’s extensive experience in this segment, developed through thousands of projects, has produced practical insights that are increasingly valuable across the wider maritime industry. Lessons learnt from integrating new systems into constrained spaces and maintaining operational continuity translate directly to other vessel types.

RINA’s acquisition of Foreship has brought together deep expertise in the passenger and cruise sectors with comprehensive capabilities. This creates a more complete and accessible resource for shipowners facing tightening expectations and evolving compliance requirements. As regulation continues to evolve, the combined organisation offers shipowners practical engineering insight helping them assess their options with greater confidence at a time when environmental rules are shifting and compliance pathways are still taking shape.

Conclusion

Shipping’s decarbonisation journey will benefit greatly from global alignment, yet the path to that alignment may take time. Until then, owners must navigate a landscape that is still forming, shaped by regional initiatives and advancing technologies. Realistic, integrated guidance will be essential. By drawing on the combined strengths of RINA and Foreship, shipowners gain a more reliable foundation to manage uncertainty and prepare their fleets for a lower-carbon future.",https://www.lloydslist.com/-/media/lloyds-list/sponsored-content/2025-rina/marine-1-download-copy.png?rev=92c5eb6129574a54b616e9ee7d744ba5,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:14.880885

American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”), ENEOS Corporation (“ENEOS”), Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (“NYK Line”), and SEACOR Holdings Inc. (“SEACOR”) have begun a joint study to develop a methanol bunkering*1 and supply chain network along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The four parties aim to establish the first commercial-scale ship-to-ship*2 methanol bunkering operations in the U.S. In the global maritime industry, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a target of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, and practical solutions are increasingly required. Low-carbon methanol produced from renewable or bio-based sources is gaining attention as a next-generation marine fuel due to its easy handling as a liquid at ambient temperature and pressure, as well as its potential to reduce GHG emissions.

ENEOS will explore the procurement and supply of low-carbon methanol, including green methanol to be produced by C2X, a company in which ENEOS holds an equity stake, through the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy project in Louisiana*3.

NYK Line will leverage its experience in developing LNG bunkering infrastructure and provide technical expertise for preparing methanol bunkering vessels.

SEACOR will contribute its expertise as a long-term Jones Act qualified owner and operator of diversified assets across the U.S. coastwise and inland waterways, in addition to its design, engineering and construction capabilities.

ABS will provide class and regulatory support needed to establish methanol bunkering operations in the U.S.

Through this initiative, ABS, ENEOS, NYK Line and SEACOR aim to help realize a carbon-neutral future for the maritime industry.

The shipments range from 17 antelopes, a rescued baboon, and 37 tons of art to a helmet that Michael Schumacher signed that same year

Singapore, December 8, 2025 – Parcels, planeloads, and packed shipping containers are what people typically associate with DHL Group, the world’s leading logistics provider. However, this only scratches the surface of what the company delivers throughout the year. Here are just five of the most extraordinary shipments the global market leader in logistics handled in 2025

151 Bear Sculptures on a Journey from Germany to Singapore

When art goes on tour: In June 2025, 151 life-sized bear sculptures embarked on a journey of about 10,000 kilometers from Wustermark near Berlin to Singapore. Crafted from weather-resistant fiberglass, each sculpture stands about two meters tall. Known as the “United Buddy Bears”, this colorful art project was launched in Berlin in 2002 to spread a message of peace and tolerance. Every bear is painted by an artist from a different country, symbolizing that nation’s culture and identity. DHL oversaw the secure transport of these valuable artworks. Weighing a total of 37 tons, the shipment was packed into eight sea containers, loaded by crane onto trucks, and transported to the Port of Hamburg. From there, the bears began their sea voyage to Singapore, where they were displayed for two months, continuing their mission of promoting international understanding.

USA to Kenya – Rare Antelopes Go Home

13,000 kilometers for survival: In February 2025, DHL transported 17 mountain bongo antelopes from a conservation center in Loxahatchee, Florida, to a wildlife sanctuary on the slopes of Mount Kenya, Africa’s second-highest peak. These animals are descendants of mountain bongos relocated from Kenya in the 1970s. Today, after decades of poaching, habitat loss, and forest degradation, the species is critically endangered, with fewer than 100 surviving in the wild. To ensure the Florida bongos’ safety and comfort on their journey, DHL provided a dedicated flight equipped with custom-built crates supplied by a wildlife protection organization. The animals received continuous care from a veterinarian and two bongo specialists. Their new sanctuary offers a secure environment where they can breed and thrive. Their offspring will one day return to the wild, reclaiming Mount Kenya’s forests as their natural home.

Across Continents, Signed by Legends – A Far-Traveled Helmet Meets Michael Schumacher

From Switzerland to Brazil, a helmet like no other embarked on a tour across continents in March 2025. On its journey, the helmet was signed by all 20 living Formula 1® world champions, becoming a unique piece of motorsport history. One signature was particularly moving: Michael Schumacher’s, the seven-time world champion who has withdrawn from public life since his severe skiing accident in 2013. His wife, Corinna, helped guide his hand to write his initials, “M.S.”, on the helmet – a gesture that resonated deeply with fans around the world. A replica of the helmet was later featured as a raffle prize to help fund the “Race Against Dementia” charity. Founded by three-time Formula 1® champion Sir Jackie Stewart, the organization funds research into prevention and treatments for dementia – a cause close to his heart after his wife’s diagnosis. Under strict security measures, DHL transported the helmet from Switzerland to the homes of multiple champions so they could add their signatures. The route included stops in Ibiza in Spain, London in the UK, and Brasília in Brazil.

Saving Saadoon – A Young Baboon Moves from the Middle East to East Africa

An unusual passenger boarded a DHL flight from Bahrain to Djibouti, East Africa, in November 2025 – Saadoon, a young male baboon. He was found abandoned and in critical condition in Bahrain in 2024, at just three months old, in a country where baboons are not native. Saadoon was a victim of illegal wildlife trade. After more than a year of intensive care by an animal welfare organization, he needed an environment suited to his species. Djibouti’s climate and ecosystem offered exactly that. DHL flew Saadoon from Muharraq in Bahrain to Djibouti airport, where he was transferred to a specialized refuge near Djibouti City. Custom boxes, veterinary oversight, and an accompanying animal welfare representative minimized stress during the flight. Now living in a sanctuary tailored to his needs, Saadoon shares a new home with a female baboon, essential for social bonding among these intelligent primates. His new surroundings give him a chance to adapt and, hopefully, live freely one day.

Paraguay to Peru – South America’s Iconic Club Football Trophy on the Move

In November 2025, DHL delivered the iconic trophy for the CONMEBOL Libertadores Final, South America’s most prestigious club football showdown. The journey began at CONMEBOL’s headquarters in Luque, Paraguay, and ended in Lima, Peru, where the decisive match took place on November 29. Standing alongside Europe’s UEFA Champions League, the CONMEBOL Libertadores brings together the best clubs from across South America, each chasing the ultimate prize and the privilege to represent the continent at the FIFA Club World Cup. Known for its electrifying atmosphere and passionate fans, the final is a sports highlight watched by millions worldwide. As CONMEBOL’s Official Logistics Partner, DHL ensured the trophy’s safe and timely arrival. Roughly one meter in height, it traveled in a custom metallic case with a special security lock and was handled exclusively with gloves to preserve its flawless shine. Even sealed inside the case, the trophy sparked excitement – fans who spotted it often gathered to snap photos and share the moment. This year, Flamengo of Rio de Janeiro claimed the trophy after an unforgettable all-Brazilian clash against Palmeiras of São Paulo.

The Green Pioneer was named one of TIME’s Best Inventions of 2025.

The conversion journey of its diesel-electric power system to dual-fuel ammonia started in 2022, on land, when Fortescue converted a four-stroke Cummins engine at is Perth testing facility in Western Australia.

“The Fortescue Green Pioneer is proof that safe, technical solutions for ammonia power engines exist” said Dr. Andrew Forrest, the Chairman of Fortescue back in 2024, and he has continued to push for “real zero” fossil-free operations on land and at sea.

Fortescue Shipping owns a fleet of eight conventionally powered Singapore-flagged very large ore carries as well as the Green Pioneer. Fortescue plans to retrofit all of its own ships with ammonia engines by 2030 and any newbuilds will feature ammonia engines.

Fortescue also charters in ships which contribute to the group’s Scope 3 emissions, the Net Zero target for which is 2040.

Fortescue has also developed a decarbonized mining approach. By 2030, the company’s mines will feature battery electric trucks, excavators and drills, autonomous vehicles, fast battery chargers for mobile mine equipment, and ore processing powered by wind and solar, supported by battery energy storage systems.

The company’s Green Metal project will use renewable energy and green hydrogen reduction technology to produce low emissions metal suitable for most global steel plants. Shipping semi-processed metal instead of the ore will also reduce shipping volumes with a consequential reduction on shipping emissions, supporting the company’s aim to reduce emissions intensity levels from shipping iron ore by 50% from 2021 levels by 2030.

The findings of a report, commissioned by Fortescue and published prior to COP30, support Forrest’s ambition, indicating that the world has reached a green tipping point. “Firmed renewable energy is now the cheapest form of energy in nearly every corner of the world.”

The economics of Real Zero are clear across three sectors, according to the research, which finds:

Heavy trucking (Europe): Battery-electric long-haul trucks are projected to reach cost parity with diesel equivalents by 2026 – a tipping point for zero-emission transport.

Fertilizer (India): By 2026, green ammonia for fertilizer production will carry only a marginal cost premium over grey ammonia (made from fossil fuel) in parts of India, and by 2030 will undercut grey ammonia in renewables-rich regions.

Steel (Japan): Green hydrogen-based steelmaking could be cheaper than fossil routes by the early 2030s – even sooner with modest carbon pricing – while scrap-based electric arc furnace production is already cost-competitive.",https://images.marinelink.com/images/maritime/w800/source-fortescue-166287.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:37.884170

Lloyd’s Register (LR), EXMAR and the Belgian Federal Public Service (FPS) for Mobility and Transport have helped to develop interim guidelines to enable the safe use of ammonia cargo as fuel on gas carriers

The Belgium FPS Mobility and Transport, with support from LR and EXMAR, led work to secure an amendment to the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk (IGC Code) more than two years ago, removing restrictions previously preventing the consumption of ammonia cargo as fuel. The three stakeholders provided the initial draft of the Interim Guidelines to the IMO Correspondence Group considering the guidelines. Subsequent development involved cooperation with Member States in a Correspondence Group to ensure consensus.

The Guidelines were finalised during the IMO’s Sub-Committee on the Carriage of Cargoes and Containers (CCC 11) and are expected to be formally approved at MSC 111 in May 2026.

Ammonia has long been recognised for its potential as a zero-carbon fuel, but until recently ammonia cargo could not be used as fuel on gas carriers certified in accordance with the IGC Code. The new framework balances safety and flexibility, allowing shipowners and operators to move forward with ammonia-fuelled vessel designs under a recognised regulatory pathway.

Claudene Sharp-Patel, Global Technical Director, LR, said: “This collaboration shows what’s possible when industry leaders, regulators and technical experts come together to enable change. LR has been involved in ammonia-as-fuel projects from their earliest stages through to realisation. The deep knowledge and expertise we’ve developed directly benefit our clients as they look to decarbonise their fleets. Being part of this pioneering work reinforces LR’s position as a trusted advisor and innovation leader in the maritime energy transition.”

Kristof Coppé, Director Fleet Operations and Technical Business Development, EXMAR, said: “EXMAR’s journey toward ammonia as a marine fuel began in 2021, when our company received Approval in Principle from Lloyd’s Register for an ammonia-fuelled mid-size gas carrier. Using our own cargo as fuel has long been a strategic priority for EXMAR. A commitment previously demonstrated through our pioneering adoption of LPG as a propulsion fuel. Ammonia now marks the next step forward, offering the added benefit of reducing direct CO₂ emissions by up to 90 percent.

“Our close collaboration with Lloyd’s Register and FPS Mobility in Belgium has been instrumental throughout this process. Their support, particularly on the regulatory front, has been a cornerstone in advancing this project toward success.”

Nathalie Deleuze, Maritime Expert – Alternative Fuels at FPS Mobility and Transport of Belgium, said: “Decarbonisation is a key priority for Belgium. At the FPS Mobility and Transport, we’re committed to facilitating the shift toward alternative fuels. To make this happen, we combined our expertise in IMO processes with the technical know-how of pioneering Belgian shipowners and Lloyd’s Register. Together, we’re charting the course toward a cleaner future.”

LR’s Fuel for Thought: Ammonia gathers into one place the most relevant information on the use of ammonia in shipping, serving as a convenient reference for shipowners considering alternative fuel options for their fleets, and for maritime professionals seeking a deeper understanding of the zero-carbon transition. The report combines expertise from LR and other shipping knowledge leaders on topics including the current state of ammonia as a clean fuel, including its safety considerations, drivers for adoption, production and supply chain, and technology readiness.",,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:50.459070

These new release areas have been agreed under the joint authority regime with the Victorian State Government.
Australian Energy Producers Chief Executive Samantha McCulloch said the decision reaffirms the essential role of natural gas to Australia’s energy security and the necessity for continued investment in new gas supply.
“Exploration is a critical first step in the discovery and development of new oil and gas resources needed to ensure Australia’s long-term energy security,” McCulloch said.","Australia’s Albanese Government has opened five new areas for bidding in the Otway Basin for offshore gas exploration to lower power prices, in order to ensure that the domestic industry has access to gas at affordable prices, the country’s Department of Industry, Science and Resources said Dec. 11.

The release of new areas follows a review of the process for making new offshore acreage available for exploration and extensive consultation with the industry and stakeholders, Minister for Resources and Minister for Northern Australia Madeleine King said on the department’s website.

The development also follows an announcement by the Victorian Government on Dec. 10 to release petroleum exploration permits in the Otway and Gippsland basins.

“Exploration and new discoveries will play an important role in underpinning our energy needs and support Australian industry and households as we meet our net zero commitments,” King said.

“The release of new acreage supports our Future Gas Strategy and will help ensure Australians continue to have access to gas at affordable prices,” she added.

The Future Gas Strategy maps the Australian Government’s plan for how gas will support the country’s transition to net zero.

King said the new release areas, located in Commonwealth waters, have been designed to protect neighboring marine parks, with buffer zones established to safeguard marine park boundaries.

All projects will be required to meet strict environmental and emissions standards per usual processes, she said.

Public consultation on the nominated new areas will be open for eight weeks until Feb. 6, 2026, while applications for the exploration permits will close on June 30 next year, she said.

These new release areas have been agreed under the joint authority regime with the Victorian State Government. This offshore acreage complements South Australia’s and the Victorian State Government’s exploration programs, she added.

Releasing new acreage would help address the structural gas shortfalls forecast from 2029 by the Australian Energy Market Operator and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the statement said, recognizing that tackling shortfalls is vital for manufacturers who require gas as a feedstock or as a heat source and cannot transition to alternatives in the short to medium term.

Industry welcomes move

In a separate statement on Dec. 11, the Australian Energy Producers said that it welcomed the release of new acreage.

Australian Energy Producers Chief Executive Samantha McCulloch said the decision reaffirms the essential role of natural gas to Australia’s energy security and the necessity for continued investment in new gas supply.

“Exploration is a critical first step in the discovery and development of new oil and gas resources needed to ensure Australia’s long-term energy security,” McCulloch said.

“Bringing new gas supply online sooner is the only sustainable solution to put downward pressure on prices,” she added.

In June, the Department of Industry, Science and Resources stated on its website that it was conducting a Gas Market Review in conjunction with the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.

The review aims to examine the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism, the Gas Market Code and the Heads of Agreement with east coast LNG exporters, it said at the time.

“With the outcome of the gas market review expected to be announced shortly, we will continue to work with governments on measures to increase gas supply and ensure Australian homes and businesses have reliable and affordable energy,” McCulloch added.

Australia is among the world’s top LNG exporters, with market participants monitoring the country’s production prospects to determine global demand-supply balances and the impact on international prices of the fuel.

According to the Resources and Energy Quarterly report by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources earlier this year, Australia’s LNG export volumes are forecast to reach 82 million mt/year in the fiscal year 2026-27 (July-June), up from a forecast of 80 million mt/year in FY 2025-26.",,N,,2025-12-12 08:57:56.944358

Shipping represented roughly 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions in 2024—placing it on par with some G7 economies.

Container and Bulk Carriers Drive the Sector’s Footprint

Container ships and bulk carriers account for nearly half of global maritime CO₂ emissions. Over the five-year period, container ship emissions rose 14.7% while bulk carrier emissions increased 10.6%. The OECD attributes the spike largely to increased global trade volumes and higher transport intensity—tonne-miles growing faster than GDP.

Fleet characteristics also play a role. Vessels aged 20 years and older now number nearly 80,000 globally, up from about 70,000 in 2019, extending reliance on older, fossil-fueled hulls. Meanwhile, mega-containerships over 10,000 TEU now represent about 42% of the world’s container capacity. While these larger vessels offer better per-tonne fuel performance, they also lock in long-lived fossil infrastructure.

Efficiency Is Improving, but It’s Not Enough

The analysis uses a decomposition method to identify major forces influencing emissions. Fuel intensity—the fuel required per unit of nominal capacity—showed the strongest downward effect, indicating that ships are operating more efficiently due to slow steaming, operational improvements, and compliance with IMO’s Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). These regulatory shifts, however, have not significantly altered the sector’s fuel mix, which remains dominated by oil-based fuels despite growth in LNG and early adoption of methanol-ready designs.

Distance-driven emissions turned positive in the latter part of the period. Geopolitical disruptions—including Red Sea rerouting, Panama Canal constraints from drought, and altered trade flows following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—pushed vessels onto longer routes. This added millions of tonne-miles to global shipping activity and reduced the emissions benefits gained through efficiency.

Capacity utilization trends vary by region. Globally, underutilization has increased emissions by leaving more tonnage in operation than needed. In the OECD fleet, utilization improved slightly, exerting a modest downward effect.

Implications for Policy and the Maritime Transition

The OECD’s findings underscore the scale of the challenge facing the maritime sector as it works toward the IMO’s 2050 net-zero ambition and interim 2030 and 2040 reduction targets. Efficiency gains alone continue to be overtaken by market-driven factors—particularly the growth of global trade and rerouted maritime corridors.

Regulations entering force after 2024 will exert stronger pressure. The EU Emissions Trading System now applies to large ships entering European ports, and FuelEU Maritime will begin limiting the lifecycle carbon intensity of fuels. These measures are expected to push operators toward low-carbon fuels such as green methanol, ammonia, or advanced biofuels—pathways that E+E Leader reporting has shown carry both potential and sustainability risks.

For companies with maritime-linked supply chains, the report highlights rising exposure to carbon costs and route volatility. Many firms are already reevaluating procurement strategies, assessing the carbon intensity of shipping partners, and tracking whether carriers invest in alternative-fuel vessels.

The OECD’s analysis ultimately reinforces a key trend across the global transport sector: operational efficiency is improving, but structural patterns in trade, fleet composition, and fuel availability are determining emissions outcomes. Without accelerated investment in low-carbon fuels and technologies, maritime emissions are likely to remain on an upward trajectory despite regulatory tightening.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251211-121247-b98-Ships%20and%20communication%20network%20concept.%20maritime%20traffic..jpg,N,,2025-12-11 14:56:54.818319

CATL states that since entering the shipping sector in 2017, it has delivered nearly 900 fully electric ships equipped with its battery systems.","CATL, which is primarily known until now for its EV batteries, sees significant future potential in expanding its offerings from land-based mobility to waterways. The company aims to provide the global shipping industry with a new green, intelligent and sustainable development path. CATL expects that battery-electric ships will soon be active not only on rivers, lakes and harbours, but on the oceans.

Su Yiyi, Head of CATL’s Marine Division, stated at Marintec China: “CATL’s marine business already covers inland rivers, lakes and coastal waters and is now evolving towards deep-sea applications. In the near future – possibly within the next three years – we will see fully electric ships on the open sea.”

Ships with a fragmented supplier system

According to CATL, the shipping industry currently faces a fundamental challenge: propulsion, energy supply and maintenance of a ship are typically managed by different partners, leading to coordination issues and unclear responsibilities. Additionally, battery-electric ships face high acquisition costs, a lack of energy infrastructure, range anxiety, complex water conditions and inconsistent technical standards.

These factors represent a major barrier to the large-scale adoption of zero-emission shipping. Moreover, technologies from road transport cannot simply be transferred to ships, as their development must account for extremely demanding conditions such as high humidity, salt spray, long operating hours and high power requirements.

CATL’s new complete solution for battery-electric ships

This is where CATL’s integrated “Ship-Shore-Cloud” solution comes into play. According to the company, it is a bespoke complete solution for the shipping industry, featuring seamless integration from onboard energy systems to landside charging and battery-swapping networks, and cloud-based intelligent management. This approach aims to eliminate the traditional weaknesses of the industry’s fragmented multi-supplier structures.

Onboard, the system integrates batteries, propulsion and intelligent navigation systems to ensure safe and stable operation. On land, a network of charging and battery-swapping stations, along with the “ship-battery separation” model, is designed to significantly reduce energy and cost risks.

CATL states that since entering the shipping sector in 2017, it has delivered nearly 900 fully electric ships equipped with its battery systems. One example is the excursion ship Yujian 77, which operates in Xiamen Bay and has already been featured by us. CATL is also proud of the Changjiang Sanxia 1, the world’s largest fully electric inland passenger ship, and the Qinggang Tug 1, China’s first hybrid tugboat. Additionally, with the Jining 6006, CATL has demonstrated that battery swapping for cargo ships is feasible.

The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios.","The shipping industry's ongoing battle with container losses at sea reveals a complex web of environmental consequences and supply chain vulnerabilities that extend far beyond the initial moment cargo goes overboard.

Each year, thousands of containers slip into the ocean, transforming single shipping incidents into chronic pollution sources that persist for decades while simultaneously disrupting global trade networks.

The mechanics behind these losses combine natural forces with human and technical failures. Rough seas, high waves and strong winds create the immediate physical threat, particularly when containers are improperly stacked or inadequately lashed. Human factors including fatigue, poor communication and complacency during loading operations compound these risks, while mechanical issues such as valve failures or uneven weight distribution further exacerbate the problem.

Joe Kramek, President & CEO of the World Shipping Council (WSC) says: ""Even one container lost is one too many.”

Decades of marine plastic pollution

A February 1997 incident involving the Tokio Express, operating under Evergreen Marine's service at the time, demonstrates how a single container loss can become a long-term environmental liability. Hit by a large wave off the coast of Cornwall, the vessel lost 62 containers overboard, including one loaded with millions of Lego pieces.

The lost cargo has washed up for decades on beaches in Southwest England, making it one of the best-known examples of traceable marine plastic pollution. Many of the Lego pieces were ocean-themed items such as flippers and octopuses, providing marine scientists with valuable long-term data on plastic persistence and drift patterns.

The incident continues to serve as a case study for understanding how plastic pollution disperses across ocean currents. Beachcombers and researchers still document finds of these distinctive pieces, creating an ongoing record of marine debris movement.

The longevity of these plastic items in the marine environment highlights the persistent nature of polymer-based materials. This single container loss has generated decades of environmental impact and scientific observation.

Perishable cargo environmental footprint

Refrigerated container losses present different environmental challenges, as demonstrated by recurring banana spills across European waters.

On 15 November 2025, a vessel transporting bananas for major importers and retailers lost several containers in the English Channel, leading to large numbers of loose bananas, broken boxes and associated packaging washing up along parts of the UK coast.

While the fruit itself biodegrades, the long-term environmental burden comes from non-biodegradable elements such as plastic wrap, strapping, pallets, insulation and cooler foams that persist in marine environments. These materials fragment into microplastics over time, entering the food chain.

The visual impact of perishable cargo losses often generates significant public attention and media coverage. However, the less visible packaging materials create the more enduring pollution problem.

Refrigerated containers also contain coolants and insulation materials that can release harmful substances when compromised. The environmental footprint of these losses extends well beyond the organic cargo itself.

Industrial materials contaminating coastlines

Beyond consumer goods and perishables, industrial materials constitute some of the most severe marine pollution incidents.

The X-Press Pearl incident off Sri Lanka in 2021 released 70 to 75 billion plastic pellets, known as ""nurdles"", now considered one of the largest marine plastic spills in history. The ship was operated by X-Press Feeders and carried cargo for multiple chemical and polymer producers.

These tiny plastic pellets, the raw material for plastic manufacturing, spread rapidly across vast ocean areas and coastlines. Their small size makes recovery virtually impossible, and they persist indefinitely in marine ecosystems.

Other notable cases include consumer goods such as trainers, motorbikes, televisions, whisky and IKEA products arriving on beaches after container losses on major Asia-Europe and transpacific routes. Biobeads and industrial polymers have contaminated shorelines in the UK and elsewhere, creating pollution challenges that differ markedly from organic cargo losses.

The diversity of lost cargo types means coastal communities face varied contamination scenarios. Each material type requires different clean-up approaches and presents unique environmental risks.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/67d4c168c5d3f1fe3d45b35a36f722bd:d38a7b3e0c2c0929be02941b3ebacd31/gettyimages-1032544878.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 15:56:52.432224

Progress is well underway though, whether that's the development of sustainable aviation fuel or the kinds of biofuel or hydrogen that boats are experimenting with.

Regulations are being written to reflect and encourage this gradual transition too. When it comes to ships specifically, a new piece of research by the International Maritime Organization has sought to examine just how effective legislation is at the moment when it comes to nautical sustainability.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, the IMO's study is full of data that could prove crucial for how supply chain professionals understand the day-to-day impact of global fuel rules.

The report, which is titled SO₂ and NOₓ emissions from ships in North‑East Atlantic waters, sets out to measure sulphur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) directly, using aircraft and onshore sensors to sample exhaust plumes from 2019 to 2022.

This approach offers a more precise picture of emissions for a sector that operates largely beyond easy observation.

What kind of impact is tighter regulation having on shipping?

The research shows a dramatic fall in pollution since the 2020 fuel sulphur limit came into effect. Before the rule change in 2019, the average apparent fuel sulphur content (aFSC) across open Atlantic waters was around 3.03%.

By 2021, this had dropped to roughly 0.31%, and further declined to 0.25% by 2022.

Researchers concluded that “a nearly 10-fold decrease in the mean aFSC demonstrates the strong impact the International Maritime Organization regulation change in 2020 had on sulphur emissions from ships.”

The findings underline a smooth transition toward lower-sulphur fuels across the sector.

The study also gauged nitrogen oxide emissions, finding that the NOₓ/CO₂ ratio was significantly lower in ports than at sea, probably because ships rely on smaller auxiliary engines when docked – an operational factor with implications for port logistics and emission tracking.

How are companies complying with sustainable shipping restrictions?

The researchers from the Royal Society of Chemistry also looked at how shipping companies were adhering to new limits.

In 2019, before the new restrictions, eight of the 19 ships sampled surpassed the 3.5% sulphur threshold then in force.

By contrast, during 2021–2022, only five of the 78 ships tested were non‑compliant under the tougher 0.5% cap. This high level of compliance demonstrates the regulation’s effectiveness, although a small proportion of breaches remains.

Failure to comply still poses risks for supply chain stakeholders, ranging from shipment delays to reputational repercussions.

Collecting this evidence required complex operations, including flying an aircraft at altitudes as low as 30 metres to capture and analyse 130 ship exhaust plumes.

The finer details of the study

Within special environmental zones like the European Sulphur Emission Control Area (SECA), stretching across the English Channel, the limits are even stricter. Average sulphur content in these waters was measured at around 0.04%, well below the 0.1% ceiling.

Direct measurements enabled scientists to flag non‑compliant ships that computer models might miss. For example, one container vessel exceeded sulphur limits on the open sea but switched to cleaner fuel closer to shore within SECA boundaries.

This illustrates the intricate fuel‑switching routines global shipping lines must manage, which impact both operational planning and cost efficiency.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/a0d4400bb489589df7433fda5bd66a6c:0d118856c8132941191580789cbe12e2/graphics-for-work-2025-12-10t172834-228.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:04.742795

The new group plans to work with President Trump’s Administration and Congress to establish strong policies that accelerate the use of American-made energy and biofuels in the global maritime sector – thereby establishing U.S. dominance in the future of international maritime shipping.

Adding biofuels such as ethanol, biomethane, bio-LNG, biodiesel, and renewable diesel, among others, to the existing maritime fuel portfolio can fill opportunity gaps and help shippers meet both their economic and environmental goals.

Maritime fuel policies and international frameworks are developing rapidly. Incentivizing the increased use of biofuels creates an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made energy produced from feedstocks grown in the United States like corn, sorghum, and soybeans, as well as the organic byproducts and farm waste from several domestic industries. The maritime sector represents a new opportunity to strongly position American farmers and fuel producers to lead in a developing market, leveraging existing infrastructure and encouraging new investments in energy and maritime sectors while enhancing the economic resilience of U.S. agriculture and rural communities.

ABMI will advocate for policies that expand market access for U.S. farmers and biofuel producers in maritime applications, and the advancement of technologies that deploy these advanced fuels, planning to work with the Trump Administration and Congress to establish the U.S. as a global leader in maritime fuels policy.

“Every day, America generates organic waste that should be turned into clean, domestic energy. U.S. support of the maritime fuel market will grow domestic business, creating new revenue for farmers, and strengthening rural economies. The ABMI will highlight this underutilized opportunity as policymakers shape future U.S. production of maritime fuels,” said Patrick Serfass, Executive Director of ABC and co-chair of the Initiative.

Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of RFA and ABMI co-chair, said: “The maritime sector represents an enormous potential market opportunity for American-made renewable fuels produced from crops grown across America’s heartland. U.S. ethanol is one of the lowest-cost alternative maritime fuels available at scale and represents an incredibly competitive option for the shipping industry worldwide.”

Thoughtfully crafted international frameworks and national policies can drive demand for U.S. agricultural and waste-derived fuels and therefore support American farmers, biofuel producers, and the rural communities that produce them.

This legislation is poised to transform India’s maritime sector by replacing the outdated Merchant Shipping Act of 1958. The urgency to pass the bill was marked by ongoing disruptions related to separate demands concerning electoral roll discussions in Bihar.

The new bill significantly updates the definition of “vessels,” expanding it to encompass various types of watercraft, including mobile offshore drilling units and submersibles. It allows for partial ownership of vessels by Indian citizens, corporations, and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs), subject to regulations that the central government will define. An important provision is the temporary registration of unregistered vessels intended for recycling in India, which is expected to invigorate recycling operations, particularly at hubs like Alang.

A key feature of the Merchant Shipping Bill is the empowerment of the Director-General to oversee maritime education and training. This measure aims to ensure that Indian seafarers receive quality education, thereby enhancing their competitiveness in the global maritime arena. Additionally, the bill mandates pollution prevention certificates for all vessels, aligning India’s regulations with international standards by incorporating treaties such as MARPOL and the Wreck Removal Convention. This aims to reinforce environmental protection within the industry.

The bill further addresses ownership criteria, thereby enhancing India’s shipping capabilities and fleet size, which could position Indian shipping companies to compete effectively on a global scale. Moreover, the legislation aligns with international maritime labor standards, establishes a certification system for Indian seafarers, and ensures access to social security, thus fostering improved welfare and working conditions for seafarers.

Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways, Sarbananda Sonowal, highlighted that the global maritime industry has witnessed notable changes in recent years, creating challenges that necessitated reforms in the outdated 1958 act. The adjustments in ownership and the revamped regulatory framework aim to modernize the maritime sector, boost competitiveness, and align with international benchmarks to meet evolving demands.

In conclusion, the Merchant Shipping Bill, 2024, represents a substantial leap towards modernizing India’s maritime landscape. Its comprehensive provisions emphasize safety, security, sustainability, and the economic potential of the maritime industry, promising growth and better social welfare outcomes. This legislation is positioned to enhance India’s role in global maritime trade and bolster the industry’s overall effectiveness.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Lok-Sabha-Approves-Merchant-Shipping-Bill-2024-Maritime-Revolution.webp.webp,N,,2025-12-11 11:57:15.332516

According to Reuters, oil prices rose after the announcement about the oil tanker.","The US has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, says US president Donald Trump, according to the Reuters news agency.

“We have just seized a tanker off the coast of Venezuela, a very large tanker, very large, the largest ever, in fact, and other things are happening too,” Trump said.

Reuters reports that the seizure has caused oil prices to rise and is likely to increase political tensions between the US and Venezuela.

Trump has ordered a massive build-up of US military presence in Latin America. Recently, fighter jets and tens of thousands of US soldiers have been sent to the region.

The seizure of the oil tanker – a VLCC supertanker – may be a sign that the US will start targeting Venezuela’s oil, which is the country’s main source of income, Reuters writes.

According to the US media outlet CNN, Trump did not elaborate on the reason for the seizure. The president simply stated that it took place “for a very good reason.”

He was also asked what would happen to the oil that the tanker was transporting.

“We’re keeping it, I think,” Trump replied, according to CNN.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi also reported on the incident after Trump’s announcement on social media.

She stated that the seizure was carried out by the FBI, the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) police unit, and the US Coast Guard.

Sanctioned oil

According to Bondi, they acted on a court order to seize the oil tanker. The minister claims it was used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran.

“For several years, the oil tanker has been subject to US sanctions due to its involvement in an illegal oil transport network that supports foreign terrorist organizations,” Bondi writes.

British Vanguard, which deals with maritime risk assessments, has announced, according to Reuters, that the oil tanker “Skipper” is believed to have been seized off the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday.

However, it has not yet been officially confirmed by the US that it is the “Skipper.”

On Thursday night CET, Guyana’s maritime authorities said that the “Skipper” was carrying Venezuelan oil and was sailing under the Guyanese flag without being registered in Guyana.

Following Trump’s announcement, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro addressed his supporters in the capital Caracas, according to the AFP news agency.

“From Venezuela, we ask and demand an end to the illegal and brutal interventionism of the US government in Venezuela and in Latin America,” Maduro said.

According to Reuters, oil prices rose after the announcement about the oil tanker. The price of Brent oil rose 0.4% to USD 62.21 per barrel.

This mandate has triggered the most significant technological and financial upheaval the sector has ever faced. This article explores the core challenge—the decarbonization dilemma—focusing on the complex regulatory landscape (CII, ETS) and the intense, multi-fuel race to find viable, scalable, and safe ""green fuels."" We analyze the leading contenders—ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen—highlighting their pros, cons, and the colossal infrastructure investment required to power the future of global shipping.

The Green Fuel Race: Solving the Decarbonization Dilemma

The biggest hurdle is the ""decarbonization dilemma"": the need to commit billions to a specific fuel pathway without a guaranteed global supply or regulatory consensus. Currently, three contenders dominate the discussion:

1. Green Methanol 🟢

Pros: A well-understood liquid fuel that can be handled using near-conventional bunkering infrastructure. It offers a clear, immediate pathway for transitioning internal combustion engines.

Cons: Lower energy density than Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), meaning larger tanks are required, reducing cargo space. While it burns cleanly, it is highly toxic and its production must be verified as ""green"" (from biomass or renewable hydrogen) to meet climate goals.

2. Green Ammonia ( 🔵

Pros: Expected to be highly scalable and cost-effective as a carrier for hydrogen. It is considered a zero-carbon fuel at the point of combustion (no $\text{CO}_2$ emissions).

Cons: **Highly toxic** and corrosive, requiring extensive new safety protocols and material changes for engines and tanks. Its combustion can produce nitrous oxides ($\text{N}_2\text{O}$), a potent GHG, posing a serious environmental and technical challenge.

3. Green Hydrogen ⚪

Pros: A true zero-emission fuel (water is the only byproduct). Can be used in fuel cells, offering extremely high efficiency for smaller, shorter-distance vessels.

Cons: Requires cryogenic storage and has an extremely low energy density by volume, demanding massive tank sizes. The infrastructure for production, storage, and bunkering is virtually non-existent for deep-sea shipping.

Beyond the Tank: Technology and Operational Efficiency

Decarbonization involves more than just swapping fuels. Immediate and complementary steps are being taken to reduce energy demand and bridge the gap until green fuels are universally available.

Energy Saving Devices (ESDs): Technology such as propeller boss cap fins, air lubrication systems, and optimized hull coatings that physically reduce drag and improve hydrodynamic performance.

Wind-Assisted Propulsion (WAPs): The re-emergence of wind power using modern rotor sails or wing sails to supplement engine power, significantly reducing fuel consumption on long voyages.

Digital Optimization: Using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and advanced software for dynamic route optimization, predictive maintenance, and real-time performance monitoring to minimize fuel burn.

Conclusion: The Cost of Transition and the Path Forward

The journey to net-zero is characterized by immense capital expenditure: billions must be spent on new vessels, engine retrofits, and global bunkering infrastructure. This investment carries a ""first mover"" risk, but also offers a first-mover advantage in charter markets demanding green shipping solutions.

The industry consensus is moving toward a **multi-fuel future**, where different vessel types and trade routes will adopt the most suitable green fuel. Success hinges on unprecedented collaboration between energy producers, technology providers, regulators, and financiers to ensure safety, scalability, and ultimately, a viable, sustainable future for global trade.

The collaboration focuses on container vessels first, which represent approximately 20% of global maritime emissions. By targeting 7,000 to 8,000-ton vessels, the consortium addresses vessels that operate high-volume international trade routes. A separate hybrid system for smaller 2,000-ton feeder ships will enable complete decarbonization across different fleet sizes.

Why Busan’s Leadership Matters for Global Maritime Decarbonization

Busan operates as South Korea’s primary shipping port and ranks among the world’s busiest international hubs. The city’s strategic role in global container trade makes it the ideal location for breakthrough sustainable shipping innovation.

Korean Register, the classification authority overseeing ship design and safety standards, provides critical expertise in validating new propulsion technologies. KR’s involvement ensures any carbon-free systems meet international maritime regulations and can achieve commercial viability at scale.

The Technology Behind Carbon-Free Maritime Innovation

Competitive Advantage: South Korea’s Maritime Innovation Ecosystem

Hanwha Group’s four subsidiaries bring specialized expertise across shipbuilding, power systems design, aerospace engineering, and maritime logistics. This integrated approach accelerates development while ensuring technical excellence across all propulsion system components.

HMM, one of the world’s largest container shipping operators with extensive fleet operational experience, provides critical insight into real-world vessel performance requirements. Their participation ensures designed systems match operational demands of modern international shipping.

“This tripartite agreement aims to advance carbon neutrality in global maritime transportation through the development of innovative propulsion systems.”

— Maritime Industry Experts, Busan Innovation Initiative

What Timeline Should Investors and Shippers Expect?

The consortium has entered the critical design and concept analysis phase, with commercial viability testing as the next major milestone. Full prototype development and real-world testing on demonstration vessels typically require 3-5 years in maritime R&D projects of this complexity.

International regulatory approval through IMO and national maritime authorities adds additional timeline considerations. However, the participation of Korean Register streamlines approval pathways. Early adoption could position HMM vessels and other compatible fleets as sustainability leaders within the shipping industry by 2028-2030.

So How Is COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' ROCE Trending?
Investors would be pleased with what's happening at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings.
COSCO SHIPPING Holdings does have some risks, we noticed we think you should know about.","What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings ( ) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for COSCO SHIPPING Holdings, this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.11 = CN¥43b ÷ (CN¥500b - CN¥130b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2025).

So, COSCO SHIPPING Holdings has an ROCE of 11%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 5.4% generated by the Shipping industry.

In the above chart we have measured COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free .

So How Is COSCO SHIPPING Holdings' ROCE Trending?

Investors would be pleased with what's happening at COSCO SHIPPING Holdings. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 11%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 106%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.

The Key Takeaway

A company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what COSCO SHIPPING Holdings has. Since the stock has returned a staggering 416% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.

Under the theme “Accelerating Action and Mobilizing All Actors to Conserve and Sustainably Use the Ocean,” the conference emphasized the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG14), which targets life below water through a three-pronged Nice Ocean Action Plan.

The three main priorities of the conference included:

Completing multilateral processes related to the ocean.

Mobilizing financial resources for sustainable ocean initiatives.

Strengthening and disseminating marine science knowledge to improve policy-making.

A pivotal aspect of the UNOC was progress on the Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) Treaty, adopted in 2023. This treaty is an international agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) aimed at conserving and sustainably utilizing marine biodiversity in international waters. Key components of the treaty involve establishing marine protected areas (MPAs), mandating environmental impact assessments for high-seas activities, regulating access to marine genetic resources, and providing capacity-building support to developing nations. The treaty aligns with global biodiversity goals, pushing for the protection of 30% of marine and coastal areas by 2030.

Despite 160 countries signing the BBNJ Treaty, only 56 have ratified it, with a requirement of 60 ratifications needed to initiate a 120-day countdown for it to become legally binding. Both India and the United States have not yet ratified it, with India in the process of doing so, and the U.S. still evaluating its position.

The conference acknowledged significant hurdles in advancing the BBNJ Treaty. Disputes over how to share benefits from marine genetic resources, lack of consensus on regulating extraction activities, and warnings about potential risks to ocean ecosystems and biodiversity are major challenges.

Several notable achievements were recorded at UNOC, including:

Financial Commitments: The European Commission pledged over €1 billion, with Germany, New Zealand, and other nations making substantial contributions towards ocean conservation and governance.

Expansion of Marine Protected Areas: French Polynesia committed to creating the world’s largest marine protected area, while Spain planned five new MPAs to protect a significant portion of its marine territory.

Global Coalitions and Initiatives: The conference saw the establishment of the High Ambition Coalition for a Quiet Ocean to address noise pollution and the One Ocean Finance process, which aims to secure funding from blue economy sectors.

In conclusion, the UNOC 2025 made headway in ocean protection through financial pledges, treaty advocacy, and the formation of coalitions, laying the groundwork for stronger governance of international waters and promoting sustainable practices in line with global biodiversity goals.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2025-12-10 19:56:08.306689

Future Maritime Leaders Eye Green Transition in Malaysia

Maritime students in Malaysia learned first-hand how climate action is reshaping the maritime sector during a youth event held in Johor Bahru (8 December).

The event, jointly organized by IMO's GreenVoyage2050 programme, the Malaysian Maritime Department (MMD) and the Netherlands Maritime University College (NMUC), brought together more than 60 university students and 30 maritime lecturers to discuss how shipping and ports are responding to global decarbonization efforts and how young professionals can contribute to these efforts.

The focus was on emerging career pathways and training requirements linked to low- and zero-emission fuels, port operations, digital solutions and sustainable maritime services. Participants also discussed Malaysia's role as a key maritime and logistics hub and the need for a skilled workforce to support the transition in line with the IMO 2023 GHG Strategy.

A key feature was a dialogue with Captain Emanuel, one of Malaysia's pioneering women Pilot Harbour Masters from the Port of Tanjung Pelepas (PTP). She offered insights into her daily responsibilities, leadership experience and the evolving skills required as the sector moves toward lower-emission operations.

""If you have a dream to work in the maritime sector, find role models, stay curious and keep working towards it. The industry is changing, and there is space for more women and young people to shape its future,"" Captain Emanuel told participants.

Her participation underscored the importance of visible role models in attracting more women to maritime careers.

Prof. Dato' Sri Dr. Captain Razali Yaacob, Founder & Executive Chairman from the Netherlands Maritime University College added: ""Connecting students with practitioners and current sustainability challenges helps them see the breadth of opportunities available in maritime careers today and the important role they can play in shaping the sector's future.""

The event was part of GreenVoyage2050's wider efforts to promote awareness, inclusivity and capacity-building in maritime decarbonization, ensuring young people are equipped to support the global transition to sustainable shipping.

This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.","Autonomous vessels are set to revolutionize the shipping industry, whereby they will gradually and eventually transform global maritime trade through advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensor technologies and remote operations. As traditional shipping faces ever-growing challenges - from aging fleets to rising safety concerns to ever-increasing environmental rules and regulations - autonomous ships offer a compelling solution that promises increased efficiency and safety whilst simultaneously reducing carbon emissions and operational costs.

Whereas fully unmanned ships remain on the horizon, 2025 marks a pivotal milestone as semi-autonomous ships enter practical commercial service, leveraging remote control centres and advanced AI-driven navigation to optimise routs, enhance situational awareness and mitigate human error. Supported by regulatory frameworks and rapid technological advancements, autonomous shipping is set to become a cornerstone of the maritime industry, ushering in a new era where intelligent machines and human oversight work cohesively to redefine how goods move across our oceans.

The IMO's involvement

For the past few years, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has already been laying the groundwork for the eventual widespread introduction of autonomous ships into the shipping industry. The aim of the IMO is to regulate new and advancing technologies through its framework, whereby they seek to balance the benefits from said technologies against concerns of security and safety, the impact on the environment and on the facilitation of international trade, the potential costs to the shipping industry and their impact on personnel, both onboard and on shore. IMO wants to ensure the framework regulating Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) keeps up the rapidly evolving technological developments.

Following the completion of the IMO's scoping exercise on MASS back in 2021, the main goal of which was to assess which existing IMO instruments could apply to ships of varying degrees of automation, the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), through its 109th session, agreed to a revised roadmap for the development of an official MASS Code.

The scoping exercise covered four degrees of autonomy regarding MASS, these being:

1. Ships with automated processes and decision support systems. Seafarers are still present onboard to operate and control the ship's systems and functions. Certain operations may be automated and at times unsupervised, with seafarers onboard ready to take control in case of malfunctions or errors.

2. Remote-controlled ships with seafarers on board. The ship is controlled and operated from another location whereby seafarers are available onboard to take and operate the ship's systems and functions.

3. Remote-controlled ships without seafarers onboard. The ship is controlled from another location without the presence of the human element onboard.

4. Fully autonomous ships. The operating system of these ships would be able to make decisions and determine specific actions by itself.

The outcome of this scoping exercise highlighted a number of critical issues which were present across several of the IMO's instruments, whereby these involved the creation of MASS terminology and definitions, including an internationally agreed definition of MASS and clarification on the definitions of ""master"", ""crew"" and ""responsible person"", particularly in Degrees Three (remote-controlled ships) and Four (fully autonomous ships) as described earlier.

Other key issues identified included the need to address the functional and operational requirements of the remote-control station/centre and the possible designation of a remote operator as seafarer. Further potential gaps that were identified related to manual operations and alarms on the bridge, provisions related to actions by personnel such as firefighting, cargo stowage and securing, maintenance, search and rescue, watchkeeping and information required to be kept onboard for safe operation of the ship.

At the following session, at MSC 110, the abovementioned roadmap was fine-tuned and the committee agreed on the following milestones:

MSC 111 (scheduled for May 2026) will aim to finalise and adopt the non-mandatory MASS Code;

MSC 112 (scheduled for December 2026) will seek to develop a framework for the Experience-Building Phase (EBP) of MASS;

The IMO plans to kickstart development of the mandatory MASS Code in 2028, based on the non-mandatory MASS Code and results from the EBP;

By 1st July 2030 at the latest, the goal is to have widespread adoption of the mandatory MASS Code, whilst its entry into force is scheduled for 1st January 2032, at the earliest.

It is important to keep in mind that the non-mandatory MASS will merely act as a supplement to The International Convention on the Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) and that its entry into force will not automatically relax any of the requirements as laid out under the latter. Exemptions from the requirements of SOLAS must be agreed upon by the flag State during the approval process of the non-mandatory MASS Code.

Key issues that are yet to be addressed are the roles and responsibilities of both the master and the remote operator, general questions surrounding liability and the onboard carriage of certificates. The IMO determined that its internal committees are to discuss these issues at future meetings before taking an official position on the way forward, seeing as this will affect the global shipping industry.

Benefits of autonomous ships

Autonomous ships offer significant operational advantages reducing human error, lowering crew-related costs and enhancing overall safety. One of the biggest achievements would be mitigation of human error, seeing as it is the cause behind 96% of all maritime incidents. The advanced AI and sensor systems onboard autonomous ships enable precise navigation and real-time hazard detection, which lead to fewer accidents, thus performing overall safer voyages.

Moreover, autonomous vessels optimize route planning and engine performance, ensuring improved fuel efficiency and reduced operating costs. The reduction, and eventual elimination of onboard crew requirements not only cuts costs of labour but also allows ships to be designed with more cargo space, further enhancing economic viability.

On the environmental front, autonomous ships contribute to cleaner maritime operations by minimizing fuel consumption through optimized navigation and the integration of alternative, low-emission fuels. These vessels are equipped with sophisticated monitoring systems that swiftly detect and mitigate environmental risks such as oil spills or leaks. By supporting smarter logistics and reducing unnecessary voyages, autonomous shipping plays a crucial role in meeting global decarbonization goals, ultimately fostering a safer and more sustainable maritime industry.

Autonomous ships, by virtue of their advanced automation and optimized operation, are estimated to significantly reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, thereby aligning with European Union's (EU) stringent emission reduction targets, one of these being the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS).

EU ETS, which operates on a cap-and-trade principle, enables shipping companies buy and sell allowances for their emissions, meaning that autonomous vessels could benefit from lower allowance costs due to their cleaner operations. This creates an incentive for shipping operators to adopt MASS technologies, as the reduced emissions directly translate into fewer allowances needed and thus, lower compliance costs and aligning with the market-driven push towards a globally greener shipping sector.

Furthermore, the EU's ongoing integration of carbon removal technologies highlights a broader policy environment where innovations like MASS can contribute significantly to achieving ambitious net-zero goals while benefiting from and contributing to a sustainable, market-based climate policy system.

The pitfalls of autonomy

Autonomous ships, whilst offering revolutionary benefits, come with significant challenges that must be addressed to ensure their safe and reliable integration into the maritime industry. One of the foremost concerns is cybersecurity. These vessels, being heavily dependent on digital communication and automated control systems, are vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks.

Such breaches could disrupt navigation, impair situational awareness or even hijack control of the ship, potentially leading to collisions, environmental disasters or theft of cargo. Given the complexity of integrating operational technology with information technology systems, the security framework for autonomous ships requires robust design, continuous monitoring, and real-time anomaly detection to effectively mitigate these risks.

Operationally, autonomous vessels face technical and regulatory pitfalls. The reliability of AI in interpreting complex and unpredictable maritime environments remains a challenge, especially under adverse weather or congested port conditions. Additionally, the legal landscape has yet to fully catch up, with ambiguities surrounding insurance coverage and compliance with international maritime conventions.

The human element also plays a major role as the transition to autonomous operations confronts resistance from seafarers concerned about job security and highlights the need for new training paradigms for remote operators and shore-based personnel. Lastly, the high upfront investment costs and the infrastructural changes required to accommodate autonomous ships add layers of financial and logistical complexity that may slow widespread adoption. Overall, these challenges call for a cautious, phased implementation strategy coupled with ongoing technological innovation and international regulatory cooperation.

Conclusion

The rise of autonomous vessels represents a transformative leap for the shipping industry, bringing with it promises to enhance safety, efficiency and environmental sustainability whilst simultaneously reshaping fundamental operational standards and principles. Central to this evolution is the proactive role of the IMO in developing a comprehensive regulatory framework tailored to MASS.

With the IMO's ongoing efforts culminating in the forthcoming MASS Code, regulations are being crafted to address critical aspects such as navigation autonomy, safety management, liability and crew responsibilities both in remote and in fully autonomous operations. This regulatory progression not only facilitates innovation but also ensures that autonomous ships integrate seamlessly and safely into the global maritime ecosystem, setting the course for a future where autonomous shipping becomes the industry's new standard.

With Malaysia's accession to the IMO Council, the launching of the Maritime Masterplan in 2026 is timely.","MALAYSIA has been re-elected to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Council under Category C for the 2026-2027 term — for the 11th consecutive year.

One of the IMO's principal goals is the commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by about 2050, in tandem with interim goals for reducing the carbon footprint in shipping.

Malaysia prioritises the adoption of low-carbon technology and fuels, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), biofuels, and hydrogen, in order to accomplish fleet carbon reductions.

We seek to decrease our maritime carbon footprint by incentivising shipowners to retrofit vessels with energy-efficient designs and alternative propulsion systems, consequently complying with the IMO's Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and Carbon Intensity Indicator requirements.

As a key player in Southeast Asia's trade routes, Malaysia has the potential to leverage this role to align national policies with IMO objectives, therefore assuring sustainability, safety, and competitiveness in an evolving global shipping environment.

The upcoming Malaysia Maritime Masterplan 2026–2040, scheduled for launch next year, will serve as a framework for changing the nation's marine industry into a resilient, sustainable, and competitive structure.

From an academic perspective, the 2026–2040 framework represents our most concerted effort to synchronise maritime governance, infrastructure modernisation, and blue economy development.

It builds upon lessons learnt from the Malaysia Shipping Master Plan 2017–2022 (MSMP), which strengthened fleet competitiveness, promoted regulatory transparency, and cultivated maritime human capital.

While the MSMP achieved significant progress, challenges remained in ship financing, port integration, innovation adoption, and workforce sustainability, all of which are being addressed under the new masterplan.

The Maritime Masterplan integrates climate action and low-carbon initiatives into domestic shipping operations.

This not only aligns with IMO's environmental guidelines but also establishes Malaysia as a leader in sustainable shipping within Asean, attracting environmentally-aware multinational carriers and decreasing operational costs via enhanced efficiency.

Maritime safety is also among the fundamental objectives of the masterplan, with continuous initiatives aimed at accident prevention, piracy and robbery suppression, and the welfare of seafarers.

In order to stay competitive, Malaysia's plans emphasise digitalisation and trade facilitation to preserve its competitive advantage.

The masterplan emphasises human capital development, targeting the specialised training of maritime professionals in digital competencies, maritime cybersecurity, and sustainable operations, targeting the global deficit of proficient seafarers.

By cultivating a skilled workforce, Malaysia guarantees that its shipping industry stays adaptable in the face of technology challenges, like autonomous boats and AI-driven operations.

Malaysia's dedication to the Women in Maritime initiative is equally vital, aligning with the IMO's enduring goal of enhancing female representation within the industry.

We seek to develop a more diverse, innovative, and future-ready maritime workforce by enhancing educational opportunities, advancing leadership programmes and enacting gender-inclusive policies at work.

The masterplan advocates for the blue economy, utilising marine resources to foster sustainable development in sectors like aquaculture, offshore renewable energy, and tourism.

This comprehensive strategy fulfils IMO objectives and bolsters Malaysia's competitiveness by attracting foreign direct investment, generating employment, and augmenting its participation in global trade volumes.

With Malaysia's accession to the IMO Council, the launching of the Maritime Masterplan in 2026 is timely.

This comprehensive 15-year strategy outlines a framework for addressing issues such as geopolitical conflicts, climate change, and technology advancements, while leveraging opportunities in global commerce.

Natural gas prices continue to diverge: Asian JKM declined to $10.66/mmBtu—near the threshold that attracts smaller buyers—while Henry Hub surpassed $5/mmBtu. Despite fundamentals remaining robust, with Atlantic spot rates at $130,000/day, most companies now stand on the cusp of change, testing support levels that will determine the sector’s next direction.

UPI & SPX

The UP World LNG Shipping Index, which tracks listed LNG shipping companies, lost 1.70 points (1.05%), closing at 160.72 points, while the S&P 500 index gained 0.31%. The chart below illustrates the performance of both indices with weekly data.

Broader View

UPI has reached its long-term support level, similar to the end of 2023, when growth in the final weeks of the year pushed the index into positive territory. We will discuss this topic in more detail in the Chart of the Week on our website.

The price of natural gas for Asia is declining slowly, while it is declining more rapidly for Europe. This is due to warmer weather. Interestingly, the price of US gas (Henry Hub) is rising and has surpassed $5 per mmBtu. The price of January deliveries to Asia dropped from $10.90/mmBtu to $10.66/mmBtu, which, according to Argus Media, is close to the threshold that attracts smaller Asian buyers. According to S&P Global Energy, the daily reference price for January deliveries to Western Europe (NWM), based on ex-ship (DES), is $8.787/mmBtu, representing a $0.45/mmBtu discount compared to the price at the TTF hub. Daily spot prices for LNG tankers remain at $130,000 for the Atlantic and $87,500 for the Pacific, according to Spark Commodities.

The declining price of gas will boost demand, but shipping company shares are dropping. One reason is the limited influence of spot rates on fleets mainly operating under long-term contracts.

The ratio of declining to rising companies from UPI was 12:9, with a median movement of -0.26%. Trading volume reached a record high.

Constituents

The declines were not significant, remaining below 2%, with many less than half a per cent. However, COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation (SS: 600026) experienced the most severe loss, falling by 5.3%. The price reached a support level amid increased volume, and the coming weeks will determine the next direction.

The second company with a loss beginning with a two is NYK Line (TSE: 9101). Here, the loss was 2.4%. Despite this decline, the share price remains above support, although only just.

Awilco LNG (OSE: ALNG) and Exmar (BSE: EXM) recorded almost identical losses, differing by one hundredth of a per cent. These were 1.37% and 1.38%, respectively. Nevertheless, Awilco seems to be poised for more significant growth for the second week in a row, while Exmar is moving sideways.

In percentage terms, further changes are not significant, but one group demonstrates a broader trend. This primarily involves the ongoing movement towards support levels of individual companies. This applies to MISC (KLSE: 3816), Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (TSE: 9104), “K” Line (TSE: 9107), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Shell (NYSE: SHEL).

Among the rising companies, New Fortress Energy (NYQ: NFE) once again led with a nearly 29% increase, while Korea Line Corporation (KRX: 005880) rose by almost 14%. KLC broke out of its sideways trend on very high volume and nearly reached the highest prices within its sideways trading range since the summer.

Adnoc L&S (ADX: ADNOCLS) rose nearly 5%, trying to sustain its growth trend after a correction.

Dynagas LNG Partners (NYSE: DLNG) made another attempt to rebound from support, rising 4.17%. It has not yet broken through the range.

Golar LNG (NYQ: GLNG) increased for the second consecutive week, returning to its previously broken support level. The rise was 3.6%.

Excelerate Energy (NYQ: EE) made a cautious attempt at growth, rising above the primary resistance zone, which is a price level that has not been sustained. The increase was 2.1%.

Nakilat (QSE: QGTS) remains in the support area but records a 0.5% growth.

The overall impression of the individual companies is therefore not negative, but they are on the cusp of change. However, strong fundamentals do not justify a long-term break through support levels; quite the opposite.

Crystal Ball

The late-summer rise was rejected, and UPI returned to its previous range, where it now trades. This area provides firm support. In the short term, we estimate a rise in volatility of UPI´s constituents.

Our outlook remains positive in the long term. Rising spot rates, the scrapping of steam vessels, and new liquefaction capacities push the sector higher.",,N,,2025-12-09 18:56:11.647196

The sector will also be affected by the lower GDP growth we expect across most major economies in 2026 compared to 2025, with downside risk from any correction in financial markets. A key event risk across shipping segments is a resumption of Red Sea transits leading to a reduction in tonne-mile demand, although there is limited visibility on this possible development

Tariff disputes have moderated expectations for volume growth, particularly for container shipping, in 2025 and 2026. The medium-term impact from protectionist measures remains difficult to quantify but should be negative overall. An increase in trade protectionism could also alter trade flows and limit demand for some high-margin or critical products over the medium term, although some new trade lanes could strengthen to offset those more affected by tariffs.

The initiative aims to drive coordinated research, investment and deployment across industries with high emissions.

A Strategic Push for Hard-to-Abate Sectors

The roadmap focuses on sectors such as cement, power and steel—areas where emissions are difficult to reduce with conventional methods. By promoting CCUS, India aims to develop scalable solutions that can extract, utilise or store carbon dioxide generated from industrial and energy systems.

Government Funding and Institutional Support

Launched by the Principal Scientific Adviser Ajay Kumar Sood, the initiative will draw from the government’s ₹1 lakh crore Research, Development and Innovation funding pathways. This support is expected to accelerate breakthroughs and reduce technology-deployment timelines. Earlier this year, the government also announced five CCU testbeds in the cement sector to create a research cluster for industrial decarbonisation.

How CCUS Works and Global Debate

CCUS includes processes that separate CO₂, compress and transport it, and inject it into geological formations for permanent storage. Alternatively, captured CO₂ may be reused as feedstock for industrial products. While CCUS is widely viewed as essential for net-zero transitions, some experts warn it may prolong fossil fuel dependence and add greenhouse emissions if not deployed carefully.

Exam Oriented Facts

India launched its first national CCUS R&D roadmap in 2025.

The initiative supports the 2070 net-zero emissions target.

₹1 lakh crore RDI funding will accelerate CCUS technologies.

Five CCU testbeds were created earlier in the cement sector.

Shipping is becoming more complex, and Anglo-Eastern is responding with it. 2025 brought significant uncertainty, with changing regulations and tariffs being the biggest topics. Anglo-Eastern reflagged certain vessels in response to tariffs, though always at the owner’s discretion.

The company manages more than 50 dual-fuel vessels of various fuels, with 87 under newbuilding and project management. Highlights include Windcat Rotterdam (IMO: 9995337), a next-generation offshore support vessel, as well as the first wind-assisted aframax, Brands Hatch (IMO: 1034199), and two ammonia-ready newcastlemaxes.

In 2025, Anglo-Eastern launched Sustainability and Performance Services, combining environmental compliance and performance services to help owners, charterers and operators. It boasts that its tools have saved a combined 225,000 tonnes of fuel, or $135m.

Anglo-Eastern set a 2030 target for 30% of its officers to be promoted to management before turning 30, to speed up certifications earlier in their careers.

02 / Tommy Olofsen, OSM Thome

Norway’s OSM Thome heads into 2026 under the new leadership of group managing director Tommy Olofsen, following the retirement in November 2025 of chief executive Finn Amund Norbye.

The 2023 mega-merger of OSM Maritime Group and Singapore’s Thome Ship Management created a giant with more than 1,000 ships under management, employing some 30,000 seafarers, from 20 offices around the world.

Asset manager Oaktree, which bought into OSM Maritime Group in 2018, sold its stake to JP Morgan Asset Management in August. OSM founder Bjørn Tore Larsen and Skagerak Holding, owned by the Eek Thorstensen family that founded Thome, continue to have “significant ownership stakes” in OSM Thome.

03 / René Kofod-Olsen, V.Group

René Kofod-Olsen takes issue with calling V.Group a mere technical manager, preferring “global shipping services company”. What matters is not the number of ships under management, he says, but “the quality that we are delivering on those ships”.

That said, with 900 ships in its fleet — and sizeable services and digital divisions expected to stand on their own two feet — V.Group is in a good position.

Kofod-Olsen says scale is increasingly important in his business as the industry gets more complex. Shipmanagers running 50 or fewer ships are fighting an uphill battle, he warned in November 2025.

V.Group is working with tanker company International Seaways to make ships more female-friendly. Kofod-Olsen said diversity was a “must-win battle for the entire industry”.

04 / Jesper Kristensen, Synergy Marine

Jesper Kristensen joined as Synergy’s group chief executive in March, after 34 years at Unifeeder, and succeeding long-time leader Rajesh Unni.

Company highlights over the past 12 months included a carbon capture refit on an LR1 tanker, one of the first in its class, and converting a 30-year-old liquefied natural gas carrier into a modern floating storage and regasification unit.

The company is expanding into managing methanol-fuelled containerships for an Asian shipowner and formed a joint venture with a Norwegian operator of geared bulkers.

A sea training institute in India will open in 2026 with capacity for 500 trainees a year. The group also expects more consolidation among mid-tier managers as compliance, digital and ESG requirements intensify.

05 / Sebastian von Hardenberg, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement

Hamburg-based BSM strengthened its expertise in the LNG segment, when its LNG specialty arm Pronav took on management of the FSRU Turquoise P (IMO: 9823883) in the Aegean Sea near Izmir, Turkey.

BSM took on the first methanol vessel, has 50 ships with LNG engines, and announced it will manage the world’s first ammonia bunkering vessel.

It has six maritime training centres — the most recent opened in Ghana in August — as well as 10 shipmanagement centres and 28 crew service centres. The company employs 40,000 crew and 2,000 people on shore.

06 / Rajalingam Subramaniam, Fleet Management

Fleet Management is part of Hong Kong’s Caravel Group, led by commodity trading legend Harry Banga and his son Angad Banga.

2025 was its first year under managing director Rajalingam Subramaniam, who joined from Malaysian shipowner MISC in January.

It opened its first Athens office that month, and in March acquired the International Maritime Institute, a training centre in Noida, India. It is expanding in Japan and the Philippines, where it opened an enlarged crewing and training facility in the capital Manila.

The company has 620 ships under technical management (300 bulkers, 220 tankers and 100 containerships and PCTCS), with another 130 newbuildings in the pipeline.

07 / Mark O’Neil, Columbia

Columbia Group has expanded across its integrated maritime, logistics, leisure, and energy and offshore services platform in 2025.

The company got into the FuelEU Maritime pooling business through its EmissionsLink platform, hoping to capitalise on confusion over emissions rules — especially since the International Maritime Organization Net-Zero Framework delay, which the company warned could lead to overlapping regional rules.

Columbia formed a JV in 2025 with Egypt’s Pan Marine Shipping Services, saying this will let it work more closely with local talent and institutions.

08 / Haakon Lenz, Wilhelmsen Ship Management

Norway’s Wilhelmsen Ship Management, celebrating its 50th anniversary in 2025, is now under the leadership of Haakon Lenz, following the retirement of chief executive Carl Schou.

The company has come a long way since it was born out of the Hong Kong liner service Barber Blue Seas in 1975.

Lenz has said having just over 300 vessels is about where the company needs to be, if it is to make the most of efficiencies while keeping in touch with customers and seafarers.

The company hopes to convince owners of the benefits of third-party shipmanagement by helping deal with more complicated regulations.

09 / Guo Jinkui, Seacon Shipping Group

China’s Seacon Shipping has continued to grow steadily, with notable progress in crew-only management in 2025. The company attributes this to enhanced crew training, especially for LNG and car carriers.

The company has also got into the ship leasing business, acquiring 40% of CIMC Xinde Leasing, and establishing the first FuelEU compliance pool in China.

Seacon says it has also recently developed a “Seacon-AI” model to enhance its capability and efficiency. Approval from the China Classification Society has also been gained for its new shipmanagement software platform.

10 / John Rowley, Wallem

Hong Kong-based Wallem celebrated 100 years of being based in the city, where it moved 22 years after its founding in Norway by shipbroker and agent Haakon ‘Typhoon’ Wallem in 1903.

Wallem plans to stick around in Hong Kong for another century by prioritising safety, quality and sustainable growth while adapting to technological changes and decarbonisation.

A report by the Global Maritime Forum warned that labour shortages have reached a 17-year high, threatening the resilience of global supply chains.
Cyprus, one of the world’s top three ship-management hubs, relies heavily on internationally sourced seafarers to operate the vessels under its management.
According to the Chambers Global Practice Guide, Cyprus is the largest third-party ship-management centre in Europe.
A tightening global supply of trained seafarers could affect recruitment, increase operational costs and complicate the adoption of alternative fuels across the Cyprus-managed fleet.","The global shipping industry is facing an escalating human-resources crisis as more seafarers leave life at sea for work ashore, according to reporting by Paul Bartlett, who noted during a COP30 side-event titled ‘The Global Seafarer Emergency’ that the trend now threatens the safe operation of the fleet carrying more than 80 per cent of world trade.

Growing dissatisfaction among crews reflects a familiar list of pressures, bullying, discrimination, excessive working hours, fatigue, little or no shore leave and limited connectivity with family and friends.

In many cases, contracts are extended for months, contributing to sustained physical and psychological strain.

At the webinar, Lloyd’s Register Chief Marketing Officer Philippa Charlton said shipping underpins global trade across containers, dry and liquid cargo, and gases.

She added that the sector’s shift to low- and zero-carbon fuels requires extensive new training in methanol, ammonia and hydrogen for both new recruits and existing seafarers.

Lloyd’s Register Foundation Chief Executive Ruth Boumphrey outlined the scale of the challenge.

Around 1.9 million seafarers currently work on 112,500 merchant ships worldwide, with half coming from the Asia-Pacific region, 33 per cent from Europe and 4 per cent from Africa, while women account for just 1.3 per cent of the global workforce.

She also noted that 64 per cent have not received any training on decarbonisation or new fuels over the past two years. By 2030, an estimated 450,000 will require specialist training, rising to 800,000 thereafter.

Recent data elsewhere reinforce the seriousness of the situation.

The International Chamber of Shipping estimates the global seafaring workforce at 1,892,720, while a Drewry forecast points to a shortage of senior officers reaching 10 per cent by 2030 due to fleet expansion, early retirements and limited new entry.

Surveys also show deteriorating conditions: one 2025 study found 42 per cent of seafarers plan to retire early, with many reporting delayed or incomplete wage payments.

Meanwhile, the ITF recorded a 30 per cent surge in abandonment cases in 2025, with more than 2,286 seafarers stranded on 222 vessels.

A report by the Global Maritime Forum warned that labour shortages have reached a 17-year high, threatening the resilience of global supply chains.

Capt Stylianos Dimouleas, founder of Almi Tankers and a former seafarer, highlighted the pressures crews face during geopolitical tensions and regional conflicts.

Welfare and wellbeing, he said, must form part of management systems, adding that digital connectivity “is a right, not a benefit”.

He also noted that leadership and management training for senior officers helps strengthen safety culture across fleets.

The implications extend far beyond the ships themselves, particularly for countries with large maritime clusters.

Cyprus, one of the world’s top three ship-management hubs, relies heavily on internationally sourced seafarers to operate the vessels under its management.

According to the Chambers Global Practice Guide, Cyprus is the largest third-party ship-management centre in Europe.

More than 200 shipping-related companies are active on the island, employing around 55,000 seafarers worldwide. Recent financial data show ship-management revenues in Cyprus reached €978 million in the first half of 2025, with crew-related costs accounting for 66 per cent of total expenses, emphasising the industry’s dependence on an increasingly strained global workforce.

For Cyprus, whose maritime priorities will feature prominently during its EU Council Presidency in 2026, the growing labour drain at sea intersects directly with the sector’s decarbonisation and safety objectives.

A tightening global supply of trained seafarers could affect recruitment, increase operational costs and complicate the adoption of alternative fuels across the Cyprus-managed fleet.

Taken together, the accelerating exodus from seafaring, the widening training gap and the rise in abandonment cases demonstrate a sector under significant stress at a critical moment.",,N,,2025-12-09 06:56:10.035187

Impacts of the delayed vote The one-year postponement carries significant implications for maritime stakeholders, affecting investment timelines, compliance planning, and ESG accountability.
In the absence of a single global standard, jurisdictions such as the European Union and the United Kingdom are advancing their own maritime carbon pricing systems, and others may follow.
Looking ahead The one-year postponement offers maritime companies a window, but not a waiver.","A key global decarbonization milestone for maritime shipping has been postponed. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) voted during its October meeting to defer, opens new tab by one year a decision on the much-anticipated Net-Zero Framework, opens new tab, an industry-wide regulatory regime intended to require binding greenhouse-gas (GHG) standards and a global carbon pricing mechanism for shipping.

The delay leaves the shipping sector in regulatory limbo even as companies, investors, and insurers press ahead with net-zero goals. It also raises fresh questions for legal, commercial, and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) teams about how to keep decarbonization strategies on track while expectations for formal regulation remain unsettled.

What the framework would have done

Although formal adoption has been pushed back, the framework previously negotiated by IMO member states remains a useful roadmap. Under the terms agreed in April 2025, the package would have introduced a dual system combining a fuel-intensity standard and a market-based compliance mechanism.

Ships of 5,000 gross tons and above, representing roughly 85% of global shipping emissions, would have been required to limit the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted per unit of energy. Vessels exceeding that threshold would either purchase Remedial Units (RUs) or pay a carbon fee, while ships outperforming the standard would earn Surplus Units (SUs) that could be banked or traded. Earlier drafts pegged the fees at about $100 per metric ton of CO2-equivalent for lower-tier breaches and $380 per ton for more severe noncompliance.

Revenues from those charges were slated to flow into a new IMO Net-Zero Fund, projected to raise $11–12 billion annually between 2028 and 2030. The fund would finance alternative fuel infrastructure, energy efficiency retrofits, and capacity building assistance for developing and small-island states.

The rule’s first compliance period was expected to begin around 2027 or 2028, giving the industry a limited window to adapt before obligations formally took effect.

Impacts of the delayed vote

The one-year postponement carries significant implications for maritime stakeholders, affecting investment timelines, compliance planning, and ESG accountability.

Alternative-fuel initiatives such as ammonia, methanol, and hydrogen bunkering depend on a predictable regulatory environment to attract capital and scale infrastructure. Without clear long-term rules in place, financing and deployment are likely to slow as investors reassess the commercial case for cleaner fuels.

For companies that had already begun preparing for the IMO framework, whether through carbon pricing models, fuel switch strategies, or contract revisions, the pause introduces uncertainty rather than relief. The underlying legal and operational architecture remains essential, but the absence of a firm regulatory anchor means planning must now account for a wider range of potential outcomes.

At the same time, ESG and litigation risks persist. Many carriers and logistics providers have set voluntary net-zero targets, and those commitments remain subject to investor scrutiny regardless of regulatory delays. If tangible progress lags behind public pledges, companies may face allegations of greenwashing or misrepresentation, particularly as disclosure standards tighten across jurisdictions.

The delay also increases the likelihood of regional fragmentation. In the absence of a single global standard, jurisdictions such as the European Union and the United Kingdom are advancing their own maritime carbon pricing systems, and others may follow. The resulting patchwork could complicate compliance for global operators and create uneven cost structures until an international framework is ultimately adopted.

What maritime stakeholders can do now

While the IMO finalizes its approach, maritime companies, financiers, and legal advisers can treat this interim period as a strategic window to strengthen compliance foundations, enhance operational resilience, and position themselves for long-term advantage in the event global rules do take effect. Stakeholders should focus in on the following areas.

Fuel strategy and contract readiness

Maritime companies should assess each vessel’s fuel intensity baseline, modeling alternative fuel scenarios and incorporating carbon compliance provisions into charterparties, ship management contracts, and fuel supply agreements. Clear terms on emissions liability, audit rights, and cost allocation will be critical as carbon performance becomes a defining commercial metric.

At the same time, early investment in low-carbon fuel partnerships (e.g., green ammonia, methanol, bio-LNG) and infrastructure projects can help operators manage future price volatility, mitigate regulatory risk, and secure a competitive advantage as the industry moves toward decarbonization.

Data monitoring and verification systems

Effective decarbonization requires rigor. Firms should consider deploying or upgrading emissions monitoring systems, fuel consumption analytics, voyage optimization software, and third-party verification protocols. Transparency will be a major target for investor and litigation scrutiny.

Disclosure, governance, and ESG alignment

Board-level oversight of climate strategy now overlaps directly with compliance risk. Legal teams should ensure that emissions and other ESG disclosures reflect credible transition pathways. Misstatements or overly optimistic timelines may expose firms to fiduciary duty or securities law claims.

Scenario planning and carbon price readiness

Even absent formal regulation, companies should stress-test multiple carbon price trajectories, fuel availability timelines, and compliance cost impacts. Legal counsel should prepare for a scenario in which IMO pricing reemerges in 2026 at higher levels than initially projected. Risk mitigation strategies may include hedging, alternative fuel leases, or early vessel retirement strategies.

Regional regimes and supply chain exposure

Firms should continue monitoring regional regimes and the demands of supply chain actors for low-carbon shipping services. Legal teams should evaluate risks of indirect exposure through charters with cargo owners, scope 3 disclosure obligations, and contractual carveouts for non-compliant vessels.

Transition opportunities and ESG takeaways

Although the framework delay is a setback for regulatory clarity, it does not change the decarbonization direction: The maritime shipping industry’s emissions matter, and ESG stakeholders are watching. Companies that continue advancing their transition plans now will be better positioned to meet investor expectations, secure financing, and shape the rules once they arrive.

Early movers stand to gain a distinct advantage by investing in alternative fuel access, low-carbon vessels, and fuel contract strategies that appeal to cargo owners and financiers. Proactively upgrading monitoring systems, contracts, and fuel arrangements can also reduce future stranded-asset risk and potential litigation exposure.

Additionally, demonstrating measurable progress through credible data, retrofits, and low-carbon commitments can help build stakeholder confidence, reinforce ESG credibility, and keep companies aligned with net-zero targets even before formal regulation takes effect.

Looking ahead

The one-year postponement offers maritime companies a window, but not a waiver. Stakeholders should treat this period not as a pause but as a preparation phase. The next IMO session (expected around October 2026) will likely revisit the framework. When that happens, the baseline for compliance may shift, meaning strategic readiness today will be key to risk mitigation in the future.

Legal, finance, and operations teams should synchronize efforts now on modeling scenarios, negotiating contracts, mapping fuel supply access, strengthening disclosure and governance, and ramping up efficiency programs.",,N,,2025-12-09 06:56:16.188289

Speaking during a panel debate at Travel Weekly’s Sustainability Summit, Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade was confident the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RSM) – a UK government scheme to support investment in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – would come into law as planned by the end of 2026.
She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel.
The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.
“Everybody’s dragging their heels.","Aviation and cruise sustainability experts are hopeful of progress within the sectors next year but admit delays and increased emissions are also likely.

Speaking during a panel debate at Travel Weekly’s Sustainability Summit, Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade was confident the Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RSM) – a UK government scheme to support investment in the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – would come into law as planned by the end of 2026.

Progress would rely on “how quickly they can enrol contracts, depending upon the projects that come forward”, he said, but insisted: “There will be more momentum around RCM this time next year, and I think we’ll be much more developed in terms of our thinking and government’s thinking as well as the greenhouse gas removals market.”

Aviation Environment Federation policy manager Celeste Hicks agreed: “We’re not sure whether that means contracts being awarded at the end of next year, but that’s the idea. That will give us an indication of whether we’re going to hit the 2030 SAF targets.”

But she said she also expected to see “delay and increased international aviation emissions” over the next 12 months, and accused the industry as a whole of “dragging its heels” on the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

She added: “I’m not just talking about airlines here, I’m talking about the fuel suppliers, so the oil and gas companies, which are dragging their heels on producing sustainable aviation fuel. The airline manufacturers, so Boeing and Airbus, are also dragging their heels on developing new aircraft.

“Everybody’s dragging their heels. It’s easy for everybody to blame each other, but we don’t see the progress.”

Carnival UK vice-president sustainability and strategy Sophie Portlock was hopeful of progress in 2026 towards an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) deal to reduce carbon emissions globally to reach net zero by 2050, despite talks falling apart earlier this year.

Referring to a one year delay to a vote on adopting a global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing mechanism for international shipping, she said: “It will be interesting to see what happens as a result of the IMO discussions around the net zero framework.”

She stressed the deal had not been “discarded”, adding: “It’s just been delayed by a year. That vote is now due to take place in October next year, and over the coming 12 months, there is work that is going to be done to look at some of these technical challenges and how we overcome some of those within that framework.”

While cruise only makes up 2% of the international shipping industry, ensuring alignment in the move to alternative fuels was “key” to provide confidence and clarity in the market, she stressed.

Carnival Corporation had already seen an 11% reduction in its total greenhouse gasses since a peak in 2011 following investment in energy efficiency measures and new technology, despite a 38% capacity increase over the same period of time, she said.

“That shows how these initiatives and these developments are leading to a reduction in our total carbon footprint,” she said, adding Carnival Corporation had 11 ships operating on liquefied natural gas (LNG), with 18 due to have LNG by 2033, covering around a third of total passenger capacity.

She added more than 70% of the group’s fleet had shore power capability but said the challenge in Europe was the number of available ports.

“There are about 16 ports that have shore power capability that can support cruise ships of our size,” she said, but noted: “We are expecting to see a further seven ports of a shore power capability next year. So it is increasing.”",https://dcxnozgahgy2a.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/384/Tim_Alderslade_sustainability_summit1_Main.webp,N,,2025-12-08 06:56:11.483555

If the vessel experienced more favourable wind conditions, the savings could be higher.
GCMD said the findings matter as the analysis captures the full distribution of observed power savings linked to wind conditions rather than relying on a single aggregated value.
The system also integrates intelligent sensing and automatic control to adjust rotor operation based on real-time wind conditions, maximizing wind propulsion efficiency, while maintaining safety.
“The stage is set for the next phase of the maritime energy transition,” said Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime.","The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) on Friday (5 December) said it implemented a Wind Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS) performance monitoring method with Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping Pte Ltd (EPS) to measure suction sails’ performance on tanker Pacific Sentinel.

GCMD said WAPS are gaining traction as an important decarbonisation lever, but uptake is still far below what is needed to meet regulatory targets.

A major barrier is its inherently variable fuel savings, which depend on operational and environmental factors such as routing and weather conditions. This is compounded by the lack of a standardised method to accurately quantify WAPS performance during real-world operations.

To address this, GCMD and EPS implemented the study and published their joint report titled Quantifying energy savings from wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS): A case study on the Pacific Sentinel.

The Pacific Sentinel sampled predominantly near-headwind conditions during this four-month testing period. Accordingly, the mean instantaneous power savings derived from valid on-off tests during this period was 7.2%, with a 95% confidence interval between 6.2% and 8.2%. If the vessel experienced more favourable wind conditions, the savings could be higher.

Instantaneous savings reached as high as 28.1% when the apparent wind angle was 47° and wind speed was 15.3 m/s. There were instances where near-headwind conditions resulted in negative power savings as low as -14.0%. Both are statistically rare events given the range of wind conditions experienced in this particular testing period, at three standard deviations from the mean of instantaneous power savings derived during this testing period.

Over four months of testing, they observed a range of power savings across different wind conditions:

Mean instantaneous power savings: 7.2% (95% confidence interval of 6.2–8.2%)

We also observed peak savings of up to 28.1% and negative savings of –14.0%, though both were statistically rare.

GCMD said the findings matter as the analysis captures the full distribution of observed power savings linked to wind conditions rather than relying on a single aggregated value.

“This provides a more realistic and confidence-based understanding of suction sail performance on the Pacific Sentinel,” it added.

GCMD added that the pilot shows how much, and under what conditions, WAPS deliver savings. As GCMD runs more pilots, larger datasets will enable modelling and fuel savings predictions across diverse operating conditions.

“With quantified and verifiable savings, a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism becomes viable, linking repayments directly to measured performance,” it added.

“This underpins our recently launched Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET) fund, which decouples retrofit financing from vessel mortgages by offering unsecured leases.”

Classification society DNV on Wednesday (3 December) said it has granted a Type Approval Design Certificate (TADC) to CSSC Shanghai Marine Energy Saving Technology Co., Ltd. (CMES-Tech) for its new 5m × 35m Tilting Type Wind Assisted Rotor System.

This is the first domestically developed rotor sail system in China to achieve this recognition under DNV’s WAPS rules (ST-0511).

With this certification, the classification society said the system is confirmed ready for installation on DNV classed commercial vessels and marks a major milestone for China’s green-shipping technology industry.

As shipping faces mounting pressure from fuel costs and emissions regulations, the demand for reliable and efficient wind-assisted propulsion systems is rising globally. Recent years have seen a growing number of WAPS solutions certified by DNV, including fixed or tiltable rotor, wingsail, and suction sail systems from providers around the world.

The CMES-Tech tiltable rotor system features a retractable and adjustable design, enabling the rotor to adapt to varying draft and clearance conditions, and retract during cargo operations to avoid interference with deck/hatch operations or port infrastructure. The system also integrates intelligent sensing and automatic control to adjust rotor operation based on real-time wind conditions, maximizing wind propulsion efficiency, while maintaining safety.

Dr. Huang Guofu, General Manager of CMES-Tech, said: “Receiving the DNV TADC is a landmark for China’s green-shipping industry and a strong validation of our design’s maturity, structural integrity and operational practicality. It demonstrates that our 5 m × 35 m tilting rotor design meets the highest classification and validates our commitment to driving maritime efficiency. We look forward to working with DNV as we continue to innovate and deliver solutions that can deliver economic and environmental value to shipowners worldwide.”

As part of the TADC process, DNV’s classification experts reviewed all mechanical, structural, and electrical design documentation, and assessed the system’s suitability for shipboard application under realistic operational and environmental conditions. The review confirmed that the design of the CMES-Tech system meets the requirements of DNV’s WAPS technical standard (ST-0511).

Mr. Chen Keng, DNV Vice President and Area Manager China South, said: “With increasing demand for energy-efficient and emission-reduction solutions, WAPS technologies offer immediate, tangible benefits to shipowners.

“The awarding of this TADC to CMES-Tech means we add another option to the growing portfolio of WAPS systems that have been assessed to the industry’s leading rule set, building further confidence in their readiness for real-world use. We congratulate CMES-Tech on this achievement, which underscores our strong collaboration on enabling the broader deployment new energy enhancing technologies.”

The rotor sail prototype has also successfully passed a rigorous 120% overload structural test, demonstrating its robustness under extreme load conditions. Looking ahead, CMES-Tech will proceed with detailed installation planning and sea-trials to validate the in-service performance of the new system.

U-Ming Marine Transport Corporation (U-Ming) and wind propulsion technology provider Anemoi Marine Technologies Ltd. (Anemoi) on Wednesday (1 October) announced the successful completion of the Rotor Sail installation on U-Ming’s Grand Pioneer, a 325,000 DWT Very Large Ore Carrier (VLOC).

U-Ming is the first Taiwanese shipowner to adopt Rotor Sails, marking a major milestone in the company’s decarbonisation strategy.

The four 35m tall, 5m diameter folding (tilting) Rotor Sails were delivered fully assembled and dynamically balanced from Anemoi’s production base on the Yangtze River and transported by barge to COSCO Zhoushan shipyard.

In a streamlined plug-and-play process unique to Anemoi, the sails were lifted directly onto the deck and secured in place. This method significantly reduces the shipyard’s scope of work and keeps installation time short.

For this installation, it took only 1.5 days to lift and fix the Rotor Sails in position onboard, with a further five days for commissioning and testing all four Rotor Sails and folding systems once the shipyard had completed their works during the vessel’s scheduled dry-dock in September 2025.

Anemoi’s specialist team were present throughout the process overseeing the installation and will sail on the vessel’s maiden voyage from Zhoushan to Singapore, with the Rotor Sails deployed and operational. This is to ensure crew training and operational handover will be completed smoothly, equipping U-Ming’s seafarers with the skills and confidence to operate the technology from day one.

Following completion of the installation, Grand Pioneer will resume deep-sea service between Brazil and China under a long-term charter with Brazilian mining company Vale. The vessel is projected to achieve annual marine fuel and emissions reductions of approximately 10–12% on average.

New insights from DNV’s Maritime Forecast to 2050, published on Thursday (11 September) showed that shipping’s energy transition is entering a new phase: One defined by strategic investment, accelerating fleet readiness, and emerging regulatory developments.

With the IMO’s Net-Zero Framework (NZF) approved but pending adoption in October, and the number of alternative-fuel-capable vessels in operation set to almost double by 2028, shipowners are shifting from preparation to action.

By 2030, the alternative-fuelled fleet will be able to burn up to 50 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) of low-greenhouse gas (GHG) fuels annually, double the estimated volume needed to meet the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) 2030 emissions target. Yet today, actual consumption of low-GHG fuels remains at just 1 Mtoe.

This widening gap between capacity and use highlights both the scale of industry commitment and the urgent need for fuel producers and infrastructure developers to accelerate supply to match the fleet’s readiness.

“The stage is set for the next phase of the maritime energy transition,” said Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO of DNV Maritime.

“The IMO’s Net-Zero Framework has imperfections and greater clarity is urgently needed around how the collected money will be spent. It is already influencing investment decisions, operational choices and fuel strategies across the industry. Shipowners will adjust their strategic priorities pending the October IMO meeting, which will lay the foundation for the years and decades ahead.”

The ninth edition of DNV’s Maritime Forecast to 2050 provides a comprehensive analysis of the fuels, technologies, and regulations shaping the future of shipping, assisting decision-makers in navigating the next phase of the energy transition.

The report outlines several solutions that could help bridge the gap between fleet readiness and fuel availability:

Leveraging existing fuel infrastructure for low-GHG fuels, like biodiesel and bio-LNG, combined with the adoption of flexible chains of custody models can significantly ease access to these fuels, incentivizing and accelerating both production and uptake.

Energy-efficiency measures on newbuilds are increasingly deployed, reducing emissions immediately without requiring new infrastructure or supply-chain development.

Onboard carbon capture (OCC) is gaining traction, particularly for large vessels with available onboard space. Modelling from the report shows that equipping 20 major ports with CO2 offloading infrastructure could enable the removal of up to 75 million tonnes of captured CO2 annually, potentially offsetting the need for 25 Mtoe of low-GHG fuels, as much as is needed to reach the IMO’s 2030 base target

2025 could be a breakthrough year for maritime wind energy. Wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS) are gaining broader commercial adoption, with claims of 5-20% reduction in fuel use for certain ships, according to vessel owners, operators and technology makers.

“The industry has made real technical progress in recent years,” said Eirik Ovrum, Lead Author of the report.

“But these solutions are still operating in silos. To deliver impact, they need to be integrated into fleet strategies, supported by infrastructure, and recognized in compliance frameworks. That’s where the next phase of work must focus.”

This year’s Maritime Forecast to 2050 report urges stakeholders to prepare early and evaluate all cost-effective pathways, recognizing that compliance strategies will vary by vessel type, operational profile, and regulatory exposure.

Moller – Maersk (Maersk) on Friday (6 December) said it is continuing to explore options to diversify its low-emission fuel portfolio by testing ethanol in a dual-fuel methanol engine.

Building on a successful initial trial, the company will now blend 50% ethanol with 50% methanol in a test onboard the vessel Laura Maersk.

The first trial, conducted in October and November, involved a 10% ethanol / 90% e-methanol blend and confirmed that ethanol can be safely and effectively integrated into the fuel mix. The test underscores the potential to create greater optionality for Maersk’s dual-fuel methanol fleet, essentially enabling dual fuel alcohol vessels.

Laura Maersk, the world’s first dual-fuel container vessel operating on methanol, was designed for methanol as the alternative fuel. Because ethanol and methanol are both alcohols, they share similar properties. The initial trial tested whether an E10 blend would ignite and burn as efficiently as pure methanol while maintaining comparable lubricity and corrosiveness.

The results confirm that ethanol can be blended with methanol without compromising engine performance, paving the way for higher ethanol blends. Beyond the upcoming E50 test, Maersk plans to conduct a trial using 100% ethanol.

Emma Mazhari, Head of Energy Markets at Maersk, said: “Ethanol has a proven track record with an established market and existing infrastructure and offers an additional pathway for decarbonisation.

“By gradually increasing ethanol content, we gain valuable insights into engine performance and combustion impacts, informing fuel sourcing potential.”

US shipbuilder Conrad Shipyard and South Korean shipbuilder Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) on Thursday (4 November) announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that formalises a collaborative framework to jointly explore opportunities in the rapidly expanding US LNG bunkering market.

Under the M0U, Conrad and SHI will work together to evaluate and pursue technical, commercial, and market-based initiatives that support the design, construction, and deployment of LNG bunkering vessels tailored for U.S. regulatory and operational requirements.

The MoU is intended to combine SHI’s global expertise in advanced LNG technologies with Conrad’s proven LNG shipbuilding capabilities and domestic market access.

A representative of SHI stated, “Through this collaboration, we expect to enter the U.S. LNG bunkering market while also contributing to the revitalisation of the U.S. shipbuilding industry.”

“We are honoured to collaborate with Samsung Heavy Industries,” said Johnny Conrad, Executive Chairman, Conrad Shipyard. “This MoU reflects Conrad’s focus on driving innovation in the U.S. maritime sector and positions both organisations to develop advanced LNG bunkering vessels tailored to meet market demand.”

Conrad’s extensive experience navigating regulatory requirements associated with LNG bunkering vessel design, engineering, and construction combined with SHI’s art LNG technology will greatly enhance the US LNG market.

Classification society DNV’s latest white paper recently highlighted that methanol-fuelled engines and technical systems have reached high readiness levels, and that existing global production sites, storage facilities, and a growing bunker fleet are providing a strong platform for wider adoption.

In addition, industry stakeholders are already investing in the fuel, with China accounting for 43 percent of planned global low-GHG methanol production capacity. But, as with all alternative fuels, methanol’s future role will depend on a combination of regulatory, economic, and operational factors.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV, said: “As the maritime industry explores pathways to a lower-carbon future, it is important to consider a range of practical and scalable solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and different shipping segments and geographies will require different approaches.

“Methanol is one option that draws on established technologies and infrastructure, and it is encouraging to see the industry’s growing interest in a variety of alternative fuels.”

Methanol can offer environmental benefits. It is sulfur-free, produces negligible soot, and emits significantly less NOx than fuel oil. The report highlights that certain bio- and e-methanol pathways can deliver very low or even negative lifecycle emissions, and that methanol’s compatibility with existing port infrastructure and the availability of interim bunkering solutions may also reduce complexity and cost for shipowners.

However, the report notes that cost and availability remain significant barriers, as is the case for many alternative fuels. Bio-methanol prices in 2025 average around USD 2,500 per tonne MGOe, roughly three times the cost of marine gas oil, while global production stands at just 2.2 million tonnes, far below the potential demand of up to 60 million tonnes by 2040. The report models four demand scenarios, showing that regulatory frameworks such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework and FuelEU Maritime could be decisive in scaling up adoption.

Marius Leisner, Senior Principal Consultant in DNV, added: “From a technical perspective, methanol-fuelled engines have demonstrated high reliability, with industry data indicating that modern dual-fuel engine designs have accumulated more than 600,000 operating hours on methanol. Retrofit feasibility is well established, and the use of conventional bunkering systems, unlike cryogenic fuels, means ports can adapt quickly and cost-effectively.

DNV added methanol also provides fuel flexibility: dual-fuel engines can operate on methanol, biodiesel, or conventional fuels, and, with minor modifications, on ethanol.

It can flexibly utilise green methanol or traditional fuel, significantly reducing carbon emissions and pollutant emissions during operation.","Classification society DNV’s latest white paper recently highlighted that methanol-fuelled engines and technical systems have reached high readiness levels, and that existing global production sites, storage facilities, and a growing bunker fleet are providing a strong platform for wider adoption.

In addition, industry stakeholders are already investing in the fuel, with China accounting for 43 percent of planned global low-GHG methanol production capacity. But, as with all alternative fuels, methanol’s future role will depend on a combination of regulatory, economic, and operational factors.

Knut Ørbeck-Nilssen, CEO Maritime at DNV, said: “As the maritime industry explores pathways to a lower-carbon future, it is important to consider a range of practical and scalable solutions. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and different shipping segments and geographies will require different approaches.

“Methanol is one option that draws on established technologies and infrastructure, and it is encouraging to see the industry’s growing interest in a variety of alternative fuels.”

Methanol can offer environmental benefits. It is sulfur-free, produces negligible soot, and emits significantly less NOx than fuel oil. The report highlights that certain bio- and e-methanol pathways can deliver very low or even negative lifecycle emissions, and that methanol’s compatibility with existing port infrastructure and the availability of interim bunkering solutions may also reduce complexity and cost for shipowners.

However, the report notes that cost and availability remain significant barriers, as is the case for many alternative fuels. Bio-methanol prices in 2025 average around USD 2,500 per tonne MGOe, roughly three times the cost of marine gas oil, while global production stands at just 2.2 million tonnes, far below the potential demand of up to 60 million tonnes by 2040. The report models four demand scenarios, showing that regulatory frameworks such as the IMO’s Net Zero Framework and FuelEU Maritime could be decisive in scaling up adoption.

Marius Leisner, Senior Principal Consultant in DNV, added: “From a technical perspective, methanol-fuelled engines have demonstrated high reliability, with industry data indicating that modern dual-fuel engine designs have accumulated more than 600,000 operating hours on methanol. Retrofit feasibility is well established, and the use of conventional bunkering systems, unlike cryogenic fuels, means ports can adapt quickly and cost-effectively.

DNV added methanol also provides fuel flexibility: dual-fuel engines can operate on methanol, biodiesel, or conventional fuels, and, with minor modifications, on ethanol.

A.P. Moller – Maersk (Maersk) on Friday (6 December) said it is continuing to explore options to diversify its low-emission fuel portfolio by testing ethanol in a dual-fuel methanol engine.

Building on a successful initial trial, the company will now blend 50% ethanol with 50% methanol in a test onboard the vessel Laura Maersk.

The first trial, conducted in October and November, involved a 10% ethanol / 90% e-methanol blend and confirmed that ethanol can be safely and effectively integrated into the fuel mix. The test underscores the potential to create greater optionality for Maersk’s dual-fuel methanol fleet, essentially enabling dual fuel alcohol vessels.

Laura Maersk, the world’s first dual-fuel container vessel operating on methanol, was designed for methanol as the alternative fuel. Because ethanol and methanol are both alcohols, they share similar properties. The initial trial tested whether an E10 blend would ignite and burn as efficiently as pure methanol while maintaining comparable lubricity and corrosiveness.

The results confirm that ethanol can be blended with methanol without compromising engine performance, paving the way for higher ethanol blends. Beyond the upcoming E50 test, Maersk plans to conduct a trial using 100% ethanol.

Emma Mazhari, Head of Energy Markets at Maersk, said: “Ethanol has a proven track record with an established market and existing infrastructure and offers an additional pathway for decarbonisation.

“By gradually increasing ethanol content, we gain valuable insights into engine performance and combustion impacts, informing fuel sourcing potential.”

Vietnamese shipowner Asia Pacific Shipping (ASP) on Tuesday (2 December) said it has taken delivery of Vietnam’s first methanol dual-fuel MR2 oil/chemical tanker, ASP Rainbow, at Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI), a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC).

The milestone was celebrated with the official delivery of 49,500-dwt ASP Rainbow and the joint naming ceremony for the tanker and its sister vessel, ASP Sunshine, on 20 November.

“The two vessels, named ASP Rainbow and ASP Sunshine, are not only the first in a series of new builds ordered by ASP but are also the first commercial vessels in Vietnam to utilise dual-fuel technology,” the company said.

“Putting these new tankers into operation, which are capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol, enables ASP to become the pioneer in Vietnam to own a fleet capable of using clean fuel.

“This technology not only offers maximum operational flexibility but also makes the vessels significantly friendlier to the environment.”

ASP added the move holds important strategic significance, particularly in the context of increasingly tightening international maritime environmental regulations, which have a direct impact on the adoption of methanol as an alternative fuel.

“Investing in methanol dual-fuel technology helps ASP overcome future environmental challenges while maintaining a competitive advantage in global business operations,” ASP added.

This is the first delivery in the company’s plan to build a series of methanol-powered MR2 vessels that ASP signed with GSI in 2024.

The research, published in Environmental Science: Atmospheres, used aircraft and ground-based instruments to measure sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emitted by ships in the North-East Atlantic and European coastal waters between 2019 and 2023.

The team found that the average sulphur content in ship fuel dropped nearly tenfold in open ocean areas following the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 regulation, which capped sulphur content in marine fuel at 0.5%.

Before the change, many ships exceeded the previous 3.5% limit. After 2020, only a small number of ships were found to breach the new standard.

In European sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs), such as the English Channel and the Port of Tyne, sulphur levels were even lower – well below the stricter 0.1% limit. Interestingly, ports outside these zones, like Valencia in Spain, also showed low sulphur levels, likely due to EU rules requiring cleaner fuel when ships are docked for extended periods.

This is the first study to use aircraft-based measurements and predictions from the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM3) to assess ship emissions outside of sulphur control zones since the 2020 regulation came into effect. The findings support the widely held view that ships now emit around seven times less sulphur than before the rule change – an important step toward cleaner air and healthier coastal environments.

The Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation (GCMD) on Friday (5 December) said it implemented a Wind Assisted Propulsion Systems (WAPS) performance monitoring method with Singapore-based Eastern Pacific Shipping Pte Ltd (EPS) to measure suction sails’ performance on tanker Pacific Sentinel.

GCMD said WAPS are gaining traction as an important decarbonisation lever, but uptake is still far below what is needed to meet regulatory targets.

A major barrier is its inherently variable fuel savings, which depend on operational and environmental factors such as routing and weather conditions. This is compounded by the lack of a standardised method to accurately quantify WAPS performance during real-world operations.

To address this, GCMD and EPS implemented the study and published their joint report titled Quantifying energy savings from wind-assisted propulsion systems (WAPS): A case study on the Pacific Sentinel.

The Pacific Sentinel sampled predominantly near-headwind conditions during this four-month testing period. Accordingly, the mean instantaneous power savings derived from valid on-off tests during this period was 7.2%, with a 95% confidence interval between 6.2% and 8.2%. If the vessel experienced more favourable wind conditions, the savings could be higher.

Instantaneous savings reached as high as 28.1% when the apparent wind angle was 47° and wind speed was 15.3 m/s. There were instances where near-headwind conditions resulted in negative power savings as low as -14.0%. Both are statistically rare events given the range of wind conditions experienced in this particular testing period, at three standard deviations from the mean of instantaneous power savings derived during this testing period.

Over four months of testing, they observed a range of power savings across different wind conditions:

Mean instantaneous power savings: 7.2% (95% confidence interval of 6.2–8.2%)

We also observed peak savings of up to 28.1% and negative savings of –14.0%, though both were statistically rare.

GCMD said the findings matter as the analysis captures the full distribution of observed power savings linked to wind conditions rather than relying on a single aggregated value.

“This provides a more realistic and confidence-based understanding of suction sail performance on the Pacific Sentinel,” it added.

GCMD added that the pilot shows how much, and under what conditions, WAPS deliver savings. As GCMD runs more pilots, larger datasets will enable modelling and fuel savings predictions across diverse operating conditions.

“With quantified and verifiable savings, a pay-as-you-save repayment mechanism becomes viable, linking repayments directly to measured performance,” it added.

“This underpins our recently launched Fund for Energy Efficiency Technologies (FEET) fund, which decouples retrofit financing from vessel mortgages by offering unsecured leases.”

Mr Catani acknowledged constraints on the wider uptake of bioLNG and said GNV is working to make the use of bioLNG a structural solution for its operations, but current fuel availability remains limited and requires “significant investments, as well as the development of a supply chain capable of ensuring stable, large-scale provision”.

He added costs are still high, the quantity available on the market does not yet meet growing demand and it is “a complex journey that requires the commitment and collaboration of all stakeholders in the sector”.

The six-hour bunkering operation was conducted in line with current safety regulations and international guidelines, with 500 m3 of bioLNG transferred to GNV Virgo, which the companies said is enough to fuel the vessel’s return voyage to Palermo.

Van Oord has completed the transport and installation of all 21 monopiles at Iberdrola’s Windanker offshore wind farm, a key milestone in the construction of the project. This achievement involved the largest monopiles Van Oord has ever installed, made possible by earlier upgrades to its heavy lift installation vessel Svanen, which is now equipped to manage next-generation offshore wind monopile foundations.

Van Oord’s scope of work included loading the monopiles at the fabrication site in Spain and transporting them to the Port of Rønne, Denmark. Manufactured by a joint venture between Navantia and Windar, the monopiles rank among the largest ever installed by Van Oord, with a diameter of 10 metres, lengths of 70.6 to 86.6 metres, and weights of up to 2,145 tonnes. From the port, they were lifted using MTC cranes and towed by two tugs to the installation vessel Svanen.

Protecting marine life through noise mitigation

Van Oord used specialised techniques to protect marine life from harmful noise levels during monopile installation. Bubble screens created a curtain of air bubbles around the work area to absorb and reduce sound waves, while a Hydro Sound Damper net provided extra noise reduction.

Sustainable measures for offshore installation

In line with Van Oord’s ambition to achieve net-zero emissions, renewable fuel was used to power the compressors for the bubble screens, cutting greenhouse gas emissions for this activity by up to 86%. This sustainability initiative was made possible through a joint effort with Iberdrola, Van Oord and Hydrotechnik Offshore (HTO), who shared the costs of using renewable fuel.

Building on this effort, in partnership with Skyports Drone Services, long-range drone technology was deployed as part of an innovative pilot project. The goal was to transport items from the shore to the offshore installation site, reducing reliance on supply vessels and the project’s environmental footprint. Van Oord is now the first marine contractor to perform Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) drone flights to vessels in a wind farm under construction.

‘Completing the transport and installation of all monopiles at the Windanker offshore wind farm marks an important milestone for the project. This achievement reflects the dedication and expertise of our teams, the excellent collaboration with our client Iberdrola, and the outstanding performance of the Svanen. We are proud to have installed our largest and heaviest monopile to date, which demonstrates our commitment to enhancing the energy transition and delivering sustainable solutions for the future.’

Joost van Wiechen, Project Manager at Van Oord

Adding 315 MW to Iberdrola’s Baltic Hub

Located in the German Baltic Sea, around 45 kilometres northeast of the island of Rügen, Windanker will add 315 megawatts of capacity to Iberdrola’s Baltic Hub, supplying enough renewable energy to power approximately 315,000 households.

Upcoming phases: transition pieces and inter-array cables

Van Oord’s remaining scope will be delivered in two phases. The first involves transporting and installing 21 transition pieces, scheduled for completion by December 2025. This will be followed in the first quarter of 2026 by the installation of the inter-array cables, part of Van Oord’s EPCI scope, which involves interconnecting the turbines and offshore substation and supporting energy transmission throughout the wind farm.

Blue Energy serves as the Norway office of bunker supplier Global Energy Supply, and operates as a dedicated unit focused on delivering environmental and regulatory-driven energy solutions for their partners.

Uncertainty over the proliferation of GHG emissions regulations for shipping is driving demand for its services, Trine Braathen, the company's director of environmental trading, said in an interview with Ship & Bunker.

Braathen noted the information she provided is intended for industry insights only and should not be considered as specific guidance for purchasing or selling allowances. Specific cases may differ and should be evaluated individually, and Blue Energy assumes no responsibility for any decisions made based on this information.

""What we're seeing, and have seen for a few years, is that the regulatory landscape is changing on both mandatory and voluntary developments,"" Braathen said.

""There are lots of things happening at the EU level, national levels and also, of course, the IMO level concerning the shipping segment.

""There's no doubt that the green initiatives and the green regulatory changes are in super-focus in the industry at the moment, because of course this represents something new; it represents complexity, and it represents something most of the shipping companies are not really fully aware of or understand fully, and it's definitely not their core competence.

""Our role, and why we see it as a business opportunity, is precisely because of this uncertainty.

""It's where we can use our expertise and knowledge, and share that with our customers and stakeholders.""

GHG Services

The EUA market is Blue Energy's primary focus for shipping at present.

But the company is also preparing to offer biofuels, both B100 and blended products.

Compliance with the FuelEU Maritime regulation may also become part of its business in time, Braathen said.

""Of course, FuelEU Maritime is definitely something that we will investigate quite a bit in December to see what our role is in the market, where can we actually provide our expertise and guidance,"" she said.

""As a company, we will focus on being a supplier, so we would not necessarily go on the emission side into reporting, for example, or verification.""

The firm is also starting to see interest from shipping companies in UK Allowance procurement for compliance with the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Domestic shipping will be added to the UK ETS next year, and international shipping from 2028.

EUA Procurement Strategy

The firm has seen a variety of approaches to EUA procurement for EU-ETS compliance in its work with shipping companies.

""What we're seeing at the moment is lots of different types of procurement strategies,"" Braathen said.

""The most common one is just to buy per voyage; I think at least for the mid-size and bigger fleets, that's definitely the norm.

""But for the smaller companies, it's quite interesting, they don't have the liquidity or the budget and so forth, and they are just bundling the volume and buying it as late as possible.""

A more complex approach may bear dividends, for those willing to become more deeply involved in these markets.

""There's room for improvement for these types of strategies, but it all depends on risk preference and risk exposure,"" Braathen said.

""It depends on, would you allow to only buy these allowances, or would you allow to also sell them.

""And if you buy them, bundling some volume ... and suddenly the market price dropped by 15%, in your governance and policy are you then stuck with that position, or are you allowing it to be sold back to the market and then buy it back at a lower price?

""And of course, it comes down to liquidity in the company.

""Do they actually have the liquidity to hedge for future years and so forth? It depends a bit on which type of company, but we definitely see discussions which are much more advanced than a year ago.""

EUA Savings

Braathen points to volatility in the EUA price this year as evidence of the potential savings to be made by altering strategy.

""Let's look at an example I gave to a customer about this a few days ago, where we just looked at prices during the autumn of this year,"" she said.

""Imagine if you were buying volume on, let's say, August 1, at EUR 71/mtCO2e.

""Let's say, to simplify it, you had a volume of 100,000 mtCO2e that you needed to buy, and then at 71 you buy all the volume because you believe that's a good price.

""Then you have another company waiting and waiting, and they decide to buy volume on November 1 instead, and they buy at EUR 82/mtCO2e.

""They have the same volume, but it's a substantial difference in this price just within those three months.""

The EUA price has averaged around EUR 73.41/mtCO2e so far this year, with a low of EUR 60/mtCO2e in April and a high of EUR 83/mtCO2e in November, according to Ship & Bunker data.

""I think a lot of companies don't necessarily understand the implications of this, because of course if you don't include that into your contract ... if you are a bit delaying the purchase or not having a proper strategy around it, then having these types of changes in prices could have a significant impact on the compliance cost and how it's spread out to your stakeholders and customers,"" Braathen said.

""You have what becomes a competitive advantage if you manage to time the purchase correctly, and what could be a significant disadvantage compared to your competitors if you buy at a terrible price level.""

IMO Delay

Another area Blue Energy might be interested in engaging with would be the IMO's Net-Zero Framework, which if adopted would include an element of buying and selling GHG compliance units to meet its thresholds.

The UN body's Marine Environment Protection Committee decided in October to put off a vote on the framework by a year.

Braathen questions whether consensus can be reached to pass the deal in its current format within that timeframe, but remains optimistic over the long-term prospects for global GHG regulation for shipping.

""At the moment, with all the lobbying from the US side, it is challenging to see how they will manage to change that sentiment within the year,"" she said.

""But the IMO have the opportunity now to maybe simplify it a bit and look at what they could actually control, It's not necessarily all about the financial aspects of this carbon framework.

""But of course, I am quite positive.

""I believe that at some point there will be a global carbon market for shipping; whether it's next year, or if it will take more time, let's see.

""What most of the member states want, of course, everyone wants; a fair, simplified system which makes sense.

""To get to that framework and find a compromise which everyone can live with, that's the challenging part, but from a regulatory perspective it makes so much sense to have a global system.""",https://shipandbunker.cdn.speedyrails.net/a/img/_mt_78b80c7c50864c9f516ee7b292bcaad1.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 20:56:45.661214
